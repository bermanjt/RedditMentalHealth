0,"hi everyone. i'm really looking for advice as i'm very worried on what to do.

basically, i was on social media when i saw a post that concerned me. a boy has posted about how suicidal he felt and had talked about how he had been researching ways to commit suicide. he said he was 16 and he lives in a different country. i'm the same age and i commented on his post, leaving him a list of international suicide hotlines and advising him to reach out. he asked if i could message him and i did.

i feel incredibly worried. i check up on him about once every day, sometimes twice. nothing seems to be getting better, no matter how much i say to him. i've talked to him about reaching out to people he knows, but he has a terrible relationship with all his family, and he says his friends would stay away from him if they knew. he has a therapist, and he see him three times a week, but he feels his therapist doesn't understand him. 

he told me i know more about him than anyone. i feel a sense of extreme responsibility. i'm not qualified to help him as much as i want to, and i don't even live in the same country as him. 

it seems like he ignores a lot of what i say. he talks over and over about how terrible he feels. of course this is understandable, i'm not mad or annoyed with him about it, but it's really difficult. i feel terrible for him. he truly believes there is no hope for him. he says things like ""wish me a happy death day"" and even asked me if i knew a way he could die at a waterpark he's going to as he's currently on holiday. i shut him down and told him i wouldn't ever give him advice on suicide methods. 

i try to tell him it'll be okay. i say there are good things ahead of him and it gets better. i've said this is only a short period in his life and i always tell him to stay safe and take care whenever i leave. i truly want the best for him.

i have no idea what to do. i want for him to be okay and to fully recover and be happy. if he even said truthfully that he was struggling with mental illness but no longer suicidal i'd be so happy. 

and it's also just.. really difficult. i don't at all want to make it all about me. it just makes me worry -- like, i can think ""oh god, i haven't texted him all day, is he okay?"" i worry about what would happen in the worst case scenario. would i be to blame? would they look through his phone and find our conversations? i struggle with my own mental health. i go to a counsellor now and i'm suspected of having OCD, as well as suicidal thoughts. 

i'm trying really hard to help him but i feel so useless and i have no idea what to do. i want him to be okay so strongly. i've tried steer him towards help and offer resources. and what'll happen when i go back to school? i don't know how much longer i'll spend day in and day out, pleading with him not to commit suicide or harm himself. it's terrifying. i feel like i have sole responsibility for his life, and i can't just cut him off. i want him to recover and i would never want to abandon him, but it's just so difficult. i don't know how to help him.

does anyone have any advice? i have no idea what to do.",30Jul2019,1
1,"My wife and I do ok in our marketing careers but honestly we are just fed up with the rat race. It's not worth it to us anymore.  We have a new child (our first), and want to downsize our life, our house, lots of stuff, to spend more time with him and each other. We want to start over, move to a new place and not be on the precipice of heart and panic attacks constantly. Our jobs being marketing are somewhat transferrable, which would help. But its more than just career advice it is life advice so I came here.

I'm heartbroken, all we talked about was our dogs (I have two of my own) and I'm not sure how best to comfort them, a friend of mine is an artist and he does amazing work, I was thinking of commissioning him to make some artwork of her dogs (she has another that's still alive) and my dogs all together in a happy sort cartoony like style, is that a good idea?

4,"This is a strange post for me to make because I’m in a unique position I’ve never been in and I’m unsure how to move forward. I recently moved in to my first apartment with my Longterm girlfriend. We’ve been here close to 4 months, and we really like it here. The rent is super low, and includes amenities we love to utilize, one of which is a pool. Now along with the pool, comes frequent encounters with a strange neighbor. Now, I’m not a standoffish person, and I’m extremely friendly and outgoing typical, so for a person to instantly give me bad vibes is unusual. This guy well call George. George seems pretty mild mannered, and will go out of his way to loudly say hello to everyone he knows the name of at the pool, and ask how they’re doing. This often happens when you’re mid conversation with someone else or are lounging alone with headphones in. If you don’t answer he just stares at you until you say hello. After some mild small talk, he often turns away and talks to himself as he walks away. He walks the perimeter of the pool staring in to the pool having conversations with himself, often in many different voices. When he’s in the pool he walks around in circles talking to himself very erratically. I’ve noticed when there are a lot of children in the pool, he gets his snorkel and mask and spends a lot of time lurking in the area of kids. On multiple occasions he’s accidentally bumped in to kids who were well out of his way. People seem to tolerate him but everyone seems mildly uneasy about him. Just now as I’m writing this he walked by and stared at me until I looked up to acknowledge him.

My main concern is, I always see him alone. He seems fairy known in the community of apartments at large, but again is always alone. His behavior concerns me for the reasons listed above, and frankly I think he may suffer from a mental illness or instability. If he is alone I’m concerned with his outward symptoms he may be totally off meds, or not taking his prescribed amount...or worse he’s totally alone and has no knowledge of his mental illness. 

Is there a PC way to approach another member of the community as a way to understand the situation better, or should I just let it go and mind my own business. 

I come to you mighty reddit for you have a diverse amount of human knowledge that I simply could not possess alone. Please help me become a better person.",30Jul2019,1
5,Ok so basically I had a long streak of positive thinking and habits. I was working out everyday and doing things I enjoy. I even meditated every once and a while.  I’m doing so I also uninstalled all of my games on Xbox and pc and uninstalled Instagram cause I felt it was only in the moment “happiness” but my friends convinced me to just install one game to play one game but of course now I have all of my games back horrible sleep schedule don’t work out and don’t have my license. Basically now I’m have happiness tied to when I get a car or something like that which I don’t feel is to healthy but now it’s harder than ever to get out of this routine and if I delete all my games it will be harder than ever because I’m on a team for overwatch so I dunno.,30Jul2019,1
6,My ex boyfriends dad passed away recently and his funeral is next week. I was close to his dad and would really love to go to show my support but I don’t want to upset him in any way.

7," 

So basically, my friends and I were being really stupid and I logged into this kid from my school's Google Account from my house and we went on these slides they made at the beginning of last year in class.

We spammed some edgy(ish) memes on the class slides and some of these memes could be considered offensive to certain groups of people all in good fun, but at the time of that night we didn't think much of it (since they were old slides and the teacher probably wouldn't have cared to see them).

Well the next morning we woke up and one of my friends who had been in the kid's class had gotten a message from the class forums that my school uses. It said that he saw the vulgar and insensitive things that we spammed on the slides and that he would get the people who did it to talk to the counselor once school starts up again.

My friends and I didn't think much of it until we realized that the kid whose account we logged into is going to get called up most likely, Obviously he's going to claim that it wasn't him and I'm pretty sure that he would want to prove it wasn't him.

So my friends and I started brainstorming ways that he could argue it wasn't him. We discovered that when you login from a new device on the school Google Accounts, it shows the IP Address of the device it came from. Using multiple IP trackers online, we found that our houses couldn't be traced, but the general city/region we are from is shown.

This would be okay, but would something like this be traced by the school? Would it be disregarded, and I'm just scared for no reason? Or how should we handle the situation?",30Jul2019,1
8,"This is a long story, so I hope you're ready for a read. 

My Ex boyfriend is a Narcissist who paints himself as the good guy, but after treating me like a pet for 4 years (emotional, mental, financial abuse), where nothing I needed was taken care of (i.e medical care \[I have a non cancerous? tumour on my neck, that pushes into my spine, was removed once, and now needs to be removed again which causes excruciating pain\], emotional support, goal support, getting a job support \[I can't drive so I needed him to help me get a job, no bus routes in the area\],  I had no access to finances, and there were times I couldn't even get food because he wouldn't grocery shop if I asked him, he'd just ignore me) we broke up.  It was a mess.  TLDR: I was a pet, who never left the house because I couldn't, who's owner worked long hours.

Because I can't drive, and I have essentially been alone for 4 years with nothing but the internet to keep me company, I don't feel like a person anymore.  

I have no job, get crippling anxiety every-time I try to drive (I do have a car).  I am currently still living with my ex who I am afraid of but I have no where else to go so I stay because at least it is a roof even if it is a  fearful roof.  

I have a TESOL Certificate and am trying to get a job teaching english to students overseas but this is a long process and can take awhile to go through.

Add to this my ex is kicking me out at the end of August.  I don't know what to do, I am on a timeline, extremely limited funding, with no support system.  I don't know what Services to access, (I live in Michigan).  I can barely drive, my family is basically in a Cult in Kentucky and basically brainwashed me as a child, so going back to them is a non-option, and I don't have health insurance in Kentucky anyway. 

My self esteem is shit, my confidence is shit, and I am really close to giving up because I feel like I'm not capable of dealing with all of this at once on such a short time line

Any advice would be really highly appreciated.

Thank you",30Jul2019,1

10,"I have no drive anymore. I don't want a job and I don't want to study. I left high school last year and somehow wound up with good scores and immediately I was pressured into going to a top university. I never liked school, I didn't want to study again, but I didn't have a job either and my parents gave me the ultimatum to study or get a job.

The truth is I don't want any of these things. I would rather die or be alone. I've been browsing r/depression to see if this is common but I found nothing pertaining to me in anyway. I think I've reached a level of despair and misanthropy that I don't know if it could be classified as depression anymore. I've had depression for about 7 years now (I'm 19) and I told my parents last year hoping it would get better. It has gotten worse. They refused me medication, instead vouching for naturopathic remedies that at most have stagnated my condition. We had an appointment a few months ago where the naturopathic doctor described my condition as despair, which according to him is worse than anxiety and depression. 

I'm thinking of taking medication without telling my parents. I'm old enough for Medicare so the costs would be covered. I'm so far gone I don't know if meds would help me. I think my problems are so congruent with my environment I don't know if meds would help me. I have no drive for a future. I've even lost my sex drive. I haven't gotten a full erection in 3 days. I feel like I've been poisoned.  

I'm posting here because I don't think r/depression helps me anymore. Essentially I want to know if anyone has ever felt similarly and if there's a way out for me because despite how strongly I feel in my misanthropy and lack of desire a small part of me wants to have drive again.",30Jul2019,2

12,"Hey everyone, i just want to add a trigger warning of talk of an eating disorder before you continue to read.

I am currently a little over 6 months pregnant and am having pretty severe body confidence issues. I have suffered with an eating disorder in the past but thought I had gotten over it. Ever since I started to show, I have become so self conscious, I constantly feel like people are staring at me.

13,"9 years ago I was misdiagnosed by a shitty doctor. 4 months ago I got a life changing diagnosis which has turned my life around. But to get there, I had to develop symptoms/compilations which were very clearly obviously not normal or related to my bad diagnosis.

I felt mistreated by doctors before and by time of my diagnosis I decided that I’m not gonna let it happen again. I am the only defender of my own health.  I’m also super fucking pissed off &amp; have a hard time believing any doctor any time they say anything.

After beginning treatment earlier this year (just a special diet was all it took) all my symptoms went away, including some that seemed unrelated like pain and swelling in my joints. I thought I was cured and was so excited. I started doing research on random things that could have affected/caused/impacted it and planned to get started finding ways to prevent myself from getting sick again.

Well that went to shit. My GP started treating me like a hypochondriac when I went in to ask about an inhaler and allergy testing and a rash. (Id been working up the courage to ask for an inhaler for years).

A week and a half ago my joint pain and swelling came back with a vengeance. I’ve been fucking miserable and kind of just want to die. Part of its cause the pain is way worse than I ever remember it being and is even affecting my ability to use my hands (type on my phone/keyboard and use the mouse at work). I wanted to crawl to bed last night, but couldn’t cause my knees hurt too bad. And part of its cause I’ve lost hope. 

I was better and now I’m not.

I had a doctors appointment this morning. And I said all the wrong things. Half just angry at everyone for the lack of legitimate care I’ve received and half feeling like shit and unable to clearly describe the problem and why I’m there. 

I’ve tried going in with a list of stuff, so I stay on topic and don’t go off the rails, but that tends to get them to think that I’m a hypochondriac. I try to do research and bring it in and be like this is what I think and why, and I’ve tried to pretend that I haven’t done any research.

In the end it all turns out the same, I feel like I’m not being heard, get angry and sometimes completely just forget to tell them my symptoms.  (Then it’s like no shit they think I’m making it up).

Even today, my doc for a moment seemed like she would help. She recommended a shot for pain. But then she immediately took it back. Maybe it’s cause I looked excited (yay! There’s HOPE) and it was misinterpreted as drug seeking? Or she just accidentally said it out loud and other people are allowed to receive help, but I’m not.

I have two upcoming appointments and both are important one is to get that asthma test (which I don’t understand how I ended up needing a test, I had an inhaler when I was a kid) and the other is to hopefully figure out why I have joint pain. How can I go to these appointments and do things the right way, so they they’re helpful and not a waste of time and I don’t leave feeling like I’m not being heard?

TLDR: I’m terrified of doctors mistreating me and tend to make things worse during my appointments (sometimes forgetting to tell them my symptoms). How can I get things together and get my point across so that I can get real help?",30Jul2019,1

16,"so i probably have insomnia, or at least a really bad case of being unable to sleep despite being tired, waking up frequently during the night, waking up early, and constantly feeling exhausted. this was never really an issue before - i used to stay on my laptop until i went to bed and fall asleep fine. i’ve tried cutting my use of electronics before bed, reading thirty minutes before bed, drinking herbal tea, listening to podcasts or rain sounds when i’m trying to sleep, a hot water bottle, getting up every twenty minutes when i can’t sleep etc etc.

whenever i’m somewhere else (for instance, my boyfriends house), although i still wake up frequently, it’s a lot easier for me to sleep. i thought maybe it had something to do with the comfort of my bed, so i switched out some pillows for new ones but i still can’t sleep.

i’m a full time student so this is getting really exhausting, not to mention i used to get at least eight hours of sleep whereas now i get one-four if i’m lucky. the sleeping pills they put me on weren’t very effective, nor were the antihistamines they put me on to try making me drowsy (they worked for about a month before i grew tolerant to them). my therapist is reluctant to prescribe me anything else since i’m so young and she doesn’t want me becoming dependant on anything. but so far the only thing that’s kind of worked has been weed, which i don’t want to continue.

i literally will be exhausted and be in bed for hours unable to sleep. whenever i get up, i’ll feel tired within a few minutes and go back to bed, but then i can’t get to sleep. does anybody have any suggestions or tips on how i can improve my chances of sleeping? or any strategies i can try when i can’t sleep? thank you!",30Jul2019,1

18,"Hello I am currently facing a dilemma
To give a bit of background I am currently in a summer program. In this program we had a show where we had some coworkers show of some of their talents. One of my coworkers pulled me aside and asked me if I was willing to do a performance with her with my guitar( she would sing and I would play the guitar and sing a bit  ). We practiced for a couple days and the song came out to be really good. I felt a bit of a connection whenever we sang. For some reason I always looked forward to playing with her. Whenever we’d sing together and we’d get the same pitch, it felt nice. We did this for about a week or so and when it came to the actual performing, she was just too nervous and we didn’t end up performing. I don’t really care about that part but I really liked what we had and it just felt good. A couple days later we were on the piano and we just started singing together out of no where. Then yesterday we were together in a room and she just randomly asked if I wanted to play cards with her and I said yes. This is all coming from a girl who wouldn’t even say hi or look in my direction when the program started. Honestly I’m kind of feeling her but I don’t know if she feels the same or if she thinks it’s just a friendship. We have a group chat on an app and I tried direct messaging her but she doesn’t have the app but it gives me the option to send her an invite to download the app. Tomorrow is the last day of the program. Should I send the invite today or tomorrow ? Or should I even send an invite in the first place ? Am I overthinking things ? Am I just assuming too much ?",30Jul2019,1

Right after he did my mom went back to school and then started her first jobs nursing working 70+ hours just to keep shit afloat. Ever since then, she has been so different than what I remember her being when I was younger. She is VERY quick to make assumptions and argue. She is EXTREMELY depressed all the time and is very self centered, though I dont believe this to be her fault. I say this because she is depressed and she never ever talks to me about my plans and future willingly (even though I am riddled with anxiety). Unless I bring it up, my well-being and college plans are never brought up and I am alone, not just in planning my future but emotionally too. I spend so much time talking to her even though she should be better by now. She stopped working anymore than 40 hours a week about a year ago and she is still being this way. Just to put into perspective, both my older sibs have broken down about hwo they cant handle her with all of her emotions. I dont know what to do most of the time. She always tells me that she wants to kill herself and that she failed me as a mother. I snapped tonight when she was badgering me on what I was gonna do when she got sick.

21,"Summary of accident:

The semi and I were on a one way street with two lanes, I was in the left lane and he was in the right lane. We were both waiting for the cross walk to clear so we could turn left. I waited for him to move and he didn't so I started my turn and then he began turning left after I was turning. I stopped and honked but he kept turning and ran into the side of my car.

I called the police but I think the officer who responded to the accident did a poor job for several reasons: I had a passenger and he never asked for a statement from her, he got the semi driver's statement without me being present and then let him leave. The only thing the officer asked me was if the semi's turning signal was on. The officer then gave me a sheet with a narrative that stated I was trying to go straight through the intersection which is false and I don't understand where he came up with that. The officer then told me the semi was not at fault and he was not giving the semi driver a citation, then I asked the officer to correct the narrative which he did then left. Later I called the police station and spoke to the officer's supervisor who stated the semi was at fault for the accident because I had the right of way, he failed to yield to me, and he didn't check to see if there were any cars in the left lane.

So... the at fault driver's insurance company claims the semi was straddling the left lane and so I am partially responsible for the accident but it was not possible for the semi to be straddling the left lane because that is where my car was! I have called some lawyers asking for help but since there were no injuries most lawyers are not interested. I think the semi driver gave a false statement to the police and to his insurance company to cover himself.

I was under the assumption that my dad was able to afford my college education, but turns out he had been applying for the loans each year and he didn't realize that all the money had to be paid back. How? I don't know, but we as a family aren't financially literate anyway. Anyway, my loans along with the interest rates over the time period I am to be paying them back amount to nearly $80k. There's another loan that was taken out by a second company that probably totals $23k if I am guessing correctly. Now the payments are delinquent and I am really just unclear about all of this. Had I known we wouldn't have been able to afford it outright, I wouldn't have even gone to college. I guess my credit is going to be screwed up eventually too.

 I hope you understand my frustration. I am so far in debt I doubt my debts ever be paid off, whether it's now or in 60 years. If I died though, I wouldn't want my dad (or my brother, since he cosigned one of the loans) to be saddled with my debts.

24,"I'm a 22 year old male, that moved to Canada 3 years ago from Germany.
After a ton of paperwork, stress and anxiety I finally became a Canadian permanent resident 4 weeks ago.

After I moved here 3 years ago, I started working construction. Mainly in labour and a supervisor position.
Once I became a PR I started a apprenticeship with my local Sheet Metal Union, something I was wanting to do and waiting for a long time.

Only a few days in, I realize: This is not my passion. I can't see myself doing this everyday for the rest of my life.
I'm riddled with anxiety every morning before work and just from the last 3 years of working construction my body is already messed up!
My back hurts like hell and my knees are hurting too, keep in mind that I'm only 22
I'm scared that my body will be useless by the time I hit 35

I have been contemplating quitting my apprenticeship and going to university.
I'm interested in engineering or programming. I have very little experience with C# back from my high school days and always found it very interesting.

The only think holding me back is that Sheet Metal is very well paid and the schooling is paid for by the union.
On the other hand I'm worried about raking up student debt and maybe even being too old to pursue a higher education at a college/university?

25,"Throwaway but yeah before someone directs me to breakups or exnocontact no worries I’m already on there and I don’t expect to contact my ex anymore really. I’ve completely removed myself. 

I “mutually” broke up with someone. I put that in quotes because I didn’t want to but due to the guilt that the guy was experiencing dating me, I facilitated our split. I don’t think he was able to tell me “let’s end this” cause he named our all the reasons we couldn’t be together but couldn’t say those words so I did. The guilt was mainly due to me having a strict family so hiding the relationship and him possibly leaving and in all scenarios he felt that we wouldn’t last.

We spent a day together after that. I know I’ll advised and I know stupid. He asked me to plan out the day and I didn’t. I know again my fault I should have done what he asked me. However, he reacted annoyed and even complained to his friends via text and I wasn’t snooping but it was obvious that with his constant texting he was complaining about me.

Again like I said, I should’ve done what he asked me to do. However, he didn’t help me and demanded to be taken home which I did.

Told him to take care of himself since this was the last time I’d see him and he barely replied.

He left something of his and texted to get it back however I didn’t reply that night since I needed some space and was upset for what I did and how he acted. Next morning I get a passive text saying to “keep it” and I replied immediately explaining why I didn’t reply and obviously he feels like he acted within reason. 

I’m not gonna argue with that since he was upset. And I feel bad for upsetting him and not doing what was asked of me.

I reply and even send a text the next day asking him to please get his things cause I don’t want them honestly I just don’t and also I don’t want him to trash talk me about keeping his stuff to his friends. Maybe he won’t but considering how he acted he was really mean..

I’m not looking to get him back because I know that won’t happen. I’ve apologized enough already and his behavior hurt me in addition, he probably wanted to get rid of me and probably never cared about me so I’m not doing anything anymore.

Look I know the mistakes I made guys I don’t need someone to point them out again. I already feel bad enough as is. However, I just want to move past this. I’ve been twisting the knife in my back really,.. convincing myself he doesn’t care, he hates me, and he’s happy I’m out of his life. 

However this guilt weighs on me. And I wanted us to at least be on good terms and now that will never happen. Yeah I asked to be his friend but I wasn’t going to bank on that... I just wanted to be civil and keep him in my life since before we got together we talked so well with each other and i honestly liked him as a person. However, with being treated like that, I’m hurt but obviously since I still care about him I can’t hold it against him.

Anyhow... like I said.. there’s so much guilt here. I always try to mean well. And I know I made my mistakes it just really sucks that this might be held against me forever",30Jul2019,1

28,I joined the navy right after high school. I was in for 6 years before making the decision to separate. I did pretty well in the navy but I decided it was time to move on. I made the choice to drop everything and move to Arizona to attend ASU on campus intending to special in Computer information systems but didn't get accepted into the program so I stuck with buisness. I did a semester in Arizona and finished making the Deans list. I was unhappy so I decided to use my navy skills and accepted a job in DC. I worked there for about 4 months but I hated the job due to how boring it was then made the decision to move back home to massachusetts and stay with my family for a few months to figure my life out. I got accepted to a new position that I am quite happy with. The hours are not consistent but the pay is decent. Although I am pretty content with my job I cant shake the feeling I am wasting my life not getting my degree.

29,"Hi, I recently sought advice from varying advice forums. Some kind soul lead me to a subreddit r/borrow which seems like it might be able to really help some temporary issues.  


I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to be more likely to be accepted there? Reddit advice was my last hope and when I was directed there, I felt like my situation had been sent an angel.  


My partner whom I live with and is in the same circumstances submitted a \[REQ\] post because he is a long time Reddit user. Today is my first day on Reddit apart from scrolling through pet pictures on his phone lmao.  


He's a first timer on there, which I have seen isn't favoured. Does anyone have advice of how to be more likely of being accepted?   


I had an idea of co-applicant, but my Reddit isn't old enough. I can provide all of my own details though. Is 2 applicants with 2 sets of info and income allowed for the same \[REQ\] post there? I have looked through and not seen it done. Would it be more helpful to getting accepted?

Ok now that that is out of the way I’ll start at the beginning. When we were younger (Less than 10) I was at her house and we were messing around in her room pretending to have sex in different positions but with our clothes on after that I don’t really remember but she got naked and sat on her bed. I decided I was going to change out of my jeans into something else when her dad comes in to his daughter naked on the bed and his nephew behind a door with his pants down. The rest is a blur but we went outside and I think I left but not in trouble. I forgot to mention that she and her parents are devoutly religious. Fast forward a couple years and my grandma takes me, my brother, and my cousin out to eat at red lobster. By now my cousin has stopped being religious. Lunch was normal but my brother spilt some soda on his pants on the way to drop of my cousin so we stayed at their house for a about 15 mins to dry my brother off. My cousins sister in REALLY into smoking weed and I think my other cousin was just starting to get into it. So we’re walking at her ranch ( We live in Oklahoma) and she makes a “joke” about a weed stash, I laughed and she said “no I’m serious.” I ask to go see it and she shows me the worst and most obvious stash of weed I have ever seen (basically just sitting behind a tree.) She says “What do you think?” (I’ve smoked before but not in a year or so after getting caught) I tell her it needs work and she says “Will you smoke with me? I have mints and cologne.” I decline but she gets really pushy and even grabs my arm and pulls me to it but to no avail. She says the whole reason she brought me down here is to smoke weed and I tell I’d smoke it any other time but not now because my brother was probably almost done drying off. So I go back home and that was about a month ago. In about a month her and her family are going to stay at our house while theirs is under construction and she said she’s gonna bring weed and I’m excited to smoke it with someone beside my best friend but I’m also worried something is gonna happen while we’re high. She has also been really aggressive with me like punching me and cussing at me over text when their is no need too. I know she means no harm but my mom has told me (About other girls) That if they are aggressive with you they like you. I love my cousin but there is no way I would sleep or do anything sexual with her because I feel like it would be weird for the rest of our live. Is she into me? Is this all in my head?

Recently, my professor has flagged a question on there because the answer I submitted has nothing to do with the question. However, I know why he would think this. There was a consistent error on the test using the lockdown browser where I would click on the next button or the sidebar for the next question and it would freeze and open the question in a new tab. This may have happened on that exact flagged question because the answer that I have was for the next question on the test. I simply switch answers by mistake.

41,"Trigger warning: Talk of self harm

I've been friends with a guy for about 2 months now and about a month ago he told me he was attracted to me. I told him I don't like him in the same way but was happy to remain friends, and I thought he was too. I've found out recently from another friend that this guy is becoming somewhat obsessed with gaining my affection, and it's gotten to a point where it's making me very uncomfortable.

He's been texting my friend for advice on how to get closer to me, he complains when I don't answer texts straight away and asks me why I'm ignoring him, and he's been complaining about me hanging out with other people. As far as I can tell he's been cutting himself off from his other friends and constantly asks only me to hang out.

 It's obvious that this is extremely unhealthy for him and it's damaged our friendship quite a lot and pushed us further apart, and while I've tried to establish boundaries and tell him I need space, he doesn't seem to be listening, and things are only getting worse. 

I got a call from him one night while he was drunk and he told me he had been self harming because he's been feeling depressed. Meeting up with him the following day, he asked me if he could show me the scars on his arm but didn't even wait for a reply before pulling up his sleeve and showing me anyway. I've been trying to offer him advice to the best of my ability but I'm obviously in no way a professional.
 Just now he sent me an unwarranted picture of fresh self harm wounds, and it has pushed me over the edge. I told him that I couldn't help him any further and directed him to a charity which helps people suffering from suicidal thoughts and self harm.

 I ended the conversation to go to bed and he sent me a text asking me to come with him to the charity. I don't think going with him would be good for either of us and it would make me very uncomfortable because I feel his obsession with me has partly to do with why he's self harming, but due to the delicate nature of the situation I don't know if I should push these concerns aside and get him in the door to help.

54,"Well hi first of all.... And thanks for reading 
(first post here)

I'm just honestly confused. I'm 28, black, gay, adopted, and just trying to make something out of my life really.

What I need advice on is... Well ummmmm is it me? Theres really only one thing I want out of life, and that's love. But every time I get close to it, it seems to just dissappear. I've never really had a boyfriend, just teases and it's bothering me that I really would never have it. My life isn't perfect, alot of events have me jaded because no matter how hard I try nothing (especially love) works out. At first I thought it was my fear of abandonment. Scared my mom would leave me. But that fear vanashed when my sister outted me to my mom and while there's not much of a resolution to that, what I now know is that I was using my mom as a wall to hide behind. But even through the fear I've had over my entire life, that has never stopped me from trying, just led to no success.

I honestly don't know why feeling loveless drags me down to the bottem of the well I call anxiety and depression, but it does. I'm not expecting my life to turn out like any movie, Boy love drama or anything of the sort I just know my heart beats only to find someone who can accept all of who I am.

Why am I the one those in relationships turn to when they need to figure out their problems, males and females alike? Maybe because I feel like I'm empathic, or able to see both sides of any story and work out the best resolution. But it's weird because I've never been able to be in those situations in my own personal life.

I know I love hard, but not fast because I want it to be right. I'm the type to want to be with my partner but not crowd them. I want to feel safe and secure knowing someone other than family and friends want to ""tolerate me. ""(words from an former potential love) Experience a kind of love thats not bound by blood or a friendship bond. I want to know what love truly is.

Maybe I was born in the wrong time period. I can't get with the fuck-Boi mentality. Just getting your jimmies until your satasified and then be done. I've never been that type of person. Love is both warming to the soul, yet hard to keep and maintain, I understand that. I don't want to come off desperate, but in a way I am. Love isn't only fixated in the present but the future. I feel like no matter what pace it moves, love should always have a distant finish line, not just the next morning or the next app hookup. 

Family always end up saying 2 things when this pops up in conversation or expressed all over my face... 
1.)That it's because I don't love myself, or see worth in my own life. Which was true (again alot of events lead me in this direction) but if ima be honest I wouldn't be here breathing if I never came to that conclusion.
2.) Is that I have to be patient. This word really gets under my skin because well clearly hello I've been patient from the first moment I knew what kind of love I wanted was. That was well before my last years is elementary school. 

I don't find myself to be ugly or mean spirited. Emotional at times but a heartfelt person through &amp; through. I only want the best out of not only my life but everyone that has effected me. Even when I feel depressed about not being loved in the way I feel every soul diserves, I'm not openly jealous of what other have, just wish I also would get to that place....

I guess what I'm asking advice on is.. Well is there something wrong with me? Am I destined to be alone for the rest of my life and I need to accept that? Whats so wrong with me? 

I'm a simple guy who likes any kind well told story (music, TV, spoken word, books) who would rather be at home with the one I love rather than being out every night socializing. Who would support my partner no matter the circumstances. Who really only asks for love loyalty and respect in return.
Again I'm not perfect and steadily trying to improve my own shortcomings daily. I can be platinum blonde at times, a crybaby, but I'm also wise, compassionate, and only slightly selfish lol. 

Yet... I'm still here... Alone.. At the bottom of this well trying my best to pull myself out. And yet keeps fall in further the more and more I realize my heart is broken before it even beats..... Maybe it's fear but I'm not entirely sure what I'm scared of

56,"My co-tenant is holding the notice hostage and cons me out of money. 95% of everything is his &amp; he spends freely, while lying about his financial situation. I get just a small room. The payment is split evenly. When things don't go his way, he becomes (mostly non physically) abusive. If I threaten to leave, he blows up, uses guilt trips and pity ploys, makes it all about him, gives false promises. Nothing gets resolved. He is extremely controlling with emotional abuse.

When I didn't sign the lease renewal last year, he assaulted me (no hitting). We are on a month to month now, and the landlord told me we both have to be in the office and sign off for me to leave. He replied ""it's not my problem; I don't care what they say"", after I wanted to leave. The current landlord is not aware of the abuse, as I didn't want us to get evicted and had no money until now.

I've since spoken to two lawyers who told me the landlord is wrong, and I can give my written notice and leave that same day, since we are not on a fixed term lease anymore.

My concern is, if a new landlord calls for a reference, and the current one asks us if we are leaving. They tend to contact him, and he will know right away. I'm fearful for how he might react. Neither the landlord or him are aware of anything. I was told by friends not to give the landlord a heads up and just apply at other places. Don't bring up the abuse, just go.

But I'm concerned about them contacting us if they get a reference call. But to prevent that I would have to alert them, and bring up the abuse, and that could go very wrong. It is a property management. I don't want the co-totenant being dragged into anything. 

And what of the new landlord? Should I tell them I'm giving a notice ""after"" a new place is locked down? And that I have to get away from the current roommate? Should I explain the situation? Would that set off red flags?

I don't even care about paying the extra month rent &amp; utilities as I go. I took out a small loan to pull it off. I just want to leave.",30Jul2019,1
57,"I am fucking exhausted. In the past 13 months I ended an almost 3 year relationship. Moved to a new city. Got a great new job. Started grad school. Moved into my own place after saving from that job. Got another part time job to help with the bills. Lost a lot of friends because I am so busy. Am constantly stressed out. I feel like I have no support emotionally, and I don't ask financially from anyone. I am struggling to keep my head above water and I am lonely as fuck. I don't have any family around here that wouldn't use me as an emotional crutch. I used to have such a great, normal life. The break-up seemed to be a catalyst for moving my life forward - in a good way - for a while. I am independent and working hard on my goals which I hadn't done for a long time.

But now I am just stressed out, exhausted, lonely, and feel like I don't have anyone to talk to who could understand. I do have a therapist I see - but I feel like she just tells me the same shit over and over. I know I will be okay. But right now I feel so fucking overloaded. I miss my ex, but I know it's not her I miss, just the idea of her - because I really feel like I don't have anyone who cares. I honestly think if something happened to me, the only way anyone would know would be because I didn't show up to work. Not friends who I talk to, not any family who checks in... cause they don't... just because of a job that would be pissed I didn't show up. And would likely replace me in a weeks time.

I used to be so different and I feel like everything has changed. Even though I am so busy I try so hard to make time for friends, because I enjoy other peoples company. Now I'm just alone. And everyone seems too busy with their relationships or kids (which I get) to really understand. 

I guess what I'm asking is - wtf am I supposed to do? When I am done working I have hours of grad school. Then eat (if I can afford it/have food), sleep, repeat. Work thinks I'm not pulling my weight because I clock out after 8 hours a day while others work 10 - but they aren't in grad school. I'm tired. And I feel so alone.

TLDR: What can I do to invigorate my soul again when I have almost no time to do so? And the one day I have off from school and my jobs (Sunday - which I will still usually try to work the other job for a little bit) - I'm so tired I just want to stay in bed?

58,"I was trying to buy a used vehicle from a fairly reputable+well known car company, even getting down to getting my financing options analyzed and laid out in front me.  This is like a legit chain, not ""Jimmy's used beaters LLC and Brokers.""

Basically, I decided to buy elsewhere, but they keep texting me asking about the car I looked at.  And when I said ""I'm not interested"", they texted me again from a different number, a number I've never seen before, asking what they need to do to make me drive off the lot with the car.

When I asked ""I'm not interested, how do I cancel?""

I got a really inappropriate, rude, and immature response from an unknown number.  I'm scared of divulging too many specifics for fear of repercussions.

Mind you, this is a week after test driving the car, and I'm getting these texts after 8 p.m.

Obviously, because I test drove the car, they have a lot of my personal information, license, and address.  Furthermore, because I'm a young adult trying to land a professional job, I can't go around blowing up social media with screenshots because:

A) They have my name and address.  If I post on social media, at some point, my professional persona will be linked with that of a trouble-making whistleblower, either because the persons harassing me will personally leak it, or one of my more casual social profiles (i.e. twitter, youtube, etc.) will inevitably be attached to my professional social media profiles.

B) I don't know what they can do.  They can send people to throw bricks at my house, come key my car, I don't know.

I don't know.  This is really inappropriate and I feel like I can't take legal action, but at the same time, these people need to be dealt with.

What should I do, and how should I go about doing it?

I only followed through with the pregnancy because while I was pregnant it was the most stable I've ever felt. It made me feel like I could do this motherhood thing. Now that I'm a little over 2 months into this, I've already relapsed on drinking due to feeling overwhelmed... 

I'm on psych meds but they aren't working. I don't want to risk going manic and having him taken from me and put into the foster system.

Called the adoption info line today and they said he'd go to an actual adoptive family. I don't know if I should wait and see how I do or if I should call it early so he won't remember me. Maybe its easier if I do this now?

I'm conflicted because both my parents are so helpful. Im 23 and live with my dad. Even have a wonderful new man cause baby daddy is busy doing anything besides getting his shit together. I have everything I could ask for but nothing material matters if I can't keep myself from going crazy... Am I manic now and that's why I'm considering this? Fuck.

73,"Lets start from the beginning.

I'm in a decent town, about to start at a really good school. I've been living with my mom and her boyfriend (lets call him Gary) for about 4 years.

My mom is disabled and can't work. Gary works a comfortable 80k job that he does from home.

Gary claims he has no problem being the financial foundation for our family. This is very untrue. My mom isn't the most pleasant human being. She and Gary often fight, and I'm pretty sure the only thing holding them together is me.

Gary and my mom can't get married because my mom is still married to my dad, who lives several states away and is unwilling to cooperate for a divorce. This means Gary has no legal obligations to us whatsoever. 

Gary is also quite emotionally unstable. He is impulsive and sometimes I question his empathy. He's a very hot and cold person.

Something I didn't realize before deciding to live with my mom and Gary is that he loves to exercise control. I get it, a lot of Gen X fathers are like that, but Gary's love of control just happens to show through his semi-regular threats to abandon me and my mother whenever he's pissed off. 

These would seem like empty threats to an outsider, but they're very real. If Gary feels like he isn't getting enough out of his life, he'll take all necessary steps to change that with no regard for emotional connections or in this case, family.

I can't properly articulate how badly this fucks with my happiness. Is there anything I can do about my situation?",30Jul2019,1
74,"Good evening,

Looking for some advice--I will try to keep it short.

I live in the Midwest, and relocated to a nicer, larger city in early June for an IT job I accepted with a small company (200 employees) It was big break in my career I had been seeking the past two years, only to find out two weeks into it that the company was being acquired. It sounds like the other company outsources my position, so there is a good chance I will not have a job with them when the deal closes in December, although I probably won't know for sure for another couple of months.

Wanting to be proactive in finding a different job, I started applying to a bunch of places all over the state.. with the mindset that I did not care where it was, as long as it was a great opportunity. I received lots of calls back and have had quite a few first and second interviews, which I had not entirely expected. Over the last few weeks I have thought about it more, and I would really love to stay in this new city. It has many more things to do, it's a great tech hub so lots of job opportunities, I am a couple hours closer to lots of my family, and it's just a much nicer area overall. The cost of living is a little higher, but not astronomical.

So of course, my first offer came in from a large corporation, where I would be required to move back to the old city I just left. While I do have some friends and a rental property back there, I do not desire to live there. I would feel like I am settling, which I hate doing in life. However, the other part of me says I should take the offer, because it is a solid company, a decent raise from what I am even making now, and has great benefits. While I know there are tons of opportunities around here, I do not want to regret not taking something I had and potentially end up not finding something as good.

I have been looking for homes to buy around here, and found one I really love for a good deal, and know I would be happy in. My thought was that I could buy a house, then at least have something to work around, and focus on finding jobs only in this area. Right now all my possessions are in storage back in the other town, and my friend is taking care of my dog there. Other than that, I am not married and have no children. I do have a decent amount of savings built up that I could survive on for a while, and do plan on having a roommate or two when I find a house to help pay the mortgage.

If anyone can offer any advice on making the right decision, it would be greatly appreciate. I can see the pros and cons to both, so some outside objective perspectives would help a ton. Please let me know if further details would help.

Thank you for your time!",30Jul2019,1

The other day, someone asked me to apply for a job several states over. The opportunity could be great, and I think I would like the work more, but it comes at the expense of moving away from family. Cost of living goes up substantial (living free at home vs paying the bills), which means I may have student loans for longer than I want to (several years vs one-two).

Idk what to do. I want to live close to my family, and my expenses could not be lower than they are rn, but I also don’t know if this job will get any better.

Right now I'm in Australia with my dad to visit some friends he met here 30 years ago when he made a work and travel. Although these are friends from a long time ago and I just met them once they are like a family to us. (They say the same about us)

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've started some version of this post about half a dozen times over the last couple months, but even on an alt account, I haven't been able to commit to the words I'd put down.  I keep managing to convince myself it's not as bad as all that and nobody wants to hear me whine about it. It may well be true, but this is where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is falling apart. My dad has terminal brain cancer, and I just found out he probably won't make it much past Christmas. My fiancee vacillates between lashing out about how she feels unfairly treated by life in general and repeatedly threatening to kill herself. I'm trying to be supportive to all parties here, but I just don't think I have much left in me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has hit the anger stage of grief pretty hard recently, which makes it very difficult to talk about much of anything with him. Most of our conversations end with him just hanging up on me. My mom's a wreck and I can't tell how she's going to react when it finally happens. And I'm wracked with guilt because A) I live several hours away and can't make it up as often as my conscience tells me I should and B) my family and I haven't been very close in a long while anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile my fiancee keeps piling on projects on the house in an attempt to maintain some sort of control over her life (by her own admission), and then lashing out at me when they don't get done on time, despite me pouring in money and physical effort to try and get them done.  Our conversations follow a steady pattern starting with ""everyone is just out to fuck me over"", and ending with a glib variation on a suicide threat. And I just feel trapped. I knew how to respond to the first one. I rushed over to her place and made sure she was OK and had not in fact taken the bottle of painkillers. Same for the second, and maybe the third time. But after a few dozen...I guess I just got accustomed to it? Accustomed isn't the right word. It's just normalized in a weird way, but I have no idea how to adequately respond. What are you even supposed to do?  


I've repeatedly tried suggesting therapy, she either shoots it down out of hand as being useless or gets angry with me and refuses to even speak to me for hours, if not a day or so. Recently, I suggested going to therapy together if that would make it easier for her. I got yelled at for being so unhappy that I felt we needed couples therapy. Honestly, we could probably use that but A) this was not my suggestion and B) WTF? How dare I care about her and this relationship, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read articles on living with someone undergoing mental illness, and I've had mild success (at least compared to going it alone), but I just don't think I can go on much longer. Attempts to empathize are met with anger, silence, or doubling down on how she has no will to live. (Gentle) suggestions of seeking therapy are equally well-received. 

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me wants to cut and run from this relationship as fast as I fucking can, and I feel horrible just thinking it. I'm making my peace with my dad's illness, as there's nothing I can do but try to be more present in his life until he goes, but at least there's \*something\* I can do about the rest of it. I just can't bring myself to leave while I feel there's something left to save.

My work offers free counseling services, and I'll be taking advantage of that, but it takes some time to get an appointment with a counselor/therapist.

 but I have done this Roadshow before last year in-fact (2018) now that my old co-worker does not what to do the roadshow this year the company wants to know if I would be inserted in taken my co-worker's job (DM) now this job comes with lots of stress, I'm sure you can guess its not easy being gone for long. I would roughly be gone for 6-7months away from home. Now this job comes with a huge pay rate increase roughly $25hr plus time and a half for every hour worked over 8, plus 2k for food, gas,  hotel/Airbnb and other expenses. whatever I don't use I keep.

102,"The title also serves as a TL;DR :) 
So, I’m 22, about a year out from graduating with a B.S., and planning to pursue an M.S. immediately after, which will probably take about 2-3 years. Then, I’ll probably be moving out of state for work, which will be full time. 

(I currently live with my girlfriend who doesn’t want kids, but god that’s a whole other advice post 😓For a long time I thought I didn’t want kids either, but have had a change of heart in the last several months.) 

So, I’m short, I know that I’m probably 6 years from being ready to have kids, which makes sense because I always thought I’d get married in my late 20s, anyways. But largely I’m feeling really impatient and frustrated—like I’m tired of doing the “college kid” thing and I’m ready to move on to what comes next, but I can’t. It’s to the point that I have trouble paying attention in class because I’m so preoccupied by thinking about the future, but then I remember that the future depends on me doing well in class! 
Basically, I just want to figure out something to help me feel more like I’m moving forward, not stuck. Help?",30Jul2019,7
103,"Hi Reddit, I'm here to ask your advice on a somewhat serious situation. My best friend has a dog, but she and her family somewhat neglect him. I don't know what to do about it, since I don't want to jeopardize our relationship. Here's the situation: My best friend is 17, and cannot drive yet. She is an introvert and not very athletic. She doesn't like to go outside much either. I know she loves this dog though. The main problem is her mother. first, my friend is an only child, and both her parents work, so during the school year no one is home during the day.  Her father runs a health and retirement company, and he is also a lawyer in Jordan (we live in the U.S.) and goes away for months at a time. Again, her mother works full time during the day. They don't belong to a dog park because her mother claimed it was too expensive and didn't want to fill out the paperwork. Their dog is around 2 years old, and we believe him to be part rottweiler and part beagle. There are a number of concerns, the first being that he doesn't get out enough and isn't getting the needed exercise. Second, he doesn't eat much dog food, he mostly eat table food. every night they feed him table chicken. He seems to be very fat, although they claim he is not overweight. lastly, he has a crate in the basement, but there are no blankets in it, and recently when we took a vacation my mother pet sat and went over and saw some pee congealed on the crate floor. He also isn't trained very well, and just seems starved for attention. I don't know what to do, and I want to help him without hurting my friend. What they are doing is not criminal, as the dog has food and a place to sleep, but does not get the stimulation he requires.",30Jul2019,1

109,"I literally just made an account for this so sORRy if anything’s wrong or something, let me know!!

I’m 16 and my mom has always been quite strict, I’ve never had a sleepover and I’ve been to a few friend hangouts in comparison to most kids my age.

The hangouts are usually like, planned, not just hanging out for fun and going like, outside for no reason. And, I’d understand if they were new friends or bad influences but they aren’t. I’ve known my closest friend for almost ten years, she lives with her mom only, and I’m still not allowed to sleepover at her house.

With my old friend group, they hung out a lot of times outside of school and sometimes tried inviting me but then just stopped (I literally only hung out with that friend group outside of school once for a birthday party). 

My best friend is moving away (again, before she moved away after 6th grade and we had only hung out maybe twice outside of school) and I really get so sad when her and my other friends talk about their sleepovers like, is it so hard to just maybe...facetime me when they have a sleepover since they know my mom won’t let me at all? I mean, that sounds so fun
and I would do that if my close friend couldn’t hang out with us????

I’ve concluded that they just think it’s too complicated to hang out with me but, I don’t know what to do, we rarely ever text, too. Its just me thinking once again if my friends are really my friends. Like, once there was gonna be a birthday party but the girl was like “sorry something happened” to the [dead] groupchat and then her plus another friend are on each other instagram stories. And I understand not wanting to talk about some things but it just seems not friend-like? 

I don’t know what to do, my mom’s stubborn and my friends know that.

Another example is something that happened today, I was speaking to someone (not him) about Starbucks and my favorite drink from there and he ran out and got me the drink. 

I recognize that these are nice things that he's doing but they flip off a red light in my head because a lot of the time I'll tell him no to these 'favors' and he'll do them anyway and expect me to be grateful and it just weirds me out.

112,"Hello! Before we start I would like to apologize in advance if my post is all over the place. So as the title says my girlfriend came clean about her having me over at her moms house while she was at work. I’m not upset at my girlfriend because I understand why she would come clean but what I’m worried about is our relationship. 

I’ve been dating this girl for 3 and a half years. We’ve had small problems but nothing too big. But over those 3 years we’ve only been able to see each other at school and on a handful of weekends so we decided that this summer vacation, I would sneak in into her house so we could cuddle and have sex and all that before her mom came home, and we did this for about 3 weeks. 

A week ago, it got really hot so she decided to only wear a bra since she’s comfortable with me seeing her like that and she looked absolutely stunning. I had to kiss her all over but my dumbass decided to give her a hickey right in the middle of between her boobs. When I was giving it to her I had my eyes closed so I didn’t know where I was giving her the hickey. After I noticed where I gave it to her, I got really scared that her mom was going to notice and told her that she should wear a regular shirt so she could hide it. 

She did wear a shirt. But only for a few hours. Long story short her mom noticed right away. My girlfriend came clean and told her everything. She told me that she told her mom everything so I told my mom as well. They took her phone away and I haven’t been able to contact her. But her dad called me and he was obviously really upset but he understood why we did it but her mom is really but really upset. I sent her a message apologizing for everything but she hasn’t texted me back. I know we both fucked up and it was mostly my fault and I know there’s little chance for me to get her parent’s trust back but if anyone has any suggestions on what else I can do, please tell me. I really want to make the most out of this relationship since I’m moving in about a year and she’s someone I really like. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

118,"Just a little background before I dive in: I’m currently a junior in high school. My school has decided to implement a couple of rules that seem absolutely ridiculous to me. 

Firstly, book bags are no longer allowed in the classroom. Seeing as we only get 5 minute passing periods, this is just... insane to me. My locker is located at the far-end of school, completely away from classrooms, which only enhances my problem with this. The reasoning behind this change wasn’t elaborated on much; however, they did say it was to “maintain a safe learning environment within the classrooms”. I’m baffled. How does outlawing bookbags maintain safety? Does this seem absurd to anyone else?

Not only this, but they’ve also decided to send out “weekly internet reports” to parents that show how our laptops are being used at school. It shows searches, websites we accessed/tried to access, and more. Seeing as they block almost EVERY website known to man (not an exaggeration, any website that isn’t 100% school-related is usually blocked) I just can’t understand why they feel the need to do this.

I did this as a sort of bored way to laugh at a bunch of racist idiots, but I quickly started to realize I had begun to agree with them. I was sympathetic to their belief that “white race” was under attack in America and Europe, and I very quickly paired this with my own anecdotal experience with blacks in my high school years, which furthered my connection to this ideology. I’ve been keeping these beliefs to myself for these last five months, and I fear they have become too entrenched in my mind to cast them out.

We are currently in Summer vacation but I haven't spoken to her since the last few weeks of school, I did a mistake by not asking her if she wanted to hang out during the summer, or asking for her phone number, I don't get that nervous or shy talking to her or any other students, but I hesitated.

The reason I like her is that she is really nice to me, and is a fun and cheerful person, she is also attractive, I barely had any classes with her last year, but another trouble is that there is a chance that we might have few to no classes together, she is an extrovert, but at times she is also somewhat shy, I am not aiming to becoming her boyfriend, I just want to get closer to her, thank you for reading, I may post this on a relationship subbreddit as well, but I have also gotten decent advice from this community.",30Jul2019,1

After the movie ended, my grandma picked us up (excluding the boyfriend- he went home with his dad). My sister rode in the front and me and my friend were sitting in the back. I put my foot on my friend as a joke and tried to take a picture to be like ""couple goals"" because we joke that we're dating (we're not- she's literally like a second sister to me) and the flash went off. My grandma looked back, demanded that I took my foot off of her and asked why I took a picture. I just told her it was an accident or something along those lines. Once we dropped my friend off, she started yelling at me to ""not put my legs on other girls legs"" and she was very visibly pissed off. It just felt like she was mad about something underlying. The next day, she interrogated my sister, asked her various questions like, ""Clpping is getting really close with her friend, they've been texting a lot, right??"" etc etc. 

She's been overall pretty antagonizing towards me lately and I feel like maybe this is the reason why. It's also made me pretty spiteful because I DON'T like my friend in that way. We are best friends and that is all. She's been my closest friend for years now and I've never had romantic feelings for her.

It’s been getting worse and worse from me being in the kitchen to me just poking my head out of my room triggering him to follow me around. I’ve kind of ruled out some things that may be causing it. Not to say that I’m completely right but my reasons are as follows:

1. He’s lonely since the other cat died: For the first 5 years I’ve had him he’s been my only cat and quiet. Plus it’s not like they were the best of friends, in fact they didn’t really get along at all.

2. Pay more attention to him: Since April I’ve been taking time out of every day to play with him for around 30 minutes but that’s changed nothing.

He gets fed wet food at 7:30 every night and I always make sure to keep his other bowl filled with dry food. But even like an hour after he’s eaten his wet food he’ll be constantly following me around and loudly meowing for food.

135,"Hello Reddit,

I have been given the honor to plan my cousins bachelor party. Basically, we are about 18 people and are renting a cottage in the countryside that has access to a lake. We have the food being catered, we have the choices of vices taken care of...but we are struggling with entertainment. We have about $550 left to work with, what can we do to entertain all these poeple and the bachelor. The only restriction was a stripper. We are a group of people that are pretty much open to any form of entertainment. It can be a persons service, an item or items to rent...etc.

What are your ideas?!?! Please HELP!",30Jul2019,1
136,"You know the memes where it’s about those friends on Xbox who just magically disappear and their status says “Last Online: 6 Years Ago”? I feel like I’m going through that but it just doesn’t make any sense.

My Xbox and now PC friend has mysteriously vanished. I don’t *know* him in real life, but we know each other really well. We’ve been friends for 6 and a half years, and we have each other’s number and all. Anyways, ever since last Wednesday he hasn’t gotten on or texted me. It’s strange because this has never happened before and I’ve known him for 6 years. I’ve even had my other friends to text and call him and nothing. He hasn’t gotten on his computer for nearly a week, and hasn’t responded at all. I’m really starting to get worried now. Today I just spammed him and nothing :(

148,"My first long term relationship, and first relationship ever came crashing down after half a year of long-distance because of college. I initiated no contact after asking on Reddit and after 4 months of silence we met up once I was back in town. I had seen other girls after it ended but kept this from her when she asked. I'm not trying to justify it, it was wrong and at this point, I want to grow past that into a more honest person. I'm not sure why I did it, I guess I just didn't want her to get jealous, I didn't want her to see me as some sort of player, but of course, she found out and this caused a rift. Still, feelings remained and we made up and entered this weird one foot out the door pseudo-relationship where she constantly kept me at arm's length while continuing to pull me in, once or twice she'd try to end it but she'd change her mind.

By the end, it was causing more pain than pleasure, her reluctance, and indecision about wanting me especially after I broke her trust stunted any chance of developing feelings, and her distance made me afraid of getting to close that I'd break my own heart if she left, so I kept mine aswell. We spoke one night and she ended it, 100%, saying she viewed no future with me, she saw me as this sex-addicted guy who only thought with his dick, and that she could never see me the same way. She said she didn't hate me and that she wanted to be friends, And I know that wronged her, I'm not trying to get her back anymore, it's clear she doesn't want me and she doesn't owe me anything especially after how I've treated her, but it still hurt. I still loved her, and strangely enough despite the breakup and the period of silence she still knew me better than anyone and I considered her one of my closest friends. 

Some days of silence passed after that conversation and she drunk dialed me asking if I hated her, we had a wonderful conversation and at the end, she asked if I still wanted to speak to her, I said that I do but that I need some time to figure myself out. Now it's been 3 weeks since that point, I saw her at a party unexpectedly recently and felt horrible just at the sight of her, it felt like she kept positioning herself within my field of view at all times. At the same time, all I wanted to do was speak to her, but that's not what this post is about this is just context.

From this entire experience, I learned that, at least at this point in time, as the people, we are now, a relationship between us would only breed more pain, we both have things to work on, I especially have a lot to work on within myself, figuring out who I am and moving past my previous dishonesty into a better person. I know I did wrong and I want to and will change.

I don't know what I want to do now though, I feel conflicting desires pulling me apart.

I want to feel love again, that simple burning feeling in my chest that I felt at the start of that relationship. I want to be caught like a deer in the headlights by the blinding burning passion of it again, to be able to kiss someone and lose myself in their lips. I want to feel nervous about a person because I just think they're so amazing, to just absolutely freeze when they look at me and melt when they smile. I want to meet someone who can make me feel pure, innocent love again. No second-guessing, no indecisiveness, a leap of faith, to fall in love and be caught. 

Yet simultaneously I'm a horny asshole. I want a healthy sex life, to explore and learn about myself and others, I haven't had much experience and I want to change that. 

I'm kind of terrified of having my heart broken again, it was one of the most horrible feelings I've ever felt, relationships, emotions, and love have felt so hard throughout this experience. And I feel like I've sort of lost my innocence in a way, I used to look at her and fantasize about just holding her, but now I get so horny all the time I'm worried that I'll be unable to have a fulfilling relationship without a prolific sex life. That I've tainted myself now through my actions.

149,"I'm 28 years old and have done nothing with my life. I dropped out of college at 18 due anxiety and depression. I have only worked a couple jobs mostly through family.

153,"Seems sad I'm turning to internet strangers for help. Not because it's a bad thing to do but because I'm at the point where I feel like I need to. I'm 22 almost 23 and I feel like a big chunk of my life is fading away. I'll start at the beginning. When I was in high school I had a lot of friends and partied almost every night. Was a popular kid and could date almost any girl I wanted. There was a point in my senior year where I realized that I had my priorities fucked and I wasn't going to graduate. I enrolled myself at a military school to get a diploma and graduated top of my class. I immediately enlisted in the military after.

    Here's where shit starts fucking up. I joined at 17 and was always the youngest in the group. When I graduated boot camp and got stationed at my first command and reality set in hard. I just turned 18 and was in a fresh new place and didn't know anyone. Immidatley I was getting shit on for being the youngest and that drew an insecurity out of me I never felt before. It impacted my work and I just kept fucking up all the time which in turn led to more heat from my co workers. I did my 4 years clean and got out but about my third year in I got a girl that I liked since about middle school pregnant. We weren't making enough to support a child so we got married so the military would recognize us as a family and help us out. 

    Fast forward to me getting out and at around this time my wife had the baby but got hit hard with post pardom. I saved enough money to support us when we got out for a while but I spent an entire year almost staying at home and taking care of my wife and child. My wife and I had already been having trouble because she has the mentality of a 16 year old and doesn't know how to be an adult really. She's lied to me about where she's going and she would go to a casino and blow money on gambling. She never picks up after herself and she treats me like a slave. At first I thought it was the post pardon but after a while I just realized that's how she is. Not to mention my mother in law is the same way and they team up on me all the time. It's hard to explain the countless times they have treated me like shit especially when it comes to me just trying to raise my child. In the midst of all this I lost all my friends because I'm too caught up in trying to take care of my child and my wife who is also like a child. 

   All in all at this point right now, my marriage is in shambles, my wife and mother in law team up on me and try to push me out of my child's life, I'm unemployed and running out of money, I had absolutely 0 friends right now, and I have no idea what to do with myself. I'm not depressed or anything but I kind of realized this is just life. I'm waiting for it to balance out but honestly I could just use a couple kind words right now. My child is all I care about at this point and I'm sitting here tearing up because I tried to hug them and they ran away from me and I know that's not that big of a deal but god damn man it's really getting to me.",30Jul2019,1

I'm by no means a stupid person, i actually consider myself above average intelligence, but lacked any sort of motivation.

My life started falling apart in high school, I had a girlfriend so i was able to ignore it for the most part, until that ended. I was left to deal with this through my first semester of school, the easy way out was drugs, which was the route i took.

165,"It's a bit of a long story, but I'll try to condense as much as I can. 

Basically, I have an undergrad degree in a subject that I'm hugely passionate about. However, it's not an economically sustainable degree, at least on its own, so after graduation I went and pursued a more 'practical' masters degree. I'm halfway through the degree, and I have a very prestigious job offer for post-graduation that I have accepted. This is the kind of degree and program that would leave me ""set for life"" - I'd never have a problem getting a high-paying job, and it's an in-demand job even in poor economies. It's a lot of people's dreams.

All of that said, I'm miserable. My mental health has tanked in the last year, and I'm having multiple panic attacks and mental breakdowns every week. The job is alright, but its unfulfilling and boring, and I feel like it's turned me into a shell of myself. 

On a whim in April, I applied for a program in another country that would set me up for my dream career. The program is so perfect for me, I couldn't've designed it better if I tried. I got in, and that's where the problem lies. 

The program would set me up for my dream career, but it's not a great career. It's hard to find jobs, and most jobs are low-paying. I would also have trouble with visas, which would affect my job prospects. That said, I'm just not happy with what I'm currently doing. The constant stress has turned me into a person I don't recognize. But it does offer stability and reliability that would enable me to pursue my hobbies as much as I want, once I start working. 

I have to make a final decision by Friday, and I don't know how to do it. Everyone I've talked to has said ""Well, what's more important to you?"" and that's just it - I don't know. Every perspective I consider, the two possibilities are basically equal. I'm so tempted to go with what I feel will benefit my short-term mental health, but I worry that it would ruin my future financial stability. 

Help!

TL;DR - have to decide whether to continue my current masters degree that offers a good career but doesn't make me happy, or do a masters in an area that I love but risk bad career prospects.",30Jul2019,1

After speaking with him I upset him by not being the happiest on the phone as I’m in college in a difficult program. The way that I know someone is reaching and cares about me is frequent contact. This isn’t how he likes it he doesn’t want to talk as much as he is spending time with his family. I didn’t know that that’s how he wanted me to be acting by texting less. I feel now that everything is hitting him at once he is becoming more agitated understandably. 

My question is in addition to texting him less what can I do to support him through this difficult time ? Have you had an experience with a boyfriend/girlfriend’s parent having cancer ? I can’t even imagine what it would feel like...

170,"So I'm dog sitting for some family friends this past week. One of their dogs was diagnosed with some kind of muscular myothapy on one of his legs (I forget exactly what) and he had surgery \~3 months ago on that leg. Long story short, he got knocked over by the other dog earlier and he didn't cry out or anything but he refused to go more than about half a block on our evening walk today. I checked his leg and iced his hip. He can definitely still get around on all 4 legs (he came skipping up when he heard the treat bag). I texted the owners to let them know the dog had a bit of a tumble and that I took care of him and made him feel better the best I could.

They get back tomorrow and I'm freaking out worrying if the dog is still not gonna want to walk and they're gonna hate me because he fell on my watch and I feel bad, like a horrible person for letting this happen. Like, I want to tell them to not bother paying me or at least deduct some from my pay because they trusted me with their pets and although I don't think he injured himself drastically, he still got hurt to some extent so I still feel like I let them down and I'm the absolute worst and I deserve to be hated and yelled at and never trusted with anything ever again...

I know I'm most likely overthinking this and I think I did everything right following up after the incident (took care of the dog, then texted the owners, etc). So I've been freaking out for the past hour and I'm trying really hard but I can't seem to get myself to calm down. I don't know what to do.

We'd only been together for a year, but it felt like longer. We had a future planned together, we'd always talk about it, we were mad about each other. She suffered from depression and ultimately decided she couldn't be in a relationship right now, although she'd always told me that I was worth it and she wanted to make things work so it came as a huge shock. I feel utterly crippled, depressed, I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed in the morning, I think about her constantly and it's agony.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I just started an ambitious new job as a software developer. I have no experience as a software dev so the learning curve is huge. It requires a lot of independent study and I really have to stretch myself. When I was with my girlfriend I had immense passion, ambition drive, which is what I have always relied on to meet challenges like this. With her gone, all of that has been (temporarily) shattered. I no longer have that drive, I use all my energy on just making it through each day. I'm terrified that with my mental state in pieces I'm not going to be able to meet the requirements of this new job, my financial situation will be in shambles (I NEED a job to pay my rent and bills while I study for my MSc) and my career as a software dev will be stunted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I suffer from severe anxiety and mood swings, which makes these things difficult enough as it is. I'm sorry if this post is out of order/incoherent or w/e, I'm really totally lost as to how to handle this situation, I just don't feel like I have the strength, so I'm reaching out to anyone who can offer me any advice on how to cope or what to do.

174,"Hey guys,
I'm at a Basketball tournament with my new school team. I joined the team around a month ago and today is the second day of the tournament (there are three days in total). I am an extrovert by nature but this is the first time I've found it difficult to interact with people. I've tried talking to every one in my team, tried discussing strategies and getting involved in general group discussions but nothing has worked out. Due to this I'm feeling lonely and I'm worried it'll affect my performance in the tournament as i am not familiar with their form of game play and they are ignoring my questions. 
Any advice on how to overcome this would be highly appreciated :)",30Jul2019,1
175,"Incoming wall of text so be prepared. If you need a TD;LR, I'll do my best to provide it. 

So I feel bad for my mom because her situation kind of sucks, but at the same time she's adding stress to my life and I need her to stop. Here's what's going on. 

For some reason my mom has been unable to let me grow up ever since I moved out 3 years ago. She's on me for everything - calling and texting all the time and nagging me to do things that I'm already on top of. Here's the kicker - I live in a different state than her. 

She's in her 50's, hasn't had a job in 10 years, sits at home on her phone and does nothing, and complains that she has no friends, yet doesn't go out. 

To preface the rest of this I'm going to reference SDI personality traits. 

Blue - a people person, very social, tries to avoid conflict and will go to bat for other people. Can be a bit of a push over. 

Green - very analytical, likes to know WHY things are the way they are, will go to bat only if they know they're right or need to investigate. 

Red - competitive, expects excellence, doesn't tolerate others' bullshit, can be nice but when it comes to competition or getting ahead, they'll do whatever it takes. 

So:

My dad - blue/green
My sister - one of the most red people I know. 
My mom - no clue
Me - VERY blue with some green

My mom still lives with my dad and my sister. She doesn't have a good relationship with my dad because she feels like he doesn't value her. However, she doesn't help him. He makes all the money, she's in insane credit card debt which he pays, he comes home to a messy house, she pushes off going to the grocery store until he just decides to buy takeout and isn't sympathetic towards his issues because he isn't sympathetic towards her. Honestly their marriage started to crash when she quit her job 10 years ago and never looked for a new one. 

She feels like she doesn't have a good relationship with my sister because my sister doesn't respect her. My sister calls her out on all of the aforementioned crap daily and doesn't take her seriously because she finds my mom hypocritical, which she can be. Something that pisses my sister off (me as well) is my mom is 100% incapable of seeing any fault in her actions. So my sister and her will fight all day, but because of that, my dad and I just don't bother with her (because of the blue trait) and would rather not get into a dead end argument - even if we're right and she isn't. 

So that leaves me. She has expressed to me that she feels like I'm her only friend (because I can be a pushover and just deal with her crap) and so she puts all her weight on me. Here's the thing - I live in a different state, 100% financially independent from my parents, paying my own bills, engaged, and JUST started my career. She BLOWS up my phone every day. I get 20-30 texts from her a day and another 10-12 things on Instagram every day. If I don't respond to her in a timely manner she gets mad at me and then guilts me because no one else talks to her. I have less time for her now than I did in college - which wasn't much. So we came to a compromise where if I tell her I'm at work, she leaves me alone. Well - today was the last straw. I texted her I was at work and put my phone away. She then texts me ""you should be home by now"" and I open my phone 3 hours later to 11 texts and her getting mad at me for not responding to her. I got upset with her because of her compromise and she then said that it was my fault because I didn't provide her with my work schedule. I'm living my own life, far from her. She doesn't need my work schedule!

I love my mom and feel bad for her, but honestly I'm too busy and too stressed to deal with this. I really don't need this right now.  Sooo what should I do?

If you got this far, thanks for reading. I really appreciate it.",30Jul2019,1
176,"My gf has this ex who randomly shows up at her house, work, calls our work, stalks her ( she gets random texts that say, “who’s that guy you’re with?” Whenever she walks out of work on break), threatens to knock her teeth out, calls her literally hundreds of times a day, won’t accept that they aren’t dating, etc. I’m a very patient guy and she’s definitely worth working through something like this for. Her daughter goes to a daycare that his aunt owns and like I said, he randomly shows up at her apartment (which she moved into and he somehow found out where she lives.) Now obviously I could just beat the ever living shit out of him, but I’m afraid that he might retaliate in some fucked up way. He also mentally abused her so she won’t just call and get a pfa against him because she thinks he’s somehow above the law and it won’t do anything. I can’t get her to go to the police and I can’t just beat his ass because that will cause more problems as violence always does. What can I do? I know it’s hard for victims of this kind of thing to be rational but I’m at my wits end and I know eventually I’ll do something stupid because I have one hell of a temper.

177,"A bit of backstory for context: I've been facing some emotional problems for weeks now, I've been teetering on the edge of emotional outbursts. And it got to the point where I was unaware of my emotions, and more unable to control them. My anxiety came back, and for days at a time when people don't talk to me or don't realise I'm there I keep wondering if they just don't want me around anymore. 

I was unaware that my anxiety mixed with my expressive negative emotions impacted the people around me, in this case, my friends. But when they let me know what had been happening, I definitely felt like shit. It's been 2 days since they told me, and I've not talked to them since, still finding a way to properly readjust myself back into the circle. As the days go by though, the ice between my friends and I grow thicker.

I'm not denying that I am in the wrong here, I wanna know if there's a way of making things up to them, and how should I do it, tell them verbally? Put up a message? 

i need someone to address these anxiety issues to as well... I don't have much money to spend on a therapist (am a conscripted soldier) are there any alternative options?? :/

I just want things to go back to normal. I don't like living in fear and feeling like shit all the time.

178,"So I had this best friend. We were best friends probably 4 years straight. We had never tried anything romantic until one time, on a whim, we decided to hook up. Now, I can do the whole hookup thing. He, however, really **cannot**. He got super attached and I thought there might be something there. Actually, correction. I feel like I almost forced myself into liking him. I just knew he had been there through family drama, friend problems, breakups, and vice versa. Well, I was an indecisive person to him as well really. One day I wanted him, the next day I didn't and the thought of him grossed me out. I ended up breaking things off **3** times completely and I thought he would get the hint the last and final time until he texted me ""ending things""... I don't understand how you can end it if it was already ended but alright I guess. Anyway, we have each other blocked on social media because he saw I posted a picture on Snapchat with another guy. And my friends follow his social media and see he would post things about ""picking shitty girls"" and ""I deserve better"" Cry me a  river omg... and to me honestly, it sounds like he can't accept denial. I've already gotten over that part and I haven't missed him and I don't know why considering he was my best friend before all of this. But, my question to you Reddit, why do I actually feel like I'm about to get sick if he is mentioned or anything of the sort? Like I physically feel uncomfortable and want to cry because he is just a gross thought to me. Why?",30Jul2019,0
179,"Recently I lost a really good friend of mine &amp; a guy I had fallen for because they found they were better suited for eachother.  This is a part of life. I’m an adult &amp; I understand this logically. My hearts a fucking mess.

This was mainly my fault but we immediately cut ties and I’ve beat myself up for a while now on where I went wrong, what I did to push them away, what about me is so disposable. I also hate the fact that I can’t get over it and that I’m so clingy. 

I honestly feel worthless because although I took part in the decision to part ways I feel like I was easy to discard/erase/forget about.

I hate myself for not being able to just move on. I feel so alone now &amp; I hate the silence they left behind. I really cared about them and maybe I did a bad job at showing it? Id like to think I would still have them in my life if I could just grin and bear it and push my feelings aside. But I got hurt and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about. I had a few bad nights and had to get my antidepressant prescription augmented and medicine to be able to fall asleep. I honestly can’t stop tormenting myself about not being enough, not being someone people wouldn’t want to lose, not mattering. 

How do I stop placing my self worth on others?How do I cope? How do I stop thinking about them and how do I stop attacking myself for being flawed? I need to be able to find peace.

180,"At the end of May I (25M) moved in with my mother in her then boyfriend's house (We'll call him ""T""), after completing my degree. Today things boiled over in regards to my mom and her now ex-boyfriend, where it degenerated to T screaming, cursing, and finally screaming get out. He has now turned his anger towards both of us screaming and yelling foul things. In this latest screamfest he said that we are lying, cheating, stealing, freeloading f\*\*ks and that hes gonna set things right and hes gonna have family come set things right. None of what he said is true of course, but this worries me as he's a very angry vindictive human being. We are slated to be gone in a few days, already have a house lined up to move into. Until then we are kinda stuck here til the lease is signed and power is on.

However he has since turned off the internet where my desktop is and I have no friends around me where I can bum internet off of for it.

182,"I fell in love with a kitten I found online and I waited about three weeks for him to become old enough to live with me. It was a long and expensive process to get him here which makes this whole thing harder. After having him for two weeks, I felt drained. I deal with chronic migraines and he yowled a lot from being curious about his new environment and trying to adjust to everything. It took a lot out of me and I felt like I got way more than I bargained for. I started looking for a new home for him but changed my mind a lot until this couple asked about him. They seemed like a really good match and they have cats who are closer in age to him (my youngest cat is 3 so he's reaching the end of his playful years). I had a particularly rough night/morning and made the decision to rehome him. It happened quickly and I was extremely detached the entire time. I didn't say goodbye to him but as soon as they were walking out the door, I lost my composure and I've honestly just been a wreck since he's been gone.

Hi Y'all how you doing today ? I'd like some advice on how to ask my parents to see a psychiatrist as per the title ... 

I'm 17(M) and I have a shit ton of problems I would like to talk about to someone that could help me fix them, I don't want to talk about it to the people near me in fear of making them push me away because no one wants to hear about that kind of stuff. I've told myself that the biggest things we're fixed and that I've made peace with my problems or some shit but I've gotten into a relationship recently and all the problems have resurfaced.

Usually it shouldn't be that hard to ask your parents for something like that ....I think , but I have a dad that wouldn't understand that kind of stuff coming from me, would ask me a bunch of question I don't want to answer and would perceive it as weak, and a mom that would start stressing the shit out because she'd think it's her fault and that I feel the way I do and that would just make her life worse, maybe it's just me stressing out for nothing or being a pussy....I'd like some advice.

187,"This isn’t necessarily asking for dating advice or anything but generally about coping—as you will progressively find while reading the text below: but it does involve an ex-partner that I still have a close best friend relationship with. 

I had gotten out of a neglectful relationship with another guy let’s call him James who simply didn’t give me the attention I deserved and would chant empty promises. The guy I am talking about now, my best friend, let’s name him Xander, helped me out of my break up. He had showed me that I was well off without James and that I was a strong woman and had plenty more people to meet and will find someone that would love me. About a week I had had friends that would playfully implore that me and Xander would make a cute couple, etc. I dismissed them at the time but as I was alone with my thoughts I started thinking more about it and began spending more time with Xander. It wasn’t until long that my feelings grew. Turns out at first he wanted something too; although, he told me he wasn’t emotionally ready at the time considering that he was still sore from an extremely toxic relationship he was in with a previous girlfriend about a year ago and wanted something casual because he didn’t want him to seem like he was getting into a relationship out of lonelines (which was the sole reason why he clung to his ex for such a long time). Although, a few days afterward we began a couple. Sooner or later he broke up with me because he felt ‘we didn’t have anything in common’ and wanted to stay friends; considering that he had regretted being in the relationship because of the possibility of tarnishing our friendship. Which was understandable and respected his decision. We remained friends but had a sort of ‘friends with benefits’ relationship. His parents, naturally not trusting him about issues such as him having sex with his previous girlfriend without any kind of upfront honesty, still had a lingering suspicion of that corruption with that ex and therefore didn’t trust him. One day his mom found a condom wrapper on the floor (which was the same day we broke up) and interrogated him about it. There didn’t seem to be any tension at first but when his mom told his dad (his parents are divorced) his father was furious. I hadn’t heard much about it, but it seemed as though a lot had been going on within his family. Xander was struggling with depressive thoughts and feelings of hopelessness and would often times come to me for comfort and love because I was the person he trusted most. That and I was willing to give him support and compassion that he wanted. It still hurt me to see him in so much pain, considering that I still loved him. Also during that time his mother had her sister over along with her nephew. I distinctly remember Xander describing his aunt as a junkie, how she would sell her food stamps for drugs, etc. and would sleep with different men while leaving his cousin all to himself to watch. It was also this time that he found out that his step-father (whom Xander’s mother divorced) was under investigation for possession of child pornography. He was absolutely devastated and I remember the tension he would describe with his mother. That and the trouble his own mother was going through with it.

Nevertheless, one day not too long ago I had started to DM him on Instagram instead of our usual means of Snapchat. Our streak had almost hit its mark in disappearing and I decided to be a bit flirty; therefore, I sent him a message that went a bit like this:

“You better save our streak or I’ll make sure there won’t be any more coochie”.

It turns out, his mother had access to his Instagram from when him and his ex were fooling around. He didn’t remember at the time but soon found out when she would hint at it and become a bit unnecessary hostile later after it was sent.

It wasn’t until after work a couple of days later that I saw he sent me a message. The day before I felt some kind of dread and sadness before I went to bed and told him about it before I slept. He told me that he wasn’t allowed to talk to me anymore. That he was going to move from his mom’s to his father’s which was thirty minutes away (his mom’s place was within a minute walking distance), he had to quit his job, and he told me that his parents said that he was changing schools. I was absolutely devastated. My best friend gone? And I felt like it was all my fault. He told me it wasn’t my fault because we didn’t know that she could see our DMs. I told him I felt hollow, and he told me he felt the same. He told me that it would be a while until I would talk to him again. Maybe the end of the summer perhaps. But at first he made it seem as though we couldn’t talk for the rest of our lives or something. He told me not to text me unless he texted me first and I tried to give my phone number but he must’ve forgotten it because it was at the moment that his father was coming to pick him up. I remember him telling me that his dad was going to talk to my parents for some reason but they weren’t home and he didn’t have their number.

The only thing that I know he has to remember me at the moment is my little drawing I made for him when we dated. It was of him and he told me he kept it safe. And I have one of his shirts and still have the photos of us from when we were dating, I’m currently wearing his shirt whilst typing this.

It had been two days since the incident and earlier today while I was walking my dog I saw his mother’s car packed with paraphernalia in the trunk, so much so that it couldn’t close. 

I cried. And I imagine he did too. I continued to sob and listen to my music as I walked throughout the complex with my dog.

Anyway the reason why I type all of this is to perhaps get some kind of idea as to why or what had happened to cause such a reaction; considering that we both are teenagers and things like this should be expected. That and how to cope with it. He has been there for me through thick and thin and means so much, but I just don’t know how to cope with him automatically being gone. I talked to him everyday and now he’s gone. It’s just hard to swallow at the moment and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice? If so I would be very grateful.",30Jul2019,0

190,"Long story short, I was approved for a studio apartment and also a 1 bedroom apartment. Let me give you the gist of each place. 

Studio apartment: 
Located in midtown, around 450 square feet, 3.3 miles from work which means I could bike, but even if I drove, I wouldn't be needing gas as often. Price is literally what I'm paying for my half of a 2 bedroom place (can't stay here unless I get a roommate and I'd prefer to live alone). I'm honestly not sure if all of my furniture would fit, but I'd make it work/figure it out. Car insurance would go up about $400 more a year despite driving less, because of the area I'd be living in. 

1 bedroom apartment: 
Located around the same neighborhood I'm in right now which is about 10 miles to/from work which means I'd be driving like I am now and would need gas about once a week. This place is around 650 square feet.  Price is at the very very top of my budget. I'd still be okay paying this much, but it is at the very top of what I want to pay/can afford. Car insurance should stay around the same as what I'm paying now since it's about the same area. My furniture would definitely fit. 

A little about me: single, nearly 27 year old female. I have no debt/loans. I work for the state. I am actively trying to promote, but in the mean time I am working as much overtime as I can for extra income. I'm also in school full time and paying for that out of pocket.  I'd like to be able to buy a house within the next few years, assuming the market crashes in the near future. I am introverted and tend to just stick to my room when I'm home. Right now I have one tv and that's in my bedroom. Even when I was living with my sister and we had a living room TV, I would more often than not just spend my free time in my room watching TV. I rarely have people over. 

Which would you choose and why?",30Jul2019,2
191,"Hi, first post here, but have no other place I can think of to ask for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife started a new job about a month ago.  She's not sure how or why really but her current boss has done everything she possibly can to make her as miserable as possible in her new job.  She tries very hard to humiliate her in front of as many people as possible on a daily basis.  The other people on her team have said to my wife privately that her boss is going a bit overboard and they've never seen her like this before.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has tried to be as polite as possible and just take it all in stride but it's getting very out of hand.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this woman has found every tiny insignificant thing she can possibly think of to berate and chastise my wife publicly.  She had 1 small innocuous typo in an email and she spent 5 minutes berating her for it.  She asked my wife to use a specific set of data to run a report then berated her for using the wrong data set.  She spent another 5 minutes berating her for not sending her an email which she did actually send.  Then once proven wrong she spent another 5 minutes berating her for putting her in the ""to"" line instead of the ""cc"" line.  Literally just finding any possible excuse on every single possible thing to dig in and scold her.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm writing this, my wife has been at work for 13 hours and the woman knows it takes her an hour to commute home and keeps setting up meetings every 45mins-1hour so that she can't drive home.  Latest update is there is now a meeting scheduled for 11:40 PM with several other women obviously in hopes that my wife can join and she can gang up on her with the other longer tenured members of her team.  I could go on and on, and yes everyone has had their share of terrible bosses but this one really takes the cake.  She has done nothing to help train or onboard my wife, and has done everything to prevent her from succeeding and mocked every attempt she's made at trying to learn anything.  She clearly has some serious underlying mental issue that is in desperate need of professional attention...

&amp;#x200B;

The funny part is my wife was hired by this woman specifically.  She chose to hire my wife, and then immediately almost from day 1 has been as mean and nasty to her as humanly possible.  I don't really understand the motivation unless the decision to hire 'someone' was made from above her and she is trying to prove that this 'someone' didn't need to be hired and is therefore trying to make the 'someone' (my wife) look as foolish and incompetent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is a great person, very patient and extremely hard working and very smart, and I know any 'good husband' would say that but it's honestly the truth.  I worked with her before we were together (met her at work at another job/company a long time ago) and she really is a top performer.  She's just not being given a chance and the work environment is so extremely hostile.  Ironically it's just her team, everyone else seems to be nice and friendly/professional.  

&amp;#x200B;

We don't think going to HR will help as they'll more than likely side with the manager and/or just flat our tell the manager anything negative that was said.  They don't have an ombudsman.  The manager's boss actually seems to like my wife, and when they've talked he told her that the manager said my wife was not interested in being in the job long term and was not interested in leading a team, etc. etc. basically all lies.  He seems like he could be an ally but he's not her direct manager and has not been at this company for a long time either so is viewed as a bit of an outsider.

192,"Seeking someone educated. Not some bs.

About two weeks ago I fell off my bicycle while riding. Only thing that hurt was my arm at first, but as the day went on ribs were beginning to feel pain too. Felt extremely lucky. I went to the doctors about it and explained the pain I was feeling. - he did an examination on my ribs and straight up said nothing is broken, it'll get better. I explained other pains I've had in the past, poor knees and shoulder which were from unrelated events. He got me to get my blood tested for something I can't remember. 

Fast forward a week and a bit it's hurting to get out of bed, it feels like my ribs are stabbing into my side. An extremely painful feeling. 

Today as I have work off, I dropped into the doctors again, I've told them it is getting progressively worse, struggling to get out of bed, can't fully breathe in without it hurting etc. they sent me to get x-rays done of my ribs, &amp; was meant to see them again later today. 

Before going to get my x-rays done I see reception to rebook an appointment for today to see the doctor again, after being told they were fully booked out I have to wait till tomorrow. 

I got my x-rays done, handed them in &amp; began my trip home. Upon walking to the train station my ribs had gone from being tolerable to the point every step I was taking was immense pain. 

After a long slow walk home I'm now in bed laying upright and its not painful. I know getting up will hurt like hell. 

What are possible causes? Is the pain all in my head? Wtf is wrong with my body and how can I stop this pain?",30Jul2019,1

194,"To start with, sorry if the neutral pronouns are hard to read. I'm talking about my singular sibling who goes by they/them. 

My sibling has been having a crazy time at life recently. To tell the truth they seem bipolar to me with runs rampant in our family. They'll be extremely manic for a while, making huge future plans to get their life together or move across the country, then hit a wall. The lows are so bad that my sibling recently got in a lot of legal trouble, became an alcoholic, and harmed themselves badly. 
They were hospitalized for a while and I understand they were put on medicine and it really seemed to help. They were suddenly back to normal, like how they are when we were kids and teens, not the 'you never know who you're going to talk to' adult they'd become. I'm not sure what the meds were but they genuinely made a difference. My sibling was arrested a week or so ago and didn't take the meds while in jail, and hasn't since. 
I noticed right away, talking on the phone. They just seemed ultra hyper and positive despite just being released from jail. They just seemed off, so I asked if they were off their meds and they said yes. Is there any good way to convince someone to go back on their meds? I really just want them to be okay, but recently they're messing up their life to a disturbing degree by just ignoring all consequences in life. They keep doing crazy things that they'll never be able to get out of (like theft and fraud type crimes, no violent crimes) and their only explanation is 'I don't know why I did it I just wasn't thinking straight'. I think they need the meds, but I don't want them to just start lying to me about it if I harp too much, or stop talking to me altogether. 
If anyone who has had this struggle reads this please let me know if there's any good way to convince them.",30Jul2019,1

Joe is a bit more problematic. He is also friends with Bob, but Joe and I got off on the wrong foot (I beat him in a game of Super Smash Bros and he told me to fuck off). Our relationship has always been tense, but it never overflows, until today.

Bob, Joe, and I were going to play a game together, but Joe was complaining that the controls were too confusing (it’s a bit more complicated but also irrelevant).
I told him he’s being lazy and that he needs to get over it, and then we had an argument which ended with him calling me autistic and removing me from the group chat.

Two hours later, he DM’d me, saying “are you done being pedantic and argumentative?” I ended up sending him a paragraph about how he is extremely salty and gets emotionally defensive whenever he feels threatened (even in a video game), among other things, and I closed the DM afterwards. I immediately regretted doing that, though, since I’ve still got to moderate his activities in our community. I know he sent a paragraph back, but I closed the DM again so I didn’t read it.

We kept in touch afterwards and were really close friends and a little too close at times, but nonetheless things kept happening that pulled us apart and i felt stressed. Idk if i may have overreacted but i ended up blocking her when the summer began because i just couldnt take being around her anymore. 
Ive been stressing and crying and hurting myself nearly everyday this summer because i feel so guilt ridden about the entire relationship and i miss her and just so much more, but this isnt the main point.

Today, someone that is both of our friends randomly decided to text her asking why she broke up with me, saying ""by his side it seems like u broke up with him because he was bored."" i never said this, like i said she broke up with me because I was ""too good"" or ""overly affectionate."" So, she is obviously mad and assumes i was talking smack about her. She blocks the friend and posts on her public snap that im basically an asshole, garbage human being that i should kms and rot and fuck myself and such, that im spreading rumors about her even tho she explained why we broke up, which she did. I feel like theres something i can do other than just wait, and even waiting feels wrong because i think everyone hates me now. I never even did anything in this scenario it was forced onto me. Idk what to do or how to feel.

And My mother now has sole custody.

When I was young, my sister left with her now, ex.

203,"This involves an ex-partner that I still have a close best friend relationship with one that I’ve come to lose. This post is a tad long but please bear with me.

I had gotten out of a neglectful relationship with another guy let’s call him James who simply didn’t give me the attention I deserved and would chant empty promises. The guy I am talking about now, my best friend, let’s name him Xander, helped me out of my break up. He had showed me that I was well off without James and that I was a strong woman and had plenty more people to meet and will find someone that would love me. About a week I had had friends that would playfully implore that me and Xander would make a cute couple, etc. I dismissed them at the time but as I was alone with my thoughts I started thinking more about it and began spending more time with Xander. It wasn’t until long that my feelings grew. Turns out at first he wanted something too; although, he told me he wasn’t emotionally ready at the time considering that he was still sore from an extremely toxic relationship he was in with a previous girlfriend about a year ago and wanted something casual because he didn’t want him to seem like he was getting into a relationship out of lonelines (which was the sole reason why he clung to his ex for such a long time). Although, a few days afterward we began a couple. Sooner or later he broke up with me because he felt ‘we didn’t have anything in common’ and wanted to stay friends; considering that he had regretted being in the relationship because of the possibility of tarnishing our friendship. Which was understandable and respected his decision. We remained friends but had a sort of ‘friends with benefits’ relationship. His parents, naturally not trusting him about issues such as him having sex with his previous girlfriend without any kind of upfront honesty, still had a lingering suspicion of that corruption with that ex and therefore didn’t trust him. One day his mom found a condom wrapper on the floor (which was the same day we broke up) and interrogated him about it. There didn’t seem to be any tension at first but when his mom told his dad (his parents are divorced) his father was furious. I hadn’t heard much about it, but it seemed as though a lot had been going on within his family. Xander was struggling with depressive thoughts and feelings of hopelessness and would often times come to me for comfort and love because I was the person he trusted most. That and I was willing to give him support and compassion that he wanted. It still hurt me to see him in so much pain, considering that I still loved him. Also during that time his mother had her sister over along with her nephew. I distinctly remember Xander describing his aunt as a junkie, how she would sell her food stamps for drugs, etc. and would sleep with different men while leaving his cousin all to himself to watch. It was also this time that he found out that his step-father (whom Xander’s mother divorced) was under investigation for possession of child pornography. He was absolutely devastated and I remember the tension he would describe with his mother. That and the trouble his own mother was going through with it.

Nevertheless, one day not too long ago I had started to DM him on Instagram instead of our usual means of Snapchat. Our streak had almost hit its mark in disappearing and I decided to be a bit flirty; therefore, I sent him a message that went a bit like this:

“You better save our streak or I’ll make sure there won’t be any more coochie”.

It turns out, his mother had access to his Instagram from when him and his ex were fooling around. He didn’t remember at the time but soon found out when she would hint at it and become a bit unnecessary hostile later after it was sent.

It wasn’t until after work a couple of days later that I saw he sent me a message. The day before I felt some kind of dread and sadness before I went to bed and told him about it before I slept. He told me that he wasn’t allowed to talk to me anymore. That he was going to move from his mom’s to his father’s which was thirty minutes away (his mom’s place was within a minute walking distance), he had to quit his job, and he told me that his parents said that he was changing schools. I was absolutely devastated. My best friend gone? And I felt like it was all my fault. He told me it wasn’t my fault because we didn’t know that she could see our DMs. I told him I felt hollow, and he told me he felt the same. He told me that it would be a while until I would talk to him again. Maybe the end of the summer perhaps. But at first he made it seem as though we couldn’t talk for the rest of our lives or something. He told me not to text me unless he texted me first and I tried to give my phone number but he must’ve forgotten it because it was at the moment that his father was coming to pick him up. I remember him telling me that his dad was going to talk to my parents for some reason but they weren’t home and he didn’t have their number.

The only thing that I know he has to remember me at the moment is my little drawing I made for him when we dated. It was of him and he told me he kept it safe. And I have one of his shirts and still have the photos of us from when we were dating, I’m currently wearing his shirt whilst typing this.

It had been two days since the incident and earlier today while I was walking my dog I saw his mother’s car packed with paraphernalia in the trunk, so much so that it couldn’t close. 

I cried. And I imagine he did too. I continued to sob and listen to my music as I walked throughout the complex with my dog.

Anyway the reason why I type all of this is to perhaps get some kind of idea as to why or what had happened to cause such a reaction; considering that we both are teenagers and things like this should be expected. That and how to cope with it. He has been there for me through thick and thin and means so much, but I just don’t know how to cope with him automatically being gone. I talked to him everyday and now he’s gone. It’s just hard to swallow at the moment and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice? If so I would be very grateful.",30Jul2019,2

This girl is 2 years older than me. I am going to be a senior in high school this year. We were kind of friends when she was a senior and I was a sophomore. We recently saw each other at a party and texted a little bit and then I asked her out. 

The date

We went to see a movie and then go get lunch. During the movie she put her head on my shoulder and I then put my arm around her and we did that type of shit y'know. The whole thing went really well. She was making moves, was clearly interested in me and all that.

What's weird
All of a sudden she stopped responding to me on all platforms. Last night I asked her if she had ever smoked(weed). I'm not a stoner but I like getting high every once in a while. She partied a lot her freshman year in college(liquor). She said she hadn't and then just stopped responding to me. I'm out of town at a camp until friday. I am thinking of waiting until tomorrow night before bed and if she hasn't responded by then I'm going to facetime her and see what's up.

So im like 80% sure that the girl i talked to on the phone was the same that took my interview but i was so exited that i kinda missed her name. Then we talked about salary, what i will be workin as and then, my problem, when i would start. I had a small piece of paper that i was taking notes on and she askes me if i can start working on this date but i need training so its better to start on this day but it would be good if i could also work on that day so can you start your training on this day? Okay wow now im kinda confused but i try to keep up and scribble all of that info on that paper.
So heres something embarrassing about me. I get often confused with the numbers the 6th and the 7th ( in my language) and its stupid because my birthday falls on a 7th but i still get confused and always have to think twice hard first. Now the final answere to when i am suppost to start working falls on eather one of those dates (so in a week) but when i was scribbling the info down i wrote the 7th and all was well and the call ended. But then i thought oh no! She acctually said the 6th so i scribble over it... but.. is it really. wait.. which one did she say?
Its alright! I say to myself. she emphasized that i would get an email with all that info! I only wrote just in case. So i decide to wait.

Well. Its now a week till my job starts and i have not got a single email still and im very worried. I dont want my first impression being me showing up on the wrong day.

Now i got an phone number that lookes like to be a work number from the company but not the offical number and what lookes like the work number of an woman that im only 80% sure is who i think she is but possibly not. Im also not sure if this number would be derectly to her work phone or it would be like my moms job and it would go to somebody that has to transfer it to the right person. And im doupting myself and thinking that of it is like that then im not even sure if id be calling the person that i was planning this with!
I then have an email from when i was INVITED to the interview that was NOT sent by the interviewer but an email nonetheless.

My mom thinks i should try to send a polite email to the one that i have (with the other emails attatched) and explain the situation or i can ask if i could have the interviewers email and try my luck with her.

What should i do? I fucked up i know that but idk what im doing. Also what would i say? Any help with wording the email would be appreciated and also any help at all. and again english is not my first language so sorry for any errors in this",30Jul2019,1
224,"Hey, i made a couple of posts talking and asking about these stuffs. what really started those feeling were my old “friends” because they hurt me a lot.
I’m still scared of them coming to my house and doing some imaginable shit to me or my family i know they won’t, but i have this feeling of doom that what if they are? What if tomorrow or next week is my end? What if my own decisions killed me? What if it was all my fault? These thoughts are killing me more than my toxic friendship. I don’t know what’s real, everything seems fake! Everyone sounds the same, there’s no one out there that will save me. Therapy won’t save me, they are just going to say I probably have depression or some shit. I’m tired, i’m scared for my life. I just got a baby brother a couple months back, they said that they were going to shoot fireworks beside my house i know a real friend wouldn’t do that, but i can’t escape. I told them that i was working with my dad... i lied, they probably know they’re probably mad at me, thinking of a plan for my doom. 
School isn’t the same either...
I’ve been getting shitty grades on my tests,
So what’s really the point of moving forward, 
Yeah there’s more to life than this,
But I don’t even know if i’m going to see the future
I don’t know if im going to die by my own “friends”.
They all said it’s a joke I don’t believe them. 
If they come to me i can’t kill him, his family is from the mafia? 
I can’t think,
I stopped talking to people,
Every message that i get i think it’s them,
Yeah, i could be a pussy and not hang out with them
But, its because i’m scared
I’m scared of something happening,
I’m scared of them,
I’m scared of my future,
Can’t make friends i destroyed all my friendships.
I am scared of everything, 
I think that everything is about superstitions, 
I’m scared of god, i’m scared of him punishing me for everything. 
Everyone gets mad at me because i don’t know.
I’m always the bad friend, they were my last friends
I believed in them, but now i’m scared! 
I never kissed, i never had a gf. 
I don’t know what my future is going to be.
I love my family, I don’t want this anymore.
I wish life was a dream.
Why are people fake!? 
Why don’t you leave me alone!? 
Why can’t i be forgotten!? 
Why me? 
Why this suffering? 
I can’t think anymore.",30Jul2019,1
225,"I took a side gig at a bakery a while back, and I did enjoy it but mostly now I'm washing dishes. The money has been nice, but it's not altogether necessary. I took this job for fun.

Then on July 2nd my friend suddenly lost his life in a motorcycle accident.

I have been trying to process and give myself time before making big decisions, but on Saturday I put in my two weeks notice at the bakery because I felt frustrated at not working in the position they hired me for, which was learning to decorate cakes.

Now I wonder if I jumped the gun. But I also feel overwhelmed and like my world is upside down, and I'm so sick of washing dishes evenings and weekends and mopping, it's not what I signed up for.

I don't know if maybe they'd let me take a leave of absence, cuz I do feel overwhelmed and like I need more time to process, as well as time with friends and family. Cuz it can all be over so fast. Life seems too short to work two jobs.

On the other hand I know they're really hurting for help at the bakery and I feel terrible for quitting, even if I'm just trying to do what's best for me. I feel like I let them down. I've only worked there for like 3 months, after all, and it's under new management and everything.

I want to do the right thing without sacrificing mental health and physical wellbeing. I already cut back on hours cuz I was getting sick more often with all the hours I was working.

Problem is I am having trouble making logical decisions because everything feels all topsy turvy. My world has been turned on its head. I just don't know what to do and I want some objective perspectives.",30Jul2019,0

I just don’t want to completely “waste” my 20s doing nothing but studying while not making any money. It’ll probably take until my 40s to make the higher paying career worthwhile financially. 

My gut instinct was to do the higher paying career starting later but my parents want me to do the career that starts sooner. 

I also want to consider lifestyle, not just the work and pay. By lifestyle I want to deliberately turn this post a bit more vulgar for the sake of honesty.

229,"I want to drop out of university (about half way through at a top 15 in the states) and start day trading with money from a bartending job. I can't do both because university is eating up my money, meaning no money left to trade with.

**Topics of Consideration:**

**School:** I dislike school and have a shitty GPA (2.8, can't retake classes due to financial strain) so I don't really feel motivated pursuing that. My major (pretty locked in at this point) generally requires grad school and I have poor chances of getting in to one.

**Trading:** I have been very successful trading over the past 6 weeks (after about 6 months of on and off study) with about 18 profitable and 2 unprofitable trades ON PAPER, making about 7% return. This is spending only about 45-60 minutes a day on this. I really enjoy this and have been spending a fraction of the time on it that I would were I to have enough money to trade for real.

**Other:** School is a huge financial burden (I am living off family member's money). Due to some mental health circumstances requiring me to take a leave from school early on, my GPA is shit and I won't get into the grad schools that I want. I may also be able to receive the money which otherwise would have gone to paying for my education to pursue trading, which would give me great starting capital.

I have a few dreams, and right now the most relevant is financial independence. I'm tired of being a financial burden on my family, and after overcoming some mental health issues including a stay in a psych hospital, I have finally been in a position to pursue the thing that I wanted to go to school for: finance and trading. And to see myself be successful at it on paper, it's invigorating like almost nothing else.

**My plan:** So yeah. I could drop out and bartend, work night jobs while trading during the day and make probably $40-50k this year, of which I might invest about $20,000 into trading. **Based on my major and GPA, this is probably about as much as I'd make after graduation anyway.** At my current rate of return it would take just over a year to double an investment, so if I can continue perfecting my trading strategies and investing money from work, it might take about 2.5 years to pocket $100k of profits.

I've already paid for this next quarter of school, so I will continue to test my trading ability, and if it flops or becomes less consistent, well I'll have my answer.

SO, r/advice, do I drop out of school to pursue this dream? Or is this a delusion?",30Jul2019,3

By making her wear pull ups 

Here is the entire rule if she wets the pull up at night
She has to wear the pull up all day And she wets during the day it's extended to the week.

Anastasia tried to get out of pyschical excerise class but couldn't get a private moment with the teacher and was embarrassed since it's male member of staff. 


So after changing a member of class humiliated her by pulling down her shorts.

She was so embarrassed  she took her things and ran out of school.

She didn't run home though she got on train from Manchester to my home in Edinburgh.

238,"First, I would like to say I'm going to therapy, I've done great progress and I feel like this vicious cycle thing that's going on is me realizing what's going on and facing the biggest monster I've had to face emotionally. This is the reason I started going to therapy. 

So I'm a guy, 25 years old, one of my biggest fears is ending up alone or not ever having sex. I haven't been with a woman or ever had sex. I'm also not very happy with social situation, I know people, I have close friends, but I would like to go out more. My closest friends don't really go out that much, so they can't help me there. Since that is how things are I have been engaging in my interests, going out by myself to activities and clubs that interest me. Here's the part that in which the vicious cycle comes in. 

So I go out, I meet new people, before it used to be a hassle to even talk to them, now I'm not sure, I haven't done this in a while, but I'm pretty sure socializing will not be difficult anymore. I practically talk to anyone these days. It's when I start thinking about what's going to happen, whether I'm going to find any friends, whether I'll meet a woman or not, and so I end up doing nothing, or I end up being too afraid of even trying, or I sign myself up to go to the event but then end up not going.

239,"Fire sprinklers all throughout apartment, but I'm limiting discussion to the kitchen because that's where the stuff that makes heat is.

From what I can tell, the glass is filled with red liquid and is a thinner tube.  This would suggest a trip temperature of 155F, and it is the quick response type.

The sprinkler is located directly over the sink.  The counters are 3' high, and the ceiling is 8-1/2' high.  How concerned do I need to be about pouring hot water (from say cooking pasta) into the sink, with the steam rising up towards the ceiling?  For sake of argument, we'll assume ""normal"" amounts of water, which I guess would mean a maximum of 8 quarts.  Typical pack of pasta says to use 4 quarts, so 8 is on the high side of what I would probably ever do.

Also, how far away do I need to put toaster, toaster oven, etc?  155F isn't really *that* hot compared to boiling water or the temperature of most sorts of cooking.  It all has to do with how quickly the temperature dissipates as it rises towards the ceiling.

Rationally, I know the chance of setting it off this way must be almost non-existent.  They would be having false alarms all the time otherwise.  A neighbor has said that the building of 100 units has only had 2 fire alarms in the last 2 years, and at least one of them was from *mechanical* damage to a sprinkler head.

(still married to the 3rd) But...I want them to get a divorce. Well - not all of me does but...part of me does. My current dad has not always done the right things and it currently possibly cheating on my mom. She says that she doesn want a divorce - so I'm not going to ask her to get one. Now, I live in NC but if they divorced there would be a chance of us moving back to my home state of UT. We would try to stay here but...there is still a chance. 

I'm with an amazing guy right now and we love eachother very much - Which is one of the other few reasons I don't want to move. Sometimes I just feel like...I've never really had a dad. I've never really had a family. Me and my sibling fight all the time, my parents fight all the time I mean...it hurts. I have taught myself to bury all my feeling, which is y posting this is weird for me. To most people I'm just a super goofy person who wants to have a good time. But deep down I'm so empty. I feel almost nothing. Sometimes I think it's easier to just die - even tho I could never kill myself. 

It's really hard for me to even cry bc of how much I have buried my emotions. I want to cry but sometimes I just can't. The only person I can talk to is my bf and just a little bit ago he was crying over the fact that I could possibly move.

If there was a 80 hours job I would do it. 6 months after I graduated highschool I was working at Chiptole, I decided this isn’t what I want to do, I applied for orientation at this private school and go into unit clerk, the lady asked me what my interests were and she recommended I try a digital marketing course. Mind you I enjoy business and I hated school so this was a quick pass to getting a diploma and not stressing about school ever again. I did the course, I wanted to drop out so many times because it was so dumb and I hated it. While attending school 8-12:00, I worked 1-9:30 3 days a week and 8 hours on the weekends.

My friend picked psychology intermediate in 6th form. She was really interested it at first, but it quickly became unbearable for her. In her second year she still continued with it and even joined the school's psychology group. By the end of that year she completely loathed it and failed in it. And if I wanted to talk about general psychology stuff she didn't want to hear about it and said she remembers literally nothing (after her exam), not even the OCEAN acronym or Pavlov's dog.

Seeing her go from really enthusiastic and wanting to become a psychologist to never wanting to think about anything related to psychology really shocked me and scared me. But besides that, I'm afraid that I'm too brutally honest and blunt to be a psychologist, as people often tell me that and that I'm unintentionally rude.

As I said I have a 19k debt for my college studies and must pay monthly for it. Right now I pay little less than 360usd a month. Every year it increases in about 65usd. And If i don't pay on time, the debt increases in a crazy amount: 0.14% of the total for not paying on time and 8% increase per year... not paying is not an option. 

Would I have a comfortable life earning 50k yearly while paying my debt? While I get that some states are more expensive than others, I have no clue whatsoever on how expensive in general life is. 

I'm afraid to accept without realizing that maybe I won't live comfortably as I do now and I absolutely do not want to come home asking my parents for help to be able to sustain my life in the US.",30Jul2019,1
257,"I am a 25m and I just got back from a vacation in Hawaii with my family. The vacation was truly amazing in every way and being there for my first time it was beautiful.

Now by all means I understand that there are significantly worse things that could be happening. However the question still remains, why do I feel completely lost all of a sudden? I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time but I’ve found my own personal ways to cope in a healthy way. It has not reared its ugly head for a while now. I can’t help but think there’s much more to this situation though as if something’s missing. I could just be running blind in the dark for something that doesn’t even exist. But here I am in the dark wondering where I went wrong in a life that’s only gotten better over time.

I'm usually a rock and tough when it comes to emotions. I can miss social and emotional cues easily,but my feelings don't get hurt easily it takes a lot to hurt me. The thing is now that I started dating I found myself to be overly sensitive. Usually it's to anything he says that I don't like and, I find myself getting upset and crying. Of course I don't do this in front of him,I go hide and do it. We always seem to end up talking it out when he senses I'm upset. That's something I like about him and,it may take him a bit but he can figure out that I'm upset and we talk it out. So we always end up good again,but it's just the silliest things that set me off. I'm usually hard as nails and have thick skin,but when it comes to him I'm just a mess at everything he says. He's not saying anything mean or wrong,I guess I'm just taking it the wrong way.Like he couldn't understand why I don't like dresses. I just don't know what is wrong with me when it comes to him. It can be a simple no from him that sets me off crying. If I ask to hang out and it's a no,but he has a good reason for the no which I can't fault him for it sets me off. I don't want to be needy or clingy,so we don't go out often. I see him everyday at work since he's near by and we text almost everyday. I try my best to give him space and, that made him insecure in thinking I didn't like being around him. But I don't want to come off as clingy and I get all emotional about him. This is all new because I'm not used to expressing these emotions. Stuff that usually doesn't bother me does with him and,I can't figure out why I get all weepy about it.",30Jul2019,2

I’m new to this feed so I apologize if I screw up.

So I basically just wanted to ask in all seriousness. This fall, I will be an freshman pursuing my bachelor’s degree. I’ll be attending an out of state university, whose tuition comes out to approx $30K per year. My brother is also starting his PharmD this fall. My parents will be both paying for our tuitions (more mine than my brother’s). They’ll be taking student loans for both of us. But recently there’s been a lot of stress around the house and I’m guessing it’s because of the financial situation. My mom works as a person in charge at a fast food and she gets tired easily (50 years old). My dad is fine. Is there anything I can do to help my mom or parents in general? My parents don’t want me to take a job this first year because they want me to get good grades first.

265,"My friend passed away last week and will his funeral is this week. This is the first time someone close to me has passed away. 
My question is it acceptable to write like a letter or note and place it in the casket with him? 

Him and I met when I moved back to my hometown 4 years ago, him and his few friends and I were the only gay people in our small Midwest town so we got really close. We had our ups and downs, but ended up going our separate ways on good terms once we both moved. He moved to Chicago to pursue his dreams and I moved a town over for better opportunities. He was 25 and taken way too young. 
What I want to say in the letter is something like;

 I’m sorry for not keeping up with the friendship more than I could have and that I love him dearly and will always treasure our friendship. I’m so sorry that he was taken so young and robbed from this life. I’m proud of him and will always be and I will think of him often whenever I hear songs that he used to sing with me. I pray that he is sitting in blessed repose with light always shining on him. 

I have done as much as I can to try and help his closer friends, who are also my friends too, grieve and I’ve given his mother some money directly for funeral costs.

I'm an incredibly light sleeper and don't sleep well to begin with. I was in a half sleep state and woke up to him touching my arms. Okay - weird, but not super alarmed at this point. I readjust and sniffle, hoping to 'scare' him and we'll both go to sleep. MAYBE 80 seconds later he starts with the arms again and gets closer to my boob. I readjust again..this time he even gets his hand under the blanket (I had my own) and lifts my shirt up maybe an inch. OK...readjust again. This time my back is to him and he begins feeling my butt. Light at first...but he gets braver and squeezes a couple times. Luckily my diabetes came to rescue and my low blood sugar alarm went off, so I'm in the living room of our cabins and will probably be sleeping in a chair for the rest of vacation. 

I really don't want to lose the trust of my brother, we've just recently gotten really close and don't fight as often, so I don't really want to go to my parents about this.

We paid for all 7 nights. We check in and these 2 clueless workers insist we need to pay $500 more because we didn’t pay for random fees. We called the booking site and they said that was some hardcore BS and they were lying. Over 2 hours of arguing later, in which the workers called the travel agent a dumbass, they said we now suddenly owe $200 more. We had to contact the agent again and she fought for us and finally the 2 workers realized they were wrong and charged us the amount we owed originally, $500 less than what they wanted us to pay. They didn’t even apologize. 

Fast forward a few hours later (now). Im laying in bed scratching my skin like a boy in puberty, legs, arms, and intimate parts itchy. I have bumps on my legs. The shower had hair and a weird black spot. Toilet paper on the floor. Hair under my pillow. Stains on my bed covering. One lamp won’t turn on. Construction happening in the building and half the property is out of bounds.

We went back to his place after and watched some movies, made out, and that’s it. I  can tell when a date goes poorly and i swear It went really well. When i left he said he definitely wanted to do it again.

We planned for drinks after work on Friday, but he texted me after his shift he was exhausted and couldn’t make it (he worked a double, i get it). So i assumes this might be a hit he wasn’t interested so i said no hard feelings and do you want to reschedule (if he wasn’t into me now was the time to say he didn’t want too) and he said absolutely he did and i asked when he was available and he never responded. 

I took that as “oh you’re not interested” and was a little disappointed but moved past it. I see him at work Sunday and he is making jokes and flirting with me the entire shift, still never texted me back though. 

So I’m just confused, i would love to go out with him again, i don’t know what’s going on i guess cause he appeared to be really into me and we had a lot in common.

277,"I’m sorry this is so long, I’m very confused. 

I (21f) have been friends with this guy (21) for years. We usually hangout and smoke. 
This past summer he’s invited me over to hangout more, including time with his own group of guy friends. 

It’s not always a group. Sometimes it’s just us. When it’s just us I feel tension, like sexual in a way but not at the same time. We just joke around and talk about whatever. He doesn’t flirt with me. I don’t flirt with him. 

He asked me to hangout last night, I dodged. Again tonight, but I was honest and said I wasn’t feeling too hot. We talked, eventually he said well hey imma eat but after I’m coming to get you. He came and got me and we hung out and had a good time. 

Its weird, I just notice small stuff. He’s really comfortable around me and is somewhat sweet to me. He changes his tone with me, and he does fill that whole “guardian” spot when I’m with him. I recently got drunk drunk for the first time with him and his friends. He stuck by me the whole night, including helping me through monopoly. Telling me what moves to make. At the end of the night I was gone. Everyone left and it was us. I was on the floor just laying there. He moved me to his bed eventually and played a game on his computer while I rested. I fell asleep and he left me there, which was sweet. Even if he didn’t have much of a choice. 

Sometimes I feel like he looks at me in a way. When we smoke outside sometimes we will be across from one another in the group and he will just look at me in a weird way. 

I remember a couple weeks ago kinda saying a comment about my hair getting worse and he said something like “just put it down it’ll look fine” which was... weird for him if that makes sense? 

In the past couple of months I’ve dealt with guys that weren’t great for me. I came to him a couple times asking for advice because he is my closest male friend and is straight forward. He’s been super upfront with me about his dislike in them.

Also, recently while going to pick up we ran into an issue. It ended up taking us 45 minutes longer than expected to reach the guy. It was my fault. I was freaking out because I felt rude, the dealer was getting angry, and he could tell I was freaking. He took over my phone and started talking to the guy. He eventually said something along the lines of “if he said anything to you I’d say something” because the guy was being kinda snippy towards me. It’s just small stuff. 

However, it’s weird because it’s little things I notice that don’t seem significant but the tone that goes with them changes. It feels like the tone changes from light then it gets a little deeper. I feel like he takes care of me. However, all of it could just be him being a friend. Any advice? I know this is long, thank you for your time!",30Jul2019,1

It logically makese more sense to stay at home and save for a house given that I make not a lot of money and my work is super close, but I can't stand it. So I have a large family. My parents have a 5 bed/4bath house. But there are 7 of us in total. Theres my parents, my older brother (29), two younger brothers (21) (11), and my younger sister (12). I currently share a room with my older brother and its been very hard on me. Lets just say he always complains about me being a bad roommate and he himself is not very considerate. I'm always suck cleaning our room and restroom. Our schedules don't really match up so I always have to be considered and stop using my computer or make any type of noise past 10 PM since he gets up super early for work. He complains if I even use my phone past 10 PM because the ""backlight is too bright."" He does nothing around the house meanwhile I help out my parents as much as I can when I'm available. Sorry, this is me venting a bit, but I'm really tired of it. He snores very loud so its kinda hard for me to get sleep. Ive never complained about him or asked him to do anything because thats the kind of person I am. Honestly I'm more tired of him complaing about me and having to be considerate to someone I don't particularly like and that's never considerate towards me.

They would rather me save for a house than move out. Their solution is to just divide the room with drywall, but I don't want them to have to alter their space just for me, nor do I think it will solve the problem. I know I don't make a lot of money.

280,"AS the title says, I think its a possibility that craziness is taking over him or its just some epithetical wisdom that hes realizing. My family structure has been up and down for most my life. My mother is a schizophrenic, shes been in and out of the ward every 4 years or so, she'd have a psychotic episode. My parents have been married for around 25 years and my dad has supported her with her behaviour throughout regardless. Hes a software engineer and maintains that job somehow through a good educational background. Idk whats going on now. when i was 18, my parents split, living in different homes. Ive been living with my dad and brother for the past 6 years, im 24 now. My dad used to always fight with my mom and had a cold natured personality. Hes made us cry in the past, both me and my brother when we were younger and never felt remorse for it but always continues to boast his ego and prove hes right when he can be tremendously hurtful to people and those around him. My mom is a sweet person and had it not been for my dads quarelling I feel that she would be a lot more mentally healthier. through the past 3 years, his income had been falling and had to resort to a secondary source and started an ebay business which has been doing successful and my family is happy for that. Unfortunately he stays at home most of the time, never goes out to meet friends or socialize with people. Just prefers to live like a hermit, taking care of the business and occasionally answering work emails. Now, ill cut to the chase... Recently hes become more spiritual, im assuming because of controlling his anger and negativity and dealing with my moms stress, at first we were happy that hes trying to improve his mentality but heres where it goes sideways...With the spirituality, hes become obsessed with certain psychic and pagan beliefs. He purchases scriptures off a website called creepy hollows which is supposed to connect you with angels, demons, ghouls, djinns, etc... and he strongly believes and tells to his close family and others that they should have an angel and really try summoning them and speaking with them. He also believes he can talk to Greek gods such as Zeus and hercules and that they are helping him make moral decisions. Like heres the split between crazy and reality. 1) he still has a job and pays bills 2) he still function normally, can cook/drive/ bathe/ etc.. but only the most essential. Like i mentioned earlier, he doesnt have much a social life or goes out of the house for that matter. He believes things like Islam is a demonic religion and that muslims pray to the wrong god and doesnt want to be friendly to them. Long story rejected my girlfriend who has muslim parents but isnt really a practicing muslim just because of her parents faith nearly wanted to kick me out of the house when i spoke against him because shes really a nice girl despite her upbringing. but he believes that the angels guide him and tries to superstitiously prove his points about theories of reality like the material world doesnt exist and that the universe is just an illusion like stated in the movie matrix. He loves that movie and states all the philosophical aspects of it. At this point were pretty concerned of him. He says one day he will be a sage in the mountains, not sure if that will happen or if hes just gonna go crazy like my mom. He says hes very rational about his beliefs regardless of what others believe.But noones gonna agree merely that statements like ""Islam is a demonic religion"" He says"" normal people will never understand reality"" that the world is just a simulation. Hes 56 years old and i get that people get thoughts like this once in a while but he makes it his life and its getting very annoying especially when he tells us we should believe in angels and fairies too. Like I for one am too young to delve into this crap even though it can be real or not. Im young, want to focus on getting my degree, be in a relationship, have a little fun and live normally. My friends tell me that both my parents have some mental dysfunctioning and its probably a good idea that i go to a therapist and get checked up too. He claims that he actually does some research but otherwise his knowledge of these things come from his own meditation and prayers which enhances his thinking ability. I dont know if me, my brother and my girlfriend should seek out therapy for him or this is normal and should let it be. He says whatevers happening to him is written in his destiny.

Basically, I’ve been meeting with my therapist for a few years now for my depression and anxiety, and overall life stuff, and I trust her and love her a lot. But... talking about my body and my weight is something we haven’t touched on much because it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I’ve told her a few basic things but we usually have other stuff to focus on and I keep the conversation away as much as possible.

It’s not a secret that I’m overweight, or that I’ve been steadily gaining over the years, and I want to be healthier but because of my lack of motivation due to depression among other issues I have trouble sticking to anything. But thats not exactly the subject of this post.

I feel as if I have BED (binge eating disorder). I’ve thought this for really long time now actually, I fit most if not all of the criteria. Not a fan of self diagnosing though.

But I’m absolutely terrified to tell anyone, let alone my therapist. 

I’m already fat, if I say to anyone my suspicions I _know_ it’s going to come off like I’m making excuses for “my poor life choices”. And if I end up telling her and actually not having it I’d be even more mortified.

I’m currently going to school for animation, but I don’t think it’s the career for me (however I still like animation and if I could incorporate it into whatever I do that’d be nice).

I have so many things that I I’d like to do. For instance I wanna be a screenwriter, but I just don’t think I’m a good enough. I know that I really like it. I write scripts in my free time, but I don’t feel like I’m ever gonna be good enough to do it as a career. I understand learning skills takes time and hard work, and I’m trying, but I feel like I can see a trajectory for how good I’m gonna get. I see my weaknesses and I don’t feel like I’m gonna ever be good in those areas. There’s people better than me so what’s the point anyways? I’ll never make something that’ll blow people away and truly resonate. At best I feel like I can make somewhat shallow entertainment that isn’t even that entertaining.

I also wanna try stand-up comedy but I don’t feel like I’m funny enough. I’ve been called funny by friends and a few strangers before, but never hilarious. I’ve also never written a joke that’s anything above average. And I have horrible social anxiety, how the hell would I get on stage? I’ll never be a great comedian (or potentially even a good one) so what’s the point?

Improv interests me, but I took a class and was horrible at it. Didn’t even improve. I’m too in my head, I’m a bad listener and I don’t think fast enough. I might return to this as a hobby to improve those specific skill sets, but I don’t think it’s a potential career.

I really like making home brew dnd games and my friends usually enjoy them, so I considered maybe I should start a dnd podcast. I can write the stories, but I’m just not a great oral storyteller and I’m not great at improv like I said. And there’s so many better dnd podcast so what’s the point?

Maybe a regular podcast, but I’m not an interesting conversationalist like at all. Again what’s the point?

Maybe YouTube videos? I like the idea of having creative control over my content? Or animated short films?

I just like the process of coming up with ideas and fleshing them out into stories and projects. My ultimate dream is to make some project that can really resonate with people and be recognized as something special, but there’s too many things I enjoy to choose a path and I might end up doing nothing.

Also I can’t help feel jealous of the professionals in all of these fields that I look up to. I feel like I’ll never be as good as them and I imagine them looking down on my work constantly when I make things. I feel like I don’t have anything unique to share, so what’s the point? I feel like I’m not creative enough, or funny enough, or good enough at any of the skills needed for these jobs. I could still stick to animation, but I don’t think I’d be happy.

I understand that even expecting to achieve any of these things is very optimistic, but I’d like to shoot towards them and hopefully one day I’ll get there, I just don’t know where to shoot or how. I want a job with creative control and I want to be able to share it with the world for feedback. Preferably quick feedback. I go nuts and lose motivation without sharing what I’m doing to an audience. Any ideas of what job would be perfect for this? How I should set out to figure it out? Opinions?

Sorry if that was a bit all over the place, it’s late and I have a lot on my mind. Thanks for getting this far though.",30Jul2019,1

My current dad has not always done the right things and it currently possibly cheating on my mom. She says that she doesn want a divorce - so I'm not going to ask her to get one. Now, I live in NC but if they divorced there would be a chance of us moving back to my home state of UT. We would try to stay here but...there is still a chance. I'm with an amazing guy right now and we love eachother very much - Which is one of the other few reasons I don't want to move.

I feel almost nothing. Sometimes I think it's easier to just die - even tho I could never kill myself. It's really hard for me to even cry bc of how much I have buried my emotions. I want to cry but sometimes I just can't. The only person I can talk to is my bf and just a little bit ago he was crying over the fact that I could possibly move.

292,"I was raised in a culture, have lived my entire life in a city and environment where it was an obsession to receive As in school. Where it was constant all-nighters to finish homework and extracurricular piled on top of the next. Where it was and still is considered a disgrace to attend a college that wasn’t a top 20 school in the nation. It became something that I got accustomed to - after all, there wasn’t another mentality for me to choose - but with less than two months before college starts, I’m suddenly starting to succumb to the voices in my head repeating these ideals. 

Maybe it’s because I see so many people on social media attending those exact schools that I’ve been brainwashed to believe I needed to attend, or maybe it’s more of the dull ache of disappointment that I feel in not being able to fulfill ambitions I have. Whatever the case, I’m starting to lose my excitement and interest for the college I’m attending, and I’m ashamed to admit it.

Now, I see him as mature. He can handle himself in pressing situations and can handle his grades and obligations. Obviously im biased, but his mother is ridiculous with the rules she has implemented with everything including driving.

And by ridiculous, I mean that she yelled at him in Macys once for touching a VR headset.

She said straight to my face the other day that he wouldn't be allowed to drive anyone outside of the family during his first year because thats the law — which is bullshit because a few years ago, my friend was 17 and I was 15 and she would take me out to places, and her mom is strict and attentive as well so I know thats not the law. I get that shes worried but i feel that shes being utterly ridiculous. Her justification is that his cousin had to go through the same rule but she IS controlling as a parent ( I won't get into that though. )

297,"TLDR: As his closest friend, will telling him that I think he’s delusional send him spiraling?

In case you’re wondering what leads me to believe he’s delusional, buckle up:  
He believes that he gets “thrown around his timeline” whenever he gets high and he ‘knows’ he has already experienced these years of his life the last time he got high. I’m not talking about “yo I got so high last night it felt like an out of body experience”, I mean he legitimately believes his past selves need to awaken in order for present him to return to normal.  
He’s dealing with intense symptoms like derealization, flashbacks, deja vus, etc. and he believes they’re all a consequence of him altering his timeline too many times when he was in that state of consciousness. (I’ve discussed how those symptoms are in line with legitimate mental illnesses which he can take care of. He says he’s tried to believe that but can’t.)

We used to have philosophical and spiritual discussions which is why I think he’s so open with me and which is why it’s been so hard for me to draw the line. But his way of thinking has become delusional and no reasoning or conversations help, they only leave me frustrated and him upset with me for not understanding. His symptoms have gotten worse and I can’t go on sacrificing things just because I know friendships are healthy for him. I’m his closest friend, do I tell him that I believe he’s delusional and possibly send him spiraling or do I gently distance myself?",30Jul2019,1

My son is noticing it too and is always asking “why I’m so mad at him”, but I’m not mad at him. It’s just my tone lately. (I do apologize to him, he’s 11 and a pretty great kid).

301,"Hello,

So I (F25) work in a very small organisation (mental health) there's less than 20 of us. One woman in particular is very difficult to deal with. She has 2 jobs, in one she is a youth worker.

She is probably in her 50's.

So some backstory, recently the staff had to be warned about talking about her as she had frustrated and annoyed so many people that they were all talking about it. I will admit that it got out of hand- I do not like the woman and I spent the entire conversation with other staff encouraging them to talk to their managers about it (we only have 2) and they were adamant they couldn't do that and it did get bitchy. I told the managers about this, apologiesed for my part in the conversation as I felt it for out of hand by some but told them that people had valid concerns and issues with her. 

The managers banned people talking about other members of staff. The main problem is they DO NOT listen to us about the complaints against her. One member who was the centre of the bitchiness and some very valid concerns about her ranging from issues to her work to her conduct (she is very rude, opinionated and often will get the whole office involved in something shes trying to do. Shes loud, she is unprofessional, unorganized and frankly, has no idea what she's doing.) After my encouragement  told the managers, they defended this woman all the way - came up with excuses for her and didn't listen to the complaints. I was shocked and I complained. In the end a apology email was sent that said they did realise her concerns but that they weren't major. 

Since then we have all been warned against speaking about her in that way and people have been noticibly nicer to her, presumably because any 'bitchiness' is now a disciplinary.

Personally she has been very rude to me and makes me being there awful. Im already anxious, and knowing I have to go there and see her at work makes me feel sick. 

I have complained about her rudeness and it's been met with ""oh, she doesn't mean that"" to ""well, you could be nicer to her"". This woman is not stupid, she knows when to act up when the managers aren't there. She's a suck up and is always constantly trying to get the managers attention, often interrupting conversations or claiming she can do something that is someone else's job.

For me, the hardest part is that she lies about what I have done and said. For example, yesterday she had to support someone that I had directed to her, she came back up after supporting them and exclaimed to the whole office ""mushybutts dumped this on me!"" (Not has weird when she said my actual name). It's her job!!!! Then later, she printed off an email that had been sent to her and accidently had email address of stakeholders for a different organisation. I said she couldn't do that, you can't print off emails! (She does this a lot, if she wants to show people an email she will print it off!!) We've been told not to do that, GDPR and all. Plus, if you want to get their emails there's an easier way to do that but before u could say that, He had shouted me down in front of the whole office. 

In the past she has called everyone under 30 entitled. She's the youth worker and said that to me, I'm 25. (My manager explained that she just says things she doesn't mean sometimes.)

She has claimed I have never done things when I have had conversations with her and she's told me she doesn't want those things done. Or I've explained something to her, she's done it wrong and has blamed me not explaining it to her even though she said she knew.

She has been rude to me, she talks over me constantly. She argues with us all the time, over nothing and she cannot listen to other peoples views. 

She has insane views on drug (cannabis included) use where she things everyone who uses drugs will and deserves to get psychosis. Again, she works in mental health!!

I've talked to my manager about how I can't deal with this ladies rudeness and how her constant disrespect of me makes me feel so small and insignificant. All i got was that ""ohh, she would hate to think she's done that, maybe you could be nicer to her?""

I'm at the end of being able to deal with it. I hate going to work. The managers won't listen and I can't talk to any members of staff about it. There's lots of other things that I haven't included because this is already so long! But staff still have concerns, I know that but I can't ask them about it or tell them mine.

I've told my manager that she is different when managers aren't around and my manager said ""yes, I've seen that and it does make me cringe"" my manager and I are friends.  But she won't recognise that this lady is doing it on purpose, to me, that proves she is! My manager keeps thinking she is innocent in all of this and that she doesn't mean to upset anyone but I can see that she does!

I don't know what to do, I honestly can't be treated like that anymore because if I say anything I will be punished and yet she can say and do what she likes it seems. I also know that managers find me very difficult and there are lots of things I could have done better, I just feel like she gets off the hook whilst we all have to tread on egg shells.

She’s a workaholic, busy and her parents are strict but she is everything I’ve ever wanted in a girl. The only thing is the relationship part wasn’t that fulfilling. As I said I tried everything to make her feel loved but on her end, I got basically nothing. Up until yesterday that is. 

We were breaking up mutually and going on one last date. She planned everything (as I was too stupid to realize that she loved me too and threw that responsibility on her) and the date was perfect. Walking past the location of our first date, amazing restaurant playing the songs we listened to, deep heart to hearts about our relationship and what we want in life. And then she gave me everything that I wanted during the relationship all at once on the day we set to break up. Everything that I had given to her but she was too busy to do for me when we were dating.

So now I’m lost.

I love this girl, and she loves me but we’re not together. I took the initiative telling her to not talk to me for a week, and now I’m confused. Was that a good idea or not because I don’t know what I want or what’s good at this point. She’s gone on a trip for 2 weeks to the US and I don’t know what to do. We both agreed we should try being friends once she comes back from her trip and I’d like to try. But there’s so much I want to do and say, I don’t know if I can handle that.

You know, the only thing I ever wanted was to spend time with her and show her the world because she’s too busy to do it herself, and yesterday, she saw lightning bugs for the first time and I didn’t even smile. Like what is wrong with me. 

I need some advice, or something to help calm me down, cuz I don’t want that love to go away but I also don’t want to fuck it up and lose her forever. Someone please send some advice my way.

I know I’m 18 and I have so much life to live and there’s so many fish out in the sea (all that stuff people say to help a breakup) but am I stupid to think that this relationship could be more than some dumb teenager first love? I have no idea please help a young man out.

308,"So one of my closest friends recently started smoking cigarettes. We’ve been friends since elementary school and after high school I moved a few hundred miles away for college and as a result I only visit home maybe three times a year. He turns 20 this year and only recently has he been picking up some bad habits and making some choices that he probably wouldn’t have if I were around as often as before. I care about his wellbeing and future and have spoken to him about why he started and my thoughts on it. Another one of his friends (an ex-friend of mine) also picked it up at the same time. My point of view is that I can’t make them do anything but I don’t want to see it if he’s ever around me.

My friend’s parents dont know about this, and I assume the other friend’s parents dont either. So my question is, do you think I have a place in calling up his mom to tell her what’s going on? Or should I just let it be and have them find out on their own eventually? If I call up my friend’s mom, do I have a place in mentioning the other friend is also smoking?

For past 6 years or so, I've been involved with a man 35 years older than me. He is was my grandma and sisters boss at one point. I came out to him when I was 14, he was really supportive and told me how to tell people and how to handle the grief people would give me.

About 6 years ago, he messaged me on Grindr - needless to say he was quite keen to have a go with me (I was 22, in very good shape and he was quite tubby, bald and quite ugly but had a huge cock). I agreed to it but with a few rules and went round and did our thing. 

Next time we met, he introduced me to bondage. After the first time, I was hooked. He got darker and darker with each session. 

He filmed us a few times and sent the videos out to his mates who would often join him in the sessions. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago. He accidentally sent a video to his Facebook profile instead of to his mates. It was up for 4 hours. The video itself was of me tied with all my limbs splayed out and tied to each of a corner of the bed, a baseball bat handle shoved up my ass and me sucking off him and 2 of his mates, then me getting fucked and then me sucking beer from his ass.

Nobody knew that we were involved but now it's been seen by the whole world. I really enjoy our sessions with him and his mates but now my family have seen me for a ****

311,"Hi people of Reddit( No idea if this is the right Section/if not let me know so I change it).

Around 1Month ago I Bought a Samsung s10+ from a seller on Amazon.
(Sealed,suppose completely new)

Worked fine for the first 3 weeks and after that it started to have lag issue, tried to reset ecc. And nothing worked.

So I had to contact Amazon and ask them to contact the seller about it and after 2 weeks of sending emails the Seller replied to send the phone back and that it had 2 Years of guarantee.

Till here no problem,so I sent the Phone back with Royyal mail 2nd class and lost the receipt, made no big deal about it since I never had issue sending stuff back to Amazon.

4Days later I Contacted Amazon to ask about the phone and some Indian guy Initiated the A~Z Guarantee so basically the seller got pissed and told me that I had to speak to Amazon now since that option was on.

Now I asked after 1 weeks to Amazon Support about it and they told me they will write to the seller and they basically told him that I had no receipt and to proceed with the refund.

Now the Seller is saying he didn't get the Product back(Knows I have no receipt so I m fucked)

Amazon A~Z can't help me since I have no Proof that I sent the package back..

Royal mail said that they can't provide me with a receipt or anything to prove I sent the package from the post office.

So I lost 800$ for a f.... Receipt..

I'm going crazy over this So I made this post, does anyone know a way for me to fix this issue? Since I'm tired of calling/writing Amazon about this issue and getting transfered to th A~Z and getting denied by email. Please Help... Tried to Google this but nothing.

Thanks

312,"I need advice. I'm not sure on what - so I'll just tell u most of what is casing me trouble. I won't go into detail but, my mom has had 3 husbands. (still married to the 3rd) But...I want them to get a divorce. Well - not all of me does but...part of me does. My current dad has not always done the right things and it currently possibly cheating on my mom. She says that she doesn want a divorce - so I'm not going to ask her to get one. Now, I live in NC but if they divorced there would be a chance of us moving back to my home state of UT. We would try to stay here but...there is still a chance. I'm with an amazing guy right now and we love eachother very much - Which is one of the other few reasons I don't want to move.

Sometimes I just feel like...I've never really had a dad. I've never really had a family. Me and my sibling fight all the time, my parents fight all the time I mean...it hurts. I have taught myself to bury all my feeling, which is y posting this is weird for me. To most people I'm just a super goofy person who wants to have a good time. But deep down I'm so empty. I feel almost nothing. Sometimes I think it's easier to just die - even tho I could never kill myself. It's really hard for me to even cry bc of how much I have buried my emotions. I want to cry but sometimes I just can't. The only person I can talk to is my bf and just a little bit ago he was crying over the fact that I could possibly move. I can't see him at all, and he doesn't want my mom to help me sneak out to see him anymore. (my dad is the only one with the issue of my bf) I doubt we will move but lie I said earlier...part of me wants to.

Part of me wants to go back to UT, the place where I grew up, bc that is where so much of my family is but the other part of me wants to stay here with my bf. Rn I just feel so broken and I need someone's advice. Please. I feel like no one will read this bc I've made a few posts like this in the past and I only got a few responses. I know this is a lot - and even this isn't the full story. FAR from it. I have so many mental and emotional issues buried deep inside me and from time to time they come out. I just need some advice on...anything really. I understand if you guys don't really have any but...yeah. Thank you for listening and for anyone that can help.",30Jul2019,1

316,"Bruh. I am lost. Maybe you guys can help. I just found out that my ""Dad"" isn't really my father. My sister heard rumors and nagged me with evidence that I was another man's child since high school. I held out for 13 years not wanting or choosing not to believe her. But she finally hit me with some evidence that shook me. Showed me pictures of my supposed biological father in high school. *Jaw dropped*  
It was me..... with longer hair. Hell, even my newborn son looks just like him. So I paid for a DNA test and let my ""Dad"" know what was up. My sister and family members admitted that my Mother was ""extremely promiscuous"" throughout high school.  He admitted to having doubts about my paternity but let me know I was his son regardless of what the DNA test said. He and I were never close while I was growing up. Like...at all. But this has explained a lot of that. He was raising a son he didnt believe was his as best as he was able. 
I digress. 
So I pondered for weeks on broaching the subject with my Mom. My biggest reason for pushing forward was my son Atticus Finn. He died at three months of congenital cardiomyopathy. My soul was ripped out. Then we find that we're pregnant again with my second son Ezekiel. EVERY bit of the medical info I gave for my Dad's side was complete and utter bullshit. Then, while my son is literally lying on the hospital bed dying, she has the gall to tell me that the reason my son is dying is because I dont believe in God. KNOWING THAT MY DAD WAS NOT MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER. So I decided that, if nothing else, I need an accurate medical history for my biological father for my son. Even if that's the only contact I ever had with the man. So. My Mother has always been very narcissistic.  I knew if I told her without my stepdad present that she would hide it and make me out to be the bad guy. So I decided that telling them both was the best path. 
I sat her down with my stepdad and told her that I knew that ""Dad"" wasn't my biological father. She stuck with the ""That's impossible"" routine until I showed her the DNA test, the website for the diagnostics center that I used, and the reciept.  She got up and walked into the kitchen and came back a few minutes later with this stony look on her face. She was peeeehissed. The first words out of her mouth were, ""Well you just ended my marriage."" BRUH. THE FUCK.  The next words were, ""Ok. I'll tell you what I know.""
She then proceeds to tell me that while my ""Dad"" was away on a hunting trip that she went to a party where she accepted a drink from a ""friend"" and woke up the next morning on our front porch in her panties and t shirt. A couple of months later she figured out she was pregnant with me.  So now I'm apparently a rape baby. 
I know I am probably an asshole but I dont believe her. She is the head of her church and knows that if she is found out that her reputation will be tainted. And she can't have that. She'd rather violently throw me under the bus and claim rape to save face as opposed to admitting that she made a mistake. 
So it has been over three months since this has happened. My Mom and stepdad refuse to talk to me other than unavoidable pleasantries when I pay them rent and power. It hurts that they abandoned me but it pisses me off that they abandoned my kids. I am stepdad to three wonderful boys and three biological kids of my own. The steps have had a rocky family history. My parents stepped in to be the ""Grands"" and my boys LOVE them. Now they have nothing to do with any of us and my boys are heartbroken. 
SORRY THIS IS SO LONG. 
I don't know what to do. My putrid bitch of a sister has weaseled her way back into their good graces and I don't know how to handle it. I had a semi successful woodburning business and I haven't had the inspiration to do anything since this started. There are so many more subtle things that are part of the story but this is most of it. R/relationships won't let me post, r/rape keeps talking about how I should believe my Mom and I lack empathy, so I want to know if I am the asshole for wanting to know the truth of my paternity and thinking my Mother is a shit person.",30Jul2019,1
317,"I started going to a new school in the 9th grade, in like March, I made some friends real fast, and I even got a girlfriend.

And after like a few days I've noticed people were staring at me and giving me looks, and the guidance Counselor called me into his office. He told me that my ex girlfriend and her friends said I was touching then inappropriate and stalking them, I told him it wasn't true but of course he didn't believe me Fucking dick. I don't even know her friends and now she lies and tell them that I'm stalking her! I'm so pissed off, but I just left it alone, I sat with my other friends on the other side of the lunch, they believed me. After like a few weeks, my ex's friend came up to me and slapped me in the face and told me to stop stalking her, I didn't know what she was talking about, she would just take over me if I tried to talk, and she claims I comment inappropriate stuff on little girls, this is a High School btw. I went to the Principal's office, and guess what they suspended me for 2 days. I just stopped coming to school for a few days, I was started to be depressed, had some suicidal thoughts I guess, but I came to school, same thing over and over again, people staring at me and I didn't feel sadness I felt anger.

318,"Over the past month or so, I’ve been going through a really difficult time. I’ve been getting very sick and my recent visits with doctors have me very worried. I keep trying to deny that anything is wrong with me physically, but it’s becoming harder and harder to ignore.

In addition to that, my personal life is a disaster. I lost my ex boyfriend and closest friend in the world because he continued to do things that were seriously fucked up. Last summer, he left me for his ex, and eventually I forgave him. This summer, he did the same thing. When I said I didn’t feel comfortable with it, he cut me off and blocked me. Whatever. Eventually I made peace with it and moved on. I met a new guy who I am growing really close with. However, this guy is in the US on a work visa and has to leave next June. I know I’m going to end up devastated when he leaves. We have been hanging out a lot, and he wants to pursue a romantic relationship. For the most part, I want this too. However, I am very worried about my emotional well-being when he has to leave next summer. This guy has treated me better than any other person I’ve ever been with, so naturally I want to pursue it. But I am terrified of being hurt again. 

I know I’m ranting and that this may make no sense to anyone. I just want to be happy, but it seems like life keeps fucking me at every chance it gets.

321,"I know this sounds crazy but please be nice! I’m being genuine. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m very attractive. Not just his personal preference but he also believes I’m objectively ‘hot’. He has dated very good looking girls (Instagram models, strippers, runway models)  and he thinks I’m better looking than all of his exes. He actually broke up with one of these good looking exes to be exclusive with me. He thinks I could be a model. I have suffered low self-esteem for a while and when he makes claims like this it makes me incredibly angry. In my mind he’s either delusional or lying. I hate hearing it because I don’t want to buy into this fantasy of his. I would hate to have an misplaced inflated ego. 

Even if I get to where I want to be self-esteem wise I will never believe I’m supermodel material. I rarely get approached by men, but my boyfriend claims it’s because I’m too intimidating. He says he feels uncomfortable being out in public with me because I receive so much attention. I really don’t notice this at all. He thinks it’s because I’m so used it. He always thinks men are flirting with me, when I believe they’re just being friendly. (This is the only point he may have in my opinion because I’m hopelessly oblivious to romantic advances) He also claims several of his friends have mentioned they are attracted to me. He points out that I don’t have many female friends and women are either very eager to be my friend or act insecure/crazy. I just assumed I attract crazy people. Lastly, the thing that causes me the most internal strife is my male friends. I always thought I had a lot of guy friends because I’m funny and have a great personality. My boyfriend says the reason is that most of them want to sleep with me. 

I wasn’t popular in high school and my friends never post any pictures I’m in. I always assumed it’s because I ruined the photo. I don’t post a lot of pictures on social media but I never get the thousand of likes other girls get. Random guys don’t slide into my DM either. 


He’s generally a well-adjusted (slightly paranoid) person. What he’s saying does make some sense. But is it possible he just wants to believe this narrative and is pushing it? I also think my personality could be clouding his judgement. Should I believe him? I’ve never been bombarded with compliments all the time and it’s honestly messing with my head and self-image. 

I know I should probably put a picture but I really don’t want my face attached to this post.",30Jul2019,1
322,"I  (22) am considering breaking up with my boyfriend (22). For some  context, we've been dating for almost 1.5 years now. Did long distance  for about a 8 months, which is where I'm guessing the problems started.

There  has been an ongoing argument for almost 2 -3 months now wherein I've  constantly mentioned that I don't feel that we spend enough time  together. It's come to a point where he also gets annoyed every time I  bring it up. When he's not in the country, work anyway keeps us busy. Every 2 months, he's able to visit for a  week. Here's where the issue is:

I  feel it's natural for me to expect us to try and meet everyday whenever  he is here unless it's obviously difficult for whatever reason. I  generally end up feeling like he doesn't want the same, since he doesn't  really take as much effort in trying to plan with me, it doesn't bother  him as much if we don't see each other for a couple of days (We live  less than 2 miles away from each other). But, we do have a great time  with each other whenever we do meet. And I know we still have feelings  for each other.

We've discussed  this multiple times and agreed on the fact that the intensity is lesser  from his end to want to meet or talk as much. I'm just having a really  hard time processing if this normal. Of course, I don't expect us to  spend copious amounts of time with each other on a daily basis, but I  still feel like at least the other person should put in efforts for it?  For instance, he's now back in the country for a couple of months. It's been two  weeks since he arrived. We started traveling to and fro to work together since our work places were on the same route and that week was great.  Last week, he didn't go to work since he felt a little under the weather so naturally we didn't meet, but neither do we then talk over call / text. By mid week he felt better, so I even offered multiple times to come see him so that he wouldn't need to travel at all. It finally resulted in an argument and then we finally ended up meeting the next day. 

I  know this probably sounds really trivial or stupid. But I wonder does  it have to be so hard? I've spoken to him about this countless times.  Yesterday he mentioned that this is actually normal and that my  expectations are a little high to meet. I get that it's normal to not talk / meet every day but if it's doable then I feel like both the individuals should at least try? I feel so confused and maybe a little needy, so I'm not really sure how to process this. 

I'd  appreciate honest feedback even if I'm in the wrong here. I just think  it's going to be difficult going forward if I'm constantly unhappy about  this because it obviously results in more fights between us. Don't  think that's very healthy. Or am I just expecting too much and this is  something I need to accept and work on lowering my expectations in a  relationship personally?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm considering breaking up with my boyfriend since we've been fighting about the same issue for a couple of months now. I feel like he doesn't put in enough efforts to spend more time with me, he thinks its normal to not spend as much time together. Are my expectations just too high or is it just better to end it since we both can't seem to see eye to eye on this?",30Jul2019,1
323,"So I am a woman in college and I am in my first year. I've been noticing many women wearing very casual clothes on campus mainly due to comfort. I see them wearing solid shirts or tank tops, leggings or yoga leggings, and Addidas, Vans, or Converse shoes. This is honestly not the fashion appearance that girls wear at high school. Girls at my high school would dress preppy with clothes from American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, and Aeropostale. But it seems that people in college dress their own way.

I have the money to change my wardrobe but I am not sure if it would be a good idea to simply change to conform to the masses.

328," 

Hi I'm 17 and turning 18 in less then 2 months. And here in Sweden that means I am officially an adult, independent and free to do whatever I want to do (as long it isn't illegal). But with in my life that isn't the case, I feel like a prisoner within my own family. Before I start telling my story I want you guys to know that in Sweden even if you turn 18 you still have to graduate school before you move out and next month I'm starting my final year in school.

I'm going to list all my family memeber and give you a picture of my relasionship with each and single one of them and my problems with them. I'm starting with people that are no longer present in my life anymore. And I want also tell that I have 5 siblings and only 2 of them do I share both my parents with that's my younger siblings. The rest have individual fathers.

My father:

He has been out my life for almost 6 years which has been great. Because when he was present he use beat me and my mother a lot. I remeber that I used to be very scared of him and feeling like if I did the smallest thing I would beaten very badly. Apperently he started to do this when I was 1 years old. It all ended because he reported my mother for abusing me and my siblings and that she poisned us which was all bullshit. He did this because he wanted my mother to lose custody over us and he knew that he could not get custody over us because we hated him. During the investigation over this he hit my mother with his car. Ever since he lost I haven't seen him, but recently he has tried to contact me over social media but I have blocked him everywhere. I don't want to see his face ever again and I don't want to hear his voice ever again.

My oldest sister:

She is 10 years older then me and she has also been out of my life for almost 6 years. Her father was my mothers first husband and he died before she was born. She had some issues that I'm not sure what it was but she used to been in special classes and had some physical handicaps. Her legs were different one leg was bigger and taller then the other one. She used to be very disrespectful to my mother and call her names, she was unthankful when my mother had raised and treated her very well. She also physically attacked my mother mulitple times and told her that she hated her. She just one day packed her bags and left one month after I last saw my father. I pesonally never had any problems with her, but my problem was with the way she treated my mother who had always been there for her. It doesn't bother me that she is out my life it never did.

Now to people who are very present in my life and some of them I wish were not.

My mother:

The person I love the most in this entire world and means most to me. She has been there for me my whole life and has always backed me no matter what. Writing this I have realised that there have a lot of people that have treated my mother like shit and I want to hurt all of them. 2 of her husbands ( including my father) have tried to make sure that she lost custody of all her children. But she is a strong women and has fought through everthing she has faced. We talk a lot and disscuss future plans. And the problem of leaving my family is that I can't leave my mother I just can't.

My second oldest sister:

For this I call her Lizzie which is not her name. She is the reason I'm writing this and she is the reason I hate my family she is pure evil. She is 5 years older then me and ever since I can remember she has had power over me and treated me and my other siblings like humans that she owns. The reason for this is that when my mother was not home instead of paying a babysitter to take care of us she just told Lizzie to do it and this gave her power that she abused. She used to order us to things like wash the dishes, sweep the floor, take out the trash and go to the store, all of this while she just chilled or hanged out with friends. If we did something she didn't like she used to 1. use violance or 2. tell us to go sit in an empty room and let us be there for hours until she said we could come out. Up til now she was pretty much taken control over everything in my life and I can't do anything I want without Lizzie somehow knowing about it. She says cares about my mother but she does not, she only cares about her because my mother enables her to have power over us. The reason my mother enables her to do all of this because in her eyes Lizzie has helped her a lot she pays the bills and makes sure that we stay away from being criminals. In reality Lizzie pays the bills with my mother money and she has not made me stay away from being a criminal my mother did. Lizzie manipulates people around her and wants to control people. She is obsessed with having people she can tell what to do and what not to do. She wants people to feel that she knows everyrthing and she wants people to feel without her they can't take care of themselves. And now she sees that that she is losing the power over as we are getting older and tells us that she is like a second parent and that she has raised us which makes me boil inside. Because I know this her try of making sure that she can control us forever. One thing she has done is to become a football agent because my older brother play football and she wants to manage his career and if he does not want to as she wants, she can ruin his life. She has taken it a bit further because I want to become a race car driver she wants to be my manager when she know absolutly nothing about racing. And my younger sister wants to get into entertainment guess what, Lizzie wants to ""help her"". And there is a lot of things like spying on people and being a hypocrite that I wish Lizzie could disappear or never was my sister. When she is outside she is very insecure and plays to be very nice. She has talked a lot about her friends treating her bad but I don't believe it because she lies and flips stories and makes herself the victim. If I would move out she could turn my whole family against me so that's why I do try to come up with the best excuse to move out like going away to university. But I'm just an avarege student and it's going to be very tough to do so. If I move somewhere close they will just show up everyday or make people keep an eye on me because we live in a small town and everyone knows each other. She also wants to be home as much as possible, she stopped going to university(but she says that she does everything via the computer) and is awake 19 hours a day just to control everything at all times. She said recently that she has no hope fo none of us, but then wants us to have a schedule, workout and try work hard to become succesful basically do everything she doen't do, when I later asked her why cares so much about our succes when she said she has no hope for us she responded she has hope for all people but she can't control everyone but us.

My older brother:

He nice, but he is foolish. He is like a puppet to Lizzie and does everything she wants to.

My younger sister and younger brother:

I have no problem with my sister. And my brother I have had a lot of fights with but that is every brother relationship.

The only thing I want is indepence.",30Jul2019,1
329,"It’s messy. I engaged in a secret relationship with a guy we’ll call, Tim. Nobody knew about it because it was very complicated with his ex, we lived in a small town, and it was very soon after he split with his long term girlfriend. It was a serious relationship nonetheless. We exchanged “I love you”s and he took my virginity. Eventually he had to leave for college and things just didn’t work out. We remained good friends and still hang out frequently and talk everyday. That was about a year ago. Flash forward to last weekend and Tim, his brother, Tyler (not his real name), some of our friends, and I, decide we’re going to get absolutely trashed. We play drinking games and consume more alcohol than any human should. Tyler and I became really good friends over this past school year, we even went to prom together, but we’re just that, friends. We are very touchy-feely, but that’s just the kind of people we are, and the relationship we have. However, on this particular night, things were extremely over-the-top. We were severely hammered mind you. We all went down to the basement to go to sleep at around 2. Tyler and I always share one large couch. Tyler’s about 6’3” and heavy set, and I’m petite and 5’3”, so it works out. Our legs were completely intertwined  and we were all up in each other’s business. There was some rubbing of the legs, hands drifting dangerously close to certain areas, and hand holding, all while our closest friends (and relative in Tyler’s case) are all sleeping in the same room as us. Eventually, as the rubbing and whatnot continued, Tyler sat up, looked at me for a second, and then suddenly we were kissing. We kissed for a while, and then Tyler stood up, did a quick scan of the room to assure everyone was asleep, and then led me up two flights of stairs, right into Tim’s bedroom. Oh, the irony. We then aggressively made out for a while to say the least. Shirts came off, boobs were smooched, and private parts were rubbed. Then we stopped. Tyler sat up exclaimed, “goddamn we are so drunk” and then went to the basement brought me my things and asked me to sleep up there. I obliged. We have since talked about it and neither of us are being weird thankfully, I told Tim and he doesn’t seem concerned because, in his words, “you were drunk, shit happens” so everything’s good right? Wrong. Tyler has no clue that me and his brother were together. And it’s not up to me to tell him, believe me I wish I could, that is completely Tim’s decision. And while Tyler doesn’t seem to think it’s a big deal what happened, I find myself thinking about it, and Tyler in general, a lot. A lot, a lot. And I can feel myself falling. I need advice, and lots of it. What do I do? Do I act on my feelings? Is it in my right to tell Tyler about me and his brother? Help!!!!",30Jul2019,0
330,"I’m interested in learning Colombian accent because I can understand it well and I heard it is one of most clear/clean accents in Spanish language. 

Then my friend from Spain told me that it is strange to hear a Chinese girl having Colombian accent.  Apparently there’s not a lot of chinese there? 
I don’t want to learn Spain accent because of vosotros verbs and sometimes the accent is hard for me to understand. 

I heard that Mexican accent is good too but due to the conflict with the U.S right now. It makes me doubt about it &gt;.&lt;. 

Everyone obviously have different opinions but proving enough facts and reasons will definitely help me make decision :) 

My goal is 
to stick with an accent in Spanish and hopefully it sounds “professional” or “clear/clean” to others.",30Jul2019,1
331,"My sister in law has recently confided in me that she's dating a legally married man who is in the midst of divorcing his wife. 
I haven't met him because she lives in a different province and I don't often see her, but the circumstances she has described seem implausible to me.

She told me that she and this man began a relationship months ago and in this time she often stayed at his apartment where he lived alone. Later in the conversation she dropped the bomb that he confessed to her after some time that he was still legally married, but that the relationship had been over for a long time they just hadn't made the seperation legal out of laziness.

This seems reasonable, I guess.

But then she tells me that she's met the wife because she would often come to his apartment in the morning to get ready for work while sister in law was there, leading me to believe that they hadn't been separated for very long if her belongings are still at her husband's apartment.

Sister in law tells me that her boyfriend told her recently that he hopes to marry her and be with her forever, so he and the wife went to a lawyer to finally begin the divorce process so that he isn't held back from deepening his relationship with her.
He said that the wife made it clear that she didn't want to divorce (although he claims they've been separated for a long time) and threatened to take half of what he owns out of spite.
 To avoid losing everything, apparently an agreement was made that husband and wife would  live together for a year, during which time the husband must be faithful and stop seeing sister in law (specifically requested by wife), and after a year she will grant him a divorce without taking half of what he's worth.

I don't know anything about divorce laws but all of this sounds insane to me.

Sister in law states that they are continuing their relationship in secret until the full year is up and then they can be together freely. She is even planning to travel home with him for a family event and when I asked how they were going to manage that without the wife finding out she was very vague and said she would explain in person.

I'm pretty dumbfounded by the whole thing so I didn't get to ask a lot of the questions that were swirling in my brain, and on top of that, sister in law can be very defensive and self righteous so I didn't want to say anything that might make her feel like she's being criticized.

I just can't help but think she's being played and mislead by an unfaithful married man. 
Sister in law is 35 years old and I don't want to believe she's a total imbecile so I'm trying to consider all of this as though it's plausible.

So I guess my question is, what are the chances that this situation would ever play out in a divorce court?
Beyond that, what am I supposed to say when she talks to me about him, or if I end up meeting him?
I don't really want to support this relationship from what I've heard, even if what she says is the truth, because in either case the wife is being deceived and lied to and sister in law is a participant in that deception even if she herself is being deceived to some extent.",30Jul2019,1

338,"Disclaimer: This is a really long story but I assure you every single part of it needs to be read in order to understand/give the best advice.

I’m 19 (F) and I live with my mother. She’s extremely controlling and severely depressed. My father passed away when I was really young and since then she hasn’t been the same. It started off with her moving into the living room. Once he died she decided to sleep on the couch every single night. Then she developed a shopping addiction and started buying unnecessary things online and on tv. When I’d ask her why she was doing this she’d make the excuse that a lot of the items were “gifts for her gift room”. Now a little backstory here, the “gift” room is basically a bedroom in the back of the house filled with old boxes from when we first moved in, a computer, my dad’s old stuff, and now a shit ton of hoarded items that she’s collected over the years. Anyways, she finally stopped shopping once times became really tough for us. 

Thankfully, my dad had left us a pretty large fortune since he had a very high paying job. But we ended up losing a huge chunk of it in lawsuits from greedy family members who weren’t in the will at all. After that, we were left with enough to live comfortably... well until HS started. I was sent to a private school that wasn’t extremely expensive but it was enough to put a dent in our finances. Forgot to mention this but all throughout this time my mom didn’t (and still doesn’t) have a job at all. She’s always made excuses for her unemployment like “dad didn’t want me to work” or “I need to be here for you bc u get sick a lot” or “I’m working on it”; but there’s no real valid excuse imo. She has a degree, she’s not disabled, she could easily find a job but she doesn’t want to. Anyways flash forward to the middle of HS and things start to get really tough. There’s less and less $$ coming in, we got behind on tuition fees, I couldn’t go out as much as I needed to, and my mom completely let herself go. She always put me and my needs (financially wise) ahead of herself. While I do appreciate this, I still don’t think it was completely right. She’d give me practically all extra spending money so I could go out or have clothes, but she’d never buy herself new shoes or clothes or go out with her friends at all. She hasn’t been out in years and all of her apparel have holes in them... I feel terrible. 


Bc of this, she’s been isolating herself in the house for years now. The less and less we had, the more my mother seemed to fade away. She didn’t want to leave or try new things. She didn’t want to see her friends. She’d make any excuse she could not to try in life. And eventually she just became this sad person who wouldn’t leave the couch all day except to go to the bathroom and to cook/do easy chores occasionally. She also doesn’t exercise or shower regularly either. And the majority of the food in the house is pretty unhealthy as well. I’ve tried to encourage exercising &amp; healthier options but she refuses to listen to me and calls all of my suggestions “cruel comments” / says I’m out of line for criticizing her. Or she’ll call me a “tree hugger”for suggesting healthy alternatives. But she’s overweight and it’s really worrying me... I don’t want her to die early bc of easily preventable unhealthy habits. 

But yeah I could spend hours telling you how many opportunities I’ve lost in the past because of our financial troubles, or how many friends I’ve lost because she isolated BOTH of us when I was younger; but now things are just insanely worse. Since I graduated HS, the $$ stopped coming in &amp; now we’re living off god knows what. I think she borrows from family members or something else who knows; she won’t tell me much. But now we’re at the point where I can’t even leave the house... like at all.

There is absolutely no extra cash for me to go out and see my friends, or to pick up a new hobby or anything. I don’t drive because we can’t afford lessons or the fee for the license itself (let alone the insurance). I don’t have a regular ID either for the same reason, so even when I do go out I cannot prove my age, which in turn limits a lot of activities. I also can’t walk anywhere either because there isn’t really anything to do near me within walking distance and every time I try to walk somewhere it has to be within a mile. There’s also not a lot of sidewalks to walk on either. My mom’s also super protective of me and limits where I can walk and when bc I’m female and she’s afraid that I’ll get kidnapped or harassed. We live in a good area but I do understand her concerns ig... but again this rule limits me a lot. 

Not only can I not leave my house by myself at all, I’m also trapped in a sea of clutter. My mom’s been hoarding everything since she started that shopping addiction. And it’s not just nice new items in boxes... no no it’s old envelopes, trash, expired food, dirty&amp;clean clothes, old appliances that don’t work anymore, old medicine, plastic bags, old flowers etc. Basically anything you can think of. And it’s not as bad as those “hoarding buried alive” shows you see on TV. It’s more like a 1/5 of that. But nonetheless the entire house has clutter in every single room. I feel trapped constantly. The house smells most of the time &amp; she refuses to deep clean things like kitchen floors, stoves, bathrooms, showers etc. She only does the bare minimum like washing dishes or cleaning counter tops with wipes. That’s it. And I can’t even clean or organize anything either because she throws a shit fit everytime and doesn’t trust me/ says she’ll “do it when she’s ready”. My mother’s also in complete denial of her problem or how it affects me btw.

She’s full of empty promises. She always says that she’ll “work on getting a job” or “work on cleaning up clutter in room A or B” but it never happens. I’ve even tried making deals and  scheduling a set time where we both tidy up together, but once that time rolls around she ALWAYS makes the excuse that she’s “too tired” or just doesn’t want to right now bc she’s the parent and to “try asking again later”. I’m honestly so tired of this. We keep fighting bc of it as well.

Also I can’t even go to college anymore. I got into a private 4 year &amp; a few community colleges. I was willing to put aside the 4yr one and to try community bc I knew times were tough, but I can’t even do that. My HS refuses to release my transcripts because my mom hasn’t paid off the last 2 years of tuition. And no transcripts=no college.

Currently I’m looking for a job myself but it’s hard. I’ve applied to more places than I can count but they never call me back &amp; I have no prior experience either. And I’m afraid that once I do get a job it’ll take me years to leave this place since I’d also have to be helping out the house w/ my income as well. I’m so stressed. All my friends are going off to college and I’m just stuck.

I have no hobbies and nothing to do at home. I’m trapped in my room all day and I’m forced to lay down in bed or sit in bed. I even eat in bed bc she refuses to eat with me for some reason. I don’t exercise either bc I can’t leave &amp; we have no equipment to do so. And I recognize how bad this is on my health too. I do try to get up every hour or walk outside in my backyard or pick healthier things for myself at the store when I can but I know this isn’t enough and it’s driving me insane. I feel like she’s turning me into her; a blob who lays down all day and does nothing. I wake up everyday and stay in bed all day on my phone (my average screen time is 12.5 hours daily).

I’m also losing friends bc I can’t see or hangout with them / their moving away for college. I’m truly going insane and I have no hope anymore. I’m so tired of laying down doing nothing all day when I’m so young. I hate seeing my friends having all these fun experiences going places and traveling when I have to suffer in this prison. And no one knows the entire truth as to why I can’t leave either so I constantly have to lie to them or make excuses.

My mental health is fucking declining at an alarming rate from all of this and a shit ton of other stuff that I won’t get into. I recently got a therapist (who charges very little), but I’m afraid that I won’t be able to see her consistently bc we literally can’t afford anything at all anymore.

I want a better life but I feel completely stuck and hopeless. I don’t even have savings to run away either.

Anyone have any advice for this? Please?",30Jul2019,6
341,"Bit of background: a few weeks back I did something terrible and got an unprotected oral sex from a prostitute. I was overcome by guilt and anxiety and got myself tested for Stis.

343,"I met Tom in high school we were part of a good friend group. We partied a lot our senior year and then when we graduated I moved across the country for school he went into the military. It's been six years from my senior year, and I finally decided to go home.



Tom is home for the summer. After serving five years in the military, he was discharged along with his girlfriend. They moved in together to go to college. They are both 24 and this summer they are taking off and not working they are staying at Tom’s parents rent-free. We usually go out drinking a couple of nights a week. They love to post lots of cute photos of themselves on Instagram and tweet multiple times a day. They care a lot about their image, reputation, and popularity.
They always like to get blackout drunk and can be loud. Tom’s girlfriend usually puts glasses from the bar that she thinks is cool in her purse. 




Tom thinks it's funny and encourages her to do it they say the bars get those glasses for free, so it doesn't matter. We're from a liberal state I'm LGBT. He and his girlfriend pride month tweeted: ”I don't care if you’re gay or straight, i have plenty of friends that are both. But pls stop forcing it on us who just wanna be left out of it.”
I find it hurtful when they tweet that stuff. Tom and Toms's girlfriend also tweet out slut-shaming things like:



”What do women do after they’ve slept with everyone and still don't find love?
Post “men ain't shit.”
I think it's funny they like this stuff because when tom is single, he'll sleep with anything that walks he's a known dog. In the past, he's talked about how he'd slept with a lot of women and ”shout out to women with no self-respect.”




He's also been caught sexting other girls while he's been in this relationship. He tries to manipulate a girl his friends used to make fun of and who has low self-esteem. She moved away and has no contact with any of us, but Tom still keeps photos of her and thinks she wants him. He thinks she’s playing hard to get. So I don't understand why he puts down promiscuous woman. They post on social media always trying to look like the perfect couple.



I want to distance myself from him, but Tom is a long-time friend. I feel like an asshole judging them so much. Am I the asshole for wanting to ghost these people? I feel emotionally drained should I stop the friendship? Would that make me an asshole?

345,"So route A makes my journey between 15-20 minutes deoensinf how fast I walk. It cuts through a couple parks, one outside a mosque and a fairly run down, low income area. But I've had no problems. 

Route B is about 30 minutes no matter what just because of length. It's in more busy areas, along pavements by roads, but I do get a nice river walk when approaching work. 

The obvious answer would be A. But my boyfriend said he's been beaten up in that exact place before and robbed once too, a few years ago now. He said the people there have made very bad and harassing remarks to himself and people he's been with - again I've had no problems at all. 

I walk during the day, there's usually always a couple people around walking to/from work, so I'm never really alone. 
But my boyfriend is really worried about me as I'm pretty small and can't defend myself. But it is quite a longer route to go to work and back every day if I took route B.

353,"(I will try to explain myself the best I can since I speak English very poorly)

I’m in high school and my school offered for a period (around May) some tutoring by students who had excellent results, (they were in the last year so 1 year older than me). 

I went to this “tutoring class” only one or two times since I don’t really give a shit and didn’t really do anything, I just chatted with the tutors: a guy who I vaguely know as we played football together a few times and had a few classes in common. And the girl who I didn’t know at all.

Now the weird part: yesterday the girl messaged me, and she told me she has something very important to tell me and she would like to talk in person since that thing is “very important”  but she also told me not to worry. 

I’m worried: 
1st issue: I don’t think it’s anything school related since she has completed her high school exams and successfully graduated almost one month ago so she should be out.

2nd issue: even if it was, why did SHE text me (instead of the school itself or the other guy) didn’t give her or the other guy my number (maybe the other guy had it but I haven’t heard anything from him)  and it took me a while to realize who she even was. 

3rd: in the message she very clearly says “talk”  so that kinda confirms my suspicion.

I’m kinda scared to be completely honest and I don’t know what to expect, she didn’t want to give me any details as she wants to talk in person....My rational side is hoping that this is not some kind of psycho who “fell in love” with me.

356," I had a dream when I was younger of an older family friend (about two years older, I was probably 7 or 8 at the time) who took me up to his room and made me touch and lick his.. and I would sometimes think about it, being one of those memories that you weren’t sure were a dream or not. Then the other day, weird dreams came up during a discussion with my mom and I told her. She told me it wasn’t a dream, and that the same exact situation that happened in my dream, happened when I was younger (I told her that it happened, not knowing what I was saying). She told me we stopped going over there as a whole family and that’s why we weren’t as close to them anymore. She also said that she didn’t think it affected me in a bad way, since I was so nonchalant in the way I talked about it (when I was younger). I was genuinely shocked when I found this out. Part of me really believes he was just curious, and it wasn’t supposed to be anything like that but I can’t stop thinking about it. Im so confused why I suppressed it and tricked myself into thinking it wasn’t real. I’m really not sure what to do. I still see this guy sometimes. I was thinking therapy but I’m not sure we have enough money for it. When my mom told me this the other day, I really didn’t want her to freak out so I just told her that I agreed and that I didn’t think he meant it in that way, or that he was “just curious”.

I have this game which I play on a gaming site for a long time now, please let us consider this gaming site has completely unsafe for this post.

So this other day I posted something on my private Instagram and my friend commented something and when I went back to the gaming site, one of the people I talk with (I have shared nothing in personal) said the same thing what my friend commented, and believe me that was just completely out of nowhere and irrelevant to anything we have talked before and upon saying that, he abruptly stopped the conversation which really freaked me out, and now I really am scared, so my question is that even if assuming I give all of my personal details to someone or I play on a site which is very unsafe, is it possible for someone to breach into my private account of Instagram? (Also I am completely sure this guy isn't on my follower list)

Please answer because this has really made me paranoid",30Jul2019,1
358,"Hello Reddit, this is going to be a summary of a quite long story for me.

Right now I am 23 and the story goes back to when I was around 10. Back in School I used to be a very shy person I had maybe 2 or 3 friends and most of the time I was made fun of when someone find out who was the girl I liked so I became a very reserved person. So I met this girl which from now on I will refer as 'A' somehow I managed to be friend with her and started to like her a lot to the point I fell sleep every night thinking of her. Even though we didn't talk much at this point I considered her someone close to me.

Forward 1 year I had a big crush on her but never told her anything. One day after school my friend and I were talking on messenger to her and somehow he dared me to tell A I like her. So I jokingly did and the reply was "" I will think about it"" being dumb and shy I panicked and told her it was a friend who wrote that. ( Yeah I know it was a dumb move).

Also by this time we were preparing a school exchange to Australia for 6 weeks ( Quite far since I'm from Peru). Only about 14 people out of 50 we were would go in a selection process from school. Being shy I didn't want to go but I found out A wanted to so I applied for it. Surprisingly we both got accepted to the trip. During this trip which I always think was the best time of my life me and A got really close to the point everyone at the trip though we were a couple. Because we spent all our time together.

In Australia the host brother I had also started liking A as she visited the home I was staying at frequently. So this is where everything went wrong for me. One day all the group and their respective host families went to a pool and my host brother asked me to help him ask Adriana out. Being shy and trying to be nice although I didn't want to I helped him ( Had to help him translating from English to Spanish as A didn't know English so we'll back then). A said yes to him and they dated the last 5 days that we were in Melbourne. I don't know why but since that day and seeing them those 5 days kiss in front of me I started hating myself to the point that I promised myself I wouldn't be shy anymore.

After those 5 days we went for 3 days to Sydney before going back to Peru, and during this 3 days A was all the time with me. And everyone on the trip was telling me to ask her out that it was obvious that I liked her and she liked me. But again I didn't and we went back to Peru.

Back in Peru we were still very close but I never asked her out. One year later she got expelled from school for a stupid problem that I won't go into details. And after that day we lost pretty much all contact until a few years later.

During my last year's of High School I met with her randomly when we somehow managed to be in the same party or place but we didn't talk more than just saying hello. Even though I had a girlfriend while A wasn't in school anymore everytime I met her I always started wondering what if I had tell her my feelings 

High school over haven't heard of A in some time and I'm in a different city waiting on the line for my University entry exam and I found A in the line too. She was going to study in the same University I chose. Again we exchanged some words and didn't talk again for like 2 years. Then I started encountering her through University campus until one day I asked for her number and since that day we started talking every now and then and also went out as friends a couple of times. 

Again Everytime I met her I started wondering if I should tell her how I felt in High School so I could close that chapter but always though it might be pointless and never did tell her 

Fast forward to the present I moved to California after graduation to work for 1 year I have a 2 year relationship with a girl and I talk with A every month at least about our lives( about work, her bf , my gf , etc) and still wondering what could have happened if back then I told her how I felt or what would she say if I tell her how I felt in the past.

Now my year in California is over and I am one month away from going back and I started to talk with A every week and also asked her if we could meet when I'm back. She said yes also she seemed dissapointed I was not going to be able to be in her graduation coming in a few days.

And now 6 days ago I texted her and my messages were not reaching her and after checking fb and Instagram I realized she had blocked me and deleted me from everywhere.

Now I feel so confused and sad that now it seems like I will never be able to find closure to this. If anyone has any idea what I should do or any insight on why she might have blocked me after everything seemed ok as we're friends. I would appreciate it.",30Jul2019,3

363,"What started out as a kind gesture has now been the biggest pain in my ass. The end of last year (Dec ‘18), my wife and mine’s friend was going through a rough patch with his SO. He had been venting to us that the house was not being taken care of (ie: dirty dishes everywhere, bathroom being messy, etc.) Throughout the rest of the month we noticed that his attitude and happiness had spiraled and we were able to notice a huge character change. My wife and I had offered to let him stay with us for a little bit until he can get himself together and find his own place. That was very nice of us right?

Another important detail: I work with this guy so I’m sure you can see where this is going.

The end of March is here and he had finally decided to take us up on our offer. Everything is going great. His outlook on things are improving, his attitude has changed. The whole goal of this change has worked!

And now the frustrations begin. Our friend has been living with my wife and I for 4 months and it has been the most irritating experience. It’s little things like how he took over half of our refrigerator, likes to sigh A LOT, I found out he will start a load of laundry then disappear for 12 hours, does not help bring trash to curb, and has cleaned the bathroom he uses TWICE since he moved in. There are so many other things that I am not including but I will not bore you all reading this. 

In the end, my wife and I can’t stand our friend living with us anymore. What was supposed to be temporary has become, evidently, long term because he had just purchased a new car that is costing him $500 a month so there is no sign of a savings. I have come very close to putting my foot down multiple times but due to him living and working with me will put a strain on both home life and work. The only way I can think of getting him out is to get my wife pregnant lol. If you took the time to read my rant/request for help, I thank you. 

TL;DR: My friend &amp; coworker lives with my wife and I and we can’t take it anymore. There is no strain on my relationship but if I put my foot down, my work life will be affected",30Jul2019,1

I took him in and I’ve been caring for him but the family that found him wants to keep him. 

But I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place here. The mom is really sick and openly admits she can barely care for herself let alone animals. They’re really low-income, which is fine, but this kitten needs medical attention that they can’t pay for and are essentially expecting me too pay out of pocket as a broke college kid. My resources at local shelters won’t help me because the kitten isn’t adoptable as they want to keep him. They also have two cats already neither of whom are spayed or neutered. They’re skeptical of vaccinations claiming their last cat died because of them which would mean I would have to get this little dude vaccinated behind their backs. 

But the little girl who found him adored him and I think the mom might have cancer and Jesus Christ am I really going to refuse to give them the kitten? They clearly can’t provide him the level of care he needs but that just feels so morally wrong.",30Jul2019,7

376,"So a quick back story, im 27 years old been working at a company for 2 years. I got the job as the boss is my uncles good friend i started off working as general labour to working my way up and now running the company. Unfortunately my boss pays very very little for what i do just above the minimum wage. I bring in 6-10million dollars a year for him from the projects i run.

The job is high stress, as is my boss he has an autocratic style of management, In the 2 years i had never taken a day off work even worked while being sick and had all the responsibility of the company put on me.

I just got home from a 1 month vacation overseas and just before i left i had gotten a sever tooth infection that had made its way through my gums, causing me severe pain i was working while having to take endone to fight the pain. While waiting to receive surgery my boss had told me this is self inflicted and made me feel guilty for having to take the day off for surgery.

I got sick overseas and have been ill upon my return so i have been given an extra week off work but tomorrow i am expected to go in and begin working, but my intentions are actually to go in and resign. I want to just work in a no responsibility role that pays more and allows me more freedom and time to travel etc.

Should i let my boss know tonight that i cannot see a future at his company so he doesnt expect me to work tomorrow, or just arrive to work in the morning and speak with him direct about how i feel, and how i would like to terminate my employment.

380,"Holy shit I don’t know where to begin.

It’s 1 am, and right this second my mom is kicking out my older sister(22)(fake name Lindsey) out of the house, right now she’s packing up her stuff.

Basically what led to this situation was that last week Lindsey got fired from her job and has been lying to us by still getting dressed in the mornings and leaving the house. But she would come back to the house when everyone leaves. And my mom found out she was fired because she called her work place. 
Mom asked her what she’s been doing this past week if she’s not working and my sister says she’s been trying to find a new job and going to interviews
Mom asked for proof, Lindsey shows her emails and all of a sudden an email pops up and opens and mom gets a look at it and can see it’s one of those sites where you sell your body to men for money, aand Lindsey quickly closes the email, and logs off.

My mom is speechless and does not know what to say.

My sister has been sneaking off in the night as well. She has been talking to this boy that my mom seems to think is a really bad person.

Mom yells at Lindsey ‘that the worst thing you did today was make my kids lie to me’
Ya I can see how that is horrible, Lindsey did convince me and my younger brother to lie to her. All we did was go out to dinner with our friends and cousins and when my mom convinced me to tell her the truth, mom thought it was good for us to hang out with our cousins bu it was unreasonable to lie over this.

I can still hear my mom yelling
Saying how she put up with a lot of our shit and does not want to be disrespected in her house

Mom is right now dropping off Lindsey to our Dad’s place.

Ugh I really hate family arguments.,
I have no idea what to do.. what advice do I give my mom..How do I fix this family or is this just something that happens and can’t be fix

I'm pretty nervous about it, not just because the orthodontist (a nice Southern man) is going to cut open my mouth and dig around a bit, but because I can't help but think of this as them removing a literal part of me that's been with me all my life. I get the feeling like I'm just abandoning an old friend, although I have literally never thought about my wisdom teeth prior to the scheduling of this surgery. 

Perhaps this is an extension of my anxiety towards the surgery itself and the inevitable discomfort that I'll feel during the recovery process. But this sudden sentimental attachment to my wisdom teeth is something I logically shouldn't care about. My girlfriend has agreed to incorporate the teeth into an art piece of some sort (she's weird like that, and I love her). The fact that they'll be used after their removal I hope will alleviate the feeling that I'm abandoning them.

We kept going out but her parents began letting her out less and school got on the way but I tried really hard to keep the relationship strong but I didn’t manage because one day she called me and asked if we could have a break until the school year was over. I said yes but was really upset, knowing most breaks don’t end well. There was a disco at the end of the year and I asked her for it, she said it’s best not to and she didn’t think it was a good idea to get back together.

391,"My freshmen year in college is going to start and I am very nervous. I am an introvert with social anxiety and stuff. I always fear new environments given the influence from my past experience. I came across difficulties in making new friends, I was often the one left out when forming groups for projects, etc. Imagine being absent in high school and nobody realized, as if you weren’t a part of the class. Yeah, that’s me. I don’t have many friends, not to mention a girlfriend. I don’t consider myself attractive because I have a big nose, thick lips and an asymmetrical face that just looks weird in any angle, I am 170 centimeters tall and not muscular at all. I have really low self-esteem as a result. Oh btw, I wasn’t born in a wealthy family either.

I once told my parents my concerns and worries, they told me to take it easy. “Really you are worrying about this and that already? Perhaps other students are also facing the same problems? I doubt everyone has the charisma to make friends before the semester started. It’s gonna be fine sweetheart, just don’t be too passive and you’re good to go” I nodded but was still skeptical. The reason being 2 weeks ago I had to go to my college in person to submit my tuition fees and collect my new card. While waiting during registration, I observed and found out that my peers all seem to have their counterparts and were getting along with each other, while I was the only one alone, it is going to be harder to blend in isn’t it.

Up till here you may think that there are numerous ways to establish friendship with others, and I am simply making excuses, yeah there are options like joining clubs and societies, forming study groups, etc. However, I have ZERO talent in pretty much anything, I am not good at any sports, I am not good at cooking, I don’t know how to play any musical instruments, my academic performance is not outstanding either. So where do you think I will have the confidence to join clubs? I think I might be the biggest loser in this century and might as well offer my place to someone else who deserves it more than I do.

395,"To start - our home is currently a building site, with lots of machinery and vehicles visiting throughout the day. We also have woodlands behind the house on a very steep slope with a cliff edge.

&amp;#x200B;

My border collie cross, Judy, has always been a very active dog and only started to have health issues when she reached 11ish.

She was diagnosed with diabetes earlier on this year when she became really lethargic and lost a lot of weight, and we've been injecting her with insulin every day since (which she absolutely hates, and really stresses her out)

Over the last few months, her cataracts have developed quite quickly, and now she's 99% blind. She gets around by listening to sounds, and she's always had a good nose - but she's starting to bump into things and trip over objects quite a lot.

With where we live, it's becoming increasingly obvious that it's generally unsafe for her to carry on as she did before. It would be different if she were a house dog, or if we had a flat, square garden.

Every morning she still expects to run up the woods, but we've had to stop her once or twice from walking straight over the edge of a 20m ledge behind our house..

Her diabetes is manageable, but she's increasingly hating being injected and associates my dad and I with it, which is really painful.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, it's a case of ""it's more painful for the owner than the dog"", as we see her struggling around the land and I'd hate for her to get seriously hurt. Most days though, she's the same old dog, chews on sticks she finds and is always happy and energetic. So it's really hard to look at her as a struggling, ill dog sometimes.

My legs also hurt after a long time walking and my upper body strength is quite bad, I struggle picking heavy things up. Although, it's not as bad as my legs and back, since I had to carry myself up the stairs with my arms.

My weight has very heavily fluctuated, I've been obese, underweight and overweight. I'm currently overweight, but I'm working on losing that recent depression weight

400,"I let my friends friend stay at my place for a few days and I noticed some items missing. I check my security cameras, and sure enough, there she is caught red handed stealing from me. She’s not the brightest thief since the cameras are in plain sight, and she left her belongings at my place when I found out. 

I was furious and confronted her through text, her initial response was “please explain” leading me to think she might have stolen more and I’m just not aware. I sent her the camera footage and she confesses immediately and is very apologetic.

I tell her to return my items or pay for what she stole. Otherwise I’m filing charges on her and she can pick up her stuff at the police station. She won’t do either and is becoming irate and more desperate to get her stuff.

A part of me wants to file charges on her and teach her a lesson. What she did is wrong, especially to someone helping her out. Who knows how many people she’s done it to and she will do it again if don’t press charges. 

Another part of me doesn’t want to deal with this bullshit, and the stuff she stole is not worth going through this much stress. She’s also very tempered and might come looking for me with her friends, and I don’t want that trouble.

i will try not to go into too much detail, but basically he told his parents and sister he was dating me. i think that was so dumb, every single person we've told so far has been super critical of our relationship cause of the age gap. his parents were very gentle with him, i know they must have been so disapproving but clearly they tried to hide it. his sister BLEW up and called him a pedophile and said she'd never talk to him again if he didn't end it. he said if this is what's necessary, then so be it, and he's basically cut ties with her. it really made him upset, he cried for a while. 

i really feel like i can't break up with him now, the guilt would be unbearable, cause i know it'd make him hurt so much more. he hasnt said it explicitly but i can tell he's so sad and knows his family have lost respect for him. i feel like i've dug myself into a hole because if i leave him he might either hurt himself, or come after me, i can't really tell at this point, he's not in a good frame of mind. he might even kill himself, and that would ruin my life. i haven't told my parents or anybody close to me, and i can't really.",30Jul2019,24

Met this girl 5 years ago, never dated but always a chemistry, she's had a troubled life, sexually abusive dad, abusive sister, uncaring mother, she got pregnant at 19 to an extremely abusive boyfriend, had the child, stayed with the guy despite the abuse, eventually moved on to a school friend who emotionally abused her, broke up with him earlier this year, all the stepping stones to becoming an escort tbh.

After her last relationship ended I moved in to help her financially, took a few months to get an income organised but in the time I was looking for money she was escorting. I moved in around April and always had suspicions of her escorting, it all came out a month ago where she admitted to it and now we're very open about the whole thing.

The thing is, she's pulling in 6-8k a week, I'm on about a grand a fortnight, I've just started university and she wants to support me, and wants to buy uni supplies, food and lend a hand paying bills, but because of her history and her raising her child I feel like I can't take advantage out of, I don't know, pity(?), even though I desperately need the money.

413,"Some background: I was at an IT school for 3 years, part of that was an internship at anrapidly growing IT company. Graduated some time ago there and am now employed at said IT company. The pay is very decent, if not high to camparable positions. The people are nice, the atmosphere is good. It's in the town I live in and just about 15-20 minutes away, which is why I chose to apply for a full time job there for now.

What's bugging me though is what I'm usually working on. Since it's mainly customizing for standard software all i'm working on is UIs mostly. Barely any background work even besides a bit of counting up and down and doing some formatting, disabling/enabling elements and pushing some data back and forth, all that good stuff.

This all is, besides the learning how some frameworks react, all too easy, yet incredibly frustrating. Again, not because it's difficult in itself, but rather a lot of ""does the xml markup work this way in this case"" or ""why does that element get but beneath the other one despite both having 50% width where with all others it works"".

I am thinking about leaving the IT field in general sometimes, but regarding the worldwide situation that would probably be stupid. Now the plan would be to work for one or max. two years to get more work experience (always nice to have) and save up some money. I could potentially save up enough to even finance going to uni and only needing some part time and/or holiday jobs. 

But yet I don't know where to start. I found myself interested in AI (neural networks especially) but also things like image recognition or pattern detection (Qagga.js had a very interesting ""how it works"" blog post about that). 

My question here is: What would I even need to study to get in this direction? Should I go for Informatics/Applied Informatics or would I even need pure math primarily for that?

Besides, I don't want to go to uni just for the sake of it, because some will say there is a lot one can learn without it, especially in IT. I want to get a degree mainly for security later on (a bachelors or masters is just worth more than what I have and some companies don't even employ anything below, especially if I was to move to a bigger city some day), but also to get the hang of new concepts and being able to focus on that, because after a full time work day I often find myself rather exhausted from all the frustration over the day which means my productivity drops near zero.
Also, I won't get into something I might enjoy doing much more if I don't at least try focusing on studying for a couple of years.

What I could use is some advice on where I should start looking, which fields I should inform myself about and where to start in terms of which degree might be suitable for me. Because I damn right have no clue where to start really.

417,"Hello everybody, 
So pretty much all of it is in the tittle. I’m a 22 yo girl and I worked during a month (June) for a guy who made my life a living hell. He is actually notorious in the city because all the young women who worked for him have always left in less than 2 months and talked about how it is to work for him. 
But I just moved here, I come from the other side of the country, I arrived in this small city less than 3 months ago. So I didn’t know nothing about his reputation and was happy when I found the job offer to be a receptionist at his hotel. 
At first he was really super nice but things went really bad really fast. He was touching my tights, my neck, my hair, talking about my body, asking about my sexual life, commenting on my clothes... He is a 66 yo man but really intimidating. I was asking him to stop but I was afraid to yell or hit him. One day I pushed his hand off my tight a little more violently than before and from this day he hated me and was yelling at me all the time for no reason, heck, he once threw an electric stapler at me because I was wearing closed shoes while he wanted to be able to see my feet.
The list of the things he did goes on and on but that’s not the subject. One day it went to far and I left in the middle of my shift, running as fast I can. I wanted to be done with him like all the girls before me. But I forced myself to fill a lawsuit against him so maybe I can stop him from doing it to others. Some of the girls went to the police but they all withdrew their charges after some time because they didn’t want to face him again. Because of this he thinks that he is in intouchable, that we are all so afraid of him that he is sort of all mighty. 
I want to prove him wrong. I’m now pressing charges through the Labor Court (I’m French, here it’s called the Prud’hommes, I don’t know how it’s called in English, it’s the court that deals with conflicts between employees and bosses). 
I received advices from the counselors who helped me build my case and they make me ask for a total of more than 5000€ in réparations and interests for the different charges they told me to press (not only sexual harassment but also work without a contract, assault etc).
The total is high so we directly go to court without conciliation attempt first. 
So. I can’t afford a lawyer so I’ll defend my case myself.  I realize that it means I’ll have to stand for myself all alone in the court while he will come with a lawyer against me. Plus I’m terrified and feel nauseous just with the idea of seeing him again. I just can’t sleep.
I don’t know how, or if, I’m going to be able to do it. I don’t want to start crying in the middle of the hearing and not be able to talk and defend myself...
So I thought I’d ask your advices about how I can cope with the hearing. If you have any tips to help me talk and stand for myself while I’m quite scared of public talks and completely terrified of him, let alone arguing against a lawyer...",30Jul2019,1

425,"Hello.
I graduated from my University in an animation major 2 years ago I've got gigs on different projects, even I worked on an animated short which has won on some animation festivals, so my working life started well, the problem starts that in my country, Mexico, animation still is an small industry. So just a handful studios pay well, that is why on my free time I started to make commissions of  fan art and furry art drawings and I ended up earning more money than on the places I worked before. 

I have to admit I fail in a comfort zone for a year since I started earn more making drawings than working for studios here, also I love to draw I found fantastic that I could earn money doing it and I have more time for my self and personal proyects, but at the same time I end up applying less to new jobs on studios (and not getting any new gig), less profecional experience and not improving as much my portafolio. Then on the last months I felt that even when I was enjoying it maybe it wasn't the best in the long term, so I decided that I had to get back on track improve my portfolio and applay to more places, or even I started with a doubt, if the studios here don't pay well, try to study something more (it is not that uncommon on my country). So I decided to mention it to my parents that I was investigating to maybe study something on IT or Finances, but still I haven't decided.

My dad loves Finances so he was very happy to hear that, and he ended up showing to me a business school online and that I can study a master on FinTech in a year. I wasn't very convinced because I've never heard of this school but I still asked information on the website. They called me they tell me everything in a super formal way and they throw me lots of info how the founder of the school was awesome, what about is the master, that I will be doing a business simulation along the year, a networking week in Barcelona, Spain. But they need me to apply fast so I can get a discount on 37% off on the tuition because it is limited just for this week.

I told them I will think it alongside my other options (My dad didn't liked that I told them it, that it is wrong, idk why...) in my case I would prefer an university that I know and that has a reputation in my country, than an online school that I think my dad found out as a google ad searching for ""bussines school"", and since both ask almost the same for the tuition fee I prefer a university I know it's reputation. 

I tryed to research more about this school and I didn't found so much just that apparently they are backed up by a big Spanish book editorial.

About reviews online I didn't find too much just few positives on a website, but I found weird 5 of the 9 reviews were writed exactly the same day, and on its info on Google they have just two reviews one 5 starts without comment, and another one, 1 star saying that it is an scam.

I am not trusting this school, but my dad is already all in, that he will pay me the course that I should take the risk I have nothing to lose.

But from the other side I don't want my dad to pay something with no reputation and I don't want to waste my time passing the course if I want to get a job I will be rejected because no one knows this school when I can go to something more trustful.

If I am honest I am just thinking to study this for the money, I don't care that much about Finances, I just want to work in something more stable, with a better income and that I won't end up hating. I love animation and teachers and some coworkers have told me I have talent as a CGI artist but I am scare that won't end up earning enoght to have the similar lifestyle that I was used to living with my parents and with an stable income.

So I feel overwhelmed with my dad telling me that I most to take this course and the people from the school calling me and sending me emails almost daily. All just because I fail in my comfort zone and I felt that I lost my track on my career this last year, that even I think it wasn't that bad, I was still earning money, doing something that I enjoy, just right now I want to improve and have a better income.

It started with an argument about me drinking to much, and she lied about why it bothered her. Then the next day she broke down and came clean about why. She was addicted to literally everything. Cocaine, heroin, crystal meth, weed, alcohol, smoking, literally everything. But her boyfriend at the time who was enabling her, cheated on her and broke up with her and that was enough for her to go sober. She’s 5months sober and never needed to go to rehab.

When she told me this. Something inside me flipped. I just felt this sense of loss and regret at the fact I’ve been avoiding drugs all my life.

We’re both clingy by nature. We like spending time, as much time as possible, with our people. In the past I’ve had to tone it down, as has my boyfriend. But neither of us have to tone it down anymore. We love spending time with each other, constantly. 
If we’re not at work, we’re together. Talking, watching TV, playing video games, listening to music, anything and everything we prefer to do together. 

My mother, however, believes this is unhealthy because we don’t have “enough time apart”. After all, distance makes the heart grow fonder but..I’m already plenty fond of my boyfriend. I don’t like him *more* after being reunited, I’m just bummed we had to spend any time apart in the first place. 

When apart, we still function just fine. We still work and go to the gym and sleep and eat and take care of responsibilities...but it’s just not as much fun and doesn’t come as easily, and we’d still rather be doing it with each other.

This is the first time I’ve been on a relationship that’s just..calm. Relaxed. Neither of us have to worry about dishonesty or infidelity or “having plans” because we’re always doing *something* together. 

We’re comfortable together, and I can’t imagine getting burnt out because..well, what’s there to be burnt out on?

Now I need a second job or a steady/extra income because I am saving for a future trip to Thailand and I am paying for my partners (30M)  seats/accommodation (I am paying for the whole trip because he has no job which I don’t mind). 


What are some ideas that I could do get that extra income including ideas about a second job I could find?

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

439,"Rejection is one of the worst feelings anyone can experience. But it isn’t what it seems and if you look at it in the following (correct imo) way it will be much easier for all of us.

If someone rejects you, it doesn’t mean you are not good enough, it just means you don’t fit the needs of that person. This applies to dating, job interviews etc. 

For example, if you apply for a job and you get that sad email where it is said they don’t need your services, it just means your skills are not what they require, and you may be very valuable somewhere else. If you get rejected by your crush, he/she just rejects the idea of being with you, not you as a person, as he or she may need someone else with other qualities, and surely there is that one person that needs your qualities so much.",30Jul2019,1

I met this girl online while playing a video game. In the short time span we've known each other (approximately 2 months) we have developed what I would consider strong relationship. The past 18 months i've been dealing with a lot of personal stuff and she's managed to help me with them. I love her like a sister and vice versa. Her other online friends have raised concerns about our closeness which I understand considering my age, suggesting to her I might be a pedophile etc which is truly disgusting. One even went as far to compare me to a rapist. Her friends tell her that I need to be cut out of her life. She tells me she feels as though she is being manipulated by these other people and does know who I am as a person. Despite this I can't help the sense that she is slipping away. I know that this relationship is also important to her as she consistently reminds me of this and how special I am to her. I feel as though I shouldn't involve myself in the scenario and let herself come to a decision herself whether or not she should remove me from her life.

i’m a 16 year old female who grew up in an abusive home with my biological father. once we (my mom, my sister and i) got away from that piece of shit, we were couch surfing and homeless until my mom met her now husband, bill, and we moved in with him. he wasn’t well off by any means (he lived in a single-wide trailer in his mom’s front yard) but it was a permanent place to stay. my mom got a job again, they got married, and bill became the dad i never had. he took care of my mom and treated my sister and i like his own. everything was great and i even adopted his last name in place of my biological dad’s.

well, he used my mom’s laptop for a work email a couple weeks ago and stayed logged in. she kept getting his notifications and it was annoying so she went to log out. out of curiousity, and because she’s his wife, she started going through the emails and found multiple offers to prostitutes in a city 2 hours away that were sent while she was on a trip for work. 

it’s disgusting how he gave almost 6,000 dollars away for fucking “sensual body massages” when he had a wife coming home in 2 days and 2 kids at home. the worst part about it all is that my mom won’t even try to divorce the fucker. she loves him and i understand he’s done a lot for her, but this is also how her previous marriage ended and she kept up with his bullshit for far too long. i feel so awful for her. she’s the strongest person i know and i love her with all of my heart. i’m also devastated that the man i’ve called my dad for a fucking decade is a lying cunt. who knows how long he’s been off with hookers while my mom busts her ass for 2 kids and him?

i don’t know how to react. i don’t know whether to be upset with her, or just stop talking to him, or pretend like it never happened. i can’t talk to anyone about it. my sister would be horrified if she knew. i’m so lost.",30Jul2019,2

I am currently living in a unfinished basement that I have semi-fixed up. I will only be there for 8 more months, but the landlord does not know I am down there. (Have currently been living there for two months.) The people upstairs are aware of the situation. I have started to have second thoughts/anxiety about this and am wondering if anyone is familiar with what could happen if the landlord ended up finding out I was down there. If I just got kicked out that would be ideal (no legal issues or other roommates getting evicted etc)

Does anyone know what the landlord could/would do? The landlord is fairly active in our lives but is not at the house often.

What should be my next steps? Seek alternative living options or stick with it? (I have put about 300$ into the basement and it is definitely livable for my standards.)

452,"Long story short, on Friday I was dumped unexpectedly by my boyfriend of 12 months. It was completely out of the blue and I’m still in shock. We were barely on a date that Tuesday and everything went great so I was completely blindsided by this. 2 weeks prior to this he told me how grateful he was that we were together. He’s never sentimental sot this was also very shocking and made me incredibly happy. Also, about 3 weeks ago I was messaging him saying I’ve been holding in a secret and it was okay if he wanted to break up. He declined immediately and sent me a paragraph which basically stated how much he adored being together and how I made him incredibly happy. The whole time I was simply going to say “I’m a vampire” because I was having a twilight phase and I thought he could sense my sarcasm. He’s never the one to say I love you, nor has he told me in the past 12 months. He’s very much one of those people that won’t say it until he’s 10000% sure. I only recently said it on Friday since I had to say something to try and sway his mind. I’ve known for a long time that I loved him but I was always too shy of saying something because I didn’t want to freak him out. He dumped me because in his mind he had no intention of doing anything romantic or sexual. We’ve known each other for 12 months and the most we’ve done has been cuddling, no kissing, no sex, no nothing. Which I’m perfectly fine with but idk I guess he wants me to find someone who can provide me with that or he got tired of pretending. After he broke up with me, he said he wanted months of ghosting so he could get over me. Please keep in mind that he broke up with me over phone as soon as I woke up. I had barely woken up at 10 am on Friday psyched to see him when he asked me to call. I knew it would be serious because he never calls me but I was simply expecting him to cancel hahah.
We came with a compromise that as long as he wouldn’t ghost me I wouldn’t demand to see him to give my side of the story. He really wanted to hear it but he said he just couldn’t see me. I was obviously hurt by this a ton but at the end of the day he was my best friend and I didn’t want to lose contact so I was willing to give up a final meetup. I’m obviously still in love with him but he said he wanted his space so I genuinely don’t know what to do. Do I reach out again and ignore his bubble or do I simply stay quiet and wait for him to say something. On Sunday, I got into a miny car accident (I went over the curve at McDonald’s and my car wended up hovering cuz I’m a dumbass lol) and I was going to use that as an excuse to message him and then tell him how I feel yet again. I reallly really really want to but he said that right now he just needs time. but I really miss him and stuff and I want to hear how he’s been because I’ve been a hot mess and I really hope he’s not going through the same.",30Jul2019,1
453,"Should have probably posted this last night but I need serious advice on whether or not to quit. 
It’s a long story but I’ll try to sum it up. 
I’ve been working at a bank for about two years and I’m absolutely miserable. My experience there started out good, but over the last about 8 months it’s completely gone down hill. 

I could go on and on about their issues but I’ll just try to go over some of the main things that are bothering me. 

1.) I’ve offered to help out around the branches in town before because hours=money and I like to make sure I’m a solid employee willing to be flexible. But I feel completely taken advantage of at this point. Started with asking me if I wanted more hours, and now they just randomly schedule me wherever they want, whenever they want, or they TELL me I’m working doubles. Which normally I’d be fine with this because I’m their employee, but I’ve told them 100 times that right now it’s just not possible for me to be working a bunch. (I had to actually switch to a different position with less hours because I’ve been dealing with a heart condition, but because they keep scheduling me whenever they want I’m working almost full time) 
2.) I was promised my new position would be 7am-12:30 but because of the previous thing I’m staying late, coming early, working doubles, working at all 3 branches in town.. sometimes all 3 in one day. 
3.) I was told when I got this new position that I would be working 1-2 Saturdays a month. I’ve been in my new position for 4 months. Of those 16 weeks, I’ve had 1 off. 
4.) When I am in need of time off it seems like it’s a huge deal. I’m willing to help them out whenever, cover for people... but if I ask someone for an hour off or ask someone to cover for me literally no one makes it a priority to help me, even though I help them. SOMETIMES, they are fine about this and just give me the day off when I’m really symptomatic so I don’t want to throw them completely under the bus. 
5.) Coworkers are horrible. No one really gets along, training isn’t kept a priority so half the time people don’t know what they’re doing, and all the branches train differently so you never really know. Coworkers treat each other horribly. No one works as a team, half the time they sit around and when I’m supposed to be locking up for the day they won’t help anymore so I’m stuck there an hour after I’m off to help people while they do nothing. 
6.) Management is awful. All three supervisors I’ve worked under were very rude to me, some even accused me of making up my heart condition, I’ve been yelled at for the dumbest things (while they pick and choose favorites, another employee will make the same mistake as me and not get yelled at) 1 of the supervisors I worked under literally didn’t even know how to use the program we use to run transactions. 
7.) I feel like I don’t get fairly compensated for what I actually put in there. I get paid as a part time employee because that’s my position, get incentives for a part time employee, no PTO, no breaks... yet I’m working 30-40 hours a week, and people who work less than me are getting benefits, better incentives etc. 
8.) Not at all interested in banking, I’m going into psychology... so since all this has been happening, making me super unhappy I’m not even enthusiastic about my work anymore. I’m completely burnt out. My head is in auto mode while I’m there. I don’t even know how to be productive anymore.",30Jul2019,1
454,"Thank you for reading. 

Lately I've felt like the archetype for a person that's lost in their life. The 1 year anniversary of my father's passing is coming up in about a week and it has me reflecting on everything. My mother passed about 8 months before my Dad did, and I spent about a year and a half returning from living as a teacher overseas to care for them as their illnesses progressed. The last year has been spent tending to the details of their lives now that they're gone, doing things like selling the house, managing inheritance, dispersing special memory items, etc. My parents were pretty much the only family I had that I'm in touch with. The few other people still alive from my family are all estranged. 

When I returned home I somehow managed to find a decent paying office job that worked to help non-English speaking healthcare patients. It was something I enjoyed at first but wore on me after a while. The job was for a small family-style company and there was no chance of promotion or raise or any career advancement really. It's more like I was the HR guy for an 8 person company. It was good for me at the time and helped me settle back into the US but the work was often monotonous and meaningless and there wasn't anywhere to go from there. My parents passed while i was working that job, and call it depression or laziness or whatever but regardless of the 'reason' they fired me. 

Now I work full time on an organic farm. My degree is just one of the ""degree for a degree's sake"" types, honestly probably the prime example for that idea (Philosophy major.) The farming work is good but there's no chance to make enough money to support myself. I live now probably about 80% off the farm job with the last 20% trickling in from inheritance. There is enough left over from my parents' that I could keep living this way for years but it hurts me to do it this way. I know it'd be better to save it or put it towards something meaningful like some sort of career-focused schooling. So the need to find a more sustainable job is pressing against me too, despite the fact that I personally enjoy what I've found for the time being. 

It just feels so difficult to get my feet under me again. I'm someone who always had a plan. I traveled the world, studying abroad at first and then working my way into helping with the programs themselves. My trips always focused on the developing world, (usually India), and I went on to become a teacher in some truly incredible and wild situations. It was only a few years ago I was driving a motor scooter past rice paddies to work everyday (while comedically dressed in a full suit.) I've nearly fallen off mountains, been attacked by monkeys, and become friends with some truly inspiring people. The value of experience in life and the individual choices we make for ourselves is something that's never been lost on me. I've always sought to make my life an adventure, one that can hopefully add to the lives of others in the process. 

Yet all that is just heady language when stacked against the reality of bills and aging. I don't know how to transform those travel years and all that passion into a serious career. Yet due to my vague bachelor's in Philosophy, it feels difficult to approach more schooling. I'd love to go for something like Ecology or Environmental Science but everything I've read has been a bit disheartening in terms of meeting their standards. 

I'm sorry if this seems incoherent. Maybe that's just a reflection of the place I'm coming from. I've gone from this international adventure life to years of sedentary living back in my hometown. Getting back in the international sphere has its own appeal too, but I'm also approaching an age where the larger questions of what to do with life itself somewhat eclipses that heady escape. It seems like it's more of an internal personal call towards something spaceless. Maybe that's what draws me to the larger ""skill"" focus relating to something like Environmental Science. I have skills from working with people with developmental disabilities, working in healthcare recruiting, being a teacher, farming and travel navigation, but these are all more scattered than focused. They're not a single unified sense of purpose. 

Then there's just the fact that they're gone. It still weighs on me, even after almost a year for my Dad and more than a year and a half for my mom. Some people tell me I should give myself more time to grieve. Yet somehow it feels almost like I'm at an age where I should be ready for something like this. There's still always this need to function. You can't just tune out of life to mourn, no matter how great the pain is. You still gotta go to work and pay bills and talk to people and live. I've been doing all that, wondering if I give myself enough credit for the pain I feel or if I'm just exaggerating that pain to find excuses to be lost. It's all so ambiguous and painful and at the end of every reflection I have on it all I seem to do is shrug and push through another day. 

If you've lost a loved one and/or have advice please add your thoughts. Thanks again for your time.",30Jul2019,1

456,"I often think about doing things that are extremely out of character for me. For example I could be outside walking my dog and I might look at him and think something along the lines of ""I could punt this little shit across the street and no one is close enough to stop me.""

457,"So its kind of a long backstory but idrc cuz I feel like I need to get this out. We’ve known each other since middle school and became really close in high school. We were in the same clique and like a lot of high school cliques, ours started to disband in our senior year, which was over 2 years ago. During that time of disbandment, we became even closer to the point where it felt like it was just us. Especially since certain drama created some weird beef between our previous best friends coincidentally at the same time. This was when I started to catch feelings for her. I remember thinking that, maybe eventually she’ll feel the same and she’ll catch feelings for me as well. So we stayed friends.

Then we graduated and she moved out of town (about 1-2 hours away) for college while I stayed in our hometown. I remember her telling me how hard it was for her to make friends there and I honestly felt the same here since we only talked to each other. So whenever she would come down for the weekend, we would hang out, except it would be just us. Basically dating. We would go places that couples would go to, eat at nice restaurants, but we never did anything romantic like hold hands and stuff and I never tried to make a move since I never felt like there was any sign that she liked me back. 

So with no friends besides each other, and my great feeling of loneliness, around the first month that college started, I confessed my feelings for her. I told her that I feel like we should start dating since we were already doing ‘dating’ things and that we were each others best friends. Obviously she didnt feel the same way. But she really enjoyed being my friend, so for her sake, I told her I would be willing to just stay as friends then. Basically just putting myself in the friendzone. So, we stayed friends and continued our ‘hangouts’ and that didnt help me at all. I felt like I was trapped in a dead end, with no friends to talk to besides her, and no one to go to for advice. So a couple months later I told her I need to distance myself from her cuz on top of adjusting to college life, it was taking a toll on my mental health. She understood and let me be. 

It only lasted about 4 months before I came back to her. During those 4 months I felt so lonely, to the point where I felt like I had high-functioning depression. That affected my ability to make friends in class which made it even worse, so I gave in. This time I kept telling myself I would keep a respectable distance so as to only stay as friends. And I somehow convinced myself that I no longer had feelings for her. But of course I found myself back to being trapped in this unrequited love. It didn’t help that she decided to act oblivious to my former confession to her. I never knew why she would act like it never happened when I felt like it was a pretty big moment in our friendship. So I cut her off, and by that I told her that I can’t talk to her anymore cuz of how emotionally draining it was and how it fucked up my mental health and again, she understood and let me be. 

This time, it turned out a lot better. For the first 2-3 months I became more social and made some new friends in classes, I got a job where I met a lot of cool people who I consider to be my best friends today, and I even reconnected with some old friends from my former clique in high school. I was finally back on my feet and felt like I couldnt be any better. 

Then, a friend of mine who moved to the same college as her and became friends with her, told me that she misses me. And at first I was like “psshh, I’m ready to talk to her. I know what I’m doing and won’t let myself repeat the last year and a half. It’ll be different this time” So like an idiot I started texting her again. We hung out like usual. But this time instead of all my attention going to her, I had other friends to worry about now so I wasn’t as focused on her. I hung out with my other friends more as to draw attention away from her and summer was fun. I was very cautious as to keep my distance, always making sure to not get too close or not do anything stupid. But idk if it was the stress from school or something but we began to vent out to each other and then we became really close again. And of course I caught feelings. You would think I would learn my mistake the 3rd time but no. I remember thinking about how this time, we’re older now and more mature so maybe she understands me now. On top of that, my friend told me that she said she ‘kind of’ thought i was cute. So I say something along the lines of “We’re best friends, we do couple things like go to nice places with just us, eat at nice restaurants with just us, and only we know each other so well, so why not date?” 

Somehow, the conversation turned into an argument. It went from confessing my feelings to asking her why she ignores my feelings and acts oblivious. She took that as an offense and went off on me about how she only wanted to preserve our friendship. So she suggested we not be friends anymore. And me being petty, agreed and blocked her on all social media. I didn’t block her phone number tho. I remember feeling free again. Of course the first couple weeks were hard, but eventually I almost totally forgot about her. Couple months pass and its April of this year, when on my shift at work I see her sister who is three years younger than us and who looks almost exactly like her, come into  the store. As soon as I saw her I felt my fight or flight instincts come in, thinking that if her sister is here, she might be here too. so I ran to the back room. Eventually I figured it was just the sister that came in so I came back to the front and said hi since we knew each other. But ever since then its like she’s back in my head. It didn’t help that the next week was her birthday and I would see snapchat memories of us hanging out. It felt like all my progress I had made just blew away and now I’m back to thinking about her. Which is exactly where I am right now. 

I told myself I would get over it in the next month since summer was almost here. And a month passed and I still thought about her and how she was doing. And meanwhile I’m having fun with my new friends over summer and going out, I even had a couple of summer flings but still I can’t help but wonder how shes doing. I want to text her, but i dont know if I’m just trying to give myself a reason to text her, or if I genuinely want to know how shes doing. I don’t trust myself to make the right decision. All I know is that this conflict has been in my head for almost 5 months now and it really fucks with my happiness sometimes. Like sometimes I feel like I’d be better of just texting her and catching up with her. But at the same time I don’t want to even put myself at risk of going thru it all again. Idk I feel like I can’t get my peace of mind without resolving this. But also, maybe I shouldn’t find closure and I just have to wait a little longer and it’ll go away. I want someone to be able to tell me what to do. If you have to break something harsh to me, I would rather hear it now than later. Thanks for reading this far and maybe this whole thing will lead me to finally rest easy.",30Jul2019,2
458,"This might sound arrogant, but I really don't mean it. I was raised by a family which only has 1 goal. And that is ""Looking perfect from the outside"". So I was perfect all my life. I was always clean and showered every day even as a kid. I was always the best in class. I was always friendly. I always helped everyone. I was always the most successful person. You know that kid in school which is good in math ? The kid that is good in sport ? The kid that can speak multiple languages. I was all these kids combined basically.

The older you get the more problems you notice about yourself. And then it happens. Problems pop up that you can't fix to keep the illusion of being perfect up. May it be that you are balding, that you are short, that you have a tendency to get obese, that you are less intelligent, that you have a personality disorder etc.

Some things just can't get fixed or it's at least really hard. And everybody learns to accept their mistakes and problems and negative traits during their childhood, but I didn't.

459,"I know some people stay friends with others that aren’t that nice just to have friends and people to hang out with. But, I can’t seem to do this. 

I’m a 31yr old female living in Los Angeles, CA, this is where I’ve lived my whole life. I‘m a pretty likable person, I think. Although I am more of an introvert, I know the importance of making small talk, asking questions, being charming, not awkward and all of that. Therefore, when I meet other girls at events or gatherings I seem to be liked, more than once they have asked me for my number to grab lunch or coffee in the future and just hang out. 

My issue though is that I can read people extremely well. So, right off the bat I know if someone truly can be a potential friend or not. So that excludes a bunch of people as soon as I meet them. And, let’s say I do like a girl and would like to be friends with her, the moment I notice something off in her personality I step away. Think Maya Angelou and her famous quote, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” I’m actually more forgiving than Miss Angelou and give everyone the benefit of a doubt, a second chance if you will. I figure sometimes people are having a bad day or they expressed themselves incorrectly without realizing it. But, after a while I realize they’re not very nice or centered people so I discard them. I don’t want friends like that, I like nice, kind people and I feel I shouldn’t have to put up with crap like that. And so my question is, Is that a bad thing? Because I genuinely would like to have friends, I just can’t seem to find people I’d like to be friends with. Is it that I’m just too judgmental? I don’t know...

I’ll give you a few examples - 

1. I met a lady who was about 15 years older than me, a professor, she was really fun and energetic. Yet, she tended to be rude to people. I noticed it once and let it pass since I figured that’s how her and her friend got along. But, then we went to a karaoke party and she was so rude to multiple people on the same night and towards people she didn’t even know well. So, I thought, this is how she will eventually want to treat me at some point. No thanks. She was also a lesbian and although she assured me that she’d never hit on me since we were friends she did try a few times. She’d get just a little too close for comfort at times and that was very distressing for me. I’m a straight woman and have zero desire to be with another woman, ever. 

2. I met another girl whose very well spoken, truly eloquent, and I liked that because I feel I need to be more that way. She was around my age, fun to hang out with. A wannabe actress, but I figured I wouldn’t judge her for it. We do live in LA. Yet, she made multiple comments about how she wants to meet a rich man to marry so that she never has to work again in her life, she doesn’t want to have kids or deal with pets and just wants to be taken care of. I went to her apartment once and she had a bunch of vision boards all throughout her apartment, like a good 30. Now, I’m not saying we can’t have dreams and aspirations, but some of her comments sounded down right delusional. I also know beauty isn’t everything, but she’s like a solid 4, and saying things like that just sounded stupid to me. It was very off putting. 

3. Then I had another friend and she was unemployed although she’d tell everyone we met that she was in PR and dealt with clients. At first I didn’t know she was unemployed, but I caught on as we hung out more and she opened up to me about the interviews she was going to. She had—had a 7 month relationship with a guy who ended things with her since he didn’t want anything more than a girlfriend and didn’t want to waste her time since he knew she would eventually want to get married and he just didn’t see that in his future plans. So, anyway, here her and I were talking about this ex boyfriend still after a year and a half after he dumped her. She’d been mourning the breakup longer than what they were even together, which technically was only 4 months since the first 3 they were just friends. Any who, she’d also throw little tantrums here and there sometimes and it was very uncomfortable for me since I don’t like causing scenes in public. 

If you’ve gotten to this point of my post I want to thank you for reading it all the way through. I honestly just want to know if I’m being too picky with the friends I choose and if that’s a good thing or a bad thing? I don’t mind my company, I like doing things alone all the time. But, it would be nice to have a friend I could go have a drink with sometimes or a girls dinner date. I haven’t had a boyfriend in two years so I’d like to go to a bar every once in a while with a friend and see if we can meet guys. I obviously can’t do this by myself, so if you guys have any advice for me I’d greatly appreciate it. 

Thank you in advance :)",30Jul2019,1

461,"So, last year at my high school there was a girl who I was really close to. I would hang out with her at least once a week and we would always walk to classes together. I always thought she was amazing and good looking and smart but I never had the guts to ask her out although I did flirt a bit. Now here is the advice needed part. We were talking about something and I said something that I forgot lmao but I remember her replying with ""i thought you would (blah blah blah) with you being gay and all"" she then grinned as if making a joke. According to my brother she was shit testing me and I should have asked her out. Is this what I should have done? Also do you think that was just a friendly joke or more I did have something to lose though as she was one of my only friends. 

Im asking this now because I feel like my life could be a whole lot different if I did something different on that day.

For a bit of other information, we currently don't talk much any more due to us being in different classes and all that. Also another thing that may help give me advice is that on the last day of English class we had this little kareoke dance thing where there would be either someone singing at the front of the class or music playing and some people were dancing and she got up from her seat and asked if I would like to dance, I accepted but never really thought anything of it at the moment.

Thank you in advance",30Jul2019,0
462,"First of all, with all due respect, I need it to be known that I do not need any sort of judgement or chastising. Please don't make me feel any worse about this than I already do. I just need judgement-free advice.

I am almost 26 years old and I graduated from college with a degree two years ago. I now work a job that's Monday through Friday, 8am-2:30 pm. It pays $10.50 per hour. I have plans that I will move up at the place that I work at within a year and will be making 30k. I still live with my parents because I can't afford yet to move out and I have some chronic illnesses I'll explain a little about. My parents said they are totally fine with me living with them still. I am trying to move asap, but it'll probably won't happen until I have the 30k job.

I did and continue to do this despite battling really awful mental and physical health issues that I am just now just barely starting to recover from, including psychotic depression, autism, severe anxiety, chronic fatigue, and an eating disorder. The past two years I have continued working depsite how horrific these illnesses have been to me. It was by far the hardest thing I ever went through but I continued to do my job, work hard and do well at my job.

I most definitely want to continue working despite these conditions. I refuse to quit my job or totally rely on my parents for absolutely everything. But this year, I will be needing to get my own health insurance (turning 26, live in the US) and I have to get a new car. I will be able to pay for these things myself, but just barely. I definitely won't be able build up more savings this year. To compensate for this, my parents want me to work a second job. I am extremely worried about this due to my current state of mental and physical health. I give every ounce of myself to the job I have now and it is not easy on my health at all. I really don't think beginning to work another job would be best for me in my current situation. It is NOT that I just don't want to work or don't understand the importance of saving money, I am just extremely concerned for my health. I am already pushing myself extremely hard. And again, I CAN already pay for the things that I need to pay for, the only thing is that I won't be building up savings this year like I normally do. 

My parents, for the most part, know exactly how much I have struggled with my issues and how hard I've worked to try to overcome them, but have not mentioned any concern for my health when telling me about how much they want me to get another job. 

I just really don't think a second job would be the best thing for me right now. I am scared for myself. I am extremely dedicated to the job I have now and pay for everything I need myself. A second job is not absolutely necessary for me to survive right now but I understand why my parents want me to get one. I'm just very worried for myself, physically and mentally.

What should I do? Am I in the wrong for not wanting to get a second job because of my health? I don't want to sound like I'm just trying to be lazy; it's not that at all. Like I said, I'm putting a tremendous amount of hard work into my job, into improving my health, and into becoming a healthy, functioning adult. How do I speak to my parents about my concerns? I'm afraid they won't understand.",30Jul2019,1
463,"Long story short, some former friends and coworkers of mine have reached out to me, resulting in me getting a job offer of the type I cannot refuse. I checked out the new company, and it looks really good, so I have accepted the position.

Now, over to my current position. I am really not looking forward to handing in my resignation. I'm currently working at a small company, and my current boss is probably the most understanding boss anyone could ever ask for, and I do consider my boss and my coworkers my friends. 

Ideally I would resign in person, as I consider anything less than that somewhat disrespectful, but due to holidays this is simply not possible (I only have two days until the end of the month, so time is running out). I therefore have to do this by phone.

What do I say? How should I phrase this? After all the help I've gotten from my current job, I can't help but feel like I'm stabbing people in the back. There's nothing wrong with my current job, and the only reason for leaving is that the new job fits my long term plans better.

464,"Baisically I'm 19 years old, fairly introverted, I don't have many friends and I have unpopular intrerests. 

To elaborate on that, I have interests that would be considered ""nerdy"", like gaming, reading or Dungeons and Dragons, for example and because of that I have always had trouble finding friends. I am the only person out of my friendgroup that does not have a seperate friend group and because we just left school, I spend most of my time at home.

And I am pretty happy with that, I don't need a full schedule as long as I still regularly get to see my friends, so I just spend my time with my hobbies. Like gaming, drawing or watching stuff on Youtube.

The problem that led to asking this question, is that I just ordered a piece of merch from one of my favourite shows and as it arrived my mom asked me what it was from, so I startded explaining a little. I wasn't toatally getting into it, just trying to give my mom a brief understanding, to which she automatically slightly disregarded it.  
Like ""Oh so it's only a fictional thing."". I wanted to defend myself a little by explaining why I got into it and that I have alot of fun with it, after which she responded with ""You're wasting you're young life with that?"". 

After she noticed that she has upset me with it she was backtracking, saying it was only a joke and I shouldn't take everything so personally. But with that comment she hit a nerve on me, as I have always been struggling with accepting that I wasn't popular.

I usually feel happy with my interests, as I still go out from time to time and meet my friends, wich have the same intrests as me. But sometimes, like right now I don't know if I'm really wasting my life with that and if it's wrong spending my time like I do.",30Jul2019,1

So I applied to a ton of places about a month ago and have since got a job offer at a company that does sub-prime financing for people with poor credit.

I need real answers. the reason I'm on reddit asking for thoughts on this, is because everyone in my family takes sides. I need a neutral opinion.

lets get to it then,,



I'm 14 years old. last year was my last year of middle school, and my first year of online school. I liked it at first, but only because it was easy. it wasn't easy because of the work and stuff like that. It was easy because it was 100 times easier to cheat and skip out on classes. and that's just what I did. I would join the classes and mute my pc and then when class was over I would look up all the answers for the work. I did that for over half the year.

 anyway. I passed. going onto my first year of highschool. my dad has me signed up for the online school again. and I do not want to do that. I know myself. And that I will certainly cheat again if I have the chance. I don't want to do that. and that's not the only reason I don't want to do the online school. I also want to have those real experiences of going out and seeing people daily and going to the school events talking to friends in between periods just being able to physically see people. those real things I never got to have during online school.

but living with my dad, I have to do the online school. he said I can either go live with my grandma and do the brick-and-mortar school, or stay with him and do online school. 

I don't want to move away from my dad. I lived with him since I was 6. I have a cat I can't leave. this house is the only thing I see is home-

474,"Hi all! I hope this is the right thread for this.

I recently moved into a new rental place for my next year at uni. It's lovely, but the house is nearing 200 years old, and has basically original plumbing. This means the dryer in the house has never worked, and the landlords have tried to resolve the issue but nothing has quite worked. This means we only have the option of hanging clothes to dry, which I'm not used to, and have not yet had much success with. Both times I've done laundry, it's taken 2+ days to fully dry, and has always smelled wet and musty, despite smelling nice straight out of the machine.

I'll admit the first time was my fault: I overloaded the machine with both clothes and detergent. But the second time I only 3/4 filled the machines and used one laundry pod per load. It was certainly better, but still retained a damp smell. I also currently have to time my laundry around the landlords (they live in) so I can have the clothes horse. Once I have some more money I'll buy my own so this won't be an issue.

Basically, is there anything I can do to help this issue? I feel as though I'm quite sensitive to smell and honesty, having my towels and clothes smell off is really making me feel ill, since I can't shake the smell at all. I currently wash my clothes on eco for about 1hr 15. I definitely hang the clothes up correctly, so they're not folded/on top of each other/etc. They don't seem too wet when they come out of the machine, but should I be spinning them to help them dry?

Sorry if I sound utterly clueless. I've only ever done laundry in my uni's machines or at home, both of which had a drier.",30Jul2019,1

i, for about six months, started hearing these weird voices, i was almost immediately sure were birds chanting my name. i called them alex birds and something about them made me horribly uneasy. the sound of them made me feel scared and unsafe and i hated them. the first time i heard them i was at a school camp and it was the middle of the night so i just put it down to being some weird local bird. then i went home and kept hearing them and i haven’t heard them for a couple weeks but they’re back today. i hear them during the day, during night, it really varies, but only when im alone.

if i am ever home alone without my parents i slowly become increasingly paranoid and certain something is in the house. not necessarily a person but just something is here. there’s nothing actually in the house that makes me think that and when im with my parents here i cant feel that same fear that i get alone.

i also have started hearing weird pulsing noises that i cant explain. it doesn’t really have a pitch, just a steady sound pulsing. it doesn’t scare me but just makes me feel on edge. i never understand it. i can hear the pulsing as i am typing this and i hate it. if you have any ideas please help me out.

477,"I found out in June, a week before my 22nd birthday that my dad has terminal cancer and only has about six months to live. I’m really close with all of my family but especially my dad, I can honestly say he is my best friend and I’ve always spent a lot of time with him. I had a stroke when I was a baby and I’ve always hard a hard time dealing with that and the fact that I walk with a limp and my left hand doesn’t work well as it should and he has always been there for me with everything and I’m am completely depressed that I’m going to lose him. He was doing well but his health has began to decline rapidly in the last week and I don’t think he’ll make it six months, I’ll be surprised if he makes it to November so it’s likely he will die half way through the semester. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and older brother about 3 hours from where my dad lives and where I grew up but he has moved in with us to be with his family and so we can take care of him. 

I’m a university student in a very time consuming and demanding program. The program I’m in has one semester of school and then a work term so I only ever do one semester of school in a row. I’m on a work term now for the summer but supposed to go into term 6 of 8 in the fall, then another work term in the winter. I haven’t had a semester off in over two years, even when I’m on a work term I have to do courses on top of working 40 hours a week and I’m after four years with two more to go I’m so sick of it and I don’t even like what I’m doing. I’ve always been terrified about failing school and I study a lot and stress about it too much, even at the best of time school makes me depressed, I barely see my friends when I’m in school because I study so much, I know that’s my own fault but my anxiety about school is really bad. Next semester is supposed to be the hardest one and I don’t know if I’ll be able to be in school 9-5 everyday, do 4 labs a week, tests, assignments and everything else that comes with school, deal with all the stress and depression I currently have in my life and take care of my dad at the same time. I also want to spend as much time with him as I can before he dies.

With all this, if I don’t go back to school in the fall I have to wait a year to go back since term 6 courses are only offered in the fall since that’s when term 6 takes place and I’m already a year behind because I failed out my first year and spent second year getting back in. Since 2017 I’ve been in every class with the same 22 people and I want to continue and finish my degree with my class and the people I’ve became friends with over the last couple years. I’ve always been kinda ashamed of myself and don’t like meeting new people so I’d like to stay with the people I’m comfortable with some of them I’ve known almost my whole life.

My dad will also feel really guilty if I don’t go back to school in the fall, he has told me that so I don’t want to disappoint him. When we found out that he was terminally ill he told me one of the things that makes him the saddest is that he won’t get to see me graduate, so I don’t know what to do, the last couple months has been the worst time of my life, everyday is torture and it’s not going to get better for a long time 

Tldr; my dad is going to die soon and I don’t know if I can handle the stress of caring for him and losing my dad on top of a very stressful university program

480,"I'm just going to cut to the chase; this is probably going to be long anyway.

My neighbours (two parents, a set of grandparents, and three children between 6 and 18) currently have (to my knowledge) two dogs and three cats. I'm going to call the cats Pearl, Princess, and August and the dogs Luna and Cream, which aren't entirely their real names. It's apparently against their religion to castrate or sterilise animals so none of these animals are sterilised.

During the spring, Luna always gets pregnant by accident and usually gives birth right around when the neighbours start school and working. So they put all the puppies in a wooden pen in the very hot garden, with two dirty bowls and puts a leash on Luna so she's just out of reach of her puppies. The puppies are LOUD, they get aggressive, and eat and drink anything you give them because they're so hot and hungry. The neighbours youngest son (maybe 6 or 7) is symbolically their caretaker and will throw the puppies around, generally being very rough with them. The parents and grandparents have seen this and when I've been there, never told him to stop in any way. Cream is Luna's daughter from last year's litter and I haven't seen her since then. Luna is always on a leash outside without access to water or anywhere comfortable to sleep, day and night.

The cats are also related. Pearl is the oldest cat and they've had her since I was a child. I think she's still alive but I haven't seen her in years. Princess is Pearl's daughter. Her, I've seen a lot. She's locked outside most of the winter and cries all evening every evening when it's cold. She'll try to sneak into my house to warm herself and eat my cats food and when approached is very aggressive. She'll scratch and bite hard and it's obvious to me at least that she's terrified of everyone and everything. She got pregnant this year and while she was pregnant, her owners left for vacation and had no one to give her food or water. She eventually gave birth and they kept August. August is now 2 or 3 months old, and they left yet again for holiday, for several weeks this time and had the builders that were working on their house look out for them. August got lost (because he's way too young to be outside yet) and the entire neighbourhood was out looking for him. He was found again after three days and they're still letting him walk around wherever.

I sent in an anonymous report to the norwegian animal protection and said just about the same thing in May but it doesn't seem like it's done anything and it's really upsetting to hear their pets make so much noise all the time.

Maybe it's not my business but I don't know what I can do. Directly I'm hurt by Princess scratching me (really deep) whenever she sneaks into my house and my cat gets stressed from both her and August being in his house.",30Jul2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

So, when I was in elementary I had to memorize *pages, word by word* of homework. Nothing is bad about that. After studying for 5-6 hours per day on the *weekends* and was telling the studied subject to my mom (while my father was in the room too). I always asked my dad if I was clever and he always said something like ""Uhhhhh, yeah....."". I was 7-8 years old at the time and that blunt shit hurt like hell.

When I got into middle school or high school (it's the same where I live and differs from the American system). These happened when I was a 5-6-7 grader. When I got a bad grade, my parents yelled at me for hours at the time. I got one F per year. Where I live, there's this electronic diary where parents could see their child's grades. My mom checked it all the time and if she saw that I got a bad grade (C) I would get yelled at for hours (again). From that time, when I saw her check it, my stomach always flipped and I got very stressed and anxious (I was a pretty good student though). After finding a grade that they don't like, as I mentioned, the shouting began. After that, they wouldn't interact with me for **days**. Like, I would say hi/good morning/good night and they just straight up ignored me. When I asked something they wouldn't even look at me and just say ""Yeah"" or ""No"" bluntly. They often said that they will throw my TV out of the window.

\~Outside of school\~

Once (when I was an 8th grader, I think) we went to a shopping mall to buy new shoes for me. There was this pair of shoes that my father picked for me. It was pink and had a style which I didn't really like. I told him kindly that I didn't like them. He said ""Okay then, let's take a photo of them and tomorrow, when you go to school, show the photo to your classmates, so they can see what a missed opportunity this was for you."" I was livid, but didn't show it.

I couldn't sleep in the dark (still can't). I usually asked my mom to sleep with me because I was afraid of the dark (this was before they got me my night-light). My dad always told me, in an angry tone, that he will take me to a psychologist because of my ""dumb"" fear. But this wasn't the only time when he straight up told me that my fears are a bunch of crap. He always asked why I was afraid of this and that, in a degrading kind of tone. Like, being afraid of something is a sign a stupidity. His antics still baffle me up to this day (am 17).

He never said admitted that he was wrong. I never got this answer when I was right about something. Even when I looked it up on the Internet, he still wouldn't say that.

He always expressed his disgust and disapproval if he didn't like something I liked. I was and still is a common occurance. For example, clothes. I like black and hate pink. He thinks girls should wear girly colours. When I picked something I liked very much, he (almost) always said that it's ugly and not lady-like.

He praised his colleague's son for being ""so clever"". One or two times he even compared me to him. (Worst thing to do if you're a parent, in my opinion.)

""Don't you dare to cry!""

So, I think that's why I'm always anxious, self-conscious, having low-selfesteem, stressing, etc.

484,"my girlfriend has been on zoloft for a couple months. cool no problems. but i get extremely worried when she mixes it with other drugs. not too long ago she drank a glass of wine with dinner and got very drunk when before she could handle her alcohol previ to zoloft. last night she took 2 gabapentin without telling me till i had been talking to her for a couple hours. she was typoing all over the place to the point of it being nearly incoherent. i asked her if she was drunk or high or inebriated in anyway she said no. i asked if she was lying and again no. later she tells me she took 2 gabapentin her dad gave her (piece of shit) for back pain (she said she was lifting heavy objects earlier in the week). she then started talking about how she couldnt hold the phone and that typing was hard. she proceeded to complain about feeling very sick and having a piercing headache. she gets migraines and feels sick from time to time but not as bad as she was describing. just earlier yesterday before she took them we got in an argument over text about her drinking. it was weird. she agreed with me and said she understood why i was worried with her mixing drugs and zoloft but seemed upset with me. she doesnt drink or smoke normally and when she does its almost always with me. i kept texting her that night until eventually she just left me on read. i keep telling myself shes fine and just fell asleep as thats one of the symptoms of gabapentin (drowsiness). But i was so fucking worried that i stayed up all night worrying. in retrospect i shouldve called her but i didnt in fear she wouldnt pick up cause then id really freak out. i hate worrying this much and i think i have valid reasons for worrying but i dont know. Am i worrying too much? are my concerns valid? and if so what should i do to stop her from doing stuff like this? shes had a history of drug abuse with alcohol and xanax. and im really worried she underestimates how low her tolerance is from zoloft. shell smoke weed and have a full on manic episode then shake it off the next day like it was no big deal.
i love her so much and im definitely not willing to break up with her as of right now. but this worrying is really starting to take a toll on me.
side note: before anyone says just talk with her, i have and plan to again whenever she wakes up.",30Jul2019,2
485,"So basically we're both students, been together 2 years now. And we've seen a great apartment which we can afford and have applied and viewed it. We're planning on moving in late to mid August and couldn't be more excited to live together with our own privacy and peace and quiet.

The only problem is that we will be sleeping together in the same bed obviously, because we're a couple and we love each other. We are not married though.

His parents are really strict when it comes to stuff like this, and when I stopped getting on with my mum and moved into his parent's house with him  we've been sleeping in separate bedroom at night and I miss him. I respect their wishes as Christian's as they don't believe in sex before marriage or anything of that nature if we've not made an official commitment to each other.

We don't plan on doing this any time soon because we're still young but will get married I'm sure, when the time is right as we've talked about this.

They will be helping us move in and obviously will then see the fact that it's only a 1 bedroom flat with a double bed. And will work it out one way or another that we're sleeping in the same bed together, which they don't approve of.

My partner said that we should bring his single bed that he has now and put it in the living room in the corner, so to appear like we sleep in separate rooms ie to please his parents. But I just don't see why we should do that. We're adults, we're not christian and they know that (much to their dismay). I'm just sick of pretending that's normal. Plus the living room isnt huge with the sofa in and everything else so I don't want to have to take up unnecessary room for a bloody bed in my living room for no apparent reason.


What do you think? Do you think we should just have the double bed as is and just not mention it and see what they say? Or should we do what my partner says, which I think is a bit over the top personally.

490,"Tl, dr: we've been dating three months and everything she had ever said has led me to assume she was a virgin. I like her a lot but this is my first real relationship so I'm a virgin and this kinda stuff matters to me not only as a Christian, but as a character trait as well. 

Femanon and I have been dating for three months. I just turned 20 and this has been my first and only relationship other than a few dates and crushes here and there. Things have been going really well and I like her a lot, maybe love but i dont know. 

We've gotten to know each other really well, it feels like we've been together way more than just three months. We're both Christians and neither of us is the most dogmatic person ever, but it still matters a lot to both of us. I never thought she was perfect, and she's told me some stuff about in her past with an old boyfriend, basically that he was pushy and tried to get as far as he could with her and she didn't even like him that much. She never said anything more than that and really led me to believe that nothing really happened there. 

Like I said, our relationship has been going really well not only in terms of emotionally and our bonding, but she's started spending the night every now and then. We never had sex, mostly just dry humping and stuff until last week, when she went down on me. Now obviously I had no problem with that and ultimately I wouldnt have a problem with having sex before marriage eventually. 

However, last night we were texting about going hiking together and making fun summer plans and she asked me ""if there was anything she could have done in her past that would make me want to not be with her."" This being a week after our friend's gf just told him she had an abortion her freshman year of hs and they had a break but got back together. 

Like I said, she had never even hinted she had had sex with one of her two old bfs. I thought we were on the same page and then she tells me that she had indeed had sex with her old bf.

I cant believe she took so long to tell me. Obviously there is no good time to tell someone that, but she waited three months! Im not sure if that bothers me more or the fact that she actually had sex with another guy. 

Ultimately, I'm just looking for advice on how to move forward. This came out of nowhere and it really fucking hurts and I dont know why, it feels like she has been lying to me. She didnt intend to hurt me but that's exactly what she did. I dont want to break up with her, but how can I not think about this every moment I'm with her, let alone maybe have sex with her some day?",30Jul2019,1

502,"So for a bit of background, my wife was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety about 5 years ago. She is on medication and sees a psychiatrist. Our in-laws were told of this shortly after the diagnosis.

So here's the story: My wife and I went to her dad's camp this past weekend. We absolutley love going to their camp and always have a good time. We played some music, went swimming, went on some golf cart rides (it's more ""glamping"" than camping) and all of that. This is our third year going to camp. 

We got back home and my wife had a crash in her dopamine levels which left her really sad and her mind going to the worst possible place thinking her dads didn't want to inviter her there anymore and that she may never go back. I've seen this situation before. What I know helps is getting the party she's sad about to send her a nice heartfelt message to get her mind away from that dark place. I've done this with her mom and sister before and never had any issues. Well, I sent the message to her dads and her dad FREAKED. He was swearing up and down and was ""pissed off beyond belief"" that we ruined his weekend. He kept thinking that it was his fault and that we hated camp and that we didn't appreciate all the work they did. Well I got my wife to call them and all they kept saying was how upset this made them and how it ruined their weekend. We were shocked. My wife was having a depressive episode and all they kept saying was how THEIR feelings were hurt and its a tough situation for THEM. I tried to explain what depression was and how it worked in the brain as best I could, but they wouldn't hear it. Well, come the next day, her dad called and said sorry about the situation and that they were drinking but he still doesn't understand it at all. Her step-dad texted me the next day and said the same thing: it's an upsetting sitation for US. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I move forward with this? I feel like they grossly overreacted and now the relationship will never be the same. I'm still not exactly sure how it all happened. It's so weird. Both my wife and I were, and still are, really weirded out.

I recieved unemployment for this time while I search for a new job.

I have an interview today and they sent me a paper application to print and bring.

513,"(LONG)!!!

I am so indecisive, confused and upset at the same time, I don’t know what to do anymore so that I don’t upset anybody and I also don’t make a fool out of myself. 

Yesterday I went to a party (kind of a private one, not many people included), and there were also new people, friends of a common friend of mine, which I’ve never met them before. I made acquaintance with all of them, but there was this one guy that was extremely in your presence, like he was touching me and grabbing me by the waist from the back, holding my hand and kissing me on the cheek. At first when he did that I was so confused and not really comfortable so I was kinda showing him that I’m not really into it, since we barely even talked and I didn’t feel that comfortable, but I was still unsure of how I felt about that. But he did it like it was a normal thing, I was also not the only girl he did it to, he also went to other girls dancing with them from the back, you know the drill. 

However, whenever I was around him or close to him while I was trying to change the music, he was more physical with me and whispering to me how pretty I am and he also told me that he loves me (yes complete tOTAL bullshit I know). After a few hours and a couple of drinks the situation kinda changed a little bit. DISCLAIMER: The thing is that he is definitely an attractive teenager boy, and he’s handsome,  I for sure get it why the stories I’ve heard about him are so accurate (how many girls he fucked and what a fuckboy he is, yes I am DEFINITELY aware of that. I can smell bullshit from far away and I read people easily), and I see why someone would be sexually attracted to him, just as I was.

So what happened is that we started getting really close and dancing (yes I wanted that, if I didn’t I would’ve just refused him. But he made me tempted), so we started making out for a long time and getting ‘physical’ and stuff, we also slow danced to romantic music which he selected for us. He kept telling me that now I am his and that he loves me and other cheesy stuff. I noticed that some people from the party were gossiping about me because I got along with kissing him and it kinda made me feel guilty, I’ll explain later why. So after the party ended and we all got home, he texted me and asked me if I got home safe and how I feel, he also asked me if I want to go out with him the following days, I said yeah sure I’ll tell him when I am available (However, I had conflicted feelings about it). Now today he messaged me and asked me how I am and to tell him if I want to hang out with him later, I said that I will. And now he just texted me that he doesn’t know what to do because he can’t stop thinking about me.

So, what I am so bothered with in this situation and I don’t know what to do, is because at the party there was also his ex (which is very good friends with two of my friends that were also there). They used to date 2 months ago, for 6 months, they broke up because he admitted to her saying that he cheated on her with a girl he fucked for 3 hours. But what actually ended it all, is when he shouted with an insult at her, in public- And I just found out about this now, I knew he cheated on her, but didn’t know what exactly happened. However, she is cool with it now, doesn’t care what he does with whom, she’s over it. But, the thing is that a good girl friend of her (she wasn’t present at the party) is trying to date him and it’s reciprocated. But they’re not together, he’s still somehow single. So when his ex saw that he was all over me, she kept whispering to him reminding him about that girl and how he wanted to be with her/liked her. And all the people in the room knew about that, including me. (His ex also warned me that he is a big fuckboy, and I told her that I noticed and I knew that). So that’s why they were gossiping when we were making out. And this is why I feel guilty.

I just wanted to have a one night thing, have fun and make out with this boy, I did not care if he was a fuck boy and that he cheated in the past, I didn’t even plan to have a relationship or anything with him, I just wanted to make out. He obviously wants us to hang out and see each other again, and I have no idea what to do, I don’t know how I’m feeling about this situation. I have no idea what to answer to his last text (telling me he misses me), and when I asked one of my good friends for advice, she acted in a shady kinda way subtlely blaming the whole thing on me, because I was aware of that one girl. I have this guilty feeling which I can’t get rid of, I feel like all of those people are against me and I have no one’s support. If you ask me, I don’t know if I could be in a relationship with this guy, I mean the chances of it actually working are kinda low. You know what they say, once a cheater always a cheater, and it’s also about the way he acts with other girls and touches them and they all fall for it, he can’t be trusted.

So please, could you guys give me some advice?  I really do need some on what should I do about it and make things right.",30Jul2019,1
514," Hi I'm 17 and turning 18 in less then 2 months. And here in Sweden that means I am officially an adult, independent and free to do whatever I want to do (as long it isn't illegal). But with in my life that isn't the case, I feel like a prisoner within my own family. Before I start telling my story I want you guys to know that in Sweden even if you turn 18 you still have to graduate school before you move out and next month I'm starting my final year in school.

I'm going to list all my family memeber and give you a picture of my relasionship with each and single one of them and my problems with them. I'm starting with people that are no longer present in my life anymore. And I want also tell that I have 5 siblings and only 2 of them do I share both my parents with that's my younger siblings. The rest have individual fathers.

My father:

He has been out my life for almost 6 years which has been great. Because when he was present he use beat me and my mother a lot. I remeber that I used to be very scared of him and feeling like if I did the smallest thing I would beaten very badly. Apperently he started to do this when I was 1 years old. It all ended because he reported my mother for abusing me and my siblings and that she poisned us which was all bullshit. He did this because he wanted my mother to lose custody over us and he knew that he could not get custody over us because we hated him. During the investigation over this he hit my mother with his car. Ever since he lost I haven't seen him, but recently he has tried to contact me over social media but I have blocked him everywhere. I don't want to see his face ever again and I don't want to hear his voice ever again.

My oldest sister:

She is 10 years older then me and she has also been out of my life for almost 6 years. Her father was my mothers first husband and he died before she was born. She had some issues that I'm not sure what it was but she used to been in special classes and had some physical handicaps. Her legs were different one leg was bigger and taller then the other one. She used to be very disrespectful to my mother and call her names, she was unthankful when my mother had raised and treated her very well. She also physically attacked my mother mulitple times and told her that she hated her. She just one day packed her bags and left one month after I last saw my father. I pesonally never had any problems with her, but my problem was with the way she treated my mother who had always been there for her. It doesn't bother me that she is out my life it never did.

Now to people who are very present in my life and some of them I wish were not.

My mother:

The person I love the most in this entire world and means most to me. She has been there for me my whole life and has always backed me no matter what. Writing this I have realised that there have a lot of people that have treated my mother like shit and I want to hurt all of them. 2 of her husbands ( including my father) have tried to make sure that she lost custody of all her children. But she is a strong women and has fought through everthing she has faced. We talk a lot and disscuss future plans. And the problem of leaving my family is that I can't leave my mother I just can't.

My second oldest sister:

For this I call her Lizzie which is not her name. She is the reason I'm writing this and she is the reason I hate my family she is pure evil. She is 5 years older then me and ever since I can remember she has had power over me and treated me and my other siblings like humans that she owns. The reason for this is that when my mother was not home instead of paying a babysitter to take care of us she just told Lizzie to do it and this gave her power that she abused. She used to order us to things like wash the dishes, sweep the floor, take out the trash and go to the store, all of this while she just chilled or hanged out with friends. If we did something she didn't like she used to 1. use violance or 2. tell us to go sit in an empty room and let us be there for hours until she said we could come out. Up til now she was pretty much taken control over everything in my life and I can't do anything I want without Lizzie somehow knowing about it. She says cares about my mother but she does not, she only cares about her because my mother enables her to have power over us. The reason my mother enables her to do all of this because in her eyes Lizzie has helped her a lot she pays the bills and makes sure that we stay away from being criminals. In reality Lizzie pays the bills with my mother money and she has not made me stay away from being a criminal my mother did. Lizzie manipulates people around her and wants to control people. She is obsessed with having people she can tell what to do and what not to do. She wants people to feel that she knows everyrthing and she wants people to feel without her they can't take care of themselves. And now she sees that that she is losing the power over as we are getting older and tells us that she is like a second parent and that she has raised us which makes me boil inside. Because I know this her try of making sure that she can control us forever. One thing she has done is to become a football agent because my older brother play football and she wants to manage his career and if he does not want to as she wants, she can ruin his life. She has taken it a bit further because I want to become a race car driver she wants to be my manager when she know absolutly nothing about racing. And my younger sister wants to get into entertainment guess what, Lizzie wants to ""help her"". And there is a lot of things like spying on people and being a hypocrite that I wish Lizzie could disappear or never was my sister. When she is outside she is very insecure and plays to be very nice. She has talked a lot about her friends treating her bad but I don't believe it because she lies and flips stories and makes herself the victim. If I would move out she could turn my whole family against me so that's why I do try to come up with the best excuse to move out like going away to university. But I'm just an avarege student and it's going to be very tough to do so. If I move somewhere close they will just show up everyday or make people keep an eye on me because we live in a small town and everyone knows each other. She also wants to be home as much as possible, she stopped going to university(but she says that she does everything via the computer) and is awake 19 hours a day just to control everything at all times. She said recently that she has no hope fo none of us, but then wants us to have a schedule, workout and try work hard to become succesful basically do everything she doen't do, when I later asked her why cares so much about our succes when she said she has no hope for us she responded she has hope for all people but she can't control everyone but us.

My older brother:

He nice, but he is foolish. He is like a puppet to Lizzie and does everything she wants to.

My younger sister and younger brother:

515,"I (33f) am looking to do some volunteering while I am unemployed to fill in the spare time and am considering a suicide prevention hotline.

I am in Australia so Australian advice would be amazing but any advice is welcome.

I was really keen to help out in this way, having had dark thoughts myself. BUT I read an article about a woman who only lasted a day because she was inundated with calls from men basically looking for a free sex hotline.

She said she was not allowed to hang up on them because they might have been sex addicts looking to make a change or something like that. It doesn't seem fair that a volunteer should have to put up with being sexually harassed by people who are abusing a suicide prevention service so I would love some context on this, ie: if you were told in your training that you could hang up on people who were being disgusting/ if there were many obscene calls etc.

I would like an idea of what to expect before I sign up because I don't want to quit a day into my shifts as that will waste the hotline staff's time as well as my own. 

Otherwise, I'd like to hear about any other experiences too because it seems like some people really love doing this work!",30Jul2019,1
516,"Hey y'alls,

I just finished first year of uni. I don't know yet whether I'll make it to the second year. 

So about this course I'm taking...it's considered to be one of the toughest courses you can take in my university. I don't know what happened but this year the dropout rate increased 6-fold. 

I started off the year feeling quite excited about uni because it's in a whole new country and it's on a subject that I'm quite interested in. I started off on a quite solid footing too - I always did my homework and assignments and I scored quite well in my exams. However, as the year went on my motivation just withered away. I was still on task with my homework and stuff but my willingness to study basically flew out of the window. I just got really jaded with my studies basically. It's very different compared to high school where you have a whole range of subjects that you do but in uni (and especially for my course) you basically focus on one thing. Also I had doubts about whether this course is the right one for me but I just chalked it up to my anxiety tryna kill my confidence.

After the half year mark, I was barely hanging on. When things get too tough, my mind just keeps telling me to drop out but I don't want to drop out because I like what I'm doing but it's just difficult yakno?? Then, two weeks before the final exams for the year I kinda had a breakdown. Like a major one, I was just so stressed that I had suicidal thoughts and I was always so tired that I just didn't have the willingness/energy to study so I kinda flunked those exams in the end. I then had to take resits for those subjects and I don't know yet the results. 

I just feel like I'm lost now...I talked to one of my friends who switched out of this course and the thoughts that went through her mind were the same ones that I had and still am having now. But the thing is that unlike her, I don't really know what I want to do if I were to switch out of this course. 

So..yeah I don't know. I guess I need advice on what is the next step for me now..",30Jul2019,2

Tried a few dating sites but it's very rare that I get a match, even rarer that they stay matched. Being a virgin this old didn't used to bother me but recently it's started weighing on me after a girl I was talking to admitted to being put off by it because it's ""awkward"". Contemplated trying to go out and hook up with whoever I can but I'm not that kind of person and would probably struggle to do that even if I tried. I think I am a genuinely nice person and I'm not hideous looking, a lot of is just down to lack of opportunity I think.

519,"So I'm 28 years old, I've been living on my own since I was 19. My dad has this terrible habit of showing up to my house unannounced. For the past 5 years my boyfriend and I have been living together and for awhile my dad stopped just showing up. Then this past week he came over twice unannounced. I politely and respectfully asked him if he could please start calling to let me know he's coming over so I can be prepared (I had been in a nightie recovering from a minor surgery and my boyfriend was getting out of the shower). My dad lost it on me and took it way too personally then proceeded to blame my boyfriend for me asking for a heads up. He believes since he's my father he should have the right to show up any time he wants and I deeply offended him by asking him to show me the tiniest bit of respect in announcing himself before expecting to be entertained.

Canada: 
Im 18. I have a ton of volunteer experience dealing with kids. I applied for a full time summer job last year with my city, I got it. but because it was on an older email I used, I never saw the interview date until one month later. I should mention that I have been extremely depressed for the last 3 years of my life so much so to the point that I do NOT remember what happened and not being able to get this job was like a form of self punishment for me.

Anyways, I apply again and interviews trainings later  had my first day yesterday.  I KNEW I can't work this job because of what it requires (fully attentive, active, energetic, nice and compassionate) because your're with kids 8hrs/day. I can work with kids sure, but I cannot be that person for such a long time for a whole month. But a job is a job right?, and considering how much financial debt+ payments we're drowning in I need this.
Again yesterday my dad lost his mind and kept talking about how he should just kill himself and he would kill himself if he could, he could and will run away leaving us all here to fend for ourselves (he wouldn't abandon us..but he will leave the country). Also kind of important to mention here is that we immigrated here from a 3rd world country and this October will be our 6th year here.

Thing is I CANNOT work full time. My mom is not here in the country and my dad also works a shitty labor job full time and does not know how to cook. Also he is pretty tired when he comes home so he only helps with dishes. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED my employer (Im employed by the city) to put me at a near by camp location and they still put me in the furthest one. The official hours are 8:45-4:10-15
.I wake up at 6:15 and leave my house by 7:45 by bus to get off at 8:03 to catch another bus to get to camp by 8:45. Then when I get done I leave at 4:20-ish and my bus comes at 4:44pm. Then I take that bus and catch another one and finally get home by 6:03.  I have no time to rest really, because I need to make dinner which takes me forever and prepare tomorrow's lunch (when I barely know how to do either), then cleanup and make activity plan for tomorrow and I found myself going to bed by 12:30 am. 

I have been dabbling in an online business thing for a source of income and I need time to work on that. I have a clothing store job offer lined up after summer, and aside from that I have a tutoring opportunity that I think I can take up (because before I held any job ever I tutored kids in my apartment. Then this girl in my neighborhood, Then my moms' friend's kids online etc). I was trying to compare the tutoring job pay and this job's pay and if i get the desired amount of hours, then I'll make exactly the same amount (with no taxes because its online) that Im making at this job (after taxes)

So my question is, is it wise to quit (just saying I never thought I would quit, but my mom suggested I should or else I will collapse). And if so, how? Do I write them a letter? I need to quit very respectfully because I will be applying for a fall position with the city and also because I DONT want to leave a bad mark. 

Today I was supposed to go in but after yesterday's fights +my muscles being a little sore +stressed about this work situation....I couldn't go to sleep and then I woke up a little late and hadn't even prepared my lunch or breakfast...(did it for dad though u know cause he has to go to work obviously).
Currently I have been called atleast 3 times because I haven't showed up to work yet, because I didn't know what the fuck to do. Should I go in late? Should I just make up an excuse and email a resignation letter??
Im really freaking out and my GAD is in full swing again

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

525,"Hello. Long post from my phone. 

I recently left the Airforce after 6 years. I had a plan. Learn to fly helicopters and be a commercial pilot flying to oil rigs and back. I had the GI Bill, I had a place to stay and knock it out. 

Then I found out the schedule for most pilot gigs was ass. And I wanted to eventually have a family and be able to spend time with them. So I decided against it. And stopped after my private pilot license. 

Then I found a job near home for 53k/yr. no degree needed, just doing a job that I had experience with because of my old Airforce job. But there’s a catch. It’s boring as all hell. I do about 30 minutes of “work” a day. If that. My real challenge has just been trying to keep my phone charged. 
I’ve been working the job for a month now and it’s the most boring thing ever. I know the pay is good, and it’s hard to beat for no degree. But I feel like I’m wasting my time because I don’t want to be here doing nothing. 

I’ve been searching on the internet trying to find other things that interest me. And it’s actually stressing me out that I can’t find something I like. Things I would be interested in would cost me a bachelors degree. And I don’t know if I’m ready to go back to school after being out of that environment for 7 years. 

My hobbies are pretty lame. I just play video games and search stuff on the internet that seems interesting. I love to read sci-fi books and love military history.

534,"Ok, so I am graduating high school at the end of the 2019-2020 school year and after that, I am choosing to go to college. Anyway, the reason I am asking for advice is that I am very socially awkward and shy around anyone who I don’t trust. Because of this, I barely had any friends in high school, in fact, I only had 2 people who I could actually be myself around and around 3-4 people who I could have casual conversations with (but still be somewhat awkward around).  To make matters worse, I am not really into popular/mainstream things so talking to someone about television shows or movies is very difficult for me . The reason I bring this up is because when I head off for college, I want it to be a fresh start for me. I know it sounds somewhat vain, but I wish to have more friends and to be more involved with peers. I’m tired of being on the outside looking in...   I know this is mostly my fault since I’m the one who distanced myself from people in the first place but since a ton of kids from my high school are not going to that particular college,  I was hoping to turn over a new leaf and attempt to leave my insecurities behind.

537,"So the other day. My girlfriend was invited to a party by her best friend (the party was at a mutual friends house in my neighborhood). So we go, everyone of course is drinking and so am I. I was sticking with my girl and despite their being a lot of mutuals at the party I didn’t feel comfortable just going up to mutuals and just start talking with them since I was shy (I don’t talk with these people on a normal basis) and I came into the party with my girlfriend and just wanted to stick with her. I end blacking out after about 6-7 Jell-O shots, 2 cups of Captain Morgan, and a shot of Jose Cuervo (I stopped drinking after that cause I knew I was already messed up mind you I don’t drink on the regular either. I also ate as I was drinking thinking it’d help) . Last thing I recall was talking with my girlfriend in the pool and then everything just faded to black. I end up waking up at my house. To be told about a lot of shit I did 
- I was trying to be sexual with my girl in the pool. I stopped after she pushed me off 
- I was stumbling and slurring my words heavy 
- she said I exposed myself 
- I threw up A FUCKING LOT. 
- She had to drag me back home cause I could barely walk. 
Her best friend wanted to take her to an after party and leave me home. Despite contemplating on going due to her frustration/anger with me my girlfriend ended up staying with me and taking care of me. 
She was in fear that I’d get alcohol poisoning or choking on my vomit. It was that fucking bad. This was my first time ever being blacked out drunk and I wasn’t trying to get blacked out I wanted to have fun like everyone else. She called my best friend to help watch me as I was puking like crazy and rolling around barely conscious. 
I woke up and she explained what happened. I feel so fucking bad for putting her through this and her friends. It was my first time and I wasn’t in my right mind I can’t believe I did all that and caused that much pain and anger to a lot of people especially my girlfriend and best friend. She says she forgives me and wants to forget about it but yesterday when I brought it up after she invited me to sleepover. She was mad because I told her that I felt bad that I angered them and wish I could’ve been comforted in a sense(but they have every right to be upset). She said I ruined her night, embarrassed her, myself and everyone. She said I ruined her fun.  She wants me to reevaluate myself and wants a “serious break”. Every time I try to tell her how I feel on my end with the situation she says that I’m trying to guilt her which I’m not and that I’m not holding her feelings into regard despite me feeling terrible af. (she said that she understands I’m depressed but I’m not as hurt as she is) . I feel so fucking down. I feel so bad. My heart literally fucking hurts from what I’ve done. I was unconscious and blacked out it was my first time ever getting that fucked up and I would’ve never done any of the bad shit I did in a conscious state. Other people who witnessed this like her best friend, the best-friend’s boyfriend, one of their friends (who I didn’t really talk with when I was conscious and my girl met for the first time) and my boy said it was terrible and they were all pissed at me.

A couple months ago my boyfriend's firm planned a trip to Florida for a education convention. The convention is held in Universal studios so the owner allowed my boyfriend and his manager to bring myself and the managers wife. This has been planned since around the beginning of May. I wanted to bring this up in the interview because it will last an entire week in October. My boyfriend advised against telling them in the interview so I followed his direction as he has more experience ( he literally used to work at the company I was offered the job at) but now I don't know how to go about telling them and I'm worried that because I didn't tell them this it may cost my offer to be revoked if I try to tell them now. This job is a big opportunity especially with the pay increase because we are trying to get an apartment a few weeks after the trip.

I was totally flabbergasted  and didn't know how to react.  We talked for a few minutes before she went back up to the stairs and back to our respected floors.  Approximately  2 weeks later I had a major anxiety  attack in front of her.  I was so embarrassed  thought I had a full blown stroke.  After being released from the emergency  room i went to get a drink to help rehydrate.  There she was right behind me and she says to me I told my boyfriend your joke.   I was absolutely  devastated.   She still talks to me but I really don't know what to do.  Not my place but still interested  even though I shouldn't  be.  I just want to ask her what she meant by what she said.

547,"Hi there :)

So I just recently went through a series of interviews for a big company and I ended up getting a job offer. I accepted it. 

The job description said a 3.0 GPA is required, and I lied saying I have this during the interview. But now, they're asking for my transcript. I'm not sure if this is to verify my degree or GPA. I had several technical interviews and proved my skill set. Also, I have been given a start-date for the company. Can they revoke my offer?  


Thanks.",30Jul2019,2
548,"My first post here. But I don't want to talk about this to anyone in my life. So I'll keep this somewhat short. Just a few hours ago I had a weird fight with my dad, no yelling or words exchanged almost at all. Instead, it's said with silence. I ask when he gets home if he wants to go out to eat, he says where, an hr later I ask again and is met with silence. I ask one final time, he shouts, and then I go to make a plate of dinner for him for about an hour instead of going out  I finish, bring the plate to him and put it in front of him. No thank yous.
That's fine. I go back, and make my own plate. I come back to my room, until my mom calls. She says spends fifteen mins scolding and complaining (as usual) and I start to cry. 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM.
I don't fucking cry. Not with my friends, not in front of my own boyfriend, not with anyone. EXCEPT my parents. A heated argument, and I start sobbing, crying my eyes out. I hate crying, it bloats my entire damn face. So I try to avoid it as much as I can. 
But damn, I can't ever control my emotions and tear ducts around my parents in an argument. And I feel really fucking weak and just disgusted, because I would love to be one of those people who can get through an argument calmly and rationally. 
So....
Tips, anyone?
TLDR: how to control emotions and not cry in arguments

549,"Hi, I’m posting this because I really feel like I need some outside perspective on this.

So basically I have a dilema, I could stay and study university in a good first world country or I could go back to the developing country I was born and raised for the most of my life in. 

Let’s call the first world country A and the developing country B.

I have lived most of my life in country B. I am very shy and struggle to make friendships and relate to people, but I felt like for the last two years I spent on country B I was improving and managed to make incredible friendships. I even found my boyfriend, who I love very much. 

Almost two years ago my dad was presented with a work opportunity which made the entire family move to country A. For this time, I have felt terrible. I was struggling with school and felt really isolated in this new country. I feel like all my progress was erased and I was forced to start from zero. 

I managed to make some friends, but I feel like my friendship with them is superficial (only with them to go out or complain about school, but not talking about private issues) and I haven’t found someone who I truly feel comfortable with.

So overall I feel terrible in country A while I felt better in country B.

The thing is, I am going to start university soon. Country A is definitely the best option in terms of academics. University here is really good and cheap. The only problem is that I have to learn the language, so that means that I have to spend at least a year learning it. 

Meanwhile, country B has some average universities, but the good ones are expensive. The advantage is that I already know the language. 

I’m having a really hard time deciding whether I should go back or stay here. On one hand, going back would mean giving up a better education for the sake of being close to my boyfriend and my friends. Staying here would mean having a better education and more opportunities, but feeling alone and isolated.

What do you think I should do?",30Jul2019,1

552,"I reached out to my boss about workplace concerns and now I am afraid I am going to be fired.

A little background:

I do IT for a school district. I work by myself at the school while the majority of the company works at headquarters around 30 minutes away. They provide a number of services to many schools in the area and my purpose is to provide all technical support for the district I am housed in.

Lately I have been feeling very under appreciated and under valued. I never hear anything from my boss or the rest of the company. I hear many awesome things from the people I support but never a word from my own company. I never feel secure in my job because I have no way of knowing if my company understands my value.

They have started asking me to provide support for the city services such as mayor's office and fire department. All I would ever be told is that it will not be a regular thing. Every week I am being asked to do more and more for the city while also being given next to zero information on their systems. I am going in blind every time. I sent an email expressing concern because my school district expects a certain level of service from me and I don't have any co-workers to fall back on.

I received back a very angry sounding email that had HR cc'd. My boss basically asked me to outline whatever it is I am working on (sounds like he thinks I sit around doing nothing :( ) and that we need to discuss our expectations going forward.

I replied back saying that I would really like to meet with him and that I have no problem supporting the city, it is just that I want more clarity going forward. I have mentioned in the past that I feel like I am always in the dark.

When we had a company picnic last month by boss never even said Hi to me. I am not close to anyone at the company because I see them a handful of times a year. I would really appreciate having a boss that checks in on me from time to time and expresses appreciation for the hard work that I do.

My husband thinks that it is a sexism issue but I really really don't want to think that way. I think it is unfair and it is probably likely that he treats all his subordinates the same way.

Did I screw up by reaching out? I have been feeling so unhappy for so long I felt I needed to say something. I love my job.",30Jul2019,3

They expect me to clean up after myself. I have no issues with that. I don't want to be a bad guest if possible. I try to be polite and thankful. Yet, recently I've been feeling as if it's forced that they are okay with me there. His mom recently said that I should help my boyfriend put away the dishes. I stopped in my tracks because I still don't know where everything goes in his house, but he told her to not volunteer me to help. I wouldn't have minded, but it caught me off guard that's for sure. 

He cooks every Thursday night for his parents and I'm typically there. I help him cook too. 

Recently, they talked to my boyfriend about me. Not anything bad. Just... That they want me to cook on my own night for them. Sure they'll buy the food and I'm there a lot. I'm interested because his mom wanted to remind me and me I'm not over too much as well. I'm quite confused on this situation.

Basically, my brother wants to go into the Electrical Union right out of high school because he thinks he will make a lot of money and he will have a good amount of time for his hobbies. My parents, on the other hand, think that college is the only way to be successful in any way, so they won't allow him to apply to get into this Union training program. 

I proposed that he apply to this Union program and also apply to/tour some colleges as well so that he is pleasing both parties. The only issue is that he has absolutely no interests or ideas. 

I want to give him some programs/schools that could actually spark his interest so that he gets his head out of his ass about college being a waste of time and actually make an informed decision about his education while pleasing my parents desires for him to pursue higher education. There is nothing wrong in my opinion with doing a trade but this is the only way he will be allowed to apply. 

I AM LOOKING FOR PROGRAM/SCHOOL SUGGESTIONS TO PASS ON TO HIM . Here are some of his interests; fixing things (he fixes things up to sell like cars, lawnmowers, dirt bikes, ATVs), music (loves sound systems and playing with EQ as well as watching interviews of all of the artists he likes), sports (not really watching, just playing). working with his hands (he likes his woodshop class), watching movies/tv shows, etc. He's basically a normal teenage boy but has no passion/direction.

I just want a job outside of education/children and I could work my way up from there. Staffing agency told me my background is too unique so it’s hard to find a job. What should I do now? 

I graduated back in December 2018 with a degree in education. During my years in college, I had so many experiences in tutoring and volunteering as a teacher aids.

557,"Okay, so this is weird but due to financial issues and whatnot... I had still been living with my ex. I just got my own apartment but up until yesterday, I had still been living at his house. We still get along most of the time and I would usually consider us friends. Sunday night, some friends came over to swim and we were all drinking. We had a good time, but later, he confronted me about stuff that was on my phone. First, I should say, that I had told him that I am in fact talking to another guy. I was up front about it, he seemed to be okay with it. He tells me that he messaged the new guy telling him that we still have sex and that he also sent these messages to new guys sister and mother, who I am already close with. He also said that he used a program to pull EVERYTHING off of it, meaning that he could view any deleted messages and pictures, etc (He used to be a Cop, so he has access to these devices that can apparently do that). I was furious mad. Like, I have never, ever gotten this angry. I don't EVER get violent, but I was so pissed off that I seriously wanted to hit him, but chose to punch the door instead (Not proud of it). He refused to tell me where he put my phone. I searched all over the house, couldn't find it. The next morning, the alarm went off and I was able to hear it and find my phone. I looked and what was said wasn't AS bad as he was making it out to be, but still not cool. So, he took my phone, went through all the messages and even messaged this guy stuff implying that he (ex) and I were still having sex. He also messaged another friend but it wasn't as bad of a message. Then he hid my phone from me and refused to give it back to me. I'm fairly certain this isn't even legal, but is there anything I can do about it? I mean, I have a lot of intimate and personal stuff in there. I had never ever been one to hide my phone when we were together. That's why he knew the password to get in.. But we are NOT together and we have both been very clear about that. So I am not sure why he did what he did. But yeah, is there anything I can do? Or should I just let it go, get the hell out of there and just move on?

559,"Hello all,

I was a little skeptical about making a post but why not, perhaps a different point of view will do wonders.

A little background about me: Irish Male, turned 30 last month. Have a passion for Novel and script writing; photography and acting. I've a serious talent for most things IT. I'm naturally athletic and take care of myself and don't drink much at all, compared to when I was younger. 


When I was 19, I made a life changing decision to  pursue a path in life where I'd gain alot of life experience, travel and see and do different things few could only imagine. And I did just that.

Now however, now I'm 30, and one thing I've gotten so much in my time dating mostly business women and researchers (for some reason - I was a tradesman for 8 years) these past few years is ""why a person of my intellect never went to University.""

Truthfully, I don't necessarily regret my decision back when I was 19. I'm a much better and far wiser a person today than I was in those days. Yet, I've always hated that decision a little bit. The one thing that has always held me back in life has been my career. It's caused me huge upset in various ways and I'm just at the end of my tether.

I've no issues putting in the time to study but mow that I'm back in Ireland again,i once more feel caged and can't stand the country.

Should tough out the next 1-2 years to gain a qualificiation all the while my mental health declines slowly due to being in a place I almost despise.

Or, leave my wonderful girlfriend, and move abroad once more. I have numerous friends around the globe who've offered me a room and assistance settling in etc.

I'm a bit fat (I'd say somewhere about 180 - 190 pounds) and since I'm living the teenage life it's really hard for me to cope with it everyday especially in high school. They are pretty noticeable at first glance, and it's really emberassing. I tend to sit most of my time so not a lot of my classmates notice it and tease me about it. 

I've also been trying to stick with healthier living but it's really hard since I'm not used to doing most of it. I've been doing 10 pushups since last week and I'll take a few day breaks my biceps would hurt or be really sore. I've also chosen to walk instead of commuting to school. But the real struggle for me is controlling my eating habits. It's really hard to keep control of my hunger and my nutrition since I've been used to eating really unhealthy foods.

563,"I've always really enjoyed making people laugh, I just don't know if I have what it takes to make videos, and consistently.  I see some YouTubers like ""Basically Homeless"" and ""Linus Tech Tips""  and they (in different ways) remind me a LOT of myself. I just don't feel confident putting myself on camera like that (I don't really like pictures of myself but I'm working hard to get over that), or so I think. I guess for fear of how it may make me look. But I tell myself I shouldn't care about that (to a degree) and I should just be my 100% goofy self on camera. The other challenge is content. There are a bunch of directions I could go with this, but I love the idea of not only entertainment, like Basically Homeless, but education, like Linus Tech Tips.   


Even just basic tutorials for people to help them along their way, as I have been helped. I've always wanted to play around with editing, being able to transform a scene, edit little funny bits in here and there, and everything. I usually have these great ideas while I'm walking around town, or in a social situation, and I come up with this plan like a director to execute, how many people I need, what the roles of each person would be, and what the final product would look like. Unfortunately I don't have a large group of friends, and my 2 best friends (who would be PERFECT for this) are running their own business and (rightly so) focusing all their efforts on that. So I'm kind of on my own. Which in a way I like. But it just puts a dent in certain plans to make certain videos that require more than one person.    


If you feel like it, I would love to hear more of what you would like to see on YouTube. Any kind of content, I'm genuinely interested.

I refuse to let him harrass the couple in front of me who was doing their best to ignore him. I called him out loudly on his actions so that any passeby will get the reason for the conflict, he then tried to bluff me by pretending to have a weapon.

Looks too heavy for him to carry) I'm nervous but I can't let it get to me.

They think it may have been a mistake and so i did another blood test today and now we wait and see if it comes back elevated again and if so then i have to do an ultrasound on my stomach and do more test to see the problem. However, the doctor thinks it may have to do with something i been eating or just stress or something else. because i am healthy, I dont smoke or drink alcohol. I was doing research and heard that too much vitamin intake can cause elevated liver enzymes. my diet for the past few months has been taking a multivitamin and eating two large bowls of fruits like 2 apples, kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, mango, peaches, etc. I heard too much fruit is bad because it has a lot of sugar. and so my theory is that since i have been taking a multivitamin which already contains the daily required amount of vitamin that is needed plus two bowls of many fruits (for lunch and dinner) along with my food, this can be causing a lot of sugar to build up in the liver and also i am taking too much vitamin because of the tons of vitamin that i get from the tons of fruit and the vitamin capsule. plus i drink tea a lot. idk what else can cause the elevated liver enzymes since i am healthy.

Being nice to people in the past has gotten me nowhere but I always come out the asshole. Am I overthinking this? I probably won’t see her for a while either.

I (16f) started casually talking to this guy (17m) for a few months, starting in May of this year. I definitely had a crush on him, but our friendship was completely platonic. I really enjoyed talking with him. We had a ton of things in common (sense of humor, music, etc) and he really opened up and discussed a lot of personal things with me. We live somewhat in the same area (30-40 minutes away), so we decided to hang out one night at a party we were both going to. I was expecting to just hang out with him in a completely casual way, but he started making moves on me and we ended up making out. 

Now I'm mature  enough to know that a kiss doesn't actually mean anything, but it still really got my hopes up with this guy. After that night, we continued to message regularly and he would occasionally send me flirty messages and say he wants to hang out again. This got me even more excited about this guy, even though we were still just friends. 

Slowly our conversations got shorter and shorter and now we rarely talk, if at all. It's pretty clear now that he's not interested in me at all, and probably never was. He's pursuing other relationships, which is absolutely fine since he never had any obligation to me. It just sucks because I genuinely really liked him. 

I'm just very confused. I really don't have a lot of experience with boys (he was my first kiss), so I'm finding it hard to understand why he would kiss me and act somewhat interested in me if he wasn't. I'm really embarrassed now about how excited and happy I was over kissing him. I feel so used. He probably just wanted someone to make out with and he saw me as an easy target. 

Now it sucks because I can't stop thinking about him. It's so hard to let go of the idea of him that I imagined in my head. I keep thinking that maybe if I was prettier, skinnier, etc, that he might of actually liked me. I keep thinking about the ""what if"" and the ""what could of been"". I hate that I still care so much about him when he clearly doesn't give a fuck about me. I've never experienced this before so I'm having a lot of trouble navigating my feelings.",30Jul2019,3
575,"So recently I received a job offer for 57k and I currently make 28k. However right now I work 3 days a week and go to school, and life is good, money is not an issue and my wife works but hates her job and she goes to school. She makes decent cash as a server. This new job has a 30min commute while my current job is about 6min. I would be working full time, and continuing school would be difficult, and with a difficult schedule, leaving me only online and night classes, which my school doesn't offer alot of for my CS degree. 

Pro's of new job.
Huge pay raise
Really cool company(they launch rockets)
Same job I'm currently doing for more cash
Wife could quit her job and work somewhere she enjoys but would make less

Cons.
I really want to finish my degree and this would make it take twice as long and more difficult.
I enjoy only working three days. Life is good. Working full time and school does not sound fun

These two cons are major for me tho. Like thinking of them really stressed me out.

I just stopped going through mood swings and have just become sad and vacant with the occasional outburst of anger mainly at myself ut sometimes at my mother and others.

580,"Hi, I don't have anyone to talk to about this, I hope you can give me some advice. I'll try to make this as understandable as I can as English isn't my mother tongue.

I've been in a relationship for 4 years now. The first two years was like in a dream, it was us against the world and I felt really secure and happy with him. I really thought that he is the one I will spend the rest of my life with, everything about us felt so right.
When we met, both of us was occasionally using drugs and partied together, after 2 years my mental illness got worse and I decided to quit all the things except weed. It was no problem for me to quit using, he didn't stop and I was okay with that at first but then it went overboard.
The only friends he had back then was people who used, so when they hung out, they were doing drugs together. 

It was when I found out from a friend that my bf was tricking people to get money to buy drugs that our relationship got a huge torn. I felt stabbed in the back. I couldn't trust him anymore. A couple of months later he lied about what drugs he had taken, then he started getting seizures and they didn't stop so I drove him straight to the ER. 
At that point he was so down in drug abuse that he didn't cared about anything else and I felt so neglected. 
He did a lot of stupid things that broke me down piece by piece. I got so tired of his shit and so sad that he didn't listen when I begged him to calm down with the drugs, at last I got completely numb. 

When I finally got enough and moved home to my dad he ""woke up"" and said he was gonna get help, he actually did get help. I thought that I was going to get my bf back so I supported him all the way thorough rehab. Even if I was emotionally shut down. 
So like 6 months later when he got out of rehab I was so happy, we could finally start our life together. So we moved back together. But he had changed so much from all the therapy he'd gone though, he changed his whole lifestyle, interests, everything, it took me another 6 months just to get to that point that I may not love him anymore because of how much he has changed.

I've really tried to just accept it and see if my feelings will return, but I think that the only love I feel now is from our memories. When he touch me I feel nothing. 
I thought that we should live separated for a while which we have done now for a while, to see if that could help. It didn't.
We don't do fun things together anymore, we don't do anything together, sometimes I sleep at his place, maybe we're seeing each other for a little while but nothing more, there's no excitement.

My feelings for him are going up and down all the time, some days I feel like I don't want to be with somebody else but him, but most days it feels empty, like I'm on autopilot. Like I ""love"" him because that is what I'm supposed to do, even if I don't. 

He knows about how I feel and is trying his best to be the best partner he can be. But it isn't enough, even if I want it to be. I feel so dumb for not feeling the same waythat he feels about me. 
I really don't know what to do anymore because he is my best friend but I don't feel like having a relationship if this is what's it going to be like.
I'm still young and I don't wanna feel like I'm trapped in a relationship like some old couples, I just wanna be happy.

There's this other guy that I've known for 4-5 years and  we've just been talking occasionally, I've always had a little crush on him back and forth, but never acted on it. But I've always felt some kind of connection between us, like we want each other but no ones saying a word about it. The other week we decided to meet up for the first time, we just sat in a parking lot an talked a little while, when he hugged me it felt electric, I was feeling something for the first time in forever, I can't describe how amazing that was to feel that again. And now, I can't stop thinking about him at all. 

It's probably just a silly crush, but it has gotten me to think about what I want in a relationship. I don't want it to feel this empty like it does now. I want that electricity, I want to look at my partner and have no doubt at all that he/she is the one I want to be with forever. I want to be happy in my relationship. 

So, I know this is a dumb question, but I need advice. Should I try to fix my relationship with my bf and if so, what more can I do? Or should I accept that the love we had is destroyed from all the shit we've been through and break up? 

This shit is stressing me out so bad and I feel like the worst human being ever for not feeling the way I'm supposed to :(",30Jul2019,1

584,"Hello, reddit. I need your help today. 

This summer has been great. One of the best things about it was that I (M/17) finally reunited with a good friend of mine (F/15). We know each other through the crew for our county's summer musical and we totally hit it off every time we are around each other. So, naturally, we fell into the trap of liking each other.

Normally, this would be a whohoo situation, since it would be only a matter of time before we begin dating. However, last night, she told me that she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship or not. First off, she said that I would be turning 18 in the next few months (which is true) and the age difference scared her. Second, she said that I would be going off to college soon, and she can't do long distance relationships. However, she said that she really likes me and she wants me to ""be two years younger."" She said that she wants to keep talking everyday like we have been for the past month.

I really like this girl and it hurt like a bitch to have that conversation yesterday. She doesn't know what to do, and honestly, neither do I. I respect the feelings that she has and her boundaries/limits. On the other hand, she is the only girl that has treated me right in the past two years and I have immense feelings for her.

I feel like if I can't be with her, I won't want to talk to her everyday (or at all, honestly). It would hurt to bad because I feel like I would never be able to truly let her go and move on. I feel like I would have to break our friendship.

What do I do? Is what I'm feeling normal?

Assault



Cast:
Me, my girlfriend (GF), sister (S), friend (O), upset friend (E), attacker (A)

Backstory: 
GF, E, and I just graduated from school in June. Prior to graduating, we would often go out and get dinner and do stupid fun things together. We called it “goblin hours”.

The Story:
After we graduated, we all had our parties. After everyone left GF’s party, we decided to go down to a local river and to a diner for some late night pancakes. While we were there four boys showed up obviously high, drunk, or both. We thought it was funny and looked at them. Everyone else lost interest but I kept looking and they noticed it. They did a lot of seat switching and eventually my eyes were in line with A. He didn’t like me looking and at one point called me a bitch. Everyone kinda encouraged me to keep, but E was vocal about saying that I should stop and it wasn’t funny. I kept looking anyway. We got up to leave and when O was paying, I thought it would be funny to blow a kiss and wave goodbye to the guys. E had told me not to, but I didn’t listen again. We walked out of the diner and the guys ran after us. A walked up to me, yelled something about looking at him, and then punched me in the jaw. E’s dad is a cop, and she handled the situation. I filed a police report and they caught the guy that same night. We all finally go home, and when E drops my sister and I off at my house, we both told each other how much we care about one another and to text or call at any time. 

The next day I had my party, we all had fun. Later that night, she got up and said she was leaving. We thought it was a joke (that’s her kind of humor) but she had in fact left. It was very sudden and abnormal for E, so GF texted her and said that GF and I hope she’s okay and to let us know if she needed anything. 

After my party, GF and I both intended to keep in contact but neither of us checked in. Last Thursday, I texted to see if she wanted to hang out and didn’t receive a response. Friday I texted again, nothing. Sunday morning I texted again to say that I hoped she wasn’t mad and to apologize for not keeping contact. I said I was here if she needed to talk or anything and that I hoped she was doing okay. E had responded say she was very mad at me. That as a result of that night, she can’t go out and feel safe. That I had said mean things that night that were hurting her. She said she didn’t trust going out anymore.

I was shocked. I said that I didn’t remember being mean to her that night, but I apologized and I said I was sorry to have broken her trust. I apologized a lot in my message, and said that I hoped she’d want to talk more about it and try to repair out friendship, but I also said I understood if that’s not what she wanted. I thanked her for giving me a chance to apologize. 

Am I the bad guy in all this? And is there anything I can do to try to get her to talk to me again? Any advice or questions welcome.",30Jul2019,1

592,"TLDR-I was hopeful for a promotion to store manager, but instead they left the current manager and gave them another store.  But they want me to actually do the job itself, so do the work, but don't get paid.

So I have worked at a TPR of a major wireless company for over a year.  Have previous management experience and am currently an assistant manager.  My current store manager was supposed to get transferred to another location, and they were interviewing for the open position where I am, and I applied.  Was told there were so many applicants it took them 3 days to interview them all and I would be gotten back with.  Never heard officially from the district manager (who was making the decision) they just kept telling me no new update.

So last night my current store manager (the one transferring) tells me the solution.  They will keep him as store manager in this store, and also give him responsibility over the store he was supposed to transfer too.  I was told I didn't get the position because this store's sales have not been good, or that was a huge factor.  So why then did the person directly responsible get ""a promotion"" in the sense?  But this is the best part, as I thought would happen, they told this person, that on inventory days and days where management stuff needs done, I can do it.

So they want me to do the job, but not get paid for it, while someone else holds the position and gets the coin?  Nah, I'm good man.  I am trying not to quit, my family needs this job, and I am searching for other employment, but this is too much.

Was I/Am I wrong for telling them no, I'm not cooperating with their ""plan""?

I'm generally not a stingy guy, I've paid countless times for things like groceries, bedding/food for her pets or small things for her hobby because I know she can't afford a lot of things and I genuinely enjoy helping her.

The options I see myself having are:

1. I call it off (which I really don't want to)
2. I offer to pay 50 euro instead and hope that's still acceptable
3. I give her 100 euro and ask my mother for 100 euro to compensate (I almost never ask her for money unless genuinely needed and she's more than happy to help financially where she can, I'm just the type of person that feels guilty when asking for help even if it's my own loving mother)

599,"My sister and I have been extremely close the last 27 years (she's 27, I'm 31). She has always looked up to me, she's kind, sweet, and she's one of my closest friends. In January things expectantly changed as my sister had a baby. Prior to this she would always help me out when I'm in need, but that's all changed since her son is her priority.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I am upset is because I bought a new house where my sister is refusing to help me out at all. I broke my ankle 2 months ago, I broke it on both sides (tibia and fibula) this required surgery.  We are moving in 5 weeks where I can not lift any boxes. In fact I'm still in crutches and a boot, I am needing a lot of help from family and friends to make this move possible. Being an extremely active and dependent person it's hard for me to even ask the kind of help I need. Last week I asked my sister if she could meet me at the new house (this new house is 10 minutes from hers), helping me move 20 boxes into the house. My boyfriend and parents are helping me load up the trailer before hand. Since moving weekend is on labor day weekend she told me ""I can't help since that is a long weekend, I want to do something fun that weekend."" My sister does not have any plans for that weekend and she's been a big homebody ever since she had her son to the point she does not leave the house. I know for a fact she won't be going camping or possible she won't even leave the house. It's labor day weekend I understand people maybe don't want to move, so I didn't say anything although it bothered me.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we move my mom, a friend, and myself are going to paint 2 rooms. If my sister did not want to help move maybe she would want to help paint? This week I told her the weekend before we are moving I am painting asking if she could help. Her response was ""my painting days are done"". At this point I felt she did not want to help me at all where I expressed how I felt. My sister said that her weekends with her son are precious to her since she works during the week (she works from 7-3pm). Then she went on to say if I wanted to invite her to a ""grill out"" at the house she would be fine with that.... At this point I was livid pretty much told her to leave me alone, I'm so mad/upset that I don't want to talk to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it really a big deal to ask her to help me out a little while I have a broken ankle? I understand she would have to leave her son with her boyfriend for a few hours, but I don't think I'm asking too much. My sister is VERY stubborn and I know she will not see my point of view or why I'm upset with her. My mom had a few words with her where my sister said the same exact thing that she wants to spend the weekends with her son. I have not communicated with my sister and I am not sure how to get this resolved. This morning she messaged me saying she's leaving me alone per my request but wanted to wish me a good first day back at work. At least she's thoughtful thinking of my first day but I'm still SO mad at her for not wanting to help me with my move while I have this broken ankle.

Do I just accept that since she has a baby she's never going to want to help out? Do I continue to stress to her how she is making me feel and ignore her? How long would I ignore her for...weeks, months, years? I'm not even sure if I want her to help me out anymore knowing that she does not even want to do it out the kindness of her heart.",30Jul2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

604,"Hey all,

So I connect to my PC from work through out the day using TeamViewer.  A few days ago (On the 25th) I got home from work and noticed that my Chrome was open (not uncommon) but it was set to Chrome's https://remotedesktop.google.com/support page.  I was concerned since, though I have utilized CRD in the past, it wasn't something I had used anytime recently.  I checked my extensions and yea, it was installed.  I removed it until today.  That day I definitely remember TeamViewer connecting a couple of times at least and didn't notice anything.

Today I decided to try out CRD and upon disconnecting I realized that that is the exact page Chrome shows after a remote connection has been ended.

What are the steps I can take to check whether some one actually accessed my PC remotely or not?  I imagine there must be a log of some kind that CRD generates?",30Jul2019,1

616,"Let me start with some background info: My wife and I have known this guy for years. For most of our teenage and adult life we had been great friends, he was even my best man. 


Since last summer we've been growing apart, partially due to differences in our ideology but mostly due to him being a shithead to my other friends. One of the biggest problems we had was he was a ""nice guy"" to women. It was to the point where enough girls were uncomfortable by this he had a reputation for it. I even confronted him about it but he refused to admit fault because he had “good intentions.” 

After a lot drama filled events with me and my friends that I stopped talking to him all together, it just wasn't worth the emotional energy to give to someone who won't admit fault. What really made me cut ties was when he touched one of our friends on the upper thigh when she explicitly said no. 


Come to find out through his own mouth that he'd been accused of buying nudes from a minor from our home town several months ago. When he told me that, my initial thought was that surely he'd never do something so fucking vile. But after giving it thought and looking at the way he is with women it made sense that he could very well have crossed that line. A few weeks later I come to find out he was arrested and held in jail for 24 hours, I have no idea where he is in the legal process at this point since I don’t talk to him.


Fast forward to yesterday after not having talked to him especially since he told me of his accusation, he texts me and my wife ""happy anniversary."" I really don't want to talk to someone who got accused of being a fucking sex offender, it makes me sick. But my wife being as nice as she is think we’d be rude to ignore it. So Reddit, would I be a dick for not responding to a text from a alleged pedophile? If so should I respond and how?

One of my friends essentially said that the only reason I don't like Trump is because he's Trump (which, like, look at his history, why shouldn't that be a good reason for someone to dislike him), rather than his policies (which I generally disagree with, too).

Another of my friends said that they don't want to deal with or comfort me over ""left wing conspiracy theories"".

626,"So I’m entering my senior year of college with only $7.7k in (federal) student loans and I noticed that my financial aid got recalculated two weeks ago and I’ll go from owing $1000 per semester after grants and scholarships to $2200, which I suspect is due to my expected family contribution rising. I assume this is because my (single) mom got a raise but she’s terrible with money and has debt herself so she can’t help me with much. 

I’m an RA on campus which pays for my room and a small stipend, so combining that with my bit of summer money I earned (I was out of the country in June) I will have just enough to pay for this semester with a payment plan. The trouble is I wouldn’t have much saved up for spring semester. I could get a second job to work extra but i wanted to enjoy my last year of school and not stress too much. I know I’m not really in a position to afford that but I’m just laying out all my thoughts. 

So here are my options:

1) Get a loan of $1500 for the next two semesters which would give me the room to work my job like normal and be able to pay some of the tuition but also have money to spend for myself. 

2) Drop my (worthless) Spanish minor and graduate this fall semester while not taking out any loans. If I did this I would need to secure a job this semester and would have to separate from my college friends early. I would also need to make this decision by September 6, which is our deadline to declare graduation. 

I really don’t want to have to return home after graduation and rely on my family again, and I feel like path 2 increases the risk of that, which is not good bc I’m usually a pretty risk averse person. 

I realize this got long but I’ve hopefully put it all out there and if there’s anything that seems to be missing please ask. I’d be grateful for any advice anyone could give. Thanks. 

PS: Pretty important omission I realized. I’m getting a B.S in political science, which focuses on the data analysis portion of social science research, so more similar to a typical Econ program.

637,"I figured I'd get some outside advice because everything feels kinda like I'm thinking in a vacuum. My spouse is leaving next week to take a good job across the country. They just graduated college and it's a great opportunity so we decided to take it. We also decided to take it because I had just taken a job last year which moved us across the country (yes, I know). The job is in the 'big leagues' of my industry and pays very well and will look great on my resume. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, this job has also essentially destroyed me. I have gone through bouts of depression before, but this has been the worst yet. I've gone through 'worse' things in the past, too, but somehow found those trials easier to traverse. I began medication about two weeks ago and therapy almost a month ago. Long story short, the job is extremely stressful, demanding, and just not what I want to be doing. I feel like I'm at my limit every single day. I have had very dark thoughts, have even in bouts of distress almost acted on those thoughts, sometimes skip work because I can't take it, and am just overall very depressed and anxious. I cracked a tooth from clenching my teeth from the stress of this job. Whenever I spend time on myself, with my spouse, or doing anything that's not work, I am literally falling behind on work. Every single time. Even on nights and weekends. We do go out and do things to help me take my mind off of things, but every time we have fun, I have a really bad comedown as I return to work, although I've noticed my mood is stabilizing more in general since medication/therapy. I told my boss that I've been depressed and am seeking treatment. They were understanding but the company still expects a lot out of everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse has luckily been very patient, supportive, and understanding, has talked me off the ledge, so to speak; and understands that this will soon pass. A large reason why he pushed for taking this job was because leaving this area, moving closer to our family and friends, and to a cheaper area would enable me to leave this job and even take an employment break, so to him, this is a win-win.

&amp;#x200B;

The current plan is that he will leave next week and I will join him in late October. We talked about doing it this way because a.) my job is in a very expensive city, so paying to break our lease will cost us almost USD $5,000, b.) my job pays very well (I come from a very poor background so this is still crazy to me) and we could use the help in adding to our savings, especially for my employment break (which I plan to be about 3-4 months since I've had major burnout for a while), and c.) to hit a little past one year at this job so I can at least hit the average tenure at this specific company.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know that I should wait longer for my medication and therapy to be effective, so I take my swings in indecision with a pound of salt, but I still just wanted to seek advice on this. Most days, I so badly want to just leave sooner, like in September or even late August. I feel like I can't take living like this anymore and I also am tired of living apart from my spouse. We lived apart (with monthly visits) for eight months while I started this job and he had to finish school. The idea of spending about 80 more days forcing myself to give my all to this job is nauseating and causes me great anxiety. My husband is very much a ""do what's best for you"" kind of mind and has straight up told me that on several occasions. He said he's tired of living apart and tired of being in a transition state, so he wants us to just start our lives in this new area already.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days it's tempting, but I keep going back and forth because of a few reasons. 1.) I'm stubborn and feel like I should be able to 'tough it out' to build character and patience, but other times, there's a voice in my head saying, ""anon, you're MISERABLE. Why prolong this!?"" 2.) If I leave in August, our savings will not be that great after the move costs are factored in. If I leave in September, they will be 'okay.' If I leave in October, they will be great. All since we'll be saving from both of our jobs and not really going out and doing things because we'll each be alone. The voice in my head also screams, ""you're miserable and money should not be a factor in this!"" But my spouse is going to be making about half of what my current salary is, which is fine and definitely enough to live well off of in the area we're moving to, and within a few months, I'll be contributing again. 3.) Packing up the house alone and moving on a shorter timeframe will suck but will also maybe be worth it. 4.) My spouse and I are sick of being apart but being together and having decent savings and a better resume entry may make us more worry-free when we do reunite. 5.) My job paid for my relocation, and I still owe it back if I leave before two years, though the amount goes down every month. By October, if I leave, the amount owed will just take up my entire final paycheck, and we've planned for that. If I leave before, I will owe more and it will eat into our savings.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, my spouse and I decided on no major decisions until mid-to-late August, because we want to see how much of an impact therapy and medication have on me, but any thoughts are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Spouse is moving next week for a new job. I'm moving in October to join him to wait for our lease to end and finish my job here. My job makes me depressed, anxious, and overall very miserable. I started therapy and medication and am waiting to see its effects over the next few weeks, but I badly want to move with him earlier than October because I miss him and am tired of being miserable. But my job pays well, so it will help us a lot financially if I can tough it out until October and help us save money.",30Jul2019,2
638,"Currently working with juvenile offenders in a small community-based office in MA. Started working here in April 2019. I don't dislike the job, but I don't love working with teens and a lot of my time is spent doing secretarial tasks and being ""office coverage"", with little client contact. I work full time, $17.60/hour, 3 weeks vacation, not eligible for overitme pay, and 403(b) but employer does not contribute. I also am a CT resident while working in MA, so I'm paying state taxes for both states. 

I left my last job due to being burnt out from the high-stress residential setting. However, my old agency has listed a brand new position (completely separate from the program I was working in before) that seems like it'd be a perfect fit for me. My only hang-up is that the most they can offer me is $14.99/hour. Benefits are 4 weeks vacation, 403(b) that employer does contribute to, slightly higher mileage rate, and eligible for overtime pay. This new position is also in CT so I would no longer be paying taxes in two states. New position is closer to home so commute would be about 10-15 minutes shorter. 

Do the benefits and fact that I'm more passionate about the new job outweigh the pay cut? I'm struggling with feeling like I'd be moving backwards in my career, but at the same time I know that the new job would set me up for what I want to do in the future. Any advice?",30Jul2019,2

I feel like we’re close and I’ve considered asking her out but I’m afraid if she says no it’ll ruin our friendship. Furthermore she hardly takes an interest in me in the real world, I’ve asked to go to the cinema, to go bowling, roller skating, to comic con, even just to a forest to walk our dogs but there’s always an excuse. Over the year we’ve known each other we’ve done 2 things together and we weren’t even alone, her bday party and to the cinema once but she invited all her friends and hardly spoke to me (and left quickly). I’ve been the best friend I could, comforting her when her grandparents died, offering so much support that it emotionally exhausts me, buying her small souvenirs that mean a lot to her. I’ve got nothing in return except a present for my birthday that’s coming up and she describes it as a jokey present, so clearly it’s not that thoughtful. I don’t want to be selfish and I know it’s sounding like it but I’ve been through so much to make her happy and I get nothing back. I’m in a depressive state rn and I don’t want to wake up tomorrow. The worst part about it is that she is with one of my friends, alone at her house watching films, that’s something I’ve suggested for months and I didn’t even get an invite, she went bowling with her other friend, again something I suggested doing, 2 days later they’re down there without even asking me if I wanted to come. I can’t get over her and I feel like I’m being horrible when I don’t reply or don’t talk to her but when she hangs out with my friend doing something I love doing it’s like I don’t even get noticed and it’s driving me insane. At times I want to just block her on everything but other times I want to tell her how I feel towards her. She’s not been a good friend and if I talk to her about it I feel like we’d never talk again and i don’t think I can go through that.

643,"Hi! 

I am currently job hunting and every job I am applying to is paying $90,000+. I currently have an interview that is paying $120,000-$130,000 for a house manager. These are all personal or executive assisting jobs. The average salary for an assistant in my area is $85,000.

When I read the job descriptions I have no doubt I am capable to do the outlined tasks. My previous employers were two high profile executives. One paid $22/hour and the other paid $35/hour. I have always undervalued my work and will stay for years at a low paying job. 

I just feel weird if during the interview they ask my salary expectations and I say $90,000 and if they ask how much I previously made it’s no where near that number? Help! I have really bad anxiety about salary negotiations and I never ask for raises or anything. I read online if I ask for too low a salary then it will make me look inexperienced.

During the measuring process I’m very aware that the lady using the machine that measures your pupil distance and height etc. Is holding it at an angle, she then tells me as the frame is large I may still get quite an edge on them.

During the night I start having second thoughts about these glasses and how good they may be so decide that after work I’ll go cancel them. 

I arrive in store not even 24 hours after my original purchase to be told it’s too late the order has been placed and due to their contract they’d charge me £30 (supposed lens cost) as they’d be charged £30. (Wasn’t told this nicely either) they kept quoting its contractual and that the order was sent off this morning, even confirming nothing would have been made yet. When I asked if the sale of goods act applied the last simply responded with “well it’s not a tin of beans”

However it will take a lot of time and $ to make this lucrative. In the meantime the only source of income for me and family has been my LTD benefit( Which expires next year May) this alone has hurt us financially because LTD is only 45% of my previous employment salary. I shared this so that you know what our current situation is. In this past week I had two great interviews. On the one hand I could work with a company that offers no cap on commissions but the pay is only commission. It is on a weekly pay cycle and once the deal is inked I get an advance that week. This job entails me to sign up companies to use us as their POS merchant processor. There are 0 defined territories, which means that I can do business all over the U.S. and in 32 different countries outside of the U.S. plus i can work from home as I basically make my own schedule. On the other hand I have the opportunity to work in retail again(with a large wireless co.), I say again because I have many years in retail sales in store mgmt exp. and the transition would be easy for me. This would offer a base salary and commission that depends upon how well my team sells. Both opportunities offer 401k, medical, dental  vision, etc... my conundrum is if I should go for the commission only role or if I should go for the base salary plus commission. Before i forget, the pros for the first job is that I have unlimited earning potential, I make my schedule,great benefits, residuals that I keep after vesting and more, the cons are that banks compete against us and getting infront of the decision maker is difficult, as for the wireless job, the pros are the stable base salary and the commission plus the benefits, the cons are that I would be subject to retail rules, retail hours and I have to travel 45 miles each way.

656,"Her and I have been close since the beginning of 2019. And we’ve shared hella memories and good times together. But because of unforeseen circumstances she can no longer afford to spend time with me and I guess be with me. We’ve discussed this possibility in the past and what it would mean for our relationship if we just stopped trying to be something more. Me personally, I never intended on ending things with her. My heart wants her. I want her. I love this girl with all my fucking heart. But I am also a very paranoid and skeptical individual. Because of past relationships I’ve found it hard to trust people that say they love me. I love this girl and I want to believe that what she told me was true. But because of the way I love people and he way I treat others when it isn’t reciprocated I take personal offense to it Bc I feel like I’m being used. 

Now her and I have had three arguments each ending with “I can’t do this anymore”. And each time I’ve sat there and wondered is that really love? To just give up when things get “hard”. This last time tho it felt different I didn’t really see for for a week and she was just busy traveling, spending time with family, working. So one day I hit her up to check on her (she is involved with a very toxic sugar daddy, and because she has no job, he pays her really well, she forces herself to stay in that relationship Bc it ultimately helps her survive. But ever since this guy came back into her life she’s changed. She’s experiencing physical, emotional, and mental trauma.) And it ultimately affects our relationship Bc I get jealous over the time she spends with him. How needy he is for her. I mean this guy has a drug problem, he’s a sex addict and a lot of times he will go without paying my friend her weekly payment because he spends all his money on blow and escorts. I don’t need to tell her that that relationship is toxic because she knows. She talks to me all the time about him. He is really the only concern when it comes to or relationship. But she ended things with me because I put a lot of guilt on her Bc I treat her like a fucking queen. And I know that I deserve better from someone but it was never always like that between us. She used to always want to be around me Bc I made her feel better. She used to always reach out to me Bc I was her best friend. But she had a lot of time to herself when we first started “dating”. 

I have a really big problem trusting people. Her it’s worse because we are involved and Bc I’ve been lied to, I’ve been played, I can tell when things aren’t right. And right now they aren’t. But I still love this girl. I will go to hell and back for her and I feel like I have. It’s so hard to let someone you love be around someone so bad. After she ended things with me she cane over to talk Bc I wasn’t feeling well before she ended things with me. We talked, she asked to stay the night and in the morning we had sex. But I haven’t seen her since then. I still message her and we still talk. She has been asking to come visit me the past two nights but idk if it’s a good idea to let her be around me. All I want is to be around her but am I in the right mindset to be around her? I know I’m head over heels for this girl. And maybe it’s because im a weird way I like being treated like shit, it makes me feel good for how I treat people. 

What do I do? Do I stick with my feelings for her and try even harder. Do I just give up? I don’t want to give up. The thought of being with anyone else but her is giving me anxiety Bc I don’t want anyone else but her. Sure I would see a girl in the distance and be like she cute. But I don’t wanna wife them up. I wanna wife the girl up I got to know this year. I’m so conflicted Bc I’m a hopeless romantic and I want her. I crave her.

Those things didn't make me terribly insecure because he apologized and seemed embarrassed. He apologized for the next things, but they make me feel really bad about myself.

This is not what I came for initially, I have no experience managing a team but they thought I would be good for it. For the last month they went and told everyone I would be the new manager. I started having more responsibilities, truly they showed more trust in my work and everything was wonderful.

I was considering the offer of becoming a manager more seriously but today my boss told me our big boss refused to give me the promotion.

665,"Hello everyone,

So last night it hit me that my past is still bothering me. I thought I was over it. It has been 10 years. When I first attended college immediately after high school, I was really lazy and unfocused and I did not belong in college. I left my expensive school where I was pursuing premed because I was doing TERRIBLY. I left with an absolutely disgusting GPA. The good news is that I actually didn't attempt that many courses in the year and a half I attended school. I was mostly trying to retake courses that I failed, but of course, I repeated the outcome of these courses. I was unfocused. Lazy and just broke up from a serious relationship. I didn't study. I didn't show up to class. The college that I attended allows students to fix their GPA. Your last attempt at a course will replace previous attempts. It's not an average and it would greatly improve my GPA. 

Currently, I am a Software Developer and I get to work from home in Los Angeles. Life is very good, but I still feel like my past failures haunt me. I thought I was over it until last night when it woke me up from bed. I don't love what I do. I find my job to be incredibly boring and unrewarding.  At the same time, I feel trapped. I still have college debt from my last degree, but my life is incredibly easy. I would have to move back to the east coast from Los Angeles, but I don't know that I will be satisfied until I at least fix my GPA at that college. I think ideally I would like to complete my second Bachelors there, but it will be incredibly pricey. I could NEVER get accepted to a Masters program with that black stain on my record. 

I would have over a year to save money for this endeavor and I estimate that I could have 10-20k saved before classes start. I would not relocate until Fall 2020. The other trouble is I recognize that a medical pursuit would basically take me into my low 40s before I actually got started. I could still develop applications and try to work as a Software Developer, but this would be a major change in my life.

Am I insane? Why do I feel the desire to do this? Should I pursue this? I am legitimately ashamed and really deeply saddened by my performance in my late teens and early 20s. For some reason, I think this would fix these feelings I'm having, but at the price of 10s of thousands of dollars. Is it worth it? 

I have no clue what to do and I would really appreciate your response. Thank you for reading this and taking the time out of your day to help someone who is struggling and torn.",30Jul2019,2
666,"I currently work in software for a large company. All my life, I've been going with the flow. I took a CS major because my parents suggested that's where the jobs were. I got my first job through my mom because a position happened to be open where she worked and I needed an entry level anything. I moved states because my job moved states. I applied for advancement because I developed skills with the company. I'm still with that same company, 15 years later.

My advancement has plateaued and the work is frustrating. The obvious solution would be to start applying for similar jobs -- positions doing things I'm already good at. 


The trouble, and where I need advice is: I don't like what I'm doing. I wouldn't like it at another company. I wouldn't like it for more money. I just don't like it.

I don't want to feel like I've wasted my life working on someone else's dreams. I also feel like I can't just quit and start some new path because my wife would have to carry a lot of the burden by my taking a pay cut. 

My ""hobby"" has always been art. I love to paint, illustrate, draw, create. I was considering paths along that route but have never pursued it professionally -- I just don't know how to verbally rationalize quitting a decent paying, not too difficult job to become a starving artist because I **want** to. Is it too late? Is there a way to ease into one thing and out of the other? Has anyone gone too far down a path and then make a sudden change?",30Jul2019,3
667,"Throwaway.

A bit of background. My ex and I broke up about 10 months ago. A couple of days later we hooked up, as people sometimes do. One thing led to another and... you know how it goes. She asked for it, literally.

Afterward she started crying. Now, me knowing how the world is these days, picked up my phone and hit the voice recorder as I asked her what was wrong. She said that she didn't want to do that. I pointed out that she literally asked for it. She said she didn't think I would. (Wait, I'd been doing it for the past year and half, and she didn't think I would?) When asked why she didn't ask me to stop, she had no reply. In the end, she stated that she'd been leading me on when she asked for it. Although knowing she was lying, I left it at that and turned off the recorder. She asked what I was doing and got so mad when I told her I was protecting myself. She then admitted that she'd been cheating on me.

So I see that as having narrowly missed a false rape allegation.

Suffice is to say we didn't see each other again, but we spoke once in a while, because I'm an adult and hate is a waste of time.

Fast forward 3 weeks and she's with the guy I was convinced she was cheating on me with. It is what it is.

Fast forward again to a week ago and I get a message out of the blue from her. After a short conversation she tells me that a couple of weeks ago the guy had beaten and raped her. The police were involved and she was put in a safehouse and escorted everywhere. Now that last part didn't ring true, I'd never heard of that happening, but my mind skipped over it because of the situation and the immediate urge to protect. You may know what I'm talking about. So I believe it all.

Today, she tells me she spent the night at some guy's house.

Hang on. Are these really the actions of someone who has just been through such a traumatic experience? Within 2 weeks?

Sure, she moves on quickly, she always has from what I know, but still...

Then I get to thinking about my own experience with her. What if it's similar, but he didn't have the foresight or opportunity to protect himself? I don't know many details of the case other than what little she told me.

So here's my quandary:

Do I stay the hell out of it and risk the possibility of an innocent person having his life ruined, because that's the way these allegations tend to end up?

Do I get involved somehow, because I still have that recording, and risk the allegations being true and a rapist get off free due to reasonable doubt?

Do I sit on it and wait to see if anything else rings false before re-evaluating my position?

What are your thoughts?",30Jul2019,1

tldr: my cousin got pregnant &amp; she's 15. she's publicly lashing out on the boy who doesn't wish to man up &amp; take responsibility for their child &amp; now (i think) she's plotting a run-away shit/suicide.

After a date or two, she confessed that she has feelings for me. At that time, I really only see her as a friend but was starting to feel some feelings developed. Because of some complications, we decided to temporarily remain friends on a mutual understanding. It was a healthy relationship since we still hang out from time to time and are still good friends. However things started to go downhill when I was enlisted into the military(this is temporary for about 19 months). I will have to wait days to get a reply from her and she claims that she is just super tired from work which might be true since she works for about 12 hours almost everyday. I am uncertain whether her feelings for me deteriorated, and it is too difficult for me to ask. For one I am scared of the truth and two, being seen as an insecure person that requires validation. Military training only exacerbates my current state of mind. 

Theres are signs that I might have developed depression, probably over the course of bottling up these emotions until now. Turning to my family and close friends right now might not be such a good idea since they might not be able to resonate with me. Now that she has started school again, I'm afraid we might just drift apart leading our different lives. I know that there are many out there to find, but its just not possible to get her out of my mind.I know I might have to get over her and permanently remain as friends in the worse case scenario.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

676," 

The plans are as follows. $250 deductible with co pays 20 for doctors 35 for specialists and 20% left for me to pay after deductible. Costs $129 per pay period or $258 a month. Or a high deductible plan 5000 deductible which is $33 a pay period or $66 a month 20% responsibility after deductible. Maximum OOP in network is 6,350 for high deductible plan and 2000 for the traditional high premium plan.

It seems obvious however there are 2 caveats.

1. One, my employer matches 50% of the deductible on the high deductible plan from Dollar 1. Meaning if i spend $100 i get a check for $50 same week. That is awesome. It essentially means I have 50% co insurance from day one with no deductible.
2. Since it is Humana they give you points for health screening, quizzes , steps with fit bit. You go up in statuses from blue to silver to gold to platinum. It typically takes me 2 months or 3 max to hit platinum. Once i hit platinum the high deductible premium is completely wiped out making premium free. On the low deductible plan the premium is reduced to $89.

I have already decided that for next year when an entire year ends to be covered the High deductible plan makes more sense. I am 37 no me prescriptions and relatively healthy.

However, this year I am struggling with a back/hip/leg pain that I have already spent about $700 on massages, chiropractor, dry needling and PT. Its not debilitating but I work out like crazy and its slowing em down and distracts me at work on bad days. I fully anticipate continuing physical therapy and chiropractor for a while and maybe an MRI and some real doctors until the issue is resolved.

One issue I had not anticipated to keep in mind. Even though the high deductible plan covers nothing until deductible providers don't see it that way. 2 examples I have had with a similar plan in the past. Urgent care cash visit was $100 but with insurance it was $150. Also, my PT billed me in error once as if I had insurance and cost was $600. They said I would have had a provider discount but still services are always more as companies have to fleece the insurance companies and we usually don't notice do to having traditional co pay plans. So there are added hidden expenses.

The reason I think this more expensive plan makes sense is that I only have 5 months of premiums left to pay. That means $258 x 5 which is $1290 plus co pays and the percent I am responsible for instead of 3000 for the year. Plus I only have 5 months to get to deductible on higher plan vs 12 months next year. Wondering if it will cost me less since year is more then half over or am I missing something?",30Jul2019,1
677,"Hey guys,   
First time poster in this sub. I'll try to make this brief. I need advice on how to handle an ongoing issue that mainly becomes a problem when I'm (31F) in public with my partner (35M), on a date, or out having general bonding time as a couple. My partner has a really cute dog that literally everyone asks questions about. People stop us in our tracks and interrupt any conversation we are having to ask questions about her, and before we're done answering one person, another person approaches asking the same questions. This continues to happen over and over, and it prevents us from getting where we're going to, and from us having any quality time together.   
This may not seem like a big deal to some people, but I am an introverted-type person with anxiety that heightens when these situations occur; all I want to do is spend some quality time with my partner every now and then, and not have to cater to everyone else for once. My partner doesn't set boundaries with these people who approach, and he doesn't like it if I just walk away because I can't handle it anymore at some point. We have discussed the situation over and over again; he knows how it affects me, and we do our best to plan things out so that we don't always bring the dog with us, depending on what we're doing. But in my partner's perfect world, the dog would come everywhere with us; she is part of the family. I would love for her to come everywhere with us too, but every once in a blue moon, I need some time alone with my partner where the world doesn't revolve around talking to strangers about his dog. He doesn't like the idea of boarding her somewhere just because of me, and we don't have many friends nearby who could easily watch her for a day.  
I am tired of feeling like the bad guy, asking if we can have someone else watch the dog while we do something fun together once in a while.   
Does anyone have other suggestions to try?

I have met an amazing person who brings the best in me, is present, supportive and so! good!

and i have this fear. because it's good, you know. i have never really really cared about putting my best in this. i was maybe too intense in my teenage years, but no loss was meaningful to me.

the thing is i am approaching all this as a problem, and focusing too much on it. reading toooo many advice and books and videos, all so theoretical and then i have too much in mind that i just don't know what to do and what is me. i want to approach this with grace and humility, as something i just don't know.

i worry, mostly about myself, about overly expressing. i close myself and then get verborragic, or i get the other person confused, or express expectations or maybe even get slightly mean. i don't want to be or do any of these! i want to give tenderness because i want to and it is so deserved. but it's this stupid thought 'wow this is so incredible, he's so good and i am me! just me', you know. that's not healthy! and i don't have it in any other area of my life. i have confidence in every other aspect. and in the moment we are together, everything makes sense and it's easy. but then, my thoughts! when i am on my own will start. i don't want to ask for validation, i don't want to anything. i want to learn this from scratch. to be gentle, open, real, honest to myself, and expressive. and stop doubting so much because it's so paralyzinggggg. and robotic and fake. so, yes.

how can i learn to relax and trust 'love' ?

ps: my background would me: my (f/24yo) parents were never together. they split before i was born, my dad was not really present. we have a good relationship now and i understand why he did that. my mom always had terrible sick relationships. so no good background and learning experiences.

694,"Long story really but to keep it short. Did Drivers Ed at 15, got permit immediately. Never followed through despite being initially confident and totally fine at driving. Largely in part due to dreams I used to have about driving and going too fast, and crashing a lot. Lead to anxiety over even thinking about driving. Came to college, realized it was time to get license by of 1st year. Anxiety gone and done with. Got permit again(last summer), have practiced a decent amount of times but never followed through on road test. Have/bought car last fall but cannot use for road test, expired registration, can't register because need insurance, need insurance to get license etc. Feel good about road test besides parallel parking, need some practice there just never got to it. No parents/help there because college in midwest is not home and I don't go home except winter break as its NE US and flights are expensive and have to be budgeted. So I need one of my friends' car for road test, unsure how to proceed, feel bad about asking since they all always help with groceries, if I need to go somewhere, they always drive when we go to city for raves etc. 

Okay now time for detail. I have like 5 or 6 options as I see it. My closest friends/ones I think it would be easiest to work with both have manuals. So I would need to learn to drive a manual delaying my time to the road test, plus one is going away for a month for summer drill and the other works alot/late in the week making it both hard to schedule the test and to get practice in. These guys are my go-to since they're also my roomies etc. I have one other really close roomie friend who does ""have"" an automatic but its his girlfriends. We all live together but I'm not as close to her as I am to him so would feel awkward about asking and plus they help alot with groceries already. Plus her car is really new, few months, and it's a 2017 so I think it would harder/scary for her since I would be protective of a new car. Schedules here would be easier probably though. Note: for the most part, all of my friends and I work similar schedules: Mon-Fri, 7am-4pm or later pretty much. 

My other three friends that I think would/could help me are not roommates so organizing things would be harder and again I just feel like a bum/burden for taking up their time and possibly having to change their work schedule a little for this. And like I said before, I'm not exactly just looking to use it for the road test but I would want to be a little familiar with their car first of course. 

Sorry for the long post. Just lost and not sure how to proceed, and even though I'm sure they would all do it I still feel bad for asking and need help determining how to do it. Really wish I had just done this when I was a teen and I had the system in place to get it done ha.",30Jul2019,1
695,"I dated a girl for over a year, fell in love and things were great. Unfortunately for me, she decided to move to another city to get her university degree and we mutually broke things off. We stayed in contact (talked on and off) and would see each other once in a while when we were in the same city, but we were never exclusive again.  

We both dated other people while she was away, but I always had the same feelings for her and never the same way for another girl. Once she finished her degree, she moved back home. This was last summer and we started to hang out again. Things were good between us, but I had recently gotten out of another relationship, so I felt like I needed a bit of time to focus on myself and my well being. I explained this to her and told her I still had the same feelings for her (had to tell her, it was eating me alive at the time) and she told me she did too and that she missed me and how things were back in the day. I was so happy, I used to always think of the saying “if you love something, let it go. If it returns, it was meant to be” I know that’s super cheesy lol but it honestly gave me hope we’d be together again one day and here was my chance! Over the next couple months we didn’t really see each-other much but always kept talking. 

In November, I finally felt like I was ready to fully commit myself to a new relationship, so I asked her out on a date and she agreed but eventually canceled. No biggie, rain check it is. I txted her a couple times that week to hopefully arrange another outing but nothing worked for her and eventually the conversation would just fizzle out. This went on for a couple weeks. I figured if she was interested in going out she would hopefully get back to me sometime...

Sure enough, she txts me to make plans at the start of December and I obviously got excited, but now this time I wasn’t able to make it out that night, so we talked about trying the next week or the one after. I end up txting her to try to organize something and she ghosts me. I’m like alright whatever this is a mess and clearly she’s not into it anymore... sucks for me but who knows maybe one day it’ll work? 

Then the Christmas holidays are upon us, and one of my best friends txts me basically saying he matched with her on a dating app and that they went out on a date together that week. He was asking me for my blessing of the relationship and said he wanted to tell me in person but didn’t have the chance (he literally spent the whole previous day with me, so that was a lie but I digress). At first, I was so shocked and pissed off that I pretty much said ya whatever have fun. But about an hour later I txted him again saying how I truly felt about her and that it would really hurt me if this was going to happen. He just shrugged that off and said everyone deserves to be happy, which I still don’t fully understand what he meant. 

All my other friends knew how I felt about her and that I wanted to be with her. When they found out they obviously told me that it sucks and that it’s a shitty thing they did that to me, but it’s been 7 months since then, so their attitude on the matter has changed (like they’re ignoring the fact that they know I’m bothered and hurt by this situation). Now every time we all get together, I just they don’t show up and I feel like I don’t belong anymore, even though I truly love my friends and have a good time with them. The last thing I want to do is cause drama between my friends, but I just feel like nobody has my back after having been figuratively slapped in the face by both my “best friend” and ex girlfriend. 

I’m trying my best to just man up and get over it, but I think about it almost every day and really resent my “friend” and ex.

So I don't have a lot of friends my age, I mostly hang out with adults (Idk why, I've just been this way for a while, when I was a little kid I used to hang out with teens) and I'm really into this girl, but she's an adult. 

I love everything about her, she's so passionate about the things she likes, we have a ton of mutual interests, I love hearing her talk, she's beautiful, etc. But, you know, the age difference and all kinda fucks it up.

I know this can't work out, don't get me wrong, I'm not a complete idiot. Not just the age difference, but I'm not the most desirable dude haha.

a little background on me:

I live in Washington, near the Oregon boarder; I have a college degree and tons of competitive experience. I am 30, extremely driven/ hardworking, have an awesome resume and LinkedIn, very personable &amp; easy to get along with. over the last six months I have been applying for jobs rapidly and haven't been able to land a single offer and its making me crazy. i have interviewed at so many companies and I always make it to the final rounds of interviews only to get ghosted or turned down at the last second. what am I doing wrong? am I missing something here? Is this normal for others? I just dont get it, I interview really well; I always come prepared and seem to always leave a good impression &amp; I always send thank you cards after the interviews.

698,"So me (m18) and my girlfriend (f18) love eachother unconditionally and have been dating for 2 years but theres a problem. she just has to many issues.

for starters she's depressed and although on medication still is always in a mood nearly, she self harms, has family issues, has tourettes (only body movement though not speaking), is asking me for money for plastic surgery although she is literally the most beautiful girl ever like damnn u wouldnt belive how beautiful she is, has MEGA self esteem issues and she has insomnia so when i want to sleep she texts me all night and tells me to stay up when i wanna go to sleep so im always tired.

I just love her to much to let her go but at this point its getting to much. Like whenever she feels upset (which is at least 2 times a day) she texts me and (indirectly) tells me to fix her problems im at my limit and if she doesnt change soon im leaving her. 

please god please if anyone has any advice to give to me to try save this relationship before its to late i would be ever so grateful",30Jul2019,0

700,"Hi guys,

I’ve been kicked out of University for my non-existent attendance and poor exam results. I wish it was because I was a stereotypical student partying all night but I wasn’t (I had no friends, actually). My mental health had not been good from the get go; I struggled with very bad anxiety and self-esteem issues stemming from my autism and dyspraxia diagnosis. My ADHD also became much worse due to a summer of doing mostly nothing and having no support network at Uni. All these factors made it really difficult to cope and I ended up just staying in my flat all day, every day.

I understand that telling my parents is something I ultimately have to do but I don’t know how. For starters, I’ve been putting on a facade for the last year about my performance and the truth couldn’t be any more of a juxtaposition to that. The more pressing issue however, is that my sister has been struggling with eating disorders which has been hard enough on the family as it is. I don’t want to give them any more emotional baggage.",30Jul2019,4
702,"We had a two month break from law school. I was able to catch up on my work and personal life. But now that it's only two days away from start of classes, to make it ironic I have to give a short speech on what I learned in the previous year for the freshman orientation to inspire or give them an idea of what law school is, I feel so overwhelmed. 

I am dreading going back to school. 

I don't know the reason. I tried meditating. I tried to relax for a week. I know I am prepared for class but I still feel overwhelmed. I have the materials I need as well as paid tuition fee. The more I think of how rattled I am for no apparent reason, I am panicking more.  

How do I stop this?",30Jul2019,1
703,"&amp;#x200B;

It is my first time posting about me as a person rather than some problem I once had in a game so bear with me. Firstly allow me to give some context. I'm not what you would call ""shy"" I can talk alright, and decently I believe. I can handle myself in a tense situation showing what I need to. But I am an introvert. I don't like talking about my feelings, thought, and all that. Also, trust issues, severe social anxiety, among other things make it difficult to appeal to others. Last year I slowly pushed almost everyone close to me out of my life mainly due to paranoia and that I just felt done with them. And those who I didn't talk much with just seemed to ignore me, even those closest to me sometimes.

So after all... that, my problem, I am going to a new school in about a week, no one from the previous one will be with me so I have a chance at redemption with all the new people. Here's the problem, me. A month in self-imposed loneliness made it worse, yes I prefer not to approach people but I can only resist so much before I need someone. I live far away from my girlfriend which has been the only one I've talked to (by message) so I haven't had a lot of social interaction. I feel like I've lost my touch of self-control and forcing myself to be social. My antisocial part took over for the most part.

All these new people, I don't want to embarrass my self by either being stupid or by not talking or looking weird. So I'll need some advice. How would you, in my current situation, handle it? How would you casually present yourself to strangers which you'll be with for years. Note I am not asking how to get friends, I don't like them that much. I am simply asking how to get the trust of people enough for them to know I at least exist.",30Jul2019,1

705,"Yesterday I was doing my usual daily routines, I texted her good morning and asked her how she slept well I was walking my dog. It was at around noon when I found out she's dodging my messages. She'll text me at 5:00pm and I would respond a minute later, 5:01pm; which for some reason she doesn't reply to it after 20-30 minutes. I would just pass it as her being busy with her mom and such, but it only got worst. It have gotten to a point where she'll respond an hour later and in a pissed off tone, when I ask her was wrong she'll just tell me to not worry about it and that she's okay. I had enough with it so I decided to login to her account, since I made an account for her two weeks ago; some of her ex's were harassing her and she wanted me to make an account so she can get away from them. 

When I logged in.....I found out she's been texting a girl for hours. I felt devastated to a point where I couldn't eat, think straight, and I'll be getting nasty headaches. Few hours later of me trying to figure out what's going on, I got the courage to ask her about it. I asked, she just told me it's just a friend. I didn't buy it because if it was only her friend, why would she ignore me for hours while not mention anything about me to her. Yes I saw there conversation and she talks about me if I'm nothing. 

Few hours later, she texted me and asked if I'm okay because I told her I wasn't feeling well and I couldn't eat or get rid of my painful headache. I told her I'll be going out for a walk. When I came back she began being more verbally abusive while telling me she's going to make another account. I asked her why she's doing that, she said ""don't fucking worry about it, you ask too much"". 

I been with her for 2 years, the abuse began a few months ago when she would get mad at me and we would constantly fight over small things. I would always take the blame because she made me feel like everything's my fault.

709,"She texted me this last night. At 11:00 PM. I couldn't sleep because I was so annoyed and just angry at her. I haven't told my fiancé yet and I don't know what to do.

**She sent me: ""Hey girl, sorry this is last minute but I don't think I can be at your wedding on Saturday. Things at work are crazy right now and my boyfriend and I haven't spent time together in a while and I need to take a couple mental health days, hope you understand. Also can I keep the dress and shoes? Thanks""**

I should mention that I am having a destination wedding (in a large city about 4 hours away, nothing crazy like going to an island lol), **that she knew about the wedding more than a year in advance and I PAID FOR HER DRESS, SHOES, ALTERATIONS FOR THE DRESS, AND PAID FOR AND BOOKED APPOINTMENTS FOR HER HAIR AND MAKEUP.**

**I am well aware that I'm going to be getting comments stating that I'm a bad friend for not minding her anxiety and mental health and that I am stupid for having a destination wedding in the first place. I understand because I also have god-awful anxiety, but I still wouldn't flake on someone on their wedding day because of it.**

I'm just...livid. Because she has done this before SO many times when we've made minor plans, such as going to a concert or even just shopping at the mall or whatever. Just flaking at the last minute because of her anxiety or whatever excuse she comes up with. And I was stupid to think that she wouldn't do it this time because it's a wedding and no one in their right mind would flake if they are actually part of the wedding (except for her of course).

Initially when I asked her to be in my wedding she told me she didn't know if she could because of cost (she works as a mental health/behavior technician and doesn't make very much) I told her I would help her financially as much as I could. I was dumb enough to buy her $200 bridesmaids dress and shoes, dumb enough to make an appointment and pay for her to get her hair, makeup and nails done. The only thing I didn't help her with was lodging, but she and her boyfriend had PLENTY of time to save up for and reserve a hotel for a night or two. Toronto is FULL of nice hotels that aren't crazy expensive.

**I just don't know what to do and now I'M the one who is panicking and having anxiety instead of her. The majority of my family AND my fiancé's families live overseas (in Russia and Iran, respectively) and some cannot make it to the wedding so I don't really have another bridesmaid to fill the spot. I will only have my maid of honor and another friend of mine. And an empty seat during the reception.**

I know it's my own fault for even having her as a bridesmaid and I don't even know what to tell her (or my fiancé because I know he's going to be mad too). And she has the audacity to fucking ask if she can keep the dress and shoes **THAT I FUCKING BOUGHT.** Probably so she can sell them on Ebay or whatever for weed money for her and her boyfriend.

The only thing I texted her was ""**I really wish you would have told me a lot sooner, because I paid for and made reservations for you months in advance. Can you please mail the dress and shoes back to me?"" I know I probably should not have asked for the dress and shoes back but whatever.**

Of course I shouldn't even be this nice to her after what she did. She left me on read.

I am really panicking and don't know what to do, because I don't think I will be able to get a refund for the reservations I made for her and will probably never see the dress or shoes again or her for that matter. I'm just so angry, annoyed and hurt. A 'mental health day'???? Really?????????",30Jul2019,1

716,"Hey, just having a bit of a hard time at work and wondering what to do about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

So last year I was hugely bullied in the workplace. I had lost a relative to suicide so I was already in a pretty bad place. 

Last year, a woman I work with made up some things to cause friction between me and another worker, who I considered to be a friend. Turns out she wasn’t my friend. She and the other woman both did not like me and did not want to work with me and essentially tried to bully me out. 

She tried to make people stop talking to me and generally made my working life hell. I used to dread going to work. I even considered taking a bit of time off due to stress related illness, because, as you can imagine, dealing with this on top of grieving, I really struggled. There were days I would wish I didn’t wake up because it was too much to handle.

This woman moved off my department in the end, and things picked back up. I felt a lot better going to work, but it turns out for months she was threatening to sue me because I had bullied her off the department (which I didn’t do). I told my employer about this, and all of this is documented at work and my workplace agreed her behaviour was unacceptable and chose to move her out of the department to resolve the situation and she was told never to speak to me unless it was necessary to the job. 

I was told today that she is getting moved back onto the same department as me as she has been off work for a while and has had a health scare. I’m really not looking forward to this, and I can feel myself getting anxious and it hasn’t even happened yet. 

I realise this might sound like a really silly thing to be upset and worried about, but this woman is old enough to be my mother so i felt really intimidated by her.

How am I supposed to work with a woman who threatened to sue me for months? Should my employer have stopped this from happening?

And I know this sounds like a silly question, but I’m desperate here! - is there any way I can stop her from working with me?

Thanks",30Jul2019,1

719,I’m 28. My husband is 25. I was a lesbian my entire life basically until he swept me off of my feet 3 years ago. I am and have been the only one working and supporting him and our two children the entirety of our marriage. He has anxiety and depression which makes it hard to even go into public most days so I am understanding towards that. We have been struggling! I feel that he runs his mouth all day whether it’s in a joking way or a rude way no matter how I feel. If I do the same...it’s definitely a problem and when I say that...I get told we aren’t the same person and I shouldn’t do something just because he does to be vengeful. Most of the time I’m just more so “matching vibes” not actually trying to get revenge on anything. I’m always tired and he’s been pushing me to exercise more since having our 8 month old son so I just recently started going to the gym after I get off from my job. I’m extremely out of shape so you can imagine my muscle pain since going to gym after work. We don’t really have good days anymore. We laugh together every now and then and when we do...it’s great. So let’s cut to the chase...basically he’s unhappy because I’m too tired most nights that I fall asleep and don’t want to be woken up with sex. I normally don’t remember the cruel things he says that I say to him while I’m sleeping and he’s trying to start something up. He says that I don’t make the first move enough and any time I do...he rejects me as well because I make him uncomfortable or it feels like I’m forcing myself to do so (which is not the case) it’s just how he feels so I get told no. When we do have sex...he does most of the work most of the time because I struggle to do certain positions that he wants and it’s not bad. We connect pretty good when we do. The other day we had to stop in the middle of sex because it was the 3rd time during our session I had to tell him my legs were giving out... I could barely bend or straighten them (have been doing legs and glutes at the gym) but he still insists on trying to make me use my legs so the 3rd time I tried to nicely explain to him why because apparently the other two times I told him he didn’t care. That turned him off so badly we just quit. We have a good sex session where nothing goes wrong maybe only twice a week. Most of the time I just feel mentally and physically drained that my libido is nonexistent. He wants it 4 or 5 times a day. Our libidos do not match up what so ever. Today he told me if we separate he will take the time to fuck as much as possible so I told him maybe we just need to separate and get a divorce because this marriage is failing. I feel like he can go be happy and fulfill his desires and we can still be friends in the long run and I can continue to work to support our children and home and continue working on myself.,30Jul2019,1

724,"My boyfriend (19M) and I (20F) have been having some issues due to the fact that one of our mutual friends (19F) is very close to him, up to the point where they'll drink alone together in his room. I wasn't comfortable with this, and haven't been for the entirety of the time we've been dating (1 year) and have explicitly told both of them this separately, though both denied any wrongdoing and said they were just friends. I know they are just friends, but I know that he used to like her, and tells her private details about our relationship (that I don't want to do anal, that I don't like sending nudes, etc) and have only found out from him that he has told her that. She hasn't made it known that she knows these things. I'm annoyed that when we're together she can sit across from me, knowing intimate and personal things about me, and not say one word about it. She has also told my boyfriend very personal things about her relationship, like, very private details that no-one should know, and has asked him if he thought she was pretty, and if he thinks it's weird that he could potentially never sleep with anyone else. Bare in mind, they're both really wasted at this point. She also asked him his kissing technique, which he demonstrated on his hand (wow, I know).

I have since confronted my boyfriend about this, and told him in no uncertain terms, that if this whole thing continues I don't want to be around either of you anymore. He has finally realised just how much this has been affecting me the past year, and is not going to invite her to his house. I confronted her also, saying that if she had any respect for me she would have stopped talking to him about private things as soon as she found out we were going out, and would she like it if I went to her boyfriend's house and got drunk, and she essentially turned it around on me, saying that she had no idea it even bothered me, any of this, even though she has definitely known I've been really against this whole time, and we even met up for coffee to talk about it.

725,"So, earlier this year I wound up viewing a 1bed condo that was close to work. The Redfin agent was super cute, and we kind of stayed in touch. She set up a search that automatically emails me listing that fit my criteria every few days, but she also reaches out periodically.

Worth noting; I'd asked her out, she kinda shot me down, but since has been *kind of* flirty with me. But pretty sure it's just a ""sales"" thing, I figure if she shot me down once, I'm not going to make things awkward to ask her out again.

Well, I have a friend that is a realtor (or real estate agent? I get them mixed up all the time), and our mutual friend suggested I have him show me another place I'd found I wanted to look at, since I needed experience looking at places, and he needed experience showing places (he's a super good guy, but not really ""cut-throat"" enough, he's had other people swoop in and sell houses to people he'd spent months finding their perfect house).

Well, I feel like I need to just make a decision, and let the other person know so that I don't waste anyone's time or resources.

On one had, I'm not *close* friends with the guy, but he seems a good dude, and is surprisingly knowledgeable. And I don't think he would steer me wrong just to get a sale, although he's said neighborhoods are a little nicer than *I* think they've been.

On the other hand, the girl is, again, *super* cute, although I definitely think she's worked her charm on me a little. For example, she invited me to an open-house to ""come see her"", after shooting me down asking her out. But then, she also feels like she's been more engaged about *finding* me a place, whereas the other guy, I've always found places and messaged him (to his credit, though, when I was *really* serious about one particular house, he'd done a lot of research, asking other realtors in the area for input on that subdivision, etc).

I dunno, I feel kind of crappy about the situation the more I think about it. I've never bought a house before, and legitimately didn't think I was ""stringing anyone along"", but I see now, I guess I have been.

And now, there's a house that's come up on Redfin (the woman's search engine) that I was to go see asap, and I'm wondering if it would be super shitty of me to ask my friend to show it, or if I just need to commit to the woman as my realtor?",30Jul2019,2
726,"I posted this on another sub but didn't get any good advice, so I thought you guys might help or give me advice 

My boss is leaving. I never had a boss that was nice to me. I felt for the first time that a boss understood me and cared for me. Coming to work was great because of her. She was my mentor. I am quiet and stick to my work, but she always took the time to come and talk to me. That meant a lot. When I learned that she was leaving her position I felt sad but I was happy for her. Then when I thought about it more and more it really made me feel sad and I even got emotional. Which doesn't happen too often for me.

Since she was leaving I added her on Facebook. But she didn't add me back. So I thought maybe she doesn't add co-workers. But she has other co-workers as friends. I asked her if she could be my mentor and she said that she is busy and she will give me her new work email.  

I know she owes me nothing but I still feel sad. Really thought she cared more about me.

It feels like it was all fake. Its like I am somehow different from others. Even though she was nice to everyone someone i am not the same. I don't know what it could be. It kinda reminds me of high school and college where I was an outsider. Part of me thinks she was nice to me because of the director.

I have a pretty average family. The adults in my life are always trying to manipulate me or complaining about life their lives or want me to do what they want. They constantly lie to me. It is always a give and take relationship with them. When my boss was really nice to me I thought she cared for me…….she was only adult that i felt cared for me but didn't push me around. 

My previous boss have never been great to me. The mentors in my past betrayed me. Never had a good boss, they just didn't care about what I had to say. I feel alone and lost.

728,"This girl I was dating for several months just broke up with me yesterday. Im 24 and she’s 28 and has a kid. I’m very in love with her and she told me she’s in love with me and that I make her happier than anything/anyone ever has before and started crying and saying she doesn’t have time or effort to commit to me in her life right now. She has a young son and is dealing with issues from her abusive ex and is currently seeing and therapist, moving back with her parents, and has a ton of issues and crazy things going on right now. 

I can tell she wants to be with me but she rarely ever has time to see me/hang out with me as of late and she wishes she had more time for me but it’s like a huge ordeal to make arrangements every time we try to hang out. I am extremely sad and broken up about it and I told her that I respect her decision and am fully supportive of her dealing with her own problems right now... but a big part of me feels that if we love each other and make each other happy then we should be together and try to make it work.

I care about her so much and want to be there for her. She’s told me she has extreme trust issues, relationship problems, anxiety, trauma, dealt with depression, among more problems. She said she feels like she can’t see anyone right now and needs to focus on herself and her son. I totally understand this but I really don’t want to let her go... I’m so in love with her and constantly think about her and want to be with her more than anything. 

She says she hopes we can remain friends for now cause I mean a lot to her and she wants me in her life but friendship is all she has to give right now. This really hurts and I’ve been trying to just remain in touch and see how it goes and be supportive of her. However, a huge part of me wants so much to try to talk to her about making things work and telling her that we should be together cause we’re in love and I’ll be there for her to help with all her problems. I feel like we truly belong together and I have no desire to see any other girls. I just want her... and as more than a friend.

I hope that doesn’t make me selfish and I’m doing my best to cope. What do I do?

1. Obviously this is against company policy to do this. It might even be illegal but I'm not sure because it's not for probation. I think if he wants a job bad enough then he should just stay clean himself.
2. My mom previously found a position helping out this local handyman that pays well and talked with him about it (this is a different job). He said it sounded good and he would think about it but never followed through. It's frustrating because I know he would be good at this job but I guess he wasn't interested enough.

736,"I don’t even know where to begin. I think most of it is a combination of them not liking my Fiancé. My friend and his wife are what you would call geeks. In our early twenties we all hung out they got along with my 1st husband he was a geek too. Then I divorced and things changed. I hung out with them and I so am grateful for them to be there for me when I needed them. My friend and his wife I thought were like family. However things started to change. I got depressed and when I am depressed I get these weird manic moments. They are under control but I kept it in the dark for many years. I quit my job this year because of it. I am explained to my friends at first, they acted like they got it. But then the fake “Facebook stand with depression” wore off. They didn’t really know how to handle me. I never told them I had two suicide attempts and honestly glad I didn’t. The amount of judging and gossip I felt was not very good. But somehow through all this I  met someone who has totally helped me with my depression and helped see new potential I never knew I had. He was not a geek and the opposite of that. At first I don’t think they knew what to think of him. They judged him a bit because he isn’t a geek and it felt like to me, like high school. Like I thought you guys were the cool hip non judge mental people. But they are like everyone else I have slowly realized. 
Things got very uncomfortable after a couple years, they finally get married but what should have been a fun time they didn’t  include me in anything. I was actually fine with it. I had just been hospitalized for depression and when I got out, the doctors changed my meds to another drug. It has worked amazing now the first month sadly was not so good, so my emotions were all over the place. I still was invited to the wedding but I felt so odd and out of place. Then things got really bad when my bf showed up. We had all been drinking so this didn’t give the boy any points in their eyes. The wedding they thanked everyone but me, I didn’t do much to be honest just some quick favors for the tables it wasn’t any trouble. 
But to not be included was horrible. I think I cried the whole night from that wedding. 
I decided to take a break from everything at my therapists advice. Took off all social media did my thing and felt better. I limit myself to Facebook once a week now. I decided it was best to distance myself. My friend honestly is the guy in the relationship. I knew him before he met his current wife. Anyways the main problem now is this. 
My friends 40th is coming up his wife texted me, and I told her I wasn’t sure. (honestly after the wedding and how uncomfortable I was and my new job, I didn’t plan to go. Plus how they treat my Bf I just don’t like it.) 
So me being the crazy manic I am think I am being friendly by responding to her texts how I would check my schedule. Then I tell her how I love her instagram pics. She takes a lot of pics and a pretty plus size girl. She is very big on body image and all this crap about being happy and doing you. She responds very cold to me not even acknowledging. So I feel fucking stupid like what WTF is wrong with me? After my depression I am becoming a terrible person who I think is trying to get validation from those I want the most from. So I go back and tell her not going to go, after that stupid shit I decide to text her I am not going. I am sorry if I have been a shitty friend. I would like to send them something and I apologize for the awkward text. I get a very cold- response. I can’t even remember now but it was along the lines of, thank you blah blah blah. Very cold. So I just tell her see you later. All I wanted was to talk. I feel so isolated I work from home now, and I was really trying. But I fucked that up too. I know she thinks I am playing some game or she thinks I have lost it. The funny thing is I am really friends with her husband I known him since I was 18, but now I don’t think I can still be friends with either of them. I want to text them and ask them what I did wrong? What is wrong with my boyfriend? I don’t know if I should or just let silence be the winner here and just move on. But it eats my ass and I really want to know what I have done wrong, but I think the more I text or ask it will be worse and I know in the circles we run they have talked about me before. I just wish at 40 I still had friends but I have no one and I just want to make things right and have my friends back like the old times. I just don’t know what to do?",30Jul2019,1
737,"I’m a gal in my early twenties, and my friends are starting to get married. Imo we’re still a bit young for that kind of thing but whatever, I’m glad my friends are happy.

739,"I'm in a strange social pickle and not entirely sure how to address it.... 

My husband and I have been close friends with one of my former co-workers, Rick, for a few years. During our friendship, Rick has went through a divorce and now has joint custody of his two children, who are 5 and 7. We have always jumped into help Rick following his divorce, whether it was buying groceries, loaning money for work tools during a job change, having the girls over for holiday celebrations, or simply to listen to Rick vent about his ex-wife. Rick's ex-wife left him for another guy and moved their children out-of-state to move in with the new guy shortly after their divorce and custody agreement was finalized. Rick confided in my husband that he didn't have the money to hire a family law attorney, couldn't afford to pay for daycare expenses for the children if he had them full-time anyway, and most notably.... didn't want to tick his ex-wife off because their current custody agreement did not order him to pay any child support. 

Fast forward.... Rick went on a date with a gal, whom went home with him following their first date, and she hasn't left his house since. Sarah, his new girlfriend, is ten years younger than Rick and has three children from previous relationships. We had a cookout and invited Rick over, along with Sarah, whom we hadn't met. The first impression wasn't exactly stellar.... Less than two hours into our cookout, Sarah was drunk and vomiting after drinking half a bottle of rum and slurring about one of her two ex husbands, in addition to showing me pictures of the engagement ring she wants Rick to get her (mind you, this is after ""dating"" for less than two weeks). Since then, we made plans to go camping with Rick and Sarah, hoping the first impression wasn't an accurate portrait, but rather a drunken stupor. Rick backed out at the last minute citing Sarah had made plans for him and her with her friends. 

Since then, my husband and I haven't really reached out to Rick to hang out for a multitude of reasons. We've grown in various ways and often feel that Rick takes ""two steps forward, three steps back"" and we find it increasingly harder to relate to him as a friend. We are legitimately concerned about his kids, who live with him part-time in his 2-bedroom house, along with Sarah and her three children ranging from 3-8 years of age, totaling seven people in the household now. We listened to Rick vent about his ex-wife hurriedly moving in with her new boyfriend and his child, only for him to do the same thing. We've listened to his woes about struggling financially and made suggestions for ways he could improve his poor credit score, only to move in four more mouths to feed after he was freighting over the idea of paying child support on his two children, but Sarah conveniently got fired from her job the same time they started dating. We feel that he puts himself in foolish situations for someone 35 years old, so we've essentially just quit speaking to him and stopped inviting him over. He text messaged me about a week ago and I ignored it and then Sarah messaged me today, to which I didn't respond to either.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question(s) are.... 

1. In this situation, is ignoring the communication the best method? 
2. Is there really a tactful way to address Rick, without making him feel under attack?",30Jul2019,1

I have been struggling to know what I want to do with my life, I attended college for 1 semester after dropping out due to, not taking studying seriously enough, even though I was doing really well in class and labs, tests and studying have never been something I worked on in high school and came to bite me in the ass, I was also robbed of my laptop and other things, the laptop being 100% needed for the course as well. I learned that I wasn’t as into computers as I thought, but maybe that was just because I dropped out and I tell myself that to give myself a reason. I still don’t know what I want to take, and I don’t have any passions in life, I’ll play video games and hangout with my few friends when everyone has time but it’s very hard. I don’t relay enjoy doing anything anymore and I want to do something with my life. Currently I work a shirt factory job on the midnight shift to pay off student debt and save up, but saving up has also been hard for me. 

I don’t know where to look to find inspiration, nothing makes me think, oh I want to do this as a career. I do really want to go to college but by the time I can apply I’ll be 20 and I already feel like a failure. I just don’t know where to go or what to do anymore I regret dropping out and I regret all my decisions.

743,"I proposed to the love of my life about a month ago, and things are great as usual. Her family threw a party for us with a private dining room, appetizers, entrees, a custom cake, etc. They are of means and while my fiancee wished to have a say in the planning, her sister and parents took the reigns and went a little over the top for her tastes.  
That's something we are trying to be thankful for. Of course, it's a celebration for them, too, right? And a chance to leave an impression? That's where I'm confused. I think I see it as a gift for us, but should we have a say in the planning, or just accept their gift the way they choose to give it?
  
At this point, my family is trying to plan our version of the same event, and while I would like my opinion to matter, I feel guilty that I should just let my family plan this how they like. We aren't of means the way her family is but we do all right. Knowing the numbers I would love to pad the budget for a few extras, but don't want to insult my parents. What they have tentatively planned is almost verbatim my fiancee's party which stretches their budget and to me is just... more of the same? We just had this exact party with the same people.  
  
I want to have it at home, set up some nice decorations, some yard games, have it catered, and ultimately we'll spend less. But there will be a personal touch and it would be impressive enough while being distinctly different from the last party. For something like this, I would pay a large portion of the bill. But my family seems concerned with appearances and I dont know if it's my place here to push for what I really want.

I became friends with a girl who I had so much in common with. We have the same car (and are both car people) the same music taste, the same birthday and the same learning style (we have both done online school for years) we were casual friends for a few months, but eventually started talking. Once we did, it went from 0-100 very quickly. I’m a very passionate person and I fall hard, so naturally I did fine with this. She seemed to as well. We both expressed a desire to date, so we did. We had a few really amazing days where all we did was have fun, laugh and jam together. I haven’t felt at home with someone in a long time.

Then she bailed on a hangout we had planned with a friend, saying, “something came up”
I thought she was in some sort of bad situation so I started trying to get in contact with her. Nothing for two days.

For the sake of making it short, it was obvious she was lying and clearly not having some sort of trouble. We haven’t talked much since then besides me finally getting a, “I have too much on my plate and I need to work on myself” text.

It’s been hard, a lot harder than most times. It was short, but it was amazing and I’m having a lot more trouble getting over her than I should.

A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

I used to be an excellent student in high school but things have happened, I’m 3 years out and have nothing to show for. So here we go, I went away my first year of college, dropped $45k and then came back home after changing my major. Found out my parents were getting divorced, got cheated on and didn’t really have any true friends. So my life kinda spiraled downward. I took work too seriously and ended up dropping all of my classes of failing them for the next 2 years basically. I’m at a 1.5 gpa and I just changed my major again, I want to do PTA, but there’s a 2 year waiting list and I need to bring my gpa up before that which will take a year. So I’m 5 years away from having that and only have 30 college credits now. All my friends are getting ready to graduate and I’m nowhere so it just kinda sucks. I have to pay for college out of pocket because I can’t get financial aid due to grades and I can’t really afford it. I don’t want to work full time cause I know I’ll get stuck.

756,"**Long post alert** 

I KNOW 'liking' someone at work is a recipe for disaster. I know! 

And yet I fell for her so badly. I spent god knows how many hours talking to her. We even went out a couple of times. I felt 'something' was there. 
And yet, when I asked her out , her response was ""oh come on man, what are you saying?"" verbatim. Followed by a laugh. I'm not kidding.

Anyway, so I tried my best to keeps things formal (and friendly) afterwards and I kind of made peace with the fact that this person was not 'for me'. I started thinking of her as a friend of sorts, considering we get (got) along quite well. 

Fast forward to a small party that a mutual coworker friend hosted today. Here I kind of saw her in her element, so to say, as she'd had some of her friends and all come over. 

And holy shit, I realised something. I mean absolutely nothing to her. Nothing. I'm just a random coworker who was probably a bit too interested (and invested) in her, that's all.

I know this might seem quite obvious to everyone here but it's like she's in a totally different world than me. She has her crushes, things she finds attractive in guys, types of guys she likes, etc. etc. 

As you guessed it, I am nothing like those guys.

Beyond feeling kinda shit and worthless right now, it's kinda okay I guess. I feel pretty bad now, but I should be fine soon, hopefully. 

But damn, I got this so, so, so wrong. I thought I knew her, you know? If she'd even hinted that she liked someone else, I would have stepped back a long time ago. She'd never mentioned any guy in her life to me, except her ex bf with whom she'd broken up earlier this year. 

But I guess that's what makes this office 'romance' stuff so bad - people don't want to divulge too much about themselves (and rightly so). As a result, it's very easy for idiots like me to get carried away. 

Anyway, I'd not been talking too much to this girl and things were getting a little better. After this party, I feel like dog shit again. I know there are people with really serious issues on this sub, and my problem seems very petty in comparison... and yet I feel absolutely horrible because my self esteem and sense of worth is at rock bottom levels again. 

Thank you for reading. Would read your thoughts on stuff like this. Also, any advice on improving self esteem and confidence would really help as I'm pretty much down in the dumps right now.",30Jul2019,1

I was convinced by my family that I would be well payed at my job, however i found out now that its the same pay as my old job, but I thought this was a red flag but looked past it. 

I started my job 2 days ago, and its 10x the work washing dishes on a busy night at my last job is and I am very unhappy so far. Upon telling the other employees I was doing the work for min wage for my age (16), they told me “fuck that” and “If you’re after money, then here is not where you want to be” and getting min wage for the work was beyond them. Im genuinely making less here than i was working at the cheapest restaurant, since at least I was getting tips there. 

I also dont feel as if im pulling my weight either but I honestly dont know. I also feel as if cant really leave, since the owner offered me the job (which im assuming because im a cheap hire). When i asked my parents for advice they said they dont want me to be unhappy, but I cant leave unless I have another job which is fair enough, but honestly I dont know what to do. I feel like, although I wouldn’t make as much money, I’d honestly much rather do another year of school while working part time than work here 8-5 for the year.

There have always been some symptoms, like her ignoring compliments she can't agree with and calling herself ugly and the kind. Also she is crying a lot more often than other people, most of the time because some ""friends"" of her that she only knows from the internet, started to personally attack her, calling her an attention whore and telling her she was an awful person deserving to die. I don't think I need to clarify but she totally isn't. She never takes care of herself only caring about and helping others with their problems, no matter how bad these people treat her. Without a doubt they are bad influence, but she refuses to accept that, defending them saying that they are in a bad situation right now and that they don't mean it. Worst thing is she agrees with some of the bad things they say.

Not too long ago there was a time period of about 1,5 weeks, in which she would only talk to me on discord (we're both PC Gamers), unwilling to leave her room or meetup with me or anyone else. Of course I was worried, but I thought it was just some phase that would pass by or that maybe there was another reason she just didn't want to talk about, and after these days she appeared  normal again, so I kind of forgot about it. Until one week ago another female friend of ours burst into tears, telling us about all these years of bullying she had gone through and how she cries every night. My girlfriend then tried to console her and it was the first time she kind of opened up as as well. She told the crying girl how she had gone through all these bad things as well, and when she comforted her, anything she said could have been meant for herself. It was like talking to a mirror, but she just can't see herself the way she sees others, always searching for a spark of good, but totally hating herself. She also thinks that she's a bad girlfriend, which is mainly because I am way more affectionate than she is, which doesn't trouble me at all, though. No matter how often I tell her that I love her more than anything else in this world, she's still unsatisfied with her girlfriend-skills. 

She really is a great person, always nice and forgiving and polite, and at least in my eyes she's cute when judging by looks as well, so I really hate the thought of her feeling so miserable all the time for no real reason at all, I just don't know how to help her. I'm totall inexpierenced myself, she's my first girlfriend to be honest, and even I know that even as a lover I can't cure her depression on my own, and that even if everything goes well from now on it will take a long time for her to get better, but I want to do my best to support her, and I would love to hear your advise on how to handle the situation best.

P.S. I'm sorry for my bad writing skills, English isn't my first language ( I'm German). I'm not sure wether my descriptions are comprehensibly, point is she's an angel with depressions (Honest depressions, she's not one of these fakers that just want attention) and I want to support her.",30Jul2019,1
765,"I need some perspective from others on this subject, I am a 22 year old (soon to be 23 on the 11th August) guy from the south, I have a recently moved out of my parents house (technically kicked out but that's a different story). I have finally achieved a small level of comfort in my life as of late; I have a good IT job despite not having finished college an amazing girlfriend and a fairly good support system including friends and family. However despite this I have a feeling of hopelessness that I cannot escape and has been with me since middle school. Ever since the seventh grade I have been considering suicide in some forum, I have attempted at least 4 times in my life and have received in patient care from a mental facility due to these attempts twice. Each time I learned something very valuable about myself and managed to move forward, however the underlying feeling of hopelessness is has always stuck with me. One of the main factors for me being alive today are the friends and family I mentioned above; I determined that I want to setup a life for my close friends and family during the next 8 years so that when I'm gone they will be taken care of. I love all of them deeply and I don't want to hurt them however I can't continue on, life does not seem like something that was designed for me, I seem no point in continuing to exist in a world where I am constantly in pain, I have immense physical pain whenever I wake up as well as a deep mental anguish caused by world events. I see everyday the injustices committed against people like myself (black American) my girlfriend (trans) and other groups and I know deep down there will never be any reprieve for my brothers and sisters. The world does not seem to be getting better and I have been struggling to find my place in it; ultimately after doing some soul searching and deep philosophical research I've come to the conclusion that life isn't something I want to continue experiencing. I have suffered severe emotional abuse throughout the years and I don't have the strength to keep going. The best I can do is make sure the people I care about are taken care of financially before I'm gone. I need some advice from anyone willing to listen...is there a better way?...am I being selfish in this decision? I have only discussed this with my GF.",30Jul2019,1
766,"This is my first post here, so please be kind.
I am a 14 years old boy living in Eastern Europe. I live in my apartment alone for a week, then I go to my parents' house for a week and so on during this summer vacation. There is certainly one thought that crossed my mind multiple times and I cannot ignore it. I am slightly concerned, even.
What if robbers come at my door? In my country, I've seen a lot of violent news recently, because of some dickhead in the parliament who somehow legally released thousands of highly dangerous prisoners some months ago. I know you are probably going to tell me it's ok and I shouldn't worry that much, but I can't sleep properly.
If robbers come at my door, what should I do?
If they don't force the door, I should call the police. But if they actually break it? On the news, a man and his children died because some prisoner got out and chainsawed his door and eventually him. So what if they break it?
I mean if there is only one guy (who I assume won't have such a weapon), I could probably fend him off. I practiced MMA and kickboxing since I was 6 (though I am not in the greatest shape right now), I have 2 really long knives (~20cm) in the kitchen which is pretty close, a nunchaku and a high voltage taser. But what I assume is the safest and best option would be to run in my room and barricade it, then call the police. But I don't have a lot of fate in them, because literally some days ago, 2 girls were slaughtered because of the incompetence of the Emergency Services operators and the Police. Basically, they were kidnapped to be later sold as sex-slaves and one of them called the police in secret. The operator called her back, which led into the criminal finding out what she did, which further lead to them being brutally chopped up for it. Then the police took 15 hours to find a house with exact descriptions of what it looked like in ~2-3 km².
I am as insecure as ever in my own house right now and I don't know what to do. If, let's say, some robbers come in and I barricade myself, call for the police, and they eventually break the barricade (cause I don't have much stuff in my room to block the door) what should I do? Jump out the window? I live at the second story, so in the best case scenario I break both my legs and in the worst I land head-first. Most murderers in my country are fucking stupid ( I'm talking about illiterates) and they probably won't listen to me saying I will hand them everything I have. How should I sleep at night like this, guys? I know it's hard coming up with an answer for this exact specific question, but it bothers me too much.",30Jul2019,1

I want to study and gain skills in my field of interest, but it's proving very difficult since I feel sleepy *all the time*. I'm barely keeping my eyes open while typing this. It's so strange, I've never felt this way before even when previously unemployed.

The past week, I've been sleeping 11-12 hours per day, but since yesterday have limited myself to only 8 hours per day. I am also trying to establish a routine for myself by setting an alarm at the same time everyday, and going to sleep at similar times every night.

I am trying to find low-pressure, ""low key"" temporary jobs in the meantime, because perhaps it is the loneliness and anxiety of unemployment that is getting to me, but it's proving to be quite difficult. Most companies seem to be hiring for full-time, ""fast paced"" roles. I want to throw my all into learning the aforementioned skills in my field of interest, but I don't know how I'm supposed to when I just want to sleep all the time.

I can only hang out with my close friend so often (she works long hours). I walk pretty much wherever I go and take breaks to walk outside, but I still feel sleepy.

775,"This is kinda difficult to explain without the whole story, so I’ll keep it as short but as detailed as possible so you can understand my situation. My husband is from Brazil, and I know they obviously have different levels of respect than American families (I’m American). When he and I were only dating his parents respected me and gave him and I our own space. They both visited for his college graduation, then again for our wedding. His mother has been here far too often and too much, to the point that I can tell she doesn’t respect me anymore. He and I have only been married thirteen months and she’s been here a collective 9-10 months, but that’s a whole other story. I feel his father doesn’t respect me in ways that he always takes the passenger seat of the car (I know this is so small, but I think my husband should have the respect for me to say I sit up front), he disregards me completely unless I speak Portuguese (which I don’t), I understand he doesn’t speak English but he literally acts like I’m not in the room at all. And he’s constantly yelling - I understand Brazilians are naturally loud people, but this is to the point that it literally hurts my ears and when I ask my husband to ask him to quiet down he straight up says no. He hates when people have animals as pets and we have five cats, I understand that’s a lot of cats but he’s extremely rude and it irritates me. He’s not allergic, he’s just disrespectful. For example, the guest bedroom is naturally the warmest place in the house, as the window isn’t big enough for an AC unit, a floor model is too expensive for us right now, and we don’t have central AC. So, the cats love staying in that room when it’s vacant (or when my MIL is here) and he doesn’t understand if he doesn’t want them in to keep his door shut. He yells about them bothering him and I’m just like ‘why can’t he take it as a compliment?? Our cats don’t like anyone except us’. A more serious example is; they’re always interested in our drinks; whether it be soda, juice, (especially) milk, etc, they are interested. To the point; he backhands their face if they’re interested in his drinks. I understand the cats may have boundary issues but it’s because we are okay with everything they do, and it’s borderline abuse what my FIL does. When I visit someone’s house, I don’t smack their animals. He’s staying this week and I’m stressing about it. 
The story about my mother in law’s disrespect is a MUCH MUCH longer one so I won’t include it all, but summary; she steals my things and lies about it, she can’t respect that I don’t want her to hand wash dishes and only use the dishwasher as I had a heart transplant and have a weakened immune system and therefore need a *clean* house and dishes. She never washes her hands when she cooks, she does things that could give us a foodborne illnesses, and when I tell her it’s not healthy she says ‘i survived’ but I might not, she can get salmonella but I’m not. And VARIOUS other circumstances, she’s basically lived with us for about nine months so I have a whole list of things that get worse by recentcy. Luckily she’s back to Brazil but I don’t know how to tell Ant I don’t want her to come back for a long time. 

But my husband excuses them by saying “that’s just them, they’re old. I can’t change their ways” but he says that about both of his parents when they *clearly* disrespect only me. What do I say to him to get him to understand?? I don’t want them to visit anymore and I don’t know how to tell him this. 

Am I being rude? I married him, not his parents, and I don’t want to live with them when they don’t respect me. His mother constantly says that I’m young and I’m not mature enough to understand why she does things the way she does - no, she’s outright being disrespectful to my requests!

776,"Hey there, I'd appreciate some advice right now.

I (male 23) just startet dating that unspeakably nice guy (22) about 1,5 months ago. Up until now we met like 4 times since he lives about an hours drive away from me and we had a really good time together each time. On the second date he already introduced me to some of his friends.

Just when I got home from that second date, he texted me that he really appreciates the time with me and hasn't felt that secure and happy in a long time. He also told me that until last fall he has been in a 4 year relationship and that his partner left him for his best friend and on top of that he seems to have some financial problems. All in all his life seems to be quite a mess right now and he is quite depressed i guess.

To be totally honest, I really wish he hadn't told me all of that.  I really don't care if my partner has money or not and I know that everybodys got a past. But by telling me, he makes me feel like I don't have a choice other than being in a relationship with him or breaking heart and sending him to the worst state of mind ever.

He is (no lie) the nicest and cutest guy I ever dated and I really like him. I didn't open a door for myself in all the time I spent with him and there is no morning without an absolutely cute good morning text from him. But I'm not fully out of the closet, close to graduating from law school (which makes it hard to date someone that far away time-wise) and not that sure if a gay relationship is the right thing for me ultimately. So there are some factors that imply the whole thing won't work out. And I feel kind of trapped because I really really really don't want to break his heart, since his life is so messy as it is..

Any advice what I should do, say?",30Jul2019,5

778,"I'm 16 and pretty clueless how to approach this girl. She works at a restaurant near my home, and she's about my age. She's cute as hell, and I literally begin to stutter when I see her. How do I work up the courage to talk to her, and when I do, what do I say?",30Jul2019,1
780,"Ok, this is probably gonna be super long but I need to vent...

So lemme tell this from the start - when I was about 8-10 (I’m 13 now) this kid came to town. (I guess we’ll call him Mark?) Everybody absolutely hated him because he acted like a violent asshole and he was just a big ball of negativity. (I think he might’ve been like 6?) I just kinda ignored him, he punched me in the face once but I just stayed away from him.

So fast forward a few years, I’m 11 and my grandma passes away. Cancer took her. It was really horrible but I’m mostly over it now. I don’t cry about it anymore. When I was still 11, my grandfather decides to marry none other than Mark’s mother (her husband died as well). So, it’s a tradition to go over to my grandpas house every Sunday. He’s really the sweetest guy ever, he’s so nice to everyone. Ever since mark came into the family, everything just feels so much worse. He runs around the house screaming at the top of his lungs about how everything is hateful because mom won’t let him buy a new Five Nights At Freddy’s figurine or some shit. He refuses to eat any food other than chips and chocolate and wastes a lot of food as well. He’s always jumping on things and screaming and nobody does a fucking thing. It pisses me off so much, especially because I go there every Sunday and sometimes after that. I don’t know how they can handle just ignoring it, like he is so GOD DAMN ANNOYING, not to mention he actually breaks things. I should probably say here I’m kind of a sensitive guy, loud sounds really shake me up (I don’t know why) and I cry easily. Mark made me cry on New Years because I was sitting in a chair trying to calm down from all the commotion and he ran up to my ear and screamed “SHUT THE HELL UP!!” right in my ear. I just fucking hate him so much and I hate how nobody does anything. On top of that, whenever Mark’s parents want to go somewhere they just make us babysit him. He wrecked my door last time. The only actually positive thing they do is have him see some sort of corrective teacher (i guess that’s what you’d call it) and apparently recently he **just** hit the criteria to get an autism diagnosis although I personally don’t see any symptoms at all other than screaming and zoning out. I’ve noticed that my grandfather seems sadder since Mark arrived.

So it probably sounds like I’m just grumbling about how annoying this goddamn kid is, but it gets worse. apparently Mark’s parents don’t monitor his internet activity either. Pretty much everyone in my tiny town is tech illiterate except maybe 10 out of 300 people. So I fix almost all of Mark’s devices. I really don’t mind fixing things, as a matter of fact I gladly take up all offers. So I was fixing his phone (I don’t know why the fuck he has a phone he’s 8 and I didn’t get one until a few months ago) and he had YouTube open. I didn’t even mean to, I glanced at it and he was watching a video called “I put happy music over school shooting footage” this concerned me so I opened the YouTube app to see what the hell this was, I swiped down from the video and it was in his liked videos section along with Mario sex parody videos and other shit. I didn’t know what to do so I quietly closed it and showed my dad. He showed Mark’s mom and she did... nothing. She said “oh I fixed it I turned on the restricted mode switch” but since YouTube has no lock function, you can just go in the settings and turn it back off. And I looked at his phone again and that’s exactly what he did. I turned it back on just for good measure and went back to “fixing” his phone (I think he wanted me to remove the virus he put on there?) I know snooping isn’t a very good thing to do but I was legitimately concerned and none of the adults seemed to care. I looked through his phone. First thing I noticed is the fact that he had Kik, so I opened that. It was mostly just him role playing as undertale characters with strangers, but I found him chatting with a few pedophiles. One of them asked him to send pictures. He didn’t send any nude photos thank god but he sent a video of him slapping his ass. I noped the fuck out of that. He had Amino but it was the same, just weird role playing. He also was trying to email a guy and role play, but he kept misspelling the email address (“ICould” instead of iCloud). I looked at his web browser and there was pornhub open. At that point I was done, I left and told my parents about everything I saw. They said “oh it’s not our problem, don’t get caught up in it” that pissed me off because nobody is doing anything. I stopped looking at his phone after that, except occasionally I could see he had restricted mode turned back off.

You might be thinking, “holy shit it can’t get any worse than this” well strap in. One day Mark came over because we had to take care of him again. Normally he just plays on his phone the whole time, but this time was different. He went in my little sisters room and closed the door. After about 10 minutes my mom noticed and since she knows he’s a weird kid she opened the door- to see him in his underwear trying to get my little sister to strip (she didn’t do a goddamn thing thank god). My mom was PISSED and needless to say, he went home early. His mom said “oh don’t worry it won’t happen again” and that’s all. **the only people that have access to Mark are my parents and Mark’s parents. I am sure no sexual abuse happened here. I’m 100% sure this is just shit he learned from porn or maybe from a classmate.** after that, we babysat one more time but we stopped permanently after he tried to break my sisters hand because he was pissed at her. (He actually tried to bend her hand all the way back wards and he could hear her scream before we stopped him.)

Fast forward to a month ago: he got a computer, it’s not a new one though - it’s an old 2004 Windows XP computer. I set it up for him and in the process, I installed porn blockers. I figured there was no way in hell he would be able to disable these, they have a password on them and are hidden in the chrome settings. But, yesterday, i went to fix his computer (a website he was trying to visit wasn’t working). I needed to search something on the computer and typed “to” in the google search and a previous search “todoroki porn gif” showed up. I was... uh, intrigued, and I checked his history. AN ABSOLUTE FUCKTON OF HENTAI PORN! thousands and thousands of videos from pornhub with names like “deku gets raped in bathroom” and “black butler hard fuck” Turns out the sneaky fucker was able to disable the blocker by completely uninstalling the browser and reinstalling it. There was also a ton of other weird things like “drinking legal age” “how to load porn on roku tv” “undertale rule 34” “age of legal sex” I told my parents about *some* of it (not including the drinking and undertale stuff) and they said “oh but it’s none of our business just ignore it” and here I am now. I’m pissed and also afraid that he may try to do something sexual with someone else. What can I do to stop him from doing this shit? Can you guys recommend any good free blockers or protection apps?",30Jul2019,1
781,"I work at a fast-serve type restaurant, and this is my first job. My parents make less than 50k combined, and they supported me through high school since I was pursuing a science type program in university. I applied to over 10 different places in my small town and this is the only place that called me for an interview. I will say beforehand that this restaurant chain has a notoriously toxic work environment, which I found out online through hundreds of poor reviews from their former employees.

I started training at the end of June, and have completed my training and am working as a proper employee. Nonetheless, I still do not feel very confident at doing the tasks expected of me. I am trying my best and my heart is in the right place, but I am seriously struggling. Even from my third shift, I have been yelled at and told that I need to speed up and work faster, even when I can't do any better. Other coworkers have accused me of not paying attention or ""half-assing"" my work whenever I make a mistake. I have been yelled at by three of my coworkers, and one told me that I was ""pissing him off."" I never mean any harm, nor are my mistakes serious.

This job has taken a serious toll on my mental health. I am seeing a therapist for generalized anxiety disorder and depression (which I pay for with my own wages since my parents can't afford it). I feel anxious constantly, and when I'm not at work I can't stop stressing about my next shift. I can't relax during the days I have off work, and I no longer sleep properly due to anxiety about my job. Thinking about my next shift brings me close to tears and I have had several panic attacks the day before work. I'm a nervous wreck and only keeping myself together for my parent's sake. When I told my dad that I was struggling, he laughed at me and said that I was only working at a fast food restaurant and that I need to suck it up. 

I told my mom honestly that I can't go on doing this during August, but I am not willing to quit until I have another job lined up. My mental health is in shambles, but I can't quit. I feel incredibly helpless and I am embarrassed at how easily my job has caused me to crumble. I'd rather not work and make no money because of the damage this is causing to my mental health, but my parents won't let me quit and I feel too ashamed of myself to quit after 3 weeks. I am currently job hunting again, but I already applied to most places in town and my options are extremely limited.

I understand most people hate their job, especially those working at quick serve restaurants, and are unlikely to feel any sympathy for me. I don't expect a solution for my anxiety, I just don't want to hate living the way I do at the moment. How can I get myself through until I find a better job?",30Jul2019,1

783,"A few years ago a friend and I came up with an idea to improve military equipment. We haven’t patented the idea yet due to finances but all the research is there and ready to go. 

Fast forward 3 years to today and I am training to become a lawyer.  I am very focussed on that. I believe in having laser focus on one big task at a time. 

My friend called me today and said we should revisit our idea because he heard through a reliable source that there is a market for our idea. In order to revisit the idea it’s going to take a lot of work. I am very efficient and if I am being honest I will be steering and directing to venture. Everything from research to setting meetings, phone calls etc. For example when my friend called today he said the first thing we should do is get the idea patented ASAP. I told him no, the first thing to do is make a prototype, do further research, test the prototype, hopefully raise funding from the prototype and research (once Non disclosures are signed) and get the idea patent pending. 

I stressed that this project is not an overnight project but something which will take time. Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe my way is more structured and more realistic. 

Doing all of these steps will take time and my time from studying will be affected as I will not be as focussed on my legal training as I know I should be. Once I get behind an idea I  back it 100% and right now I am focussed 100% on my training.  It may be important to add that he is unemployed and has been this entire year. 

What should I do because the idea does have legs and in reality could make me more money than my legal career.

786,"If this is not the correct sub to post this, please let me know!

Hope this is not considered a Petty post (considering what are some of the other posts I've seen on this sub, given that it's not a problema with any other person, or something that serious if analyzed completely), but it's bothering me..

I'm not from the USA, and in my college once you hit the final year of your college education you have to, in addition to attend the final 4-5 classes per semester (lower than previous years), you have to go to community services and 6 months of an internship (which makes total sense, otherwise you could be graduated without having ANY experience on the field, lol).

However, I feel as if.. I'm going to dissapoint everyone if I go there?

BAKGROUND: For better or worse, all this 4 years I took classes without taking in consideration the level of the teachers giving the class.. if you took a look at my grades, you would see mostly 9/10 and 10/10's (a couple of teachers gave free 10's simply for attending and participating in class) and would believe I'm kind of an expert in what I study - I am not.
The 2 times my father has asked me something on what I supposedly only get 10's I have had no idea on what the answer was. (Think as if, if you are a mathematician with supposedly 10's and 9's and someone asked you ""Hey, how do I solve this operation : 81 / 9, you don't know since no one on said classes tought you how to divide numbers)..

With that said, I'm freaked out about doing the Social Services / Community Services, I already picked a place to go to (two months ago) and they said ""Ok, you start the fifth of august, give me your phone number and we´ll call you when the date is close to give you a tour and instructions of the place :)"", and well, instead of going to ask again this month (I finished this semester in mid june, and this month a half has been me playing videogames and watching movies) or going to ask somewhere else, all I've been feeling is relieve of knowing that no one has called me, so I'm ""free"" and not going there..


Now, since I'm supposed to begin doing services next monday, I could maybe go there tomorrow (Wednesday) just to ask if, I don't know, there is something up.. but I keep feeling as if, if there's some work to do, they'll look at my grades (which is a requirement to go there), say ""Wow, you're good at this, Ok you'll doing X,Y,Z (which I don't have any idea).. :(


Also, family has started to ask me ""When are you starting doing some work related to your study?"" ""All your cousins (I have 3 cousions around the same age as me, and they study the same, however they are from the other side of the country so I cannot ask them for help, go figure..) started last year!""


Since said services / interships last around 6 months, if I started on August, I would end in February.. and December is a heavy working month for the family business; my mother already told me ""Hey, if you are doing the community services, don't worry, we'll be fine at the business :)"" but I already told her ""Nah, I'd rather help you out, don't worry about my services :)"" when in reality I'm just, as I said already, freaked out about going somewhere to have professionals tell me ""You really don't know how to do X,Y,Z??"" or something like that.. :(


TL;DR I'm supposed to be good at what I'm studying, however I am not. I am supposed to go do interships already (some people already started in June) but I'm scared people there tell me I'm bad at this. Afraid to tell family and would rather make it seem as if I'm willing to help them out, just to postpone said interships..",30Jul2019,1
787,Whats the best way to build mass to build muscles from working out? Is it just lots of meat and protein shakes or is there something special behind it or some secret routine?,30Jul2019,2
788,"So to start this off this is a throwaway account because 
1) I'm trying to go about this the right way and don't want anyone finding out who the real people are or who I am
2) I'm terrified and feel like absolute shit

So, I'm a massive catfish. I joined an online game server in 2015 with my friend and pretended to be someone I wasn't as a joke. We later told everyone and they all laughed and it was forgotten about. I kept playing. Then because I was insecure about being myself while gaming, I created this fake persona I would play as so I could be super cool and not the idiotic self I was in real life. It started out ok, I made friends with heaps of people, but then I got into some fights with some of the others for who should be the top dog of the server, the boss if you will. My stupid ass thought I deserved the spot, and so when people told me I didn't, I made up this story about how I though everyone was like family to me, and that I was an orphan who's parents were killed in a car crash and I was the only one who survived. They all felt bad and gave me the owner spot, and that was that. Then, maybe 3 months later the server was deleted, and most of us moved onto another server. I don't remember most of the details, or why I didn't this, I just know that I'm a massive asshole and I'm suffering for it now. I pretended to have terminal cancer, to make people feel bad for me, to make people think I'm awesome, your guess is as good as mine at this point. Idk if they believed me, but this one person did. I strung them along for the ride, pretending to love them and be in a relationship with them. It didn't last for long, I quit everything because my mental health was very very bad at the time, and afterwards I tried to take my life twice (not because of but indirectly because of). Nobody else knows about this except my friends irl and i've tried very hard to bury it and forget because I feel like a monster. 

I can still contact this person possibly. But I don't know if it's worth it because it's been two years since we last spoke (they tried to contact me last year). I honestly just want to apologise, and let them know I was in a super shitty place irl and I let out all my frustration in the game, and on them and they never deserved that. If I can, Do I do it? Or do I just let them believe that my persona was a real person? What I don't need is everyone telling me how shitty I am, I know this already, my psycologist tells me this, my friends tell me this. I just need advice on whether I should try and contact this person to apologise to them or not. Maybe I'm just blowing this out of proportion and everyone knew it was a lie (which I'm hoping is the case) 

If you somehow know me from this post, I am so sorry. Words cannot explain how shit I feel about this. Nobody ever deserves to have that happen to them, and I am paying the price for my actions. I didn't know what I was doing was wrong because I was so deep into it that it took an intervention for me to get help. I'm ok now. 

TIA, I'll monitor the comments as often as I can",30Jul2019,1
789,He’s been an alcoholic for 40 years and was on meth and crack as well for most of my childhood/teen years. He never learned how to use a computer or a smartphone at all. Literally no concept of how they work. And I live in a different state far away so I can’t teach him. He doesn’t really have any friends left and I’m his only family member. He mostly did delivery driving jobs when he could get them before he had a back injury in 2008. He hasn’t worked since then and was in a toxic relationship with a woman who kept him from getting back to work. She’s gone now and he has had the necessary surgery so his back is fine. He’s motivated and clear-headed for the first time since I can remember. I so badly want him to get it together. And this is the closest he’s been in years. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.,30Jul2019,2
790,"In March my house was broken into, they took my car and a lot of other expensive electrical items too. I got the car back but because they took the keys I had to get a new lockset fitted. Because of strikes in France my car was in the garage for 3 months while we waited for the parts to be delivered from Peugeot, which racked up some lovely holding fees etc and long story short I ended up paying £500 for my excess on my car insurance (on top of the excess for my room insurance for other stolen items). As a uni student I'm already strapped for cash, working 3 jobs over the summer trying to support myself and my partner and having to pay £430 a month for rent on top of everything else. Last week I was rear-ended at a junction in the middle of the countryside, no CCTV, no dashcam, and with it being my first ever car accident I was very distressed. As you can imagine when I got out of the car and saw no damage I was greatly relieved. Like an idiot I didnt get the guy's number plate or insurance details (I was already crying my eyes out and didnt want to cause a fuss over nothing). Now a few days on I realise my boot won't open, one of my number plate lights has completely disappeared and the whole of the bumper is sort of... springy. You can press the back of the car in with your hands. 
I have £400 left in my bank account which will just cover my rent (due Thursday) so as you can imagine I can NOT afford to be paying out a load of money for car repairs.

793,"I've been at my current job for almost 2 years and I'm beginning to feel worn out. I'm a receptionist/cashier and my manager is NEVER happy with anything I do. She is very nitpicky and negative. I recently had the owner of the store tell me I didn't have a brain, I've heard coworkers be called fat/fatties, and my coworker got yelled at in front of customers for wanting to take vacation time that she earned. If I need a day off for something my manager treats me horribly and usually makes me feel very guilty about taking time off of work. 

I've started to look for jobs and was contacted by a college in my area to be a financial aid counselor. I would get 5x more vacation time and personal time, WAY better retirement plan, tuition assistance (I'm currently taking my gen eds which I could transfer the credits from my current school to the new school), and a great healthcare plan. Those are the positives of the new job, the only things that I see as negative are it would be a 40 minute drive to work (but my husband and I would be moving in the spring if I got the job), and I can be required to work anytime during the hours of 8am-10pm (currently i do 9-5 or 10-7). 

My interview is tomorrow and I have some questions prepared for them to really see if this is a good fit. The only thing I'm worried about is giving my two weeks notice if I decide to leave. The end of August is a busy month with lots going on at work and it would really mess up the schedule. I know that the last person to give their notice (they gave a months notice) was told that they wouldn't be needed anymore and to pack up their stuff and leave. If I give my notice I'm definitely preparing for that and I'm gonna have all of my belongings packed up just in case. I'm not a confrontational person and my boss can be very confrontational and doesn't care if she hurts your feelings or embarrasses you in front of customers so I definitely want this to be as smooth as possible.

794,"This is a repost bc it seems like no one saw my first one and I’m getting a little desperate for some advice that’s not from people who know me.

So I just recently graduated and for now I was planning on moving back home, my mom and sister are going to help me move back and I am transferring jobs so I’ll have a job when I get back home. However, a coworker of mine is looking for a roommate and I recently made a lot of great friends that really want me to stay and I too, want to stay. Unfortunately, I will not stay at my current job with the people that I work with because it is a toxic environment for me and I would need to look for another job. And because I’m graduated, I can work more hours.
Rent for this new apartment will be around $700 not including everything else and I am also planning a trip that will take around $356 out of my paycheck every month. If I move back home, I will still pay rent, although it will be significantly lower. I know the answer might be clear and to just go home would be cheaper but for the first time I feel connected to people and actually feel wanted and I don’t want to lose that. Should I stay or should I go? (I talked to my mom and sister about what I should do and they say it’s up to me but I am stressing about money and my friend just told me to take out a loan for the first month of rent but I don’t think that’s a good idea) if I go I can always come back to visit and but if I stay I can stay with everyone and won’t have to worry about coming back just to visit. It’s not an easy decision especially with my friends telling me to stay and I’m not good at decisions if I don’t know what will happen in the future with these friends",30Jul2019,1

797,"I was 15 when I started doing electronic music. By the time I was 17 I was still very wet behind the ears, made progress though. By the time I was 19 I had a residency DJing in a night club. By the time I was 23 it was pretty much all over. 

I want to point out some very important things that I retroactively look back on, knowing what I know now. Having worked a dozen odd jobs, manual labor, entry level, and I'm basically nowhere...

Now that I'm going on 30 I'm looking for a career so I'm not bouncing around. 

I see experience is what matters most, degrees may get you a job, certs, whatever... people you know. But to have dedicated so many hours to one thing (thousands) and have so much passion even if it has dissipated over the years. I actually had my head REALLY deep, I can't ever see myself getting so deep into something again. I had mentors, teaching from A guru, really everything that I feel cannot be attained by means of traditional ways. Like just getting a job. 

This stuff really was special, the path I was on and it flourished to about as high as I could allow it. Idk if I fell apart and couldn't handle it or didnt have a clear enough plan for the future. Mental health, life obstacles, (some drugs) I was derailed and hit bottom. In which, I then ran away from everything.

Now the last 5 years I've been doing whatever I can job wise to make it and almost 30. I look at what the future holds for me and all the jobs I look at everyone wants basically what I used to have, real hands on experience, a pretty massive portfolio, information accumulated, just everything even if I didnt know how to do something musically I was confident. 

I cannot play an instrument, I'm not a musical savant, I just had time and focus then. It took it's natural course and bloomed into good things for me.

I wasnt 100% sure but I was going with the flow and never wanted an office job or career. Now I look back I see things differently like how shallow or philosophically speaking what ""music"" is and the art itself. I've changed as a person and have a different perspective. But what I know is true more than anything is how involved I was and if I had half of what I had then In terms of involvement and knowledge I'd be set. 

Now i dont know what to do and getting back to the way things used to be I'm sure you know that's not possibly, I could try to emulate my best but I guess what I'm trying to say is. I had a career when I was so young, now I'm still young, but older and have to really figure this career thing out. But I really WAS a producer, artist.... Even if I got a cert or degree, i wouldn't be that.... 

It's like I made myself who I was because that's who I was, but now I'm trying to make myself something new and start all over. Nothing interests me on the level that really makes me dream of the future.


I really made my dreams come true back then, I had a dream and realized it. Can you believe that? 

I dont know what to do with my life anymore and like I said I'm not a really talented musical genius but damn I'm really passionate about it. Even though maybe not so much anymore and I doubt myself . I read something today that said a journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. Back then I didn't even think about how far or how long, I was just walking with a vision. 

Now that's all different 

I know I'm not alone, and I could start a new path and maybe come out better with something else.

Back to jobs and career. Everything I see requires what I dont have. The only thing I have feels useless to me now because I dont know people anymore, have the tools, or vision or time or antyhing. Experience, and real commitment. 

In my time back then I was always on the computer and resolving issues, I've always been decent with computers but a IT job really doesnt interest me and I worry about how fulfilling it will be. I never wanted an office jobs anyways.

After much consideration I’ve requested a percentage position (80%) with my new job so that I can continue some of my freelance endeavours.

800,"My ex-boyfriend flirted with my sister right in front of me. I brought my sister to a party and she was there. I don't know if anyone on here uses Instagram, but she posted an Instagram picture of herself in a bikini earlier that day and she looks really good in it. Like, insane. Her look huge, her curves are amazing, and she had no makeup on and just looked all-natural. 

My ex-boyfriend was at the party and he came up to us. But when he did, he wouldn't leave her side. I was WITH her too! Right next to her. Literally. I was sitting on a couch with my sister right next to me, and he began to flirt with her... and it was completely visible to me. It was just us 3 on the couch.  So he came up to her (and me, because I was right there) and started saying she looks so beautiful in her picture. He was flirting with her so hard. He kept saying she is so pretty. She is my half-sister, and her dad (not related to me) is Filipino so we look kinda-alike but not really. She is just a different race than I am, so I feel like we could pass as cousins more than sisters. I thought that maybe he was flirting with her because he knows he can't have me (first, he already did have me and we broke up. I thought maybe he knew his chances with me are over? Second, I have a boyfriend currently so I am not available) and he went for my sister because she is the next best thing and looks kinda like me and everyone knows her through me, but I honestly don't think that's the case. That would make me feel a little bit better if it were, like why would he go for my sister in front of me? I mean, yeah it's been a couple of years but my gosh. That seems so disrespectful. The only other explanation for why he would go as far as disrespecting me and embarrassing me and hurting me is that he was just genuinely so attracted to my sister that he couldn't stay away from her. I think he is just genuinely very attracted to my sister which is soooo hurtful to me. When we dated, he never spoke to me as he spoke to her. I mean of course, he complimented my looks when we dated... but wow. He kept saying ""you're so pretty like wow. You're so beautiful. I can't get over it. You're so pretty"" 

Another reason why it hurt was that it had been a couple of years since we last spoke. We broke up on good terms. We were friendly afterward. I always kinda missed him (not as a boyfriend, just as a friend). When I first saw him I assumed that he was coming up to us to catch up with me. After all, my half-sister lives in another state and she was visiting me, so this was the FIRST time he ever saw her in person. He never even spoke to her before this. He only knew who she was because of me... because WE dated. I didn't think he was coming up to us... to speak to her?! We used to be extremely close and tell each other everything after all... but no. He just wanted to hit on my sister. I feel so embarrassed, disrespected, hurt, etc. I feel like if he was willing to do this in front of me, he must have never cared for my feelings. And I honestly thought he did. I feel like our years of dating were a waste. We broke up on good terms. It's not like he had any reason to feel like it was okay to hurt me like this...",30Jul2019,0
801,"Hi, I’ve recently been grappling with the suspicion that I was abused at a very early age in my life. It’s not too terribly hurtful to me to imagine this, but I want to use this opportunity of me still feeling comfortable around this issue to talk to someone who could help me make sense of everything.

If there’s any kind of free online resource I could go to or any kind of free service I can take advantage of, that would be great because I’m pretty desperate to talk to someone about this as there’s no one in my life I can trust with this kind of sensitive information.

802,"Disclaimer: I am using a throwaway account to post this.

It's hard to explain. A few minutes ago, I had stumbled upon a video on YouTube of a lion putting a camera in its mouth and taking it back out. Since I am a [vorarephile](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vorarephilia), it grabbed my attention. I didn't want to click on the video since it was an actual animal, but my curiosity got the best of me. 

When I did end up watching it, I ended up being aroused by the lion eating the camera. I was absolutely disgusted in myself, I kept thinking, ""Why is this turning me on?"", or ""What the fuck am I doing?"", yet I couldn't stop watching it. Despite what I was trying to tell myself, it still aroused me. I was asking myself to stop. I knew damn well that how I felt, what I was doing, was completely wrong on so many levels, but I couldn't help myself and did it anyway. I am 15 years old and my parents do not know about this. 

I have three pets a home, a dog and two cats, however I do not have any sexual feelings towards them what-so-ever. I also did not have any thoughts of having intercourse with the lion in the video. I was only aroused by the idea of being small and getting swallowed whole by it, due to my interest in vore. But it still disgusts me due to the fact that I had these thoughts about an actual animal. I'm having a lot of trouble forgiving myself and I feel like as if I failed as a person by feeling the way I felt. What am I supposed to do? Am I a zoophile?

806,"Im a 24 year old male living in Brooklyn who makes (starting this month) $50k/year in salary, I have a savings account with one of the top yields, a retirement account,  and have had success and gained more knowledge in the stock market with a long-term plan. I currently live in the projects with my mother just cause it’s more convenient for me financially especially living in NYC. 

The problem Im facing is just finding a real career or something I can rely on to achieve the things I want to achieve but the more bad luck I keep getting the more I question whether or not the things im doing or have done was the right choice. I feel like I should’ve achieved more already and have massively not lived up to my own expectations. I know im an educated and smart individual, I stay humble and consider myself more of an introvert, I surround myself with positive people who work hard and want success (my two best friends) and yet I feel empty and unsuccessful. 

I got accepted into an aviation school right out of high school and completed a year before losing interest and transferring to a business school then switching majors to history and journalism. I graduated with a gpa just under 3.0 but that has never really bothered me as much but what I did after. I was in the process of getting an exceptional federal position with DHS before failing a polygraph exam which so badly put me into depression for two weeks because of how embarrassed I was that I failed it when there was nothing to hide. I picked myself back up and had a mini rebirth and self taught myself as much as I could, stocks, French, finances, owning property, and me and my friends devised a plan for a sort of entrepreneurship with owning property, opening our own restaurant. The goal then became save as much money as possible and acquire a stable job that could help support our aspirations...

All of a sudden one the friends who has had family and borderline bipolar disorder has to much going on and we can’t rely on him and more bad luck hits when me and other friend have massive bad-luck while taking a city job exam for the FDNY. I’ve learned that life hits you hard and you got be ready to take the punches but at what point do you tell yourself enough of the bullshit where am I in life and what, if anything, am I doing wrong? As a 24 year old with my knowledge should I be where im at? 

I currently want to go back and complete aviation school again and pursue a career in aviation because if I was to be honest my dream in life is to travel and be happy.

810,"So hey guys,
I am an 17 year old guy with a rather boring life. I dont have any real hobbies, nor have a girlfriend or anything like that. I do have some friends but I always feel like I put way more effort in the friendship than they do. During the summer break I do absolute nothing (I only game, watch movies etc) and never really get out off the house. Most of the time I am bored af. Anyway, next year I am going to uni and I was wondering how I could get a more interesting life? How do I find hobbies that i am actually excited about and where I am not bored all the time? 

Thanks guys!

813,"First of all, we come from a Latin American country, sadly, we have nothing similar to CPS and the only thing we can attend is the police or FBI. We have a culture were families live together until they are married or get an university degree. Now to the story...

This weekend we had an Aunt and one cousin (24M) visit our home, we had a great time and everthing. But after they left, my mother grabbed me to talk to me privately. 
There's this other cousin who has one daughter (6F) and one son (1M) who doesn't take care of them so my aunt (his mother) is the tutor. Anyway. The little girl is pretty annoying, it is well known in the family for acting very ""adult-like"", she speaks like she's like fifteen.
But the thing that left my mother and I very worried is what our cousin told my mother while they were at our place.
My cousin told my mother that once he was taking care of this girl while my other aunt was working. He was doing some stuff on the computer when the kid comes around goes like ""Hey X, what do you think of a student falling in love with her teacher?"". My cousin was shocked by the question and tried to not make it a serious matter, keeping in mind that she's just 6. But she insisted that what can you do if you are deeply in love with a teacher, like it was an important matter for her. He told us that this happened like a month ago.
Am I right to be worried? Am I over reacting? I know kids are interested in stuff they listen from adults, but being a Psychologist student I have seen enough horrifying stories of child abuse.",30Jul2019,1
814,"This is a throwaway account and first I need to give a backstory. Ever since I received my first phone with the same number I had today random numbers would text to me stuff like “Sheryll you have won such and such amount of money or that I was approved for a loan. “ Now my name is nowhere near being Sheryll and it is never the same number.

It was never often enough for it to be a problem until this summer. Since I have been looking for a job I have to answer every number that calls just in case. Now the person who calls is obviously number splicing since the calls come from all over the country. It is the same guy over and over. I have told him not to call again and cussed at him but for some reason he must think he has a shot of scamming me, which I knew that was the purpose right from the beginning.

The question is is how I can trace it and what charges can I press and how can I either stop the calls or make this guy’s life hell. What do I do?",30Jul2019,2

816,"Hi guys,

I’ve been kicked out of University for my non-existent attendance and poor exam results. I wish it was because I was a stereotypical student partying all night but I wasn’t (I had no friends, actually). My mental health had not been good from the get go; I struggled with very bad anxiety and self-esteem issues stemming from my autism and dyspraxia diagnosis. My ADHD also became much worse due to a summer of doing mostly nothing and having no support network at Uni. All these factors made it really difficult to cope and I ended up just staying in my flat all day, every day.

I understand that telling my parents is something I ultimately have to do but I don’t know how. For starters, I’ve been putting on a facade for the last year about my performance and the truth couldn’t be any more of a juxtaposition to that. The more pressing issue however, is that my sister has been struggling with eating disorders which has been hard enough on the family as it is. I don’t want to give them any more emotional baggage.",30Jul2019,1
817,"I’m 28. My husband is 25. I was a lesbian my entire life basically until he swept me off of my feet 3 years ago. I am and have been the only one working and supporting him and our two children the entirety of our marriage. He watches the kids while I’m at work but when I’m home I mostly have them until it’s time to go back to work the next day. He has anxiety and depression which makes it hard to even go into public most days so I am understanding towards that. We have been struggling! I feel that he says and acts however he wants every day whether it’s in a joking way or rude things coming out of his mouth, no matter how I feel. He says all the time that he doesn’t say nearly as much as he wants and he holds back a lot. If I do anything that is similar to these actions...it’s definitely a problem and when I say that he acts the same way , uses the same tones, and talks the same way...I get told we aren’t the same person and I shouldn’t do something just because he does...just to be vengeful. Most of the time I’m just more so “matching vibes” not actually trying to get revenge on anything. I’m always tired and he’s been pushing me to exercise more since having our 8 month old son so I just recently started going to the gym after I get off from my job. He only pushed me to work out because of how unhappy I’ve become with myself. Not because he’s unhappy with me or my body. I’m extremely out of shape so you can imagine my muscle pain since going to gym after work. We don’t really have good days anymore. The bad outweigh the good. We laugh together every now and then and when we do...it’s great and reminds us why we got married. So let’s cut to the chase...basically he’s unhappy because I’m too tired most nights that I fall asleep and don’t want to be woken up with sex. I normally don’t remember the cruel things he says that I say to him while I’m sleeping and he’s trying to start something up. He says that I don’t make the first move enough and any time I do...he rejects me as well because I make him uncomfortable or it feels like I’m forcing myself to do so (which is not the case) it’s just how he feels so I get told no. When we do have sex...he does most of the work most of the time because I struggle to do certain positions that he wants and it’s not bad for us...even when I ask to switch positions and do something he tells me no most of the time because he doesn’t want to lose control too quickly. We connect pretty good when we do have sec but sometimes or as he would say (most of the time) it is awkward. The other day we had to stop in the middle of sex because it was the 3rd time during our session I had to tell him my legs were giving out... I could barely bend or straighten them (have been doing legs and glutes at the gym) but he still insists on trying to make me use my legs squatting...so the 3rd time I tried to nicely explain to him why because apparently the other two times I told him he didn’t care to remember that they were giving out. That turned him off so badly we just quit. We have a good sex session where nothing goes wrong maybe only twice a week. Most of the time I just feel mentally and physically drained that my libido is nonexistent. Our libidos do not match up what so ever. Today he told me if we separate he will take the time to fuck as much as possible so I told him maybe we just need to separate and get a divorce if that’s his outlook on separation. He may have only said that out of frustration but he’s also very open and honest with how he feels at all times. Either way if that is the case...shouldn’t he go be himself else where rather than stay with me and dim himself? I feel like men end up cheating on women who don’t match up to their sexual desires. He’s clearly been with people who were able to keep up but they ended up having other sexual partners besides him. So he got what he wanted during but also ended up getting hurt because they were mostly hoes. The last thing we ended this disagreement with was the divorce subject although we both know we wouldn’t know what to do without each other. It’s just a big struggle.

So after writing this in the heat of the moment I realize I directed everything more towards his “problems” and left out a lot of mine. He has dealt with severe insecurity from me since we’ve met. Every day he has told me only positive things about the way I look. He’s never talked down on my body or looks even me being overweight right now. I only just now started being able to be completely naked around him during the day time with all the lights on. The reason it’s awkward for us a lot of time because my insecurity of my body and it’s very obvious. I’m very sensitive and take a lot of stuff the wrong way and he has dealt with that our entire marriage. If you’re insecure or with someone insecure you know that can take a toll on a relationship and causes a lot of problems. It’s not bad all the time. I’m only sitting here writing about the problems but I didn’t mention the good. I don’t need advice for the good times we have and our special friendship bond that makes our relationship a plus. He has never cheated on me and he doesn’t talk to other women like that. So when giving me advice please keep in mind that this post was created from my side. Not his. Everyone has different outlooks on things.",30Jul2019,4

822,"Hey Reddit, my friend (we'll call him Walter) (we're all around 14-15ish) has came from a poor family. He affords food and basic comforts, but due to a mix of bad parenting, cost cutting, and pride, he has some issues. He consists off of mountain dew and Doritos, he doesn't have any vaccines (based on price, not anti vaxx) and has never went to the dentist. He's always been distant, he can't really understand complex emotion, and sometimes I find myself wondering if he feels anything, because other than humor, discomfort and pain, he sure as hell doesn't show it. He pretty obviously needs some mental help, but I'm not fit to diagnose anything. He stole a lot when he was a child and steals a lot now. It's gotten him into legal trouble and now that some people in our grade including me are getting jobs he's been running into some issues on applications. The place I work at was getting desperate for people, and literally said they'd be willing to hire people with drug addictions. So I told him, they might not be very judgmental about his past. I recently got a phone upgrade, but I still had my old phone so I gave the old one to him, and after he told me he didn't have a charger I gave him the one I was using. I gave him my phone because he didn't have one (broke it beyond repair) and many schedule and employee impacting statements were given out via text. I figured I could help him out, try to get him a job, a phone to help, turn a new leaf, stop stealing for things and just pay cash for the stuff he ""needs"" that his parents won't get for him.

He got fired in less than a week. I don't know the reasons other than the fact he missed a meeting, and I doubt that was all. He put it up on his story ""LOL, guess who just got fired."" I was sad, but I figured that all blame didn't need to be put on him, he was trying.

My other friend (let's call him Graham) has been helping him for longer with just general support, inviting him over for meals and games commonly, enough to the point Walter has his own toothbrush there. Graham invited him on vacation with his family. I recently got a text that Walter was found stealing and constantly complained throughout the trip.

How can I help Walter? I can't just cut my losses, he did some shitty things, but he's just a good kid in a bad situation. Is there anything I can do? Has anyone had a similar experience? Should I be stern and confront him for the inevitable response of (man I'm sorry I thought you just gave me that phone, and the manager at your jobs was a dick) then just go back to what he was doing. Or give him support and guidance for the same result? I really need help here.",30Jul2019,5

824,"Hi everyone, I’m not the person to really try to complain or whine first off. A little background: I’m the youngest person in my office, recently started into a sales role and have been pretty happy with my position in my company and the direction I’m going into, have a relatively good relationship with my manager.

I originally had a wall of text, with paragraphs upon paragraphs, but that’s not too productive, that’s me venting. Long story short: my sales manager keeps putting himself into stressful situations and uses me (I am currently inside sales, so I support all outside sales) to fix the problems for him. Any time I ever get to have a 1-on-1 with him or go out to lunch, it turns into him complaining about the culture of our office or about his problems with his wife. He also tries to tell me to be careful about my long distance relationship because he was cheated on by his last long distance relationship. It’s starting to affect my mental health where I’m getting stressed just because he’s projecting all these things onto me, I’m losing the joy I had to come into work and have a good time with my coworkers. I also feel like I’m losing respect for my manager as I do not respect his decisions that he keeps putting himself into these situations and I’m growing increasingly frustrated with him.

1) Have any of you been in this situation before and what did you do to solve it?
2) Does anyone have any experience trying to deal with stress in their career affecting their mental health?

My friend wants to set up a tiny house village on property he's purchased for homeless veterans.

We don't have those numbers at the moment, and my friend doesn't like that restriction; he doesn't want to turn away homeless civilians who need help. I guess you could say we want to be more about 'homeless veterans *first*' not 'homeless veterans *only*'.

828,"Okay,

My roommate and I have lived in our new apartment since the beginning of May. During that month, my roommate starting seeing one of our friends and they’ve pretty much been dating since then. 

She’s stayed with him in our apartment literally every single night. She works full time and makes decent money, but so far hasn’t once offered to help out with rent

We have a two bedroom and our monthly expenses for the apartment hover around $1700. We’re all 22. I recently graduated college and have been working full time.  

The thing is, she can live with her sister, but her sister would make her pay $400 a month for rent. Our apartment is closer to her work, but she’s literally paying nothing to stay here. She does all her laundry here, uses the same electricity we use, and even last month our electricity bill was more expensive than normal. 

She literally contributes nothing to the apartment. She occasionally buys my roommate groceries and such, but absolutely no rent money. 

She also keeps messing with the thermostat making it far too hot for my comfort. 

She has never been in college and has no plans to attend school, nor does she have any plans to find her own apartment. She has almost no expenses. She’s not saving towards anything. 

My roommate and I are great friends, and I don’t want this to come in between that, but I think she could be using him - and through him myself as well - as a free place to stay.

Just last week my old laptop fell while at work, I work in a construction company doing roadway construction. It was an acer aspire that was finally giving out after 3 years. Currently I have 2 work devices, that I use for just work cause I don’t have much of a “social life”, an iPhone 6 and some cheap hp that the company gives out to all their employees to do their work on. I use the work phone as a “personal” phone cause my own phone broke down right after I got my job, and also cause I don’t do anything crazy other than watch the bachelor(ette) with my girlfriend and go to the gym. I didn’t really think of getting my own phone cause I’m not much of a personal to really treat myself. I prefer to give to others because I feel selfish when I do treat myself. Example is when my girlfriend wants something she’s wanted for a while and tells me often about I get it for her. And the reason for this post is cause I want to get something to do my college work on. Also I don’t use my work laptop for anything personal because the tech guys have remote access at their offices and can watch pretty much what we do.

Most of this money has been entirely through my mother allowing her to have her bank card and she simply takes far more than what she had asked for. She had previously set up car insurance on my mothers account, I put a stop to that and got her bank to change her card.
My mother was silly enough to give my sister the card again.

I have since installed an app for her bank into her mobile so my mother can watch her account, she would be classed as vulnerable as she is on ESA and has difficulty because of depression and anxiety leaving the house on her own, so she has been getting my sister to drive her to go shopping, even though my sister has no driving license.

This is very difficult for obvious reasons, and my mother is opened up to this vulnerability whenever my sister take her shopping. 

My mother says she knows it’s stupid to keep trusting her but she also keeps doing it.

My mother does not work, she certainly cant afford to have any amount stolen from her, let alone £1200.00 over 4 months.

Despite having the money our mom still won't let us get the computer. Usually I wouldn't be so annoyed with this, but the way she is going about does not seem fair at all. For one, the money is completely ours and we don't expect her to pay for any of it. Two, we've been near begging her for the past year now and have given her a hundred reasons as to why she should let us have it. Three, and this one is big, she has recently let our older brother get a new phone and she paid for all of it which was similar to the cost of the computer. This made me very angry because her main argument is that we would spend too much time on it while my brother is almost always on his phone at home, school and in public when we would only be on the computer at home.

Our dad seems fine with us spending our money how we want, but our mom won't let us for some reason. What should I do? I've thought about just ordering the parts, but that seems like a bad idea.

839,"One and a half year ago we found out that apparently my father had a child out of wedlock after me and my brother were born. This son of his who we will call Gavin has been kept updated on my and my younger brother’s life ever since he was born about 23 years ago by my father. I am currently 30. He never told us anything about him and it’s only because my mom had a suspicion that she pressed him and he confessed after years. Otherwise he would have never told us. Needless to say I  feel violated in the sense that there are people who know everything about me and where I lived, who I am and where I go to a certain degree (I’ve moved countries a lot) without me knowing it.
My parents are now visiting the country I am living in. We haven’t seen each other in about a year since they live abroad. (Yes my parents are still trying to work it out despite what happened.) This also coincidentally happens to be the country Gavin lives in. Now my father told me he wants us to take the opportunity and organise a meeting so we can all get to know each other (my mom is not invited) 
This is where I am conflicted.

Besides all of the above, I have so far received 0 information about this person from my father. I feel entitled to at least know who this person is before we meet. I am not sure this is justified, but this is how I feel. I asked my father today flat out for more information, and he refused to give any on account of “we don’t speak much”. I was like wtf? How the f do u not speak if this person knows who I am since the day I was born. They have as I understood spoken at least once a month since Gavin was a child. I had to stop myself from blowing up in public. He has refused to tell us anything and now he expects us to go sit and drink beer and become best friends. The whole thing just creeps me out.

Logic tells me that it’s not Gavin’s fault. He did not choose to be the son of a man who can’t keep it in his pants. But emotionally I’m a wreck about this. Not just for myself but still for my mother. I am angry at my father, I am angry at Gavin (although I know he is not to blame), and I am angry at being thrown into a situation blind.

I guess my question is, what can I or should I do in this situation. Do I go? Should I pride my father for more information? Do I have a right to be angry? This is all uncharted territory for me and I do not know how to act/react. (FYI the meeting will be scheduled in sometime this week)

I applied back in Decemberish time and received a conditional offer back in March. When applied and when I received the offer I had absolutely no doubts about wanting to go. However time has passed and I have had more time to think about it. I am now not entirely sure if I do want to go as I am having doubts. One of them is financial doubts.

I tell myself if I fail at pursuing my careers Ill just end my life. I dont really care for my life tbh and Im fine with that. Anyways so I already know when I go there they're gonna say I cant be a gamer because its high risk, and they're gonna tell me I cant make music because its against my religion. Those are the only 2 careers i want to do and the only ones i will do. I dont give a fuck if music is against my religion Im gonna do it and Im gonna be a gamer youtuber. How do i convince them that im not going to focus in school and focus on religion?

843,"       My friend is depressed from past few months but refuse to say the cause of depression. My other friend and I tried everything we possibly could to elevate their mood, unfortunately we couldn't help them. I asked many times what's their problem is but they refuse to say and answers always with ""'Sorry, it's private""



I even asked them to go to a therapist atleast, still refused! They said they're over thinking many things and sometimes their anxiety reach to a level they can't breathe. We are not irl friends, so I can't possibly meet them and cheer them. I told them to explore their hobbies as well, but they said they're in a mood where they don't want to do anything.



Is there anything else I can do for them? I don't like seeing them dull, it really hurts to see someone you laughed with to be depressed to the point of not even talking to anyone.


All I know is their problem is not related to money or family.",30Jul2019,2

I meet Bob many months ago and we use to be cool with each other until I noticed that he doesn't treat me as equal with the rest, such as him helping the others while he doesn't help me at all. Ever since then I moved on and stopped talking to him until one day an incident occurred in the break room. The incident happened some months ago where I left my belongings on the table, that's in front of a chair to indicate I will be sitting there, and went to the restroom. On my way back to the restroom I noticed that Bob was sitting on my chair so I asked him to move but he said hold on while he was talking to someone else. I slapped his shoulders and asked him to move again and he finally did. I was upset about the situation because this brought back the memories of him not treating me equal compared to the rest. Forward to today, I did the same thing, placed my belongings on the table and went to the restroom. Except this time Bob had Smith around. The table was getting too crowded, even though there were other tables with space, and Smith was sitting on the corner of the table due to the lack space on the table I was using. Smith wanted to sit on my chair when I was in the restroom but Bob told him no because I'm sensitive and I would whine about it. How did I know this?

847,"I just need help and someone to talk to.
This will be kind of long and jumbled so excuse me for that.

So, let's start off here. My family is kind of a mess most of the time. My mom is kind to me and we have a lot of fun but it's very conditional (if you look at my post history you'll see what I mean). As long as I do exactly what she says and don't deviate she is nice. She has ridiculously high standards though and is very, very negative. Some examples of this; I got my new job and she wasn't happy for me because the commute was long, and she said interviews are easy so it's not that big of a deal. My boyfriend's family congratulated me and took me out to dinner so that helped negate it a bit. A big example though is she is extremely critical of how I dress because I am trans but not out (because she calls my men's clothes ""disgusting"" it's not safe for me) I wear masculine clothes and I get degrading comments. She tries to pick what I wear for fancy events and tells me I look terrible if I wear anything I pick so I often just humor her and then go change at my boyfriend's house because his family accepts me. She also completely ignores boundaries. For example, I constantly ask her to let me do my own laundry but no matter how many times I ask, she does it when I'm not home and then complains about me never doing it. I never get the chance to because it's always done before I can touch it. I also always ask her to not text or call me when I'm driving (she has me text her when I arrive anywhere I go; reasonable enough I guess) but if I don't text her exactly when she expects me to be somewhere she spam calls and texts me. This is very very distracting and makes me super nervous because I know if I don't answer she will keep doing it and then get mad at me; there has been a few times where I have swerved or nearly hit some things because of her doing this. One time I was 20 minutes late because of extra traffic and she went out looking for me thinking I was dead. I ask her to just let me text her, and I always do, but she won't listen or trust me. Any time I make a decision that she doesn't agree with, she pushes me to not do it, and if I do it she gets angry and hateful with me. It comes down to her not trusting my choices at all and I have countless examples of this. 

Now my dad is different and not in a good way. He is rude about everything, very vocally anti-gay, and has said racist things in front of my friends before. He does, however, encourage me to do whatever I want to do as far as jobs and stuff go and was happy for me. I guess that counts for something. The story would be way too long if I described him further than that but I don't get along with him too well,  and my mom sides with him every time. Together, they listen to nothing I say and don't seem to care about how I feel. I have to act normal at all times or risk getting yelled at for whatever reason. My mom is particularly bad about this, and takes anything and everything as a personal attack, with no regard to anybodys feelings but her own. I have to walk on eggshells at all times at home, because any time I do anything I get either laughed at or told how to do it ""better"". Or I get yelled at for doing something wrong. I guess an example of this is when I put some of my drinks in the fridge and a few minutes later my dad said ""wow who did this"" and rearranged all of it. It felt so petty. There are tons of other examples like this too.

Now, over the past year after an entire life of just doing what I was told to do to avoid my mom being angry at me, I've been instead slowly doing whatever I want; living for myself instead of living just to please someone else. This has been a hard transition for me, because I'm used to someone telling me what to do so making decisions for myself is very hard, especially when I get backlash for them.

This is a bit of a baseline for why I need a job pretty much; I want to move out. I had a much lower paying job for about 5 years while I went to college (and burned out on because I wasn't allowed to take a break). I recently managed to land a much higher paying job; but by no means high enough to move out since I live in an expensive area. However it's a start.

Because of this job, I was able to make a deal with my boyfriend's family. They ""bought"" me a car, paid in full, because my old car was very unreliable and belonged to my family so they just did whatever they wanted with it at any time and if someone needed it I had to sacrifice it. So it wasnt really mine, and I needed something that wouldn't die on me while I was commuting; and I also needed a car of my own before I even thought about moving so now that step is done. By ""bought"", I mean that they got it but I'm paying them back over time for it; they did it this way so it's no pressure and no interest. They have no set time frame and don't plan on rushing me but I want it paid off in about 2 years. Now, this car was a very, very important purchase for me for lots of reasons. One was I was terrified of driving (I'm still nervous about it) and the car I drove before played a big part in that. It would randomly break down, the brakes were terrible, and it had no power so if something were to require me to move rapidly id just stand no chance at all. But most importantly, this car is *mine* and nobody can 


So with this car I've gained my freedom. I'm still a bit nervous when I drive, but that is slowly fading away.

Getting the car caused me all sorts of issues and my family was extremely mad at me for taking it. My mom got super angry at me and very hateful to my boyfriend's family. But it was all worth it for how much I've gained with that car. It's the one thing I have that truly feels like it's mine.

However, I have a problem. I've dealt with depression in the past and managed to stave it off and was in therapy for it for a few years. I was fine until I started my new job. Now I'm randomly depressed and fairly severely at that. I can't seem to fix it, and I no longer have time for therapy. I also have OCD, but it's a lot more managed now and is only really in the background so to speak.

I guess it's worth mentioning this. My job is useful for my future plans, because it's an in to what I really want to do potentially, but.....I can't say I enjoy the job itself aside from a few aspects of it. I love the people, the company, and my coworkers but the job is not something I like that much. My kind co-workers and boss keep me there and I'm good at it but it's just....not me. I can't live sitting at a desk answering emails and phone calls all day. I'm trying hard to cling to the positive parts though and it does help a lot.

Now back to that ""good for my future part"". I have skills as an artist but could not go to school for it. I showed the director of design my work and he thinks I have potential as a graphic designer, the thing I really wanted to be. He is giving me a chance.....but I need to teach myself the skills. I have never done graphic design, only art. I could go back to school for a semester and grab a graphic design certificate but there are no night classes for the things I need to take, and my family will not help me pay for school again if I go back. I went to school (junior college) for awhile without knowing what I wanted but was not allowed to take any sort of break, so I got really burnt out and just chose something I could finish so I could get out. I, of course, don't feel they are obligated to help me pay for school in any way as it is my future, but if I don't work I can't pay for both medical and school. So my goal to start with is to try to teach myself.

What I did was a mistake, obviously. I always wanted to do art, but never thought I was good enough to do it in a work environment so I did not pursue it. I finally have the confidence to change my mind on that.

But I feel like I'm stuck, for obvious reasons, and it's making me feel really bleh. I can't spend the rest of my life like this but I don't know how to get out and it's causing a fair bit of damage. 

And my last bit. I live in an expensive state. I feel like I'll never be able to move out.....plus a life time of not being able to make my own choices that I'm just now fixing has left me poorly prepared.

Also, I need to pay my boyfriend's dad back for my car. I've been making steady progress on that, and I know for sure they would not mind if I had to pay less for awhile or take a break to insure my future is what I want it to be, but I don't want to take advantage of their kindness. And to be perfectly clear, I absolutely do not regret buying that car; it's given me my freedom and I don't have to worry about my family taking it back or holding it against me, or messing with it. But, if my family sees me quit or take a part time job they will harass me endlessly with ""how will you pay it back"" and things like that no matter what I say.

What I want to do, is finish my year out at my job (unless i manage to transfer to the graphic design department before that via teaching myself) and then try to focus on being what I want to be. My goal was to work in graphic design part time and then have my own business freelancing on the side. That's my dream, but I gave up on it until now I guess. However there are still complexities to this like how will I pay for my medical and such. I can save money but it's so expensive still. But there's also a big part of me that's only getting bigger and louder that's screaming at me to give it all up and just let the depression win. I don't want it to win, but it's slowly taking over my thoughts and all I have holding me on is my boyfriend, my snakes, and my car.

Considering that, what I should probably actually do is figure out how to take reduced hours and go back to therapy for a bit to fix my depression problems. With the hours I work, I don't have time available to do therapy; and no I don't work a lot of hours, I work just under 40 per week but all the mental health places around me close before I get off or could get to them. But I'm not too sure my company would allow this, and I'm afraid to ask at risk of getting fired. Also, my family thinks lowly of people with mental health problems and would not understand. They would think badly of me for taking reduced hours. Also, I don't know if my insurance covers mental health stuff.

My final issue is I feel guilty for all of this. I could have it so much worse. I don't work tons and tons of hours per week, I don't hate my job, I wouldn't be homeless if I had to quit, I have a boyfriend that loves me, and all these things.

And then there's my family. I feel guilty about thinking so negatively of them. They pay for my food, internet and cell phone and I don't have to pay rent or anything so I have that. And my dad defended my choice to buy a car, trying to help me escape the wrath of my mom. It confuses me so much because I feel like it's wrong for me to be hurt by them because they could be so much worse. So many people have it worse than me so why am I dwindling on an edge like this? It feels so silly.

Sorry for how long this is.

Tl;Dr - depression plus mediocre choices are stealing my life away. I can fix it but feel powerless to do so.

So my question is. What would you personally do in my situation? If you've been in a similar situation as me, what did you do? 

Because I have absolutely no idea what to do with myself. I know I need help but I don't know how to get it right now, but I'm pretty sure I'm just not seeing the solution. I'm not opposed to anything.

And no I'm completely not any danger to myself as things are right now, I'm dragging myself through life for sure but I'm not that low just yet. I'm trying to stop this before I am.",30Jul2019,2

849,"Throwaway because I want to be completely anonymous. I live in California if that’s relevant. 

Here’s the situation. My uncle has been suicidal for a while because of his failing startup that’s driven him and his family (wife, children) to bankruptcy. Every time he’s had a suicidal incident, I’ve always been many hours away at college. Now, I live in the same town as him and my parents. 

Today, my mom called me and (with a very worried tone) told me to come to their place, all she said was there’s something wrong and that my uncle has a gun. 

By the time I get there, the situation is diffused. She asked me to hold on to the gun until we figure out how to get rid of it. It’s safely locked and stored away. 

On my way to his place, all I could think of is am I going to get shot today? Is my mom going to? That and how utterly powerless I’d be if I get there and he has a gun in his hand. If I had a gun, at least I could fight back. 

He’s had this gun for years and no one knew he had it until 2 years ago when someone found a suicide note before his attempt. We’ve tried to help him for much longer than 2 years, and supported him as much as we can. For the first time though, I feel like he’s a danger to me and my mom. 

This time and every time before luckily no one got hurt. But I’m worried that the next time will be different. I have his gun now but who knows when he’ll just buy another one. 

I’ve been trying to convince my mom to 5150 him or whatever to take away his ability to buy a firearm. She’s always vague about why she doesn’t do that. Be that as it may, we’re in America and unfortunately there’s tons of ways to get a gun whether you’re legally allowed to or not. 

I’m a gun control proponent and I’ve never thought I’d be in a situation where I’d think about buying a gun. If I go through with it, I’d tell no one about it and keep it locked away until something like this happens again. I’d also get proper training to make sure I don’t do more harm than good in a situation like this. 

But what do you think? This happened a few hours ago so maybe I’m overreacting. Thank you for hearing me out.",30Jul2019,0
850,"On Monday I have an interview for a position I know I am the perfect fit for an will do a lot of good in. It is a specialist position where I will be aiding in homeless individuals transition into being housed. I was a homeless youth for many years and pulled myself off the street when I became pregnant. I have still remained active in aiding various issues concerning the local homeless population both in my personal time and in my current position. A part from having the perceptive skills I have the technical skills working as a development director for a non-profit for the past four years and I am just genuinely passionate about working with the community. 

However, this past March, my life turned upside down when my former boyfriend (who I thought I was gonna marry) turned insanely physically abusive one evening while drinking. It ended with me being concussed and the future I thought I was heading towards being eliminated in an instant,not to mention the heartbreak of having someone you love do something so horrible to you. I have C-PTSD from an abusive childhood and a sexual assault I experienced as a teenager so the attack put me in a bad place, so bad that I called my children's father asking if he could take the kids for a couple weeks so that I can get into some therapy and get my head straight. 

I drank very heavily that first week and got myself my first ever DUI (and only) I was not in my right mind and despite waiting four hours to drive after I had drank, but I still blew over the legal limit. Court for that is on Friday and I will def be pleading guilty as I am deserving of the consequences.

I really want this job and know that I will do some real good within this position, not to mention a job that has full benefits and significantly larger pay, how do I navigate this if offered the position? How should I approach it. (Note, on the application there was no question if I had ever been convicted of a crime)

TL;DR I have an interview for my dream job on Monday but Friday have court where I am gong to be convicted of a DUI. How do I approach this when it needs to come up while still remaining desirable for the position?",30Jul2019,2

I’m currently 17 years old and I am about to start my second year of gymnasium but in the past few months I have been facing a problem of cliche as it might sound a feeling of just nothingness however my situation makes me unable to see a reason as to why. I have a loving family and friends and wouldn’t change. I know I should generally speaking be happy and don’t see anything to be emotional about. But the thing is that in these months it has been a real trouble because sometimes when I should be mad or sad etc I get so for a few seconds (or sometimes not at all) and just act how I feel I am supposed to. This in turn means I often go home with just a feeling of nothingness. An example could be today when I was out drinking with some friends at a theme park. Normally I’d be over the moon with joy and come home and sleep happy but today I just felt the usual snippets of happiness and then they kind of disappeared.

Long story short. I don’t have any particular reason to lean towards one emotion but just want to feel you know ... something and just need some neutral advice on what to think of this

I want to preface this by saying that I don't want a culture wars debate. I've heard that there is are a lot of issues on how white folks treat black hair, and I'm choosing to listen to black folks on their experiences. 

I know that obviously you never touch anyone's hair, and that black women in particular have people touch their hair without consent because it's seen as ""exotic"". I have also heard that many hairstyles like cornrows, dreads, bantu knots, etc can be extremely cultural and personal, and I don't want to draw attention to people who are just following their culture. I know that culturally black hair has been ostracized, put down, considered unprofessional, etc. I know a lot of black women who rock their natural or traditional hairstyles, and I'd love to say so, because I love giving compliments, but I don't want anyone to be upset that I called attention to a cultural hairstyle if they have had issues with it/ have different views. 

I just genuinely want to not offend, and if anyone has articles, etc for me to read, I'd love to educate myself. Can I mention those hairstyles as a white passing (actually Aboriginal Canadian, but I still don't live with the issues non passing black folks have) if it's positive?",30Jul2019,5

Example of his manipulation = My sister didn't want to go to the college he chose for her (the one I'm going to) so he cut my mom off, and told everyone (I have 4 siblings) that we have a month before ""the house is gone"" and we have to find somewhere to live and pay for college (HE'S NOT EVEN PAYING FOR OUR COLLEGE, I HAVE LOANS).

860,"I never post on Reddit or any kind of forum, I’m just stuck and don’t know how or who to reach out to. I’ve always been a fragile and deep person which would often bite me in the ass because I become so disappointed in myself and others. I used to have so many friends and would party all the time, but my ongoing discontent got in the way. Because of my insecurities I would make decisions that weren’t good for me. I would be pressured into having sex or doing drugs. I’ll admit, I like most drugs. Just not bad sex. Because of these things though, other girls see me as a threat. Ill admit (even though idgaf about it) that I have a good body and act very confident, so girls were never supportive or friendly to me. Which made me feel even more isolated. I come from a small town where there’s only 100 kids per grade in our high school. Rumors spread very fast and it’s toxic. I never felt popular, only that my friends were. When I separated myself from them, I lost my sense of sociality and questioned who I was. I pushed all my friends away, convinced they weren’t good enough, hoping they would try to be in my life and prove me wrong. I know it’s selfish. I’m such a loyal person to my friends and family and feel as if none of it has ever been reciprocated. None of my friends were ever consistent, for example we all threw a surprise birthday party for my friend. I bought her presents and posted on my socials about how much I cared about her. That shit makes me feel good, I was proud to have her as my friend. I didn’t care what anybody thought. Now fast forward to my birthday. Not a post, not a present, nothing. I was alone with my mom because none of my friends even wanted to do anything. It made me so bitter and sad. How could she not care after everything I had done for her? Bought her food when she was being forced to move by her mom, helped her move out of her fucking house. I never understood it. And now my actual best friend ditched me when I opened up about my depression. Went off to party and pop molly and get fingered every weekend. I blocked them and removed them, because they broke my fucking heart. I didn’t know what else to do.That’s only the simple version. there is so much more, just not enough room to type it out. I have always felt alone. At parties, when I’m with other people. I don’t wanna say I felt like I was always on another level, but I was. I notice everything and feel the weight of the world. I wish I wasn’t so sensitive. There are so many passions I have, for instance writing, singing, playing video games, and traveling. My deep depression and unsure nature have made me lose all my motivation. All I can’t think about is how all my friends are having an awesome summer and partying with everyone and doing these awesome things. Without me. And it’s my fault.  I am an only child with a single mom, so my friends were like my sisters. Without the people I laughed with, did all kinds of drugs with, cried with, traveled with, shared philosophies with, I’m alone. I pushed them away and now I’m stuck wondering if I did the right thing. Wondering if it is better to have bad friends that excite you, or to be completely alone.",30Jul2019,1

863,"I was fairly active on social media and had a decent social circle growing up. I'm in my late twenties now and decided to make new accounts when my latest job required being active on social media. I didn't want anything unprofessional there. 

I don't spend too much time on it and I'm not someone who posts every aspect of their life, I probably only post once every 2 weeks - the same as some other co-workers. The problem is I'm quite new to this industry or ""scene"" whereas many other people have a lot of connections.

I noticed that the CEO of our parent company follows literally everyone, and by everyone I mean the small handful of under 20 employees including those newer to the company (I've worked there a year, we just hired people a couple of weeks ago) yet I'm the only one not followed. He's definitely aware of my account and has liked a couple of responses but being the only person he doesn't follow is really bothering me.   


Am I overthinking? Part of me doesn't care but I feel like this is causing childhood memories of bullying and being ""left out"" of a group to show it's ugly head.",30Jul2019,1
864," Had my good mate Dave come stay over for the night in our new house whilst my other mate Charlie and I were settling in. Everything went as normal from the start of the afternoon - we chatted and caught up and it was a good time.

 It soon got to evening and we were all chatting in the kitchen. Both Charlie and Dave started drinking pretty early on and did so for the rest of the night, I however didn't drink much so was Sober for this entire time. After a couple hours chatting the topic of whether or not we've had any sexual experiences with other guys came up. I said I'd had one minor experience a couple years back at a party before Dave started to vividly recall a story of receiving Oral sex from a Gay guy around 7 months ago. I didn't think much of it and was pretty uncomfortable with the detail he was going into (not because it was a guy, but rather the fact he was going into detail) but I did think it was odd that he was enjoying recalling it so much considering he has a girlfriend. 

    The night continues and the other two continue to drink before running out and needing to head to the shops - I accompanied them as I felt staying back was somewhat antisocial. Over the course of the Journey Dave starts repeatedly joking about wanting to ""suck my d*ck"" - which was a little odd as he carried on commenting on doing it for the entire walk (I passed it off as him being very drunk at the time, but it did seem a little too insistent). Then on the way back he then jokingly said he could rape me if he wanted too - again I was really weirded out but passed it off as alcohol.

   After we got back I quickly made some food and went up to my room whilst the other two stayed downstairs. After around 10 minutes Dave comes up to my room, sits on my bed and tells me in a very shy manner tells me he's ""always liked me , but not in 'that' way"" but that he wanted to be ""there for me if I ever wanted to experiment"" . I told him that I appreciated his concern and in the most polite way I could that he should probably get to bed. He insisted on repeating that he would make the same offer if he was sober before leaving. A couple minutes pass and I get a drunk text saying 'Hey OP I kinda wanna go down on you'. I replied and told him he should go to bed and that I'd see him the following morning. He then proceeded to ask if I was ok , which I said I was, and then sent me a message saying 'Please help me'. I replied (maybe a mistake) that everything was good and that the best thing to do was to sober up and sleep. He then sent the same text again - 'Please help me'. 

I ignored it, a few minutes pass, and then a pretty much Sober Charlie knocks on my door to say Dave has wandered off alone into the street. Fearing the worst I head out to find him to see him ambling down a main road. I run up to him - ask if he's alright - and try to take him back home. He then starts to stumble and sway in a very dramatic fashion before asking for me to support him. At this stage I can tell he's faking it but reluctantly agree - so he grabs my side and leans into me. I break off and tell him to 'Snap out of it' as I know it's an act and we continue back - all the while he's telling me he ""wasn't trying to do this to test me or anything"". We get back, I grab him some water and try to take him upstairs to his room but he insists on trying to chat and asks me if ""I'm afraid to do anything because I might be labelled"". Not wanting to make the situation any more awkward I ignore the comment and take him upstairs. Upon finally getting him into his room he still wants me to stay and chat but I shut it down somewhat and head back to my room. Around 20 minutes pass before he knocks on my door wanting to borrow toothpaste. I give him some and after he comes to return it and starts walking back to his room he whispers (all the while with this odd smile) ""I'm gonna fuck you"". I went to sleep shortly after.

  I saw him briefly in the morning before he left - I was expecting him to address the stuff he said but he just sat there silently aside from some small talk and then left to go back to his parents house soon after. He hasnt messaged me and he hasn't deleted the  messages he sent in the night. 

I've known the guy for a year and have never had an experience like this with him. Both myself, Dave, Charlie and Dave's girlfriend are in a pretty close knit friend group - so my question is : 

If he continues to remain silent on everything that happened should his Girlfriend be made aware of what he said to me? I don't want to stir any drama as Dave is a good friend - but I feel his girlfriend has a right to know (he's always presented as heterosexual so there is no way she would know this had happened) Any help would be appreciated and apologies for such a long story.

TL;DR : Good friend gets very drunk, makes very odd sexual jokes towards me before telling me he wants me to 'experiment' with him in a sexual manner despite me declining multiple times. His Girlfriend is also in our friend group - does she have a right to know what happened and that he tried to make a move towards me?

865,"So about one week after my volleyball season began, I got a terrible ache in my jaw. It was preventing me from eating solid foods, so I was very weak and lightheaded at practices for a while because I didn’t have any fuel to run on, therefore I basically made a fool of myself. I got in with a doctor and it turns out I have to get emergency surgery to get my wisdom teeth removed. (That will be happening in 36 hours from now btw) the surgery will put me out of practice for about a week and a half. I have horrible anxiety so the impending surgery is on my mind 24/7 and all that may go wrong. Also I have an immense fear of needles (which I will need for the iv). I’m fine with shots because it only lasts for a second but the thought of a needle staying in me makes me sick. So I’m so anxious in fact, that I was unable to sleep last night which led me to feeling sick and vomiting when I woke up and wasn’t able to go to practice because I was nauseous and on 4 hours of sleep (I need a lot of sleep to function, so I normally sleep 10-11 hours a night). But that’s not all, a couple weeks ago I noticed a little pain in the top of my foot, I brushed it off as tendonitis thinking it would eventually heal and kept practicing on it. It keeps getting worse, now to the point it hurts so bad I can barely walk. I believe it may be a stress fracture but don’t want to see a doctor about it because it would knock me out of the volleyball season entirely. A couple days ago, I got shin splints along with a debilitating stabbing pain in my knee. I had the same pain a couple years ago, but i have never felt it again until now. It is because the cartilage in my knee is worn down. They never told me why the cartilage was worn down, but I just recently found out on my own that I have over pronating feet and this puts a lot of stress on the inner knee and eventually wears it down. So I’m just kind of bummed that I feel like my volleyball season is in jeopardy, and that I explained all of these things to my coach and they still force me to run at practice resulting in immense pain. I am still going to the practices because if you don’t go, you don’t get playing time in the game, and that’s completely understandable. I am risking my health for this, because I am extremely passionate and don’t give up. I don’t know what to do and am just bummed and anxious.",30Jul2019,1

869,"Hi everybody!  


I received an economics degree with a 3.7 GPA from UC Irvine this June. I have some internship experience at a cryptocurrency company and I've done freelance copywriting on the side also. I am 20 years old.   


I didn't think about the job prospects of the degree and pretty much just got the degree after failing a computer science class at UC Irvine and just wanting to be finished with school. I currently am living at home with my mom and I have little motivation to look for work because I feel like the most I'll find is minimum wage work in my area. My city is known mostly for the aerospace industry, other than that it mostly consists of tweakers, gangbangers, and meth addicts. My dad lives in Arlington, Virginia and my mom wants me to look for work there because both she and my dad think there's more opportunities there. I don't have very many friends, and the friends that I do have are all from high school. I pretty much just went to class and came back to my apartment at UCI. 

I'm thinking about going back to school to get a second bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from a reputable school that has an extension campus near where I live, but if I were to do that I'd graduate by the time I'm 23/24 and  I'd be so far behind everybody else. I've talked to my dad about it but he recommends if I do go back to school, that I get a master's degree in electrical engineering. I'm not even sure how possible that is given my undergrad degree is in a completely unrelated field. I know now what I need to do to do well, as I failed my previous computer science class due to laziness and taking shortcuts. I am pushing people away because I keep complaining about my situation. At first I thought I was depressed, but my friends that I do have said ""You're not depressed, you're just bored"". Which I'd say is accurate. I don't do anything all day except reach out to people on LinkedIn for possible jobs/internships. I don't want to kill myself. I'm just tired of basically doing nothing all day.   


I'm frustrated with myself and feel alone. I can tell that my parents are frustrated with me also. I've thought about joining the air force but my family considers it the ""easy way out"", plus I'm not exactly the most physically fit person.",30Jul2019,1
870,"Bad english, yadda yadda...


Ive recently thinked alot about my mother's behaviour, which has led me to revisit some obvious hints as to what's causing it.


One time my mom just asked, randomly, for a hug. Another time she started a fishing paper subscription out of nowhere for me (I think she was so desperate that she wad trying to buy my love, like how parents do in divorces). Et cetera.


The point is that Ive just now realized that Im completly disconnected with my mother. She and I never do anything together, have ever done anything together, and dont have any common intrests.


And also Ive noticed that I have a sort of unconcious bias against her. Like ive noticed that when asking my father something I dont hesitate, like i do when asking her. Or when I fell on my moped: I called my father first, and sat in our garage for a while because I didnt want to go inside and explain it to her. Even when explaining the moped thing, i got this like annoyed/frustrated/rejecting feeling that was like my body saying to not do this. Even this situation Im explaining in this post, if it were my father i would just explain this to him, but not with her. I cant talk to her.


Im 15, and that's a long time: i cant honestly remember when this started. It seems like this has gone on for as long as i remember. I feel like the time to fix things has already passed.


(In the spirit of being self-concious: like with everything writted at age 15, this might be really cringy to read, sorry if it was. Also *i understand that this isnt much when compared to other posts on this subreddit*, no comments about that please, i just want help).",30Jul2019,1
872,"Not sure where to post this.  Long time lurker but this is my first post.  Earlier today, my 9 year old son was at volleyball at our local park district.  My wife dropped him off, so he was with 6 older kids and a coach.  When my wife picked him up, he was teary eyed and told my wife that about an hour or so earlier, as he was walking out towards the exit of the public bathroom, a stranger pulled him into a stall.  My son said that he yelled help a few times and the man let him go after trying to pull him in a few times, and said ""get out of here.""  I did not ask if there was inappropriate touching, besides being forcefully pulled into a bathroom, I will let the detective question him on that.  There was also another person near the exit, which we later found out was the man's friend.  I was at work during this and my wife told me once I got home.  

Shortly after my wife and son got home, my wife dropped my son off at a friend's house and went back to the park district, spoke to the security officer and then they called the police.  They had footage of the bathroom entrance and Id'd both men, they told my wife that those two men were special needs (down syndrome ) and with a group that was there to use the park district but are not nearby and normally do not go to this park district.  My son also said that he ran out of the bathroom, so the footage should also show that.

We are waiting to hear back from a detective, who I assume will question us and my son.  I had my son briefly describe what happened to me but I would rather have him describe it just once in better detail to the detective.  I do not have all of the details yet, but I am wondering if this constitutes as child abuse? Sexual abuse?  Or something more minor?  My wife is extremely shaken up and has been crying on and off since it happened about 6 hours ago.  I am angry, but honestly more relieved and happy that he escaped, I haven't put much thought into what may have happened if he didn't get away.

879,"*LONG POST AHEAD SORRY...*

My husband and I moved a thousand miles from our home state to pursue new careers to a place where we didn't really know anyone. We were engaged at the time and had put a deposit down on a wedding venue in our home state. After a month living in our new place, we decided it may be best to just get married. We were the only people we had, and should something happen (God forbid) we didn't want either one to be without (legally). We've been together for almost 8 years at this point.  At the time we didn't think we should tell anyone about our eloping because we were still planning on having a ceremony and reception the year after. 

One of my biggest concerns is that my best friend is getting married this year (in 3 months), and I didn't want to steal her thunder or make her feel like I only got married because I wanted to be first? (that's probably me being paranoid but I'm genuinely fearful)  I don't know if I should even tell her at this point until after HER wedding, but I know that I want to tell my family. My husband is very lax about the whole situation, and it's not helping me deal with the emotions I'm feeling. It's really difficult for me to explain. I guess I'm really looking for some guidance. 

I know the longer I wait the more painful it will be. But I guess I just want to have some sort of etiquette and compassion regarding the situation. Honestly I fee guilty about the whole thing because I want to be excited about being married to my now husband...but I've kept it secret for so long it doesn't feel real. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess.

882,"Back in march or April my friend and I met up to get lunch. During our conversation she bragged to me about all the sex she had been having. When I asked who she had done it with the first name to come out of her mouth was my boyfriends, but he wasn't my boyfriend yet. She said they hooked up at her house while her parents were out of town. She said they were hanging out and one thing led to another. At some point though, the story changed and she said that he basically forced her to have sex with him. I freaked out of course and asked if she was okay and if she had reported it or wanted to report it. She said she was fine and that it wasn't a big deal. For most of the story, she was smiling and laughing which I thought was weird. I have known both of them for 11 years and I have hard time believing that he would do that. 

About two months ago I started working at the same place as him. At first I avoided him knowing what he had done to my friend. But then he got into a car accident and I started giving him rides home from work since we live near each other. One night we ended up kissing and a few nights later I asked him about what had happened with my friend. And I know I shouldn't have kissed someone who possibly assaulted my friend but I now I really don't believe that he did. So now we're dating. His story has remained exactly the same every single time while my friends has changed. He says that they had been texting and she had been bragging to him about all the sex she was having lately and invited him over to her place since it was empty. They were hanging out and he says that he got drunk. But he still remembers what happened. He leaned over and kissed her and she started taking her clothes off and then led him to her room where they had completely consensual sex and he passed out on her bed afterwards. She then drove him home and that was that. 

He story started off as them hooking up. Then she said that they kissed and while they were kissing he forced himself onto her, managed to get inside of her before she was able to push him off. But it wasn't a big deal. Yesterday it changed to they were having consensual sex but he was being an ""asshole"" to her. She didn't go into detail about what that meant. And then she asked him to stop and he wouldn't so she had to push him off and now she's traumatized. I'm really not sure who to believe. My friend wants me to break up with my boyfriend but does not want me to tell him it has anything to do with her. She said she wants to be left out of it. I feel bad for getting with him when I knew that he did that to her but now I really feel like he didn't. He has never done anything similar with me. I'm afraid to lose my friend if I stay with him but I don't want to lose him either.

884,"I know, I have some movie script material here. 

I met him and I knew immediately that this was different, this was the kind of connection that people spend their whole lives seeking.

Then, one day, he proposed to me in front of my son. I said yes. It was the most wonderful day of my life. 

Little did I know that my world was soon to be turned upside down. 

He told his mother. We both felt blessed because she was so supportive and loving. She told me she considered me her daughter and wanted to arrange our marriage. 

Then one day his father lost his mind because I am a single mother, I am slightly older than him, I am not rich, and I am not Indian. 

Long story short, my fiancé went to a coffee shop to try to reason with his father so my son wouldn't hear him being yelled at and never returned.

I sat with the muffins I had made as a surprise for him, getting the dial tone over and over again as I called him - trying to keep on a brave face for my son even though I knew something was horribly wrong.

Hours passed like this and I found out from his mother that he was on a flight to India. He told me later that overwhelmed and fearing for his mother's safety (his father is violent) - he submitted and got on the flight his father had booked with no notice, with nothing but the clothes on his back. I spent hours worrying before finally getting a message from his mother that he was on his way to India. 


I was beyond furious. His mother told me she would make sure we were reunited soon. She offered to fly me and my son to India if need be. 

Once he arrived his passport was taken from him. He was followed everywhere so that he couldn't run away. It quickly became clear that his mother had no intention of helping me get to India, although she went so far as to lie to my son about it. I realize now she was trying to keep me calm so that they could try to pick apart our relationship.

He endured day after day of intense verbal abuse and manipulation. 

I watched him hold it together. Calmly standing up for our love over and over again. 

I funnelled my heartache into moving into a house that was better equipped for a bigger family (it had only been me and my son before). I worked myself into utter exhaustion, feeling helpless when it came to the situation with my fiancé.

After a while it became very clear that the important thing was prestige and money. He needed to go to the best school. He needed to make a lot of money so that he could put it back into his family. This was about reputation and greed. I've discovered that 1 student commits suicide every hour in India because of the amount of pressure they're under and the lack of control they have over their own lives.

What he wanted to do was finish his bachelors in the United States (he only has one semester left) and transfer to Canada to marry me and live with his new family. He would do his masters here. 

But the school here isn't a ""good"" one according to his family. He can't find a ""good job"" here - because it's not a big well known city. 

They went so far as to continue fighting with him about how much money he was going to make when he had a fever of 105 and was bedridden. Yet he somehow still held it together. 

I'm in awe of his strength.

Today they silenced him. They took his laptop, took his phone. Luckily he had deleted most of his messages. With that said, they did dig up whatever they could and tried to manipulate my mother into thinking they were justified in what they were doing. (Essentially messaging her about how I said I would like to have children sooner rather than later - which was unacceptable because my fiancé won't be rich enough).

Then I was told he ran away, he was missing.
All day.

Things have escalated to the point where his physical safety is at stake.
Ultimately he will not stay there, and he will keep leaving. 
He has his passport now, as far as I know. Or perhaps that was taken again too.
I have no way to contact him to help him plan an escape. 
(I would have to pay for his flight).

Is there anything I can do to help him from a different country?

I've considered making a post on social media and trying to get it to go viral, to bring attention to what his family is doing to him and what other students in India have to endure for the sake of a ""good education"" - at the expense of their overall happiness. To try to add international pressure so that they let him leave. At this point I think they're trying to keep him in India to ""invest"" so that he can never be with me. 

I know that his father has sexually assaulted a woman in the hospital he owns, abused and cheated on his wife, etc. Which I'm sure society wouldn't view as overly respectable. But I don't know that I could release that information, I feel like I would be stooping to their level. 

But I also don't want my fiancé to die trying to escape the oppression he faces at home. I'm struggling to hold it together myself, having to tell my son every day that I don't know when he'll be home. At this point I'm going to have to try to explain to him why he can no longer talk to him. It's difficult to think clearly.

But surely there is SOMETHING I can do. 
I feel like it's necessary to stand up for love in this situation, and not submit to the injustice and violence.

885,"My mom keeps telling me that I have OCD tendencies, which I don't think is true. She keeps threatening me by saying things like she will have me be checked out or something like that (whatever that means) but isn't clear about it. Her only example that she shares with me is yesterday (although she claims I've shown OCD tendencies a lot before). Yesterday,  I waited to take a shower to use a towel that was in the washing machine. The reasoning behind using that towel is that it's not ripped and breaking down like all of the other towels in my home (my mom doesn't believe in replacing stuff until they aren't functional and apparently towels that are ripping and fraying at the ends are still functional to her). I have nice things and I like to use them. I don't understand her and I'm not sure what to do.",30Jul2019,2
886,"He has never actually hit any of us, just wanted to make that clear. I am a 17 year old male much bigger and stronger than him so i dont really see him as a physical threat.

The problem is the verbal abuse and how he acts. He will come home and no matter how nice I try to be he is nothing but unhappy and always angry. Just a few minutes ago he returned home from work, trying to be nice I ask how his day went. He simply replied with an annoyed ""fine"", went into the kitchen and started full on slamming dishes into the sink. They werent piled up or in his way at all, it was completely uncalled for.

He is constantly making jokes about my weight, anytime I try to do something about it (eat healthier or start working out) he will mock me. When I stop he mocks me. If I continue he mocks me. Even his praise comes with a mocking tone. And sure, this hurts me and pisses me off but the worst part is he does the same to my sisters (15 and 7).

Without any warning if a single toy or sock is left out he gets in my youngest sisters face yelling at her to pick it up. If either of them make a simple mistake he'll always say something along the lines of ""what are you, a 'tard?"" Or ""Oh come on i didnt think you were that stupid!"". 

Most people have bad days, but my dad doesnt even have good ones. He has a good hour. He probably has about 1 good mood hour a month or so. He constantly makes jokes at someone elses expense, but the slightest joke about him and the fay is ruined. 

He is contantly talking shit about how lazy my mom is, always making jokes about trading her in for a skinnier better version."" 

He has never hit any of us, the most he has done was push me down once years ago when i was small. He does however get in our faces and jam a finger in our chests. He constantly walks around mumbling about how useless and lazy we are, how the place is always a mess (it isnt), about how he is the only one holding this family together. It is everyday, every minute.

My mom is guilty too but in a much different way. She has always talked about leaving him, shes been saying it to me for 5 or 6 years. There have been times where she says I need to work extra hours so we can leave and when i save up plenty of money, nothing. ""Oh he seems to be better"" or ""he'll change"". Every damn time. Anytime I ever say anything back to my dad im the bad guy. My mom will tell me how horrible i am for ever talking back to him.

One of the worst parts about it all is i see myself and my sisters turning into HIM. Ill be extremely irritable, the slightest trigger and my rage is above the roof. It isnt until i calm down i realize how im being. Both my sisters who used to be so sweet and kind raise there voices and glare at you talking about how you look or act.

Im always to scared to talk about my mental health to my parents, i know how it would go. Id be called a pussy and just about everything a guy doesnt wanna be called. I have seriously thought about suicide but couldnt leave my sisters to be alone with my dad for that long, no one to protect them.

I dont have family to go to, my moms side doesnt live anywhere near us and my dads side sees him as an angel who can do no wrong. I dont have friends to go to because i do school online to work and take care of my sisters. I know im weak, i know im selfish, but im just so tired of it all. Ive wanted to take my dad out of the picture but dont want to go to prison. Im tired now, so worn down. I used to be so happy, had friends and hung out with them. Now it feels im completely alone, the few people i thought were real friends left me the second i had nothing to offer them. Im completely alone and dont know what to do. Im always so angry or depressed, the slightest moment where i want to better myself and become the man ive always wanted to be, the chains just get heavier and the single ray of sun shine goes behind the clouds.

887,"I work security for a school and I got a call from a company a few months ago saying they provide newsletters, tips, and information for school safety. I agreed since there was no cost unless I wanted to sign up for their premium website. Later, they sent me a book that arrived at the school. Now they are requesting money for the book ($300) and that it has surpassed the 60 day return period so they won’t take the book back. Apparently on the back flap of the book, there was an invoice and had information on sending it back (I didn’t pay any attention to it because I didn’t care to read the book). I’ve been telling them to send me a shipping label and they can have heir untouched book back. 

They said they are sending their “collection agency” after me. Definitely seems like a scare tactic and for now I’m considering this a free book. Is there anything this company can actually do? They do have my name and birthday but no SSN.

889,"I just started a new job about a 1.5 hr train ride from where I currently live at my mom’s house. I didn’t think the commute would be so long, but it turned out to be long with all of the daily commute train delays. I knew this potentially could happen, so I’ve been saving a bit and thought about moving to a town nearer to where I work. 

Unfortunately, my sister who has mental health issues and who lives with my mom recently went off her rocker. She has a 7 year old son that also lives with my mom and now the 7 year old is in my mom’s care and my sister has been home in about a week. My sister met some man online that came out across country to meet her. Last week he arrived and she’s been out galavanting around with him. He decided to stay permanently out here, but has no job and no money. Neither does my sister. My sister essentially left her son with my mom and then erratically would take my nephew with her for a day and then drop him back in my mom’s care. She’s unstable, refuses help at the moment, and luckily my nephew is with my mom and she has temporary guardianship notarized documentation that we got my sister to sign.  My mom is speaking to a lawyer and is looking to get temporary guardianship via the court instead of this other notarized document. My mom is 61 years old and it is just her. 

I’m in a pickle because I’m not sure if I should look for a place to lessen my commute/grow up a bit/have some independence or suck it up and stay around to help out my mom. My mom hasn’t attempted to take care of my nephew on her own yet. We’re still in the first week.

My sister is 28 and just moved back in with the family about a year ago. She has always been a little eccentric and crazy but this past year we have noticed her acting insane. Our house is full of kids, all the time, our house is the hangout spot and it’s always messy. My mom works her ass off to try and keep this house together but it falls apart faster than she ever could fix it.Us,her kids, are lazy and need to work on it.

Anyways, my sister will notice messes and decide to ‘clean’ by throwing every single thing in that room in a pile, EVERYTHING.  My mom tried to sit down and talk nicely to her about avoiding doing that. My sister got terribly defensive and screamed at the top of her lungs for 2 hours about how we are attacking her and bullying her. She never makes coherent sense when we talk and goes from one topic to another. We could say, “hey we would really appreciate if you cleaned your dishes after you cook” and her response would be something like “I am living my best life and trying my hardest everyday to be healthy and happy, I put my heart on my sleeve everyday and you guys treat me like shit” she says stranger things than that but I can’t even think or try to string sentences like her. She sounds delusional and psychotic. 

Almost every single day turns into her yelling at everyone about random things that don’t make sense. She threatens to punch my 9 year old brother and niece, has snapped me in the face with a towel and left a mark. But when we bring that stuff up , she says we are lying and we are manipulating her.

A few days ago he jumped to partner up with me for a workout (despite not being at similar skill level or stature at all) and it was a great time, I was so giggly throughout. He dmed me later that night and I added him as a friend.

I am chatting to this guy online and its so exhausting and confusing. He's so cute and nice in person but we literally talk about nothing online. I'm asking all these deep things like what his goals and motivations are career wise etc., but I feel like I am doing all the work here and interrogating him because he doesn't really ask me anything substantial in return??

We were in same class for one year and then our paths for studies went in different directions but we still stayed in contact on facebook for like 2 years afterwords and we were talking well still on facebook too. So after she blocked me on facebook I didnt believe it and thought it was her account desactivated or something. So then I found her on instagram and sent her a friendly message which she ignored and blocked me even there.. so now I am wondering what the actual hell is going on? Then I found her email and asked her in a friendly way why she blocked me and what is going on? And still no answer so I just tried to forget it and live with it what ever reason it is until after like after 3 years she blocked me (I dont even remember how much long ago it was) I recently saw her in a clothes stores working near the fitting room when I was about to try some clothes on, when I saw her there I felt so bad and hurt that I just left out the store and didn't want to try face her there. And now I am wondering I cant just stop going to my favorite store just because she works there. How should I face her? What should I say to her? Should I ask her to face why she stopped talking to me? Because I feel its gonna be really awkward to face her.

902,"Just a note before, I’m on mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues.

My girlfriend and I were living on campus in apartments that belong to our college. This past Saturday, we just moved into our new dorms for the fall semester. Last week, we checked out the floor and went into our respective rooms to check what we were working with. Mine was fine, a little small, but her smelled really, really bad. It smelled like animal urine. I came back the next day and hers smelled fine, so I thought they probably cleaned it up.

The move comes around on Saturday and my girlfriend tells me that night that her room smells like a smoker has been living in there for years. I went in there and it had a very distinct smell of cigarette smoke. My girlfriend does not smoke, nor is smoking allowed on campus, so we were very confused of what this was coming from. We figured it was coming from the vent/AC. The smell was so bad that she slept on the floor of my room for the weekend and, on Monday, we put in a request to have the physical plant come and check it out. We got an automated work order response, saying that the job was completed, which I can confirm because I heard someone going into her room yesterday. However, the smell is still there. We checked the message notifying that the job was completed and where they should have put a note of what was done to fix the problem, but there was nothing. The worker left it blank. Last night, my girlfriend was freaking out a little because she’s afraid that the smell will get into all of her clothes and other belongings and won’t come out. We sent more emails to the physical plant and residence life and they said they would take care of it. Meanwhile, I helped her move most of her clothes and bedding into my room so they won’t smell like smoke, which is cramping my already tiny single dorm. The smell is getting really bad, as I was coughing and getting lightheaded while helping her. No other dorm on our floor smells like this, nor do the rooms above and below her.

Now, my girlfriend just texted me and said that physical plant said there is nothing wrong with her room. That doesn’t seem true, as the smell is still persisting. Do you have any suggestions on what the smell could be coming from? How could we get rid of it? Otherwise, are there any suggestions to deal with difficult staff in our college when there is definitely a problem? Just a note before, I’m on mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues.

903,"This is a unique situation, let me explain. Skip to the second paragraph if it's too much to read, but it does give a bit of background. I worked at my father's accountancy firm for four years and after he merged with a bigger firm, and with the belief that i wasn't progressing, i was offered a secondment trial with a friend of his. I was happy to accept this as long as i was guaranteed to work back with my dad if it didn't work out, which i had some doubts over because i have dyspraxia and accountancy isn't really suited to me, even though it was a simple bookkeeping role. Three months later and it wasn't going well and she let me go, only to find that I wouldn't be going back to my dad's firm because of changes in the managing directors since I left and it would have been awkward to ask me back.Two years later and I've been sacked from at least 5 temp jobs- most trials, or temp to perm,  roles and failed miserably. One of the issues is that I have a degree which makes me seem intelligent and more than capable, but it was honestly more like a memory test as the questions were almost identical to the lectures and I never had full understanding of the material during the lectures, unlike most others.  

In December I was offered a temporary role to help one of my dad's clients with a huge backlog of bank reconciliations. A different guy managing me wanted me out after some horrific mistakes and I was due to leave, until my dad told the director who he knows well, that i have dyspraxia- he kept me on temporary to help with backlog of bank recs. In early february i was told that I probably won't be needed in mid February , so after improving my work since December as i got used to the role, I decided to propose that they may benefit form having me work there permanently. Five months later and i still don't have an answer. The good thing in my favour is that I'm helping out with other aspects and attending team meetings, as if I would be there for their future plans, but I'm not sure if those plans are temporary or permanent. The real issue that's bothering me is that the guy who noticed my mistakes is noticing many of them recently, after having a few months without any serious issues. this causes huge anxiety because it makes me worry that my mistakes will lead to them letting me go or influencing their decision to not keep me- I've had this worry for five months but it's getting difficult to keep with recently as it feels like a decision may be made in the next month or so. I also hold so much hope for this role because it feels like I'm unemployable for any other roles relating to bookkeeping  and can't see myself in any other fields because of my dyspraxia.

I've had this front end web job with a small firm for a decent time. I probably shouldn't have stayed at this place for as long as I did. I was underpaid. I did not mind the work. In fact I loved it. However, most communication was verbal, often misunderstood on the high up's part. Getting a word in edgewise was not always possible. Contracts were often audibles over promised and under delivered, and communication in general all around poor as for as expectations and planning. It was a mess. I'm sure many of you have experienced this with a job at some point. The kind of place where productivity goes up when the manager is out.  


Lately I worked my tail off getting caught up with all my work. I recorded everything I did and the time it took and sent out email summaries to the people I worked under. Once caught up with all my work was told that no work was coming in and I will be called when something comes up. I believe this to be true. There was nothing coming in. While in the waiting I noticed my time tracker, task manager user have been deactivated. Right now no one is talking or not giving a straight answer. It's been a few days. Basically being ghosted.  


So at this point. How would I write an email to quit? I want to be as professional as possible, and leave with little resistance as possible. I feel like it has to be in writing because anything I say can be ignored or manipulated to mean anything they want (as things have always been). I won't go into details but the person on the receiving end is not worth getting into an argument with and all they want is to argue. Defending my position is not worth the stress.  Looking back I don't think I was ever respected at any point. So how would I send a message saying I want to leave? I want it to be clear and to have them not come back to me in the future. I have never had to do this before.",30Jul2019,1

914,"I used to work for a large corporation as a data analyst. I was doing quite well and was promoted 3 times in my first year of hire. One day my boss wanted me to look at data that violated GDPR. When I refused to analyze the data he started punishing me at work. Before this we had a good relationship so I wasn't trying to get him in trouble; however, this breach was large enough that it could cost the company 4% of global revenue or \~$5.9 Billion. I had another coworker in the department tip off the internal lawyers who immediately shut down the project and scrubbed our computers. Crisis adverted.

The next day I got chewed out. I was yelled at for potentially limiting my boss ability to get promoted from ""rank 7"" to ""rank 8"". I was told from that point on that I would no longer be allowed to help or communicate with anyone on the team without his express written consent. I would also have to write a report every hour on the hour of what I worked on. There was more, but I digress. Eventually I just said I wasn't going to put up with his new rules and left.

In hindsight I should've still given a 2 week notice or written a formal letter to document the harassment. At the time I just wanted to get out. I was the kid who never got in trouble and never broke the rules so it was uncomfortable being punished for doing the right thing. Now that it has been a while I want to look for another job, but I don't know how to explain to future employers why I left. I feel stagnant now. I don't know how to be confident looking for other jobs when I don't feel comfortable talking about my old job. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but I also want to start progressing my career again.

If anyone has any relevant advice I'd really appreciate a comment.",30Jul2019,2
915,"Let's say I live in a hypothetical middle eastern country who has been run by clerics since 1979. I'm a college student so I do have access to a lot of like minded people who would get behind a secular, non biased, liberated and free government. 

What I would like to know, is that in terms of security measures, what do I need to keep in mind?

And on the other hand, what would you say would be the most effective way to find like minded people and persuade them to join such a just cause?

I know this is a far fetched idea, and the very best we're a few years away from it (lest we have a civil war, which is more than likely in the next year or so)

916,"So I've posted different questions about this situation in different subs. I've just been skipping through details to get to my main questions, and have gotten some good advice, but I have not come to a permanent solution. I will start by giving the whole story:
4 years ago, my current husband, who I was not married to at the time, had a fallen out. It was a horrible break-up right after our 2nd child was born. We started seeing other people. I started dating a guy who I will call P. P was everything I was not used to in a man. He said and did all the right things. He even a single father and we had a lot in common. But very soon into the relationship, I started noticing signs of aggression, control, jealously, obsession and violence from P. Things were moving really fast between us and I felt the need to end it before it got too deep. After I broke things off with him, he started to show his true colors and I realized he was just psychotic. He would not take no for an answer. He would call/text me non-stop throughout the night begging me to just talk to him, or be with him, or just be friends with him. We dated for 2 months but he behaved as if we were together for years and there was something worth fighting for. As it turns out, P was stalking and researching me waaaaay before we even started dating. I just didn't see those signs at first, I was at a very vulnerable point when I met him (post-partum, break-up with long-time partner). 
After a few months, the calls slowed down, but still happened here and there. It was annoying, but I never felt threatened by him so I never took any action. The most was just cursing him out over the phone telling him to leave me alone, eventually I just screened his calls, blocked his number and a year later, I got back with my now-husband. My husband was aware of the situation but like I said, the calls slowed down drastically and even when I saw P outside, he would walk the other way. It wasnt until late night hours, after a few drinks that he would decide to call and harrass me. 
Fast forward to this May. We were having a family BBQ at my house. P lives in a building literally feet away from my house. I rarely bump into him, but this day was the worst day to see him, he was wasted. Long story short, it led to a physical altercation between him and my husband. I'm not going to sugar coat it, my husband kicked his ass. And I was kind of happy about it because I thought he would finally get the point to leave me alone. But after the fight, he started sending death threats to me and my husband and everyone who was there that day (he did thorough research on social media to find them).
So I filed for an Order of Protection. The thing I've learned about these orders is that they are not really valid until the Opposer is served and both parties settle the situation in court. The first court date, he did not show up, he was not successfully served. But he is well aware that the Sheriff is trying to serve him but he has been avoiding it. Case adjourned for another month. Next court date, same situation. I mentioned to the judge that he is aware and to see if there is another way to serve him (have a friend/family member do it, certified mail etc). The judge is honestly a bitch. She doesnt seem interested in my case at all. She said unless the Sheriff confirms that P is avoiding getting served (seen running away or seen going into his apartment and not answering the door) or if I know where he works or another place to find him, which I don't, then they will have to follow the serving procedure that they have been doing. 
Now yesterday, I'm walking home with my children. I see him for the first time since May. He was walking the opposite direction as me but as soon as he saw me he started yelling dumb shit like ""Oh you better be scared!"" And ""Stop snitching, you know what happens to snitches!"" I didn't say a word, I just pulled out my phone as a threat to record him if he tried anything stupid. We got a little further away but I turned around and saw that he was now walking behind us. Still pretty far, but why the fuck would he start walking my direction as if he was following us? Eventually he stopped and turned back around. He's very overweight and probably couldn't keep up with us. 
I called the precinct as soon as I got home. They went to look up my Order number, but for the fact that P was not served yet, and does not know what he can and cannot say or do to me, he technically did not violate anything, so there was nothing that the police can do. I went on to ask if they could send someone out to serve him since I knew he was close to home, the officer advised me that I had to reach out to the Sheriff's office directly to set that up because the ""local police only do it as a courtesy and if they have time"" which they didn't. I called the Sheriff's but it was after business hours so that was a lost cause. Didn't bother calling back today because I don't know P's schedule and if he would be home today. If I call 911, I will have to press charges which will turn it into a criminal case, when all I want is for him to LEAVE ME ALONE. The officer even advised me that it would have to be a serious crime for me to call 911. Apparently, verbal threats aren't serious enough for this city (NY). 
He didn't learn his lesson from getting his ass kicked.
I cant force him to accept the Restraining Order.
The law wants to wait until he slits my throat to protect me. 
So I'm asking you Reddit...
What would you do if you were in my situation? 
Has it really come down to having to move to get this man out of my life? Which I couldnt afford right now anyway.
I don't even want violence, or harsh punishment since I know he has a son to care for, but that doesn't stop him from being crazy. What are my other options?",30Jul2019,1
917,"A few weeks ago I had 2 ingrown toenails, one one each side of my toe, cut out. It was all infected and fucked up. I went to a doctor shortly afterwards because the infection was still there.

920,"He knows what he can get away with legally, so I don't have any support. It is worsening though.

I called the police. I've been documenting. I've gone to my local Safehouse. I don't live alone.

He's told me why he's doing it. He wants to keep me scared. He doesn't want me to go for runs or walk my dog. He wants me to live in fear as long as I'm in this town. He thinks I owe him an apology for something but I don't know what - and that he'll keep the pressure on me until I apologize. I can only think of rejecting him twice and taking him to court in 2016. Nothing else. And I'm not apologizing for those things. I really think he just wants to control me and have contact with me any way he can.

I wasn't able to get a restraining order several years ago because he knows his legal limits. He has already hurt women in the past, and an animal. He has substance abuse problems.

Today he was coming through my neighborhood again and I got him on video. He flipped me off. Usually he runs away or drives away quickly when I catch him. It worries me that he's showing aggression now.

He admits to following me since 2000 when I was competing heavily in my sport. He's said he loves me, sent me nude photos of himself, and has made websites and twitter pages about me, my friends and my boyfriend - usually any male around me.

921,"Hey guys! 
So I finished work and I had a couple of beers. I'm on my way out and I run into this girl I'm good friends with. We chat for a little bit, share a hug all the usual good stuff. And on my way home I'm thinking I might have a thing for her, but after another few minutes of thinking about it I figure that it could just be because I've been single for coming up to 8 years. How can I tell the difference between latching to someone due to loniless and having an actual thing for them? 

TL/DR; how can I tell if I actually like someone or if I just want to be with someone/anyone?

925,"I have been in a relationship for a year and three months. At the time i met her i was 17 and she was 15 and her parents didnt know about me for two months. Theres a lot that happened in this relationship. 

Months 1-2: we had some good times and a lot of bad times. At the time i didnt blame her. Because she made a lot of decisions off the people she chose  to be around. Im not the best looking but people think im sweet and loyal to the bone and within 3 to 4 days we were dating. Within the next we broke up because she was screaming and yelling at me. She said she wanted another chance and got back together with me. But her friend went on a trip on our second week and she wanted to experiment and i wasnt sure about it but i said what the hell. The next day she wanted to experiment more and we did.. later i get messages from her saying shes going home and to stay away from one of her exs. When i found out why it was because of me touching her trying to do something she wanted to do because she is very presistant. Next all her exs popped in the picture. And she was flirting with so many guys but alas i did everything i could to stay with her. Because i wanted to make her happy. I wanted to do someone right and i wanted to be loved and give her a certain type of love people want. She left me for another guy. Than asked to get back with me. Than left me for another guy. Than came back and than my own best friend at the time set me up. And took her away from me. Soon we talked and he broke up with her. She came back after she tried playing both of us and we caught her. It took her a while but when her parents finally met me they liked me. But soon she moved away. The day of the move she wanted to have sex but i made a promise that i would see her soon and show her how much i really love her. 

Months 3-4: her parents got more and the picture and were helping me out i never felt so happy for all the accomplishments they helped me get through. Once she moved she told me that before she moved she kissed her ex. Than we were fighting 24/7 all summer and she was talking to other dudes but i didnt want that to bother me. Soon one of the dudes got into the picture. And it was hectic. Later found out a lot of hurtful truths from her and it screwed the relationship up a lot. Soon school started everything changed. I got a job to save money to see her in dallas. 

Months 5-6: i buy the ticket after a fight. And she than tells me the next day someone forced a kiss on her. Someone smaller and skinnier than her. I was broken. I broke down but i found out she had a pair of scissors next to herself. And i forgave her. Cus i wanted to see her and i didnt want her to do something stupid. So i saved up more money and saw her. 

Months: 7-8: we meet up and her family ends up loving me. Soon it all just stopped all the drama everything. We were so happy. But things were always good. She would get mad and tell her friends and family instead of me. And i found out she blocked me from seeing her conversations on Instagram stories. Than soon we finally talked through everything and we lost our virginities. Soon i went home after 2 almost 3 weeks.

Months: 9-10: things were getting rough at home i didnt live with my mom and dad my mom walked out and my dad has a heart condition and couldnt take care of me. So i lived with my uncle and his girlfriend. Later i got in a fight with my uncles girlfriend and was kicked out. And the week after she tells me she has feeling for her ex but she cut him off. After that my friend that took me in told me i need to start putting down my foot. So i did.

Months: 11_12 Soon she met someone new and he became a big issue. She was wearing his jacket and she was taking his hats and she was always talking about him. Than ignored me when talking she would leave calls to talk to him and she would tell me to shut up so she can answer his message. It came to a big argument and she took 3 weeks to think about breaking up with me. 

Months 13 and 14: i graduated and on the same day we got into an argument over me telling her she shouldnt be friend with the guy that stepped in the picture because hes dragging her down. Asking for money cus hes in debt to drug dealers. And soon i was leaving to bootcamp.. thing didnt go the way i expected it so i left and became a dep los. I was heart broken and i felt alone. Soon her family was saying mean things about me. And she was on board. I didnt join the army for the fact that i didnt go for my own reasons and at the time was not happy with the job. Soon her family took it another step and had her tell me in front of my family that if i didnt go to bootcamp or get a job she was going to break up with me. My family actually loved her and she sat there and said why would she say that? Soon she blew up my phone the next day while at a recruiting office all because some guy who she lets comment on her photos calls her beautiful with her and calls her bbg. And i answered just to get screamed at. When ever me and her argue shes screaming btw. So i told her how i was feeling about her family being there for me when they werent there for me than. And she freaked out saying her parents had every right to talk shit on me and i never had any righy to defend myself. Than said she didnt know if she wants to be with me anymore and it crushed me. I said fine and gave her space and later was so hurt i kissed a girl. I know there isnt any excuse the cheat on someone but i got so low i didnt even feel like myself and its like i was broken. Soon she told me she did want to be with me and we got back together.. on my birthday she called me telling me she ddnt know why but she feels like a different person.. more mean than ever. And than said she had a nicotine high and that she doesnt remember any of what she said because she was tired. Soon we hit 1 year 3 months. And she does this anonymous texting app and says tell me something u wanted to tell me. Than some dude comment ""i want to smash"" and it irritated me cus its just like i am her boyfriend and i shouldnt be seeing that. So she texted me about it and i told her she shouldnt be using those sights because its not worth it. She screamed yelled and told me she cant say she loves me because i stabbed her parents in the back for saying they werent there for me. And i was like your parents when behind my back and were talking shit on me.. it got so bad we broke up. And 3 hours later we were both crying and got back together but soon she started flipping out every five seconds and it caused me to sit there and hear nothing but screaming and when i would react she was pointing to this isnt working out. All of the passed year and 3 months she wants to say she puts a lot of effort in but shes always the first to leave. We had about three more fights and i basically feel so low but i just want things to get better because i have done nothing but dream about being with her and it has done nothing but kill me. I love her. I just dont know what to do. Any advice helps..",30Jul2019,1
926,"Just gonna warn a lot of my might find this creepy and weird. made a throwaway just to ask this. never told anyone before.

anyway last summer i worked at this restaurant washing dishes. This girl worked there as an expo and worked right next to me. at first it seemed like she was a bitch that hated me and everyone else. until one day she stood up for me to one of my coworkers. i thanked her for it and after that we were on friendly terms. 
She was still really weird though. Like one day i'm working and i dont remember how or why but she randomly said to me something like ""thats right you fucking piece of shit"" LOL. she stared me down after saying it. i was shocked and just stood there like an idiot. 
now most people might be horrified by this but i found it to be flirty and hot af actually. Thing is i'm a sub, i get off on that kinda abuse and stuff basically. mean bossy girls are great. 
so once that happened i saw her in a whole new light. i understand the weird bitchy behavior now and why people didnt seem to talk to her much.. cuz shes dominant and/or a sadist and it scares people away.
Now heres the weird/creepy part. She was 16. I'm 28. Please please don't show up at my door fbi because i never tried anything with her.
I doubt she even was aware of her strange behaviors and her inner nature. I really wanted to help her understand.. i formed a massive crush on this girl. We talked all the time and shed make other little comments too poking fun at me and pushing my buttons and id try giving it back to her.
One time everyone was getting ready to leave for the night and waiting around by the front door. Somehow or other she ended up showing off her socks to me and making me look at them.. it was such a tease. and it felt like something a girl would do when they have a crush. i had to just be like, cool, and walk away.
Sadly, some stuff happened at work and i had to leave. and it worked out that she was gone the week i left so we never even got to say goodbye.
Should I try finding her on fb or something? Keep in mind shed be older now and age of consent here is 17..
i mean i know how this all sounds but im really not a pedophile, this girl was already basically a fully grown woman and wanting to flirt with me.. and we seemed to connect on a deeper level. maybe one she wasnt aware of. Anyway yeah.. so thats my story.",30Jul2019,1
927,"You know how children play around and have imaginary friends? That's what I do. Except he's not exactly created by my imagination. He's a real person. I won't tell you how I know him exactly, because I absolutely disgust myself already. It did start off with a crush, even though we were never that close. It was the strongest feeling I've ever had and he gave me a near heart attack if he even entered my range of sight. I was absolutely obsessed with him for no clear reason. 

I now spend every single day thinking about him for what seems like more than half of the time. First thing I wake up in the morning, I think about him. Last thing I think about before falling asleep? Him. All throughout every single day there are little fantasies and daydreams playing about him being there with me. He is constantly by my side as an imaginary friend and I can't seem to put an end to it. I want to stop it because thinking about this one person all the time is driving me insane. He now seems to be the most important thing in my life and I don't see why or how. I don't want this. I think I'm going insane.

931,"Like the title says, I'm 25 years old, I've never worked a day in my life, haven't had a friend since highschool and my education only reaches highschool.

My anxiety is so bad that even thinking about leaving the house raises my heartbeat and makes me sick. For the majority of my life making posts on the internet or seeing the chat on online games was too much for me, if games didn't allow me to hide the chat I would cover my screen with paper because seeing someone else talk to me would make me panic. I suppose someone could consider that improvement. Speaking to someone outside my house is almost impossible. Last year I left the house for a haircut in an attempt to improve myself, leading up to the haircut was 2 weeks of pure stress and I bailed out last minute which followed by days of guilt.

My motivation and energy is so low that even getting out of bed feels like I'm carrying a very heavy weight.

Therapy doesn't work. I tried speaking to a GP with my mother 4 years ago (horrible experience). They put me on SSRIs which made things far worse and nothing could ever pursuade me to take those drugs again.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a ""normal"" life is pretty much impossible and I've accepted that but my idea of semi normal would be living independantly from my parents with a job. I have absolutely no life experience, 95% of my free time past the age of 11 has been sat infront of a computer screen and my only perception of real life are little snippets through the internet.

I have one skill and that is speaking fluent manderin. However, that is hardly a marketable skill when I can't even imagine what it's like to speak to someone who isn't my mother.

941,"Info - Ireland (different college system): 2 years studying business, dropped out, started into an electrician apprenticeship, didn’t enjoy that so I left after 4 months (trial period).

I was previously looking at going back to college when I left the apprenticeship at first.
Now I don’t know..
Nothing else interests me.. so I’m left with business again.
I would be starting as a 2nd year (so 3 years worth of fees, slightly cheaper).
I could also avoid the subjects I hated (maths, stats, economics, accounting)..
But what does that leave me with a business degree in marketing or management..

I don’t even know if I want to work in a 9-5 office job, that’s where business degrees typically bring you..
I know that’s not all but the vast majority of positions are going to consist of that to some degree.

I don’t know what to do.. 
I’m 22 and I still haven’t a clue what to do.
Should I just go back to college and push through? What’s that degree going to be worth? 
Especially when I’m just doing it for the sake of it.

Should I just go out and get a basic job?

I was looking at a welding course that’s on in a local college.. 
I was very interested in what the welders were doing while I was an apprentice electrician.. 
it’s cheap and it’s a year long.. which seems long for just the basics.

I don’t know if I’d like a career in welding either, I left the other apprenticeship because I was sick of pulling cables in the pissing rain, and cutting thousands of pieces of uni strut..
But I find welding interesting and something I could be good at.. I just don’t know if that life is for me.

945,"My life has been a wild roller coaster ride for the last few years and I'm confronted, yet again, with another situation that I need your advice on.

Basically I've been living in the city I currently reside in since 2012. I moved here primarily for school. Stuff happened, I got kicked out, started all over, and have been at the school I'm currently at for over 3 years (I'm currently a senior accounting student).

Because I have so many credits from my previous institution, I've been charged out of state tuition at this school for the last three years. I'm also on several other restrictions, such as financial aid, etc. Anyways, due to that, I was only allowed to take intermediate accounting I in spring because it was a pre-req for all of the other classes I needed. I took it in spring and it sucked because taking just one class felt like such a waste of time. This summer, I was signed up for intermediate accounting II because I wanted to take it and get it over with so as to take my last four classes in fall and finish this well. Well, because I was low on money and couldn't pay it past the deadline, I had to drop and figured ,ah what the heck, I'll just take it in fall alongside the other 4 (so, 5 classes total). I screwed up because it too is a pre-req meaning that I can only take that class and no other in fall and then would have to take the remaining four classes in spring of 2020. I had no clue that it was a pre-req and couldn't pay for it on time regardless. I'm kind of only in this city for school and feel like I've never finished; I keep having obstacles come my way that are more than classroom issues (I have a decent GPA and have been passing my classes).

Being that I have 5 classes remaining, my options are now to graduate in spring 2020, or to move back to my hometown (where I have my parents and actually wanna live) and transfer. However, if I transfer, I'd be transferring to begin in January of next year and have no idea how long it would take to finish. I know different universities have minimum hour requirements for transfer students as to graduate. So, I called and was told that the only way to figure out for sure would be to apply, be admitted, have a course evaluation, then I'd know. I kind of am in a bind and don't know what to do. On one hand, just busting through and staying where I'm currently at will have me in and out in May of 2020, but it's still a long time from now and I'm already 28 years old. Moving would make me way more happier (I love my hometown in comparison to where I'm at currently, and so does my wife), however, it may, and most likely would take even longer, thus delaying my entrance into a masters program and eventually qualifying for the cpa exam.

With that said, I need a job and that'd be the constant factor throughout all of this. My mental health has been deteriorating to rather stressful trauma I've experienced in the past here in this city but at the same time I have a family to support and a child so I don't want to be prolonging my education further along when I was expecting to originally graduate this December. The only plus side to all of this is that the costs of education in my hometown are cheaper, I'd have my parents around, more friends around, and I'd probably be able to find a regular job around here easier (sadly, I don't see many corporate accounting opportunity gigs here because it's a smaller town nor many internship opportunities, but that's just my observation since I haven't actually been on campus to check what they have going on).

Basically, my mental health, patience, common sense, and finances are all screaming in different directions and I do not know what to do anymore. I don't feel like I'm stable enough to make a rational and stable decision so I'm seeking help here. Please let me know what you think. If you have any questions that you think would help me help you help me, please feel free to ask.

Thanks!",30Jul2019,1
946,"Neighbour at the back of mine noticed my back door was ajar. I feel like he is always watching my house tbh. Anyways, I went to the cinema and left it open to get some air in. He climbed over my back fence and locked the door. He then must have walked through my house and left through the front door. He left the keys for my back door with my neighbour next door neighbour. I'd literally only been out the house for two hours at this point (he left a voicemail asking where I was but no explanation as to what he'd done or what his plan was. This gives me an indication as to when he must have done it.) I was at the local cinema watching the Lion King. I feel like he has crossed a boundary and he could have left it for at least a day. What if i had a guest over or left personal/private belongings out that I wouldn't want him or other neighbours to see? I have contents insurance. My back gate was locked.

Am I being too mean on him? Should I let him know that I think climbing over my garden fence and walking into my home when I'm not there is overstepping the mark. Even with his supposed best intentions in mind. I think there is a massive subtext of nosiness. He is retired and always pokes his head over the fence when I'm in the garden. Should I just leave my concerns to one side and thank him for locking my back door etc? Thoughts on this would be good.",30Jul2019,2

Location: Germany

Okay so this is my first time doing this and I'm gonna try and do my best.

This whole thing began when I was 17 or 18. I am gay and at that time was a bit fragil because I had been released out of the mental health clinic a few month prior. (Doing fine now, if you're wondering I have to take medicine everyday but it helps.) I was still in school at that time because I didn't had my 10 years of school done so I had to sit around for a few more months. During that time I meet a guy on tinder (yes gay people use tinder) and we chatted for a few months because I didn't had time to meet him immediately. He was nice and cute but I didn't though much of him before the meeting because he made me feel like he was looking for just a quick fun. This happened in winter and then New Years hit. He bought me a ticket from my city to Leipzig where he lives so we can meet up wich I thought was nice. He picked me up form the train station and then we went and had dinner. It was a cold and foggy evening (not a nice time for walking around town) so we decided to go to his place after dinner. He told me before that he doesn't live alone but in a shared flat with T.N. one of his friends. I didn't thought much of it since it's common to live in a shared flat.  
We arrived at his place but T.N. wasn't there I think or he was already sleeping. We decided to cuddle a bit and then went to sleep. (no sex) The new day when I woke up I got introduced to T.N. while having breakfast. I tried to go the ""I don't speak German route"" and be a bit funny but I think he didn't like that. I don't remember if we did much after that then just bringing me to the station with T.N. tapping along and saying that we're gonna meet again.  
While I was at that school I need a apprenticeship to prove that I’m willing to work for my future bla bla weird stuff.  
M.A. is the owner of a company called [Level4Films](http://www.level4films.de/) wich makes content for TV companies.  
He allowed me to do my one month apprenticeship there but unfortunately I discovered a lot of things during my one moth stay in Leipzig.  
I was shy at that time and didn’t know how to handle dating the boss and also working wir him so I acted a bit weird.  
I could’ve been doing a better job looking back at it.  
Anyway I found out that M.W. has his three exes around him at all times.  
P., M.G. and T.N.  
T.N. was his husband wich M.W. told me nothing about and was mad at me for finding it out and not handling it well.  
M.G. is his best friend  
And P. is the one that owns M.W. heart and the one that M.W. Will drop everything for when P. says that he wants to meet him.  
He has a radio show every friday called [matthiasweidneramabend](https://www.facebook.com/matthiasweidneramabend/) wich is one hour long an he gets drunk afterwards.  
He has a drug and alcohol problem but he doesn't acknowledges it and even forced me to drink a glass of Vodka when he was drunk and always wanted that I take drugs too and smoke with him.  
They all looked down on me and acted like they were better then me especially P.  
After the month in Leipzig everything went down hill. I was jealous a P. because I had a crush on M.W. and he didn’t seem to get it and didn’t want to tell me that HE had a crush on P. so yeah it was weird for me that he was searching for a new bf even tho P. was still in his heart.  
I visited him one more time after that I think and it wasn’t good. M.W. was mad at me for staying a bit longer because I had a interview for a internship at a place in Leipzig.  
He also said that I’m too passive and should be more active even if it means throwing China at the ground.  
Before leaving to the train station we went and have breakfast. (I didn’t because I knew where this was going)  
He told me that he doesn’t have any feeling for me and that it won’t work.  
I of courses started crying because I was feeling down and then he wanted to buy me a book for the way home because he thought that would make me feel better.  
After that was done I left as quickly as possible and booked myself an earlier train ticket because I was crying on the platform and just wantedt to get home.  
In the train M.W. texted me that he can give me 300€ to get my german citizenships wich I declined. (He just wanted to make himself feel better about everything)  
We tried being friends after that but it didn’t work because I had a broken heart.  
Some month later I called me a cunt and things like that because of my broken heart.  
I don’t remember much in between that.  
Around Christmas a year later I wanted to gift him tickets to a concert (around 100€) in Leipzig that I hoped he would take me with him.  
Instead he told me that he had a bf that he would take with him. (That was the first time that he told me he had a bf after telling me some weeks earlier that he didn’t want a relationship with anybody.)  
So I was like fine...sad but fine.  
Some month later I found out that he lied to me and took his exes with him to the concert.  
I also wished him death on his birthday round this time because I was done with him and just couldn’t handle his shit.  
So yeah I guess that’s the story.

If people have questions I will update it.

I have no idea where to post this so it might show up in different places.",30Jul2019,1

953,"I'll graduate with my B.S. in IT this fall. I live at home with parents while attending the local state college. I have a couple of connections that might help me get a job locally, but the job market isn't the best.   


I live in South Florida and want to move out north. My brother lives in Denver and its a dream of mine to get out their. I have the opportunity to get to Denver and crash on their couch until the lease is up (The lease would allow it and I would pay rent). Then we would rent a place where I would have my own room.   


Im not sure if I should stay longer or just move out to Denver. I dont want to get settled in Florida tbh.   


Logic tells me to stay home and try to use connections to get a job in SF and move out in a year. My heart tells me to get the heck out to Denver as soon as possible. Denver has tons of jobs.   


I have enough money to do it as long as I move out with a job lined up. The great thing is that I can be added to the lease at any time so I can wait till I get a job then move out their.  Then I keep thinking about the what if my connections in Florida might be the smarter thing to focus on. Keeping in mind I dont want to live in Florida...

956,"This might be a bit long so apologies in advance. 

I’m supposed to be going to a festival at the end of August. Was meant to be going with two friends, and our boyfriends (so 6 of us in total). One of my friend’s and her boyfriend decided when we all got the tickets that they wanted to stay in a hotel near the festival and then meet us at the festival each day, as the rest of us would be camping, this was all fine.

However mine and my other friend are no longer in our relationships. My ex and I ended on goodish terms and have agreed it’s fine to still see each other and camp together (but separately) at the festival, and it’s been a while since we broke up. But my friend and her now ex only just broke up, and she doesn’t think she wants to go to the festival at all now.

If she doesn’t go, I don’t know how I’ll feel camping with just my ex and her ex (who is also my ex’s best friend). I do really want to go as I love the lineup but as said the camping arrangement is worrying me.

Should I just sell the ticket and not go if my friend doesn’t go, or should I just go anyway and deal with whatever happens.

I want to confront my parents and ask them for help but i’m too scared. Fuck if it comes to it she can move in with me, I don’t care, I just don’t want her to get hurt anymore. What should I do? Please help. The thing about this is that I don’t think she even wants help, she doesn’t want me to worry about it, she just wants me to forget about it. We only recently started dating, but since then I have learned a lot about her, plus things i’ve heard about her. Her family has greatly damaged her mental health, to the point of her not taking medicine that she needs to fucking live, she wants this living hell to end, but I just want to fix this, I want to take her away from them, I want to comfort her and let her know that everything is gonna be okay.
