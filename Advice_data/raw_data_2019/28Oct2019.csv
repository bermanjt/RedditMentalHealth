Hello everybody, this is going to be a long post so thanks in advance for taking the time to read (tldr at the bottom).

I’m a bachelor student trying to finish my chemistry degree and I’m struggling a lot with life because of high demands my university is putting on me. I’ve isolated myself from the world and have become unable to take any meaningful steps towards bettering my situation. I’m not depressed but I have a very bleak outlook on life and generally see every day as a chore. Going to sleep is the thing I most look forward to every day. 

I think that there’s two aspects to my situation. The first being that I spend way too many hours ‘studying’ every day. I use a time tracking app and in the last 6 months I studied for roughly 3.5-4 hours every day. For every 4 hours of work, I waste another 4-6 hours of forcing myself to work. So, on a typical day Im spending almost 10 hours in my room alone trying to study. It hasn’t always been like this, at the beginning of my degree, I just studied – period -, without having to force myself. 

I absolutely \*have\* to study this many hours because most (not all) exams are very difficult. Not because the subject itself is difficult, but you never know what the questions on the exam are gonna be. The professors use power point slides to teach. They fill out the slides with formulas or other very tightly condensed pieces of information and recommend anywhere from 3 to 8 textbooks for reference. So, you never know what to expect when you take an exam. I once spent almost 6 months studying for an exam, then failed it because I’ve never even heard of half of the things that were asked, then took it again a year later, only reviewed a week beforehand and passed with flying colors. I have tried to speak with some professors about it and they said that I should look at older exams sheets or read the textbook. I have already done those things. They don’t want to get into the details of what is relevant for an exam so that was a dead end in my opinion. I don’t talk so much with my colleagues (more on that later) but from what I gather they are either extremely smart and can take in absolutely huge amounts of information in a short time or they just learn the answers to old exams and more or less on a wing and o a prayer take the exam hoping that it will suffice. Not all exams are like this. Some professors ask exactly what the taught in class. And I do reasonably well on those exams, I enjoy studying for them and it doesn’t take more than 2-3 weeks of studying. 

I’m in my 4th year of a supposedly 3-year program and hoping to be finished in one year. So, it will have taken me 5 years for this stupid degree. I have to do both a masters program (at least 2 years) and a doctorate (at least 3 years) as well. More than 90% of chemistry students get a doctorate (in Austria). So, I’m looking at least another 6 years of this life. And I know it will take me way longer than that. Statistically everybody takes longer and I’m taking way longer than the average person. 

The thing is that I really enjoy the subject, I think it’s fascinating and I would love to be able to actually make a career in chemistry. I never knew (with such certainty) what I wanted to do in life until finding chemistry. I just don’t want to give up. I never get the feeling of being behind the other students or that I know or understand less. On the contrary. It’s just that the exams are so unfairly difficult so I can’t take 6 of them in a semester AND do a lab too. But I do very much want to have a life. It was fine for a few years to keep this rate up, but it is not sustainable for me. I want to have friends, a relationship, enjoy my hobbies and so on.

The second aspect of my problem is that I can’t bring myself to do something against my situation. I hate myself because I perform so poorly (even though I’m honestly to god giving 150%). I can’t really connect to the other students; I can’t go out and make friends. I feel worthless und undeserving. I’m afraid of changing university because I’m afraid to go out of my comfort zone. I just can’t change anything in my life anymore. I’m just sort of moving in a general forward direction at a snail’s pace curled up in my carapace being bitter about things. And I hate myself for it. I used to enjoy so many things, reading, watching series and movies, going out, taking walks, seeing people, generally having a nice quite life. Half the things I can’t do because my anxiety is acting up and even if it didn’t, I wouldn’t have time for it anyway. And the other half I only halfheartedly do and when I do, I feel guilty because I should be studying.

I have at times had a clearer mind and said to myself that the best thing is to just find a different masters in a different field. A university that isn’t asking so much from their students. But then after some time elapses, I start enjoying chemistry again and I change my mind. This has happened at least 4 times in the last three years. So, I can’t trust myself if I have an ‘epiphany’ and ‘decide’ to switch fields.

I just don’t know what to do, should I just stick it out? I’ll be in my mid thirties and I will have spent a decade alone in a room and I’ll have a dumb piece of paper to show for it. Should I switch gears and do another masters program? And how do I stick to my decision? Should I go to another city/country? (I really like the city I live in though).

Tldr; I have to put in so many studying hours for my university that I have -1000 free time and it’s taking its toll. I don’t want to give up on my dream and I’m finding it really difficult to make it work without having to sacrifice it all.",28Oct2019,2
1,"My mother is a devout Catholic, but I consider myself an atheist. I have no interest in her religion, but whenever I bring up my beliefs (or lack thereof,) she gets mad, punishes me either by taking away my phone or the less common beating. So long as I live under her roof, I am also Catholic. Recently, she bought me a silver crucifix necklace and forces me to wear it. Suffice to say, I don't like it. It feels disrespectful for me to wear a symbol of a religion I don't believe it, and it's always a hassle to put it on and take it off because of how close it is to my throat. (I need to do this often because I do wrestling.) And be it by placebo or an actual allergy, it physically itches to wear. My mother refuses for me to take it off for anything else but practice and I'd hate to be wasteful or come off as ungrateful. Is there any way I can discreetly take it off without her noticing?",28Oct2019,2

So i declined doing the video chat with them, and idk what to do?? They've done nothing to get me to dislike them, but i just don't want to talk to them at all?

9,"This past summer, my family and I have fell into a deep financial hole because our living situation was in jeopardy. I took out a payday loan and I still haven’t paid it off because I haven’t been able to work. My credit score has plummeted and my family needs about $650 by Tuesday morning in order to keep our furniture from being auctioned off at a storage unit. I have no idea what to do. There are no lenders that are accepting me. I have been scouring google all day today and yesterday looking for lenders and I keep getting pushed. I want to do a car title loan, but my title is in the gd storage unit, my father won’t give me money nor will he even give me ideas what to do, my mother’s side of the family have been supporting us financially all summer and my mother can no longer ask them for more money. I wanted to go to r/borrow but I don’t have 1k karma. I even tried pulling an all nighter, commenting on so many different things to get it up, but I barely got anything.

I just don’t know what to do. I posted for help on r/assistance a day ago, but it got ignored. My family and I legitimately need help and it’s been so disheartening and stressful trying to catch up with what we had to ignore in order to keep a roof over our heads and food in our stomachs. If anyone has any ideas on what I can do - please, I’m practically begging, I don’t know what else to try anymore.",28Oct2019,1
10,"I recently ran across someone that I was buying really cool homemade decorations. We met up after a purchase so I could pick up the gifts and I noticed she looked really pretty and seemed really nice so I asked her if she wanted to have coffee or meet up sometime. She said she would ""absolutely"". We made some small talk and she let me know that she was recently going through a divorce and she had a lot going on, which I totally understood having gone through the same, but would still like to meet up. We had a couple of brief exchanges but she didn't always respond to messages and wasn't really as engaging as I initially thought.
Understanding her situation, how should I approach engaging or conversation for a mid/late-20s mother going through that in its early stages?

12,"Hey guys, 

So I have a friend who's ex is really bothering him. Despite the fact that they've broken up over a year ago, she keeps texting him, messaging him on Facebook, leaving voicemails, etc. One of the biggest issues is the fact that once he blocks her on Facebook messenger, she keeps making new accounts in order to harass him further. He's told me that he has done everything from ghosting her, deleting her texts, blocking her number, and yet somehow she still able to contact and annoy him.

By the way, he does not want her back at all (in fact he hates her and I don't like her because she's crazy). He has a girlfriend now who he loves and cherishes. He's asked me for advice, but I'm having a hard time doing so because this scenario is way out of control.

By the way the ex and him are attending different schools. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!",28Oct2019,2
13,"So throwaway because I feel anything that has to do with Nazis is just asking for trouble no matter the circumstances. 

So I'm an 18 year old American female, and ever since I was a little kid I've loved the history behind WW1/WW2 and a lot of other old wars. Military things just interest me. I have some friends who take an interest too but it's kind of like a hobby to me. I like to read books about it and watch documentaries and go to the museum to learn as much as I can. I have a couple of pieces of memorabilia I keep away in a box, and coincidentally my boyfriend happens to be German. So his family has quite the collection from past family members. 

Now I have a tall bookshelf in our living room and I wanted to organize the shelves by topic. So one shelf for the Cold War, two for WW1 and two for WW2 etc. I wanted to put the memorabilia I have on the shelves with the books as kind of a display case. But, I'm worried that to the outside person or to my family this would make me look like a Nazi/Neo Nazi. I'm absolutely not and neither is my boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure if I had a lot of Nazi symbols on display it just is going to end up looking like that. I do have things from America as well but I don't think that would really help honestly. I also have a uniform jacket that I wanted to hang on the wall in a case next to the shelf but that's also German and I just feel like it's definitely going to give off the wrong impression. I don't want his mom and dad to visit and get offended thinking I'm mocking them or anything. Idk it's just a weird situation and I don't know what to do without looking like an ass. Any help or thoughts would be much appreciated.",28Oct2019,1
14,"I am currently in a relationship with a (20f) girl, we’ll call her C. We’ve been in this relationship for about 3-4 years now (unsure of the exact date because we never had an official anniversary). We started off as friends, went to high school together, however we were never very close, just the type of friend where she was in my grade and we got along. 

In 12th grade we started talking more, hanging out more often, and from that a really strong friendship formed. I really liked her. She was smart, honest, confident, attractive, funny, and we shared some similar interests as well as points of view. It was perfect... we had fun together, so many laughs, deep conversations, we essentially became each other’s best friend. Even when we disagreed on something, we were okay with it. Fast forward to more time spent together, this eventually led to a sexual relationship. For the longest time we enjoyed calling each other “friends” because we didn’t like putting a label on our relationship. Fast forward to now and we’ve been dating for over 3 years now. 

Man, when I look at it from this POV I feel so nostalgic, as if the feelings I’m currently having are wrong... I know they aren’t, I just feel conflicted. 

As a side note, C dated one of my friends back in middle school and she had turned out to often have very irrational behaviour. The relationship ended badly, and left a sour taste in people’s mouths for a while. C was also known for being “brutally honest” and at times “mean/condescending”.  I was pretty aware of all this, but a couple years later when we had classes together, she turned out to be cool. I believed that she had changed, and whenever C talks about this period in time, she would chalk it up to “puberty and hormones”, which I understand, plus we were young. People grow up, people change. 

Anyways, C and I have always prioritized our own well-being, “you have to take care of yourself first”, “only once your cup is full can you fill into the cup of others.”  I still stand behind this 100%. But this situation I’m in clearly doesn’t reflect that. 

In January of this year, C left to study abroad for 5 months. This had always been a thing. Since she was young, she knew she was going to do an exchange in university. Obviously this was a tough time at first. Being in a relationship, in love, with so much time spent together. We both hated that we had to be apart for so long. I was extremely supportive, always trying to look on the bright side and not make her feel bad about leaving. We both had 100% trust for each other. Trust was never a question. It’s what relationships are built on. We both knew that we were exclusive to each other. Of course I had moments where I felt anxious/hoping for the best, but this is because I’ve been cheated on in the past, so old emotions were resurfacing. I was able to tell her about these feelings, and she would reassure me. 

Probably worth noting that, while I didn’t know it at the time, I grew up a very anxious child despite being “social” and “popular”, and dabbled with drugs, which landed me with a nasty addiction to opioids in grade 11,12 and a year after high school. C was aware of all this. She provided support, and was there for me in my time in need, all without judgement. However, I didn’t fully open up (as in go through the extensive details of my addiction) because I was scared of what would be thought of me (it was a dark time.) 

So, with her leaving for 5 months I was determined to getting to know myself and growing, because I wasn’t at my happiest. I rarely spoke up for myself because I grew up with parents that didn’t allow me to express myself without repercussions. Long story short, I’ve grown a lot since January. I’m now really in touch with my feelings, I’m aware of what I think and feel, I’m fully tending to my body, I’m really happy. So many areas of my life are excelling. I’m getting beyond mental resistance, I’m getting beyond the anxiety. I’m really getting to know myself; so much of my childhood was repressed in my mind, and sitting with the uncomfortable feelings have revealed great insights. I’m so proud of myself, I can talk about this for a while. This is a huge thing for me being proud of myself, as I grew up with the idea that I always had to do better. 

During this time with her being abroad, on a few occasions she did things that bothered me, and we are both aware that it would’ve bothered her as well. I voiced my feelings, and she acknowledged them. Nothing serious, and everything was okay – I felt so grateful to have such an amazing partner. But near the end of her exchange, I found myself feeling like I enjoyed my time alone... so much of my life was spent disregarding myself. I almost felt like I wanted her to remain abroad. This space felt good, because it allowed more space for time to spend on myself. 

And now, ever since she’s gotten back, I’ve often felt annoyed by her, and I now realize that she had always been this way... :/ 

She often speaks over me, she’ll often disconnect mentally (it feels like) when I speak, she’s often negative, I rarely ever feel like she’s truly present with me. All of this I’ve told her more than once. 

She’ll often impose her opinion on me, and is always talking bad about other people... and I honestly feel like she’s holding me back from growing. I don’t feel very happy. She’s negative about herself (which is okay, we all go through tough times, we’re all human), but she’s not willing to put in the effort at the moment (although she says she’s trying). I fully understand that it’s not easy to feel that way, and I am so supportive of her. I put in so much energy into the relationship, but I don’t feel like I’m getting the same energy back. In fact, I kinda feel drained. 

I really don’t know what to do. I’ve often been thinking of breaking up but I don’t know how, or if I even should. I know that my own well-being is important, but I can’t come to decide if this is the right decision or not. 

I’m so conflicted, I need other people’s points of view. I’ve never opened up about this to anyone.

Edit: I often think and believe that I would ultimately be happier if we were to break up, but I can’t get myself to do it. I still want to be her friend, too. This is really hard.",28Oct2019,1

Okay, so I need some help. I'm not suicidal by any means. My life is great, and I'm not depressed or anything. I have a cat and he's the best part of my life (no offense, I just like animals more than people). Nothing's wrong.

I just don't want to live. 

Life is hard but ultimately useless. I'm a tiny speck in the massive universe that has no end. If I die, who cares? I mean my family and friends will, of course, but I mean, does it REALLY matter? No. It doesn't. Now, I'm not going to kill myself or anything, so you don't have to say ""life is worth it! It'll get better!"". I don't care about that bullshit. My feeling don't matter and neither do yours. 

If the earth exploded, 🤷 it doesn't MATTER. These are just my opinions so plz don't attack me. All I want to know is why? Why do I feel this why and why does know one else?

If I hurt someone s feeling enough to where they won't let me make it better (it's happened to me before, I still don't know why she was upset) who cares? We're all gonna die. It doesn't matter if we're friends or not. I don't need anyone in my life. But I still want them. It's so weird. I don't know what's wrong with me. There's no reason to be alive right now. But if I were to kill myself (hypothetically. I'm not ok?) I wouldn't jump of a bridge or hang myself, I'd just take one of those pills or something idk. I'd want my family to know that it's not their fault and I wasn't depressed, I just don't care. 

Again, I'm NOT going to do anything.

But seriously, I could murder someone and it wouldn't matter 🤷. 

It's not worth my time to live. But I care too much on my family's and friends feelings, that I would never do anything.

Honestly though, if I had know one. I'd totally be dead by know, not joking.

20,"I'll try to make this short. Thanks for your time.

My friend and I are in our mid-20s. We used to chat almost every day.  This one week, I was very busy, I got my first job, I had guests over, and I was sick during all this..so i didn't reply to her for one week and I left her on read. Before this, she was giving me advice on how to find a job. 

After one week of not replying she messaged me ""Hey, what's wrong?, was it something I said? She said she thought I was angry at her because of the advice she gave me, i told her that of course I wasn't angry because of that.

I thought everything was cool after that, but for three weeks, she only replies to my message once a week. I reply to her right away, but she always leaves me on reading. She says that she had guests over and that she's very depressed, however, I think she is lying, and that she is still pissed I didn't reply to her for on. She has lied to me a lot before, and she can be passive-aggressive at times.

**Question: Why is she acting this way?**

\-----

When I was depressed a few years ago, I attempted suicide. She never came to visit me, instead, we had a fight then. Later she was laughing at my suicide attempt when I was talking about it(she thought it was a funny way to do it). She never visited me when my father passed away either. She did want to meet up for dinner after that. After my father passed away, I developed a stutter and she used to giggle to that. Now that I think about it she probably thought of me as her personal maid, she always made me do things for her. She told me she sees her other friends as a competition, except me. She was friends with me because I wasn't better than her.

I told her my deepest darkest secrets, and I told her everything by text, and I regret it so so much. She has ALL the receipts. She also has access to some family members, what if she sends them the stuff I sent. I just recently found out she was lying to me about everything.

Idk if it’s wrong of me to be bothered that she is asking me for money or not. I don’t really like close friends or relatives asking me for money (if it’s not an emergency or a small amount) for some reason.

Does this make me a bad person? I would help if it was like someone in need but it’s just for her school thing so she can be ranked higher.

29,"So basically I just suck at talking. I mean I’m generally a shy and awkward person who cares to much about what others think, but another reason why I’m bad at talking is because I just don’t know what to say. Whenever I’m in a call with someone or on a one on one conversation, it’s like a game for me to see how long I can go without the conversation dying down. And then I see others who can talk forever. I just don’t get it. I also don’t like small talk. Like “oh the weather is nice”. And I respond. “Uhh yeah”... I have trouble talking to my guy friends who I have been friends with for years too.

36,"I'm a freshman in college going to a small liberal arts school.   
I get that it isn't meant to be fun all the time but most people claim that they had at least a marginally positive experience. I'm burnt out already about halfway through my semester. I just want to get through this semester so I can have a few weeks off but I know I'll just dread coming back once I'm home.  


The social scene here sucks. The dorms are pretty gross, not to mention the girls on my floor act like the villains in a movie about a middle school girl who gets bullied. Another guy on my floor threatened me because he thought I might snitch on him for getting a baby emu and keeping it in his room. Everyone has their friends from high school so they just hang out with them and as someone who comes from a whopping 1.5 hours away, I'm having trouble fitting in. Doesn't help that I have social anxiety and I'm completely socially inept. Half the school commutes and a ton of people who live on campus just go home on weekends, so it's depressingly quiet on weekends and after 5 or so on weekdays.  


I didn't think college was supposed to have these types of cliques and all this stupid drama. People are talking shit about me and my roommate outside our door a few times a week. I'm not sure why but it seems intentional since they mainly say rude shit about how we're always in our room. What, am I supposed to hang out in the common room and get made fun of? I get that I'm quirky, socially clumsy, and awkward but I swear I'm not worth their time that way. 

Academically, it's fine, my classes aren't too challenging and I like my major. But I can't get into all the classes I was told to take next semester without a time turner. I'm a freshman so it's not a massive deal, but it's yet another symptom of this being a small, poorly organized college. It isn't even that the class is full, it's that there are just 2 sections at the only times the classes I absolutely have to take are offered, for introductory Spanish of all things.   


I don't feel like I'll ever fit in here and I don't get enough sleep because people on my hall are so loud at all hours and I can't stop stressing out.  


Somehow, I'm already burnt out, and although my grades so far are great I don't think I can keep it up if I'm not even motivated to study and do my homework.    


I can't transfer even though this college isn't a good fit for me. How do I stay motivated? I'm very unhappy here and I'm not sure what to do about it. I wish I had gone to community college, honestly. I would be a sophomore and the classes I took in high school wouldn't have been completely useless, plus I've got friends there.

39,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping to get some input into my current situation and would love your feedback. I'll try to keep things as concise as possible but here is the backstory. I'm a male in my mid 20s. I live at home with my parents still. I come from a culture where moving out before marriage is typically frowned upon. And defying parents is incredibly looked down upon. I also struggle with severe depression and anxiety. I'm medicated and go to counseling on a weekly basis. 

All this being said, my parents are and always have been incredibly abusive towards my sister and I. Physically abusive in our youth and emotionally abusive now. My sister has moved out with her husband. I don't receive much, if any support from them. But I understand because of how abusive my parents can be. They keep their distance. 

I was laid off a few months ago and that derailed my plans to move out with my girlfriend. I'm still on the job hunt but where I live, there's a lot of economic uncertainty and the job market reflects that. I've been trying my best to continually apply for jobs and look at job opportunities. All this being said, my family has grown to be increasingly more volatile and aggressive towards me. This typically ranges from blaming me for every little mistake around the home, and blaming me for my unemployment. I constantly walk on eggshells around them. To the point where I don't really talk to them. When we do ""talk"", it's more of an interrogation, ""what jobs have you applied to today"", ""what are you going to do with your life"". Then it will turn to insults, ""You're never going to succeed"", ""why can't you do anything right"", so on and so forth. And when I try to confront them about their horrible treatment of me, they take the role of a martyr, ""we pay the bills, how dare you talk back to your parents who take care of you!"", ""You should be grateful!"", etc. 

My only real support is my amazing girlfriend. She's been there for me and I honestly think that without her, I'd have taken my own life by now. Our plan is to move out around the end of Summer/beginning of Fall 2020. Reason being is because that's when she graduates from University and can work full time. This would also give me more time to find a job and save up. I'm on Unemployment Insurance which helps with my student loans and other expenses but it isn't forever. ***My biggest question is what would you recommend to do in the mean time so that I can keep my sanity and my life***. I do have some safety plans in place. like if I feel like I'm being overwhelmed in a panic attack, I do my breathing exercises or go to my girlfriend's place. But I feel like I could be doing more. What are your recommendations so that I can get through the next 10 or so months. If you made it this far, thank you so much for your time and consideration.",28Oct2019,1

43,"Okay so the first thing to explain is that I'm a cartpusher at walmart.  But due to me started at the Walmart Distribution Center or also known as Walmart Logistics and then transferring to the stores I managed to keep my base pay which was 16 at the time and with the annual 2 percent raise I'm sitting at 16.32 an hour rn. So I'm paid pretty well for a low level job. I've worked at my position for over a year, doing extra things around the store from helping AP to running register to helping Zone areas. I don't mind any of this and honestly love my job, I don't plan on staying here as I am going to enlist in the Navy in December. However the security company that my store contracted has one of their hiring managers in working here at times and we've gotten to talking. He's officially offered me a job with the condition that I get my Level 2 Security permit by the end of the week. The starting pay is 14 with a min 40 hours a week, I've wanted to work security for a long time, and tbh my best friend got the same offer and is gonna try to do it. My problem is that I really do enjoy working at Walmart and wouldn't even consider this offer if it weren't for three things, one is the overtime, even tho I would take a paycut I'd make up for it in overtime, two is my best friend joining if he can as the hiring manager said he would make sure we're partners. And three is that management seems to be forcing me out, the current front end manager has threatened my job in multiple way, put extra responsibilities on me that don't fall in my job description, and cut my hours as well as declined my requests on days off that I've made months in advance. Now I know this sounds like an easy decision but it's not. I plan on leaving for the Navy within a year and I don't wanna change things up from what I've done. I also really enjoy a lot of the other hourly associates and even a lot of the salaried associates and it feels like a small family with some of them, I've also worked with this company for two years and just know Walmart really well, and not to mention the pay rn is great for me. But I really don't know what to do, I can take a paycut and work with my best friend, provided he gets the job, and also work a area I've wanted to since I was old enough. But I'm leaving behind what feels like a family. And I'm torn, should I just take the paycut and get the job? Or should I just try to gut things out and hope things get better at my store?",28Oct2019,1
44,"i’m 16, and went to my schools homecoming dance last week. my mom posted pictures of me on her facebook, no big deal.  my moms friend commented, complimenting my dress, said she was still shopping around for a dress for her own daughter, and that teenage girls being picky can be a problem. again, no big deal. then, out of nowhere my mom replies that her problem was my “size” and that finding a dress for me was hard because i was too fat. mind you she commented this for all of her friends and family to see, if it was through text i wouldn’t care as much. the thing that really irks me is that i have a medical condition that makes it difficult to lose weight (and she knows) but despite this, i’ve managed to lose 50 pounds. i’m still slightly overweight, and i’m still actively working on it. i showed her her comments and asked her why she would say that; at first she looked surprised and asked how i could see them (i guess she didn’t know they were public?) i let her know that anyone she was friends with could see it, and i politely asked her to delete them because they were embarrassing. she then got defensive and refused, saying that it was her page and that she could post whatever she wants. am i in the wrong for getting upset over this?? tia",28Oct2019,5

This happened hours ago and she's been in this quiet/seemingly calm mood but its not real calm. She's upset by something and just says ""I'm fine.""

She cooked me dinner extra quietly (which I tried to do but she forced me to sit down and let her do it) and she's being ""nice"" but really the whole calm, passive aggressive thing is getting on my nerves. I was trying to ignore it for a few hours but now its gotten so annoying that I had to get up and sit in the car. You can literally feel it in the air. We arent talking much but when we do, I feel anger rising then we stop and were just on opposite sides of the room being quiet. If anything, I should be the one angry, NOT her! 

Her being calm is fine...if it were genuine. I dont know if she's shocked that I was mad, or if she's mad at me; but her stubbornness to just speak her mind is seriously making me want to be nowhere near her. 

What would you do in this situation and why on Earth might she be acting this way? 


((The Joke Backstory: My doctor basically said I was having too much sex and my sperm count got low so I need to layoff having sex for like a month so I can get lose the perpetual tired feeling (which is why I went in the first place).

She's told me before that she trusts me with these issues because we're so close and she thinks i'm smart (I got like one remaining brain cell left). But when she calls me hysterically crying the best I can do is listen, let her vent, and offer words of encouragement but im afraid she'll begin asking for advice on what to do about these issues, which I am wholly unqualified to give. I want to encourage her to seek professional help, but im worried she'll perceive it as me pushing her away and not wanting to deal with her problems anymore.

52,"So. Lemme be really upfront about this: I have no chance with her romantically. Zero. She's in a relationship, and it's looking like it's going to be one of those forever type things.

However, she has expressed interest in being closer friends. We sometimes see each other through mutual friends, but we never hang out just for the sake of hanging out. She's a really cool person, we get along really well, and I'd love the chance to spend more time with her, but I'm wary.

I'm treading carefully. I'm worried that, in the back of my subconscious mind, I feel like if I befriend her, I'll be able to slowly replace her BF. I know that this is logically ridiculous, but I can't help but worry that some sick part of me believes that at some level. If that's the case, I definitely don't want to get any closer to her.

I still think about her a lot, but I rarely think of her in a romantic/sexual way anymore. I'm not sure if getting close to her would just help to get over my romantic feelings, replacing them with a friendship, or if it would just make my feelings worse and worse over time.

The thing that makes me think it might work is that I can be around her and her BF without getting jealous or flustered. It's just the whole getting closer thing that's throwing me off. I don't want to hurt anything, and I'd hate if she started to have to ghost me because I started being flirty or something.

im 26 but as a kid around 12/13 i was rather confused with my life i was pretty ill mentally but didnt know that at time found out later i had manic depression but anyway.. i was constantly having mood swings had no-one to talk too as i couldnt go to school due to the mood swings so i found this social media site for your phone and you could search for people by city gender age anything you really want to find someone by you could search so as a horny kid i searched by gender looking for a girl to talk too.. i found a ""girl"" 3years older on the other side of the country and began to talk to her over a period of time got introduced to all her friends on the site who live in diffrence parts of the country also and i started to feel like i had friends after a while we began to date exchanging cute pictures and such after a longer time she started to ask for pictures of nudes and videos of me masterbating and we sexted.. i sent them i was young and just wanted someone to be there.. ( my mum was there for me no matter what but i wasnt really intrested in her help ) she used to send me normal pictures of her alot but only ever one of the nude kind i never thought anything of it like if the person was real.. so we continued speaking for a while i lied alot about what my life was like but not at all of who i was as a person as i wanted to keep her intrested we always spoke about how amazing it would be if we met and how we would make it happen and how our lifes would be much better together having someone to rely on.. i turned maybe 14/15 and recieved alot of birthday money and had a massive fight with my mother maybe couple days after it due to well my mood swings and how hard it was for my mum trying to manage me.. and the girl said i should just run away and come see her.. i agreed went to the train station and asked for a ticket to the city she lived what would be the next day so i paid the ticket and woman asked if i was running away i joked with her and continued on my way went home packed my old school bag with all my clothes and stuff i wanted to bring.. next day comes i wait till my mum goes to shop and i leave wearing my best clothes to impress the girl i head to the station go into the train and sit in my seat.. sitting there someone sits few seats behind me and im wondering if i should get up and sit next to them as then people will think we are together and wont ask questions as i consider if this is a good idea 4 police come in and ask me to leave the train tation ( the woman thought something was weird and reported me) i get took to a police station severly questioned about everything and i told them everything i get telt social services will take me away unknown to me my mum has been phoned and is in another room being questioned about my life and why i would run away.. my mum fights best she can for me but is told il be getting took off her she leaves the station and phones my General Practisioner and she gets me put in my mums care again instantly so we leave and i have to go see my doctor and i get refered to a therapist.. i get told to never speak to this girl again but secretly i do but shes severly pissed off that i didnt show but i explain and she eventually understands.. we speak secretly for a year still dating and sending pictures and she still trys to get me to come see her but eventually we drift apart and stop speaking completely as i begin to make real friends.. as i get older i began to think that the full thing was a plot by a peadophile ring using me to send pictures and eventually kidnap me as it was only thing that made sense as looking back alot didnt make sence..  so i kept the full thing between just me and my family and we never spoke of it not one of my friends know either as im really embarrassed about it as to me i was groomed by a peadophile until i met my Fiance and i told her everything about it.... but tonight as my fiance slept next to me and i watched a movie it came across my mind so i did some sleuthing using the girls name and city in google nothing of note comes up i check her name on Facebook 700 results i add her city to search only 1 name shows i click and go through pictures and it was her she looked the same she lives in same city has 3 kids and is in a relationship had recently posted so her profiles active.. so now i believe the girls real and what ive thought all my adult life to get over what happened wasnt true... i dont want to say to my Fiance i done it or even message the girl case they done same to her and used her pictures to send to me.. im happy with my life with the way it is and dont want to change it or open some of my old wounds BUT still im little confused by all this and need to say it somewhere to get it off my chest and have someone listen!! x

When I first got with my girlfriend, I told her things about my family that weren't true, like how they would abuse me (they didn't call me by my preferred pronouns so I was like fuck u). Some things happened and I had to be sent away and in turn, she went off on them, threatening CPS, etc. My girlfriend was under the impression that my family was awful to me and my family was under the impression that some b\*\*\*h just kinda abused them after they had to make the hardest decision of their life.

When I came back, I could barely talk to her. I had to ask to log in to talk to her and it was only for a few minutes (not calling, texting). Eventually I had enough and I snuck her number onto my phone. After a month they found out and they kinda gave up.

My parents hate my girlfriend, but because I'm almost 18, I wanna move out to see her. The issue is, my girlfriend doesn't want to wait that long, but my parents were at least expecting their child, who was gone for 13 months, to be with them til he graduates.

57,"My friend (F25) and I (F22) had a falling out about a month ago where I cut contact and blocked her number. A couple days ago, she reached out to a mutual friend and began spouting lies about me and they told me. I sent her one message from my Google Voice number and said “Know your place.” That was our way of telling each other to knock it off in our ~5 years of friendship. She then replied with this:


You text me like that again through a different phone number mustang3413, I will contact your college and make sure you never work the road. You have absolutely no respect or morals and need to grow up! People like you do not belong on the road. I know my place. I’m 25 years old, a federal officer, and a mother. You keep harassing me and it won’t end pretty. I want to go my separate ways with you and have absolute no contact with you.  I blocked you for a reason because I don’t need people like you in my life or even around me. So little girl, stay in your place and I will in mine. Have a good day. 

She has threatened to contact my college where I’m studying criminal justice and should be going into the academy next fall. Is there anything I can do regarding her trying to use her place in an agency to hinder my ability to get into the academy and find a job afterwards? I don’t know if I should contact her department or not, or if I should do anything at all. I have not replied to the message and have no intention to.",28Oct2019,1

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.

59,"Hello,

I have been living in a city in the rio grande valley (RGV) in texas for about the last year now with my fiance who is from a different town in the RGV. 

We have two options, to stay in the city area (Mcallen, Edinburg for those that want names) or to move to the country side where we can build a house on an acre of land that she has through family inheritance. 

Both of these cities are growing, and there's a lot of stuff to do there, but it is also more expensive to buy the houses there due to the area. 

The plot of land she owns is only 25-30 minutes away from those cities, but it is in a town where there is nothing. You have your Walmart/Food stores there, but recreational stuff is all in McAllen and Edinburg. 

We cant decide whether to stay in the city area, or build a house that is 30 minutes away in a small town where you still have all your necessities. 

TLDR: Would you buy a house in a city or move 30 mins away from it in a country and build a house on land that is in the family?",28Oct2019,1

64,"Hey all. So almost half a year ago, my parents agreed to financially help me pay for flight training. Fast forward to this weekend, they decided to back out. They claim that this is my career not 'ours' and they arent obligated to help me out. They were the ones pushing me to find a career and that they would help. Now, I do work a full time job however it is not enough to pay for everything on my own. And they know this. I'm feeling so many emotions especially because I did not suspect this from my parents. They helped my brother and sister through their financial needs.  I'm not sure how I'm going to make it on my own with all these financial circumstances...especially that I made the commitment and now I'm going to have to back out.

65,"This is a throw away and I’m worried about people realising who I am or who my friend is so I will keep details to a minimum.

So my friend [f] and me [m] were just watching Netflix in her bed after she’d just come home from a party and she was super drunk. I was mainly there with other friends but they’d left leaving just me and her and another friend who was out the room about to leave. 

About 10 mins into the Netflix session she turns to me and says 

“I have to tell you something”

I assumed this would be a drunk mumble or something so I said 

“Go for it”

she then pauses and explains how this boy who she’s been speaking to for a bit and they’ve been quite close intimately were doing the deed and she said to him 

“I don’t want to do this” 

and she moved away from him and she thought that would be that.. unfortunately it wasn’t the end. 
He told her how she did actually want it and she was just being a “bitch” and he proceeded to keep going, this was the extent of the information she gave me for the evening and I laid there shocked and she didn’t look too bothered by what she’d just said. She made me promise not to tell people but I’ve never had to give someone advice like this so that’s why I’m keeping details to the minimum.

About a week later we met up again with some friends and she took me to the side to talk to me about what she said, she provided more details about how she froze and didn’t know what to do, I tried telling her how she shouldn’t feel ashamed and if she needed to talk I’m here (the usual things you say to comfort someone) but the truth is I have no clue how to help her or give her advice because I’ve never had to do anything like that. 

I’m the only person who knows and she refuses to tell any one else in fear that they will judge her, I’m happy she told me because it means she has someone to talk to about it if she needs but I just need to know how I can help her, any advice is appreciated please.",28Oct2019,1
66,"(I made this as a throwaway account) 

Hi folks- I am 18 years old. I play baseball at a big ‘party’ state school (if you look up top 10 party schools it’s one of those) in the US- and I have never (like seriously never) been or attempted to get with a girl.

I am straight before y’all say something about if I’m sure I’m straight.

Yes it sounds crazy- a jock has an extremely difficult time talking to women. It’s just something that comes very unnatural to me. My parents- who have been married for 21 years never really showed affection for each other growing up so I was never exposed to it as a kid. 

In high school I just didn’t try because I was always doing schoolwork or working out for baseball. I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle a relationship with all the time I put into my extracurriculars.

Now, I’m in college about to rush a frat and have no idea what I am doing with women. It’s embarrassing now talking with my friends when the topic of girls comes up because I can’t really offer anything to the conversation.

I just really don’t know what to do because it’s definitely a matter of me overthinking things. Playing on the baseball team helps because people just assume since you’re able to compete at a high level in a sport that must mean you’re able to be very social and outgoing.",28Oct2019,1
67,"I (F20) am a current college student without beauty nor great social skills. From a young age, I was not allowed to experiment with my likes and dislikes. Therefore, I developed into a person whose motivation is dim and does not have any passion. In college, professors are eager to view your excitement into studies and scholarships are always asking for ‘passion’. Yet, I have none. 

For beauty, I also have none. Appearance is a very important factor. It affects relationships with anyone, either a significant other, family member or stranger. Even though I lost 30 pounds, my face is filled with chubby features. My body and face, a built of a man. When I settle with my appearance, I can easily converse with anyone. But, confidence is still lacked. When I remember my “ex” friends, my family members and other people’s comments, I’m just an ugly and fat person. A person who will never attract others for love nor joy. Just a person that can “help” you with your homework. 

Yet, I met a person. His heart is kind, his being is humorous and whose thoughts prevail my expectations. He would like to meet up. Yet, I quietly refused. Even though I told him about my nerves and insecurities, he would like to see me. How can I boost my self-esteem? How can I have the courage to meet him? I asked for advice from my cousin to help me with my appearance, it just turned into a therapy talk. I asked for help from my friend, she just told me to be careful. 

I have no women role models. No one to confess to. Even though I’m 20, I lack in so many departments. I’m trying slowly to overcome my fears, but the dark root is held within my appearance. Help me?",28Oct2019,1
68,"I started boxing a year and a half ago. It’s been a wild ride. I wanted to join my university’s boxing team 2 years ago. I was ready to try out until I broke my foot. I then tried out the following semester and I was rejected. So I worked hard over the summer and last year I was accepted. I went abroad last winter and kept working hard and eventually reached my goal of making the A team this fall. I’ve had so many different coaches and different sparring ( fighting someone but going 50-80% as it’s just practice) partners, but I can firmly say that I have never been in a better position to succeed than right now. I love my coach, I think he really wants the best for me, I have so many different sparring partners, and I could compete if I wanted to.  Beyond that, there are some great things that come with my position. First off, I love that I am challenged every single practice. Secondly, it is a great way to meet people. Thirdly, I was never on a sports team in high school, so this makes it up for me. 

That said I feel like I’ve never wanted to quit it more than right now. I have really just not gotten what I have put in to boxing in terms of joy. I started weightlifting in the summer but I have since stopped it due to practicing a lot and trying to lose weight. What I loved about weightlifting was that it was an immediate feel of achievement each time I set a personal record. I could see my self improve. I also did yoga and I loved how it challenged me as well, and I felt so much more comfortable seeking a challenge in terms of getting deep into a pose. I don’t feel that same way with boxing because challenging myself usually involves me getting punched a lot.  I love the feeling after practice is over, but I do dread practice. I’ve had issues sparring recently, and I just don’t feel as confident sparring. 

So I’m in this conundrum where I’ve got one foot in boxing and one foot out the door. It’s a lose lose position for sure. It’s hard for me to give up boxing, and I’m not sure if I’m just in a rut. I also feel like if my boxing journey were a movie, right now would be the the lowest point, right before it gets better. 

I would just love some input. There’s not really a question here.",28Oct2019,1

Hi. Theres a couple things I've been needing advice on for a while and I'm hoping someone can help me. About a year ago I began having shoulder pain. There was no trauma or sudden injury, it just slowly got worse. About a year later my other shoulder began hurting as well although in a different way. Since then 6 months later I began experiencing pain in both collarbones, first the right then the left. Now all 4 hurt and i can barley do any upper body workouts. I've been to orthopedic surgeons and theyve said I'm strong and that they didn't see anything wrong. I've been told its because of my Posture (by back is deformed, upper back too flexible lower back not enough). I've also been told it could be a thyroid issue although it didn't seem like I had hypothyroidism at first glance. Im out of answers, everywhere I look I get a different or wrong one. Its the most frustrating thing ever to be called skinny when I literally can do anything about it. Help.",28Oct2019,1

73,"Ok, so i've never told anyone this or ever said it out loud for fear that it'll make it all too real. I suppose i just want to finally write it down and figure out if what i'm feeling is right or normal? (It's a memory that i've suppressed for so long so it's a bit jumbled).

I'm 29 now but when i younger, between the age of 7-9yrs old, i remember i was molested by my older cousin who i looked up to (he's 8 years older than me) Now, our families are pretty close and his younger sister and i were close, she was a few years younger than me but we'd play together. My siblings and i would regularly go to their house and we'd play games, one of which was hide and seek. I remember on one occasion, he told me to hide in the bed and proceeded to get into the bed with me before grabbing my hand and making me touch him. Anyway, this happened a few times before i refused to play that game. I must have known what was happening was wrong but never told anyone. 

Other times included him following me into the toilet and making me lit on his lap, thankfully, it nothing more happened but i remember feeling uncomfortable and trying to get away from him and he'd told me if i didn't, he'd tell my parents. I should'vt called his bluff but being a kid, i thought I'd be the one in trouble so i complied. This again happened a few times and i don't recall when but it all came to a stop.

Since then, i've had to see him a lot, he attended every family gathering, our families went on holiday together, we lived a street away from each other and when he saw me, he'd make polite conversation.

I should be angry, hate him, but i feel nothing towards him anymore. There was a point when i felt sympathy for him after his sister passed away but since then, all i have is indifference towards him",28Oct2019,1

The thing is that today on the beach, I found a small (6cm) glass test tube with a brown liquid in it. 
It was only half full. 
For some reason I decided to throw it so that it breaks because I just assumed it was some kind of perfume. 
So I smelled it and it didn't smell like perfume at all. It was a very strange and disgusting smell, something I've never smelled before. 
Now I'm really anxious that it could've been some kind of poison or a dangerous virus that now escaped. 
My common sense tells me that it could literally be anything as it came from the ocean and got flooded to the beach where I found it. I have no idea how long it has been out there but now I'm really concerned that I'm screwed because I smelled it. 
So my question is, if it is actually possible that viruses in test tubes could ever find it's way into nature like that and if so how? 
Should I worry now?

78,"Hi! So I have several problems right now but currently this is the one I dread the most: talking to my dad about living with my SO. 

So to give you a bit of background, I’m from a conservative Asian family. My parents are extremely Catholic and they’re very strict and somehow protective of the family image. Once, when I was in high school, my dad broke my phone in front of me all because he saw me talking to a group of boys.

I’ve been living in a city 7 hrs away from them for about a decade now though so it has never again been an issue until now. They pay for the apartment that I share with my brother but I’ve been paying the household bills. I’ve told them several times that I want to move out but they never took me seriously.

A year ago, I met my current SO. We’ve grown to like each other and we’ve made arrangements for me sleep at his place every once in a while. Soon, without actually planning and talking abt it, I was living there full time. For 6-7months I have been out of the apartment but I was still paying the household bills because I was scared to tell my parents. Recently though the amount has been increasing because my brother’s girlfriend has started staying in the apartment so I told him he needs to pay his share. Of course he went on tantrum (he’s a big douchebag and also one of my primary problems) and told me he’d tell our parents if I force him to pay his share. This has always been his tactic and I honestly was so sick of it that without thinking, I messaged my parents and laid the truth all out.

My mom’s reaction varied from being respectful of my decision to questioning everything to crying a lot and praying and repeat. I understand though. They raised us to be conservative and moving in before marriage was a big No for them. But I appreciate that she’s trying to respect my decision.

My dad on the other hand never replied. He goes online on Facebook and posts stuff but has never responded nor acknowledged my message. My mom told me that I should talk to my dad in person because it hurt him a lot and it’s not a decision that should’ve been communicated through text. He’s on his way to the city now to attend a conference and he’s going to stay at the apartment for tonight. I’m not sure how I’ll open up the topic. Since they’re very strict, we have never really talked openly about issues - everything gets swept under the rug. 

So I need advice how to talk to him. I don’t think I even have the courage to face him. How should I approach him? How do I say it without hurting his feelings? How should I respond if things get heated? What if he ignores me?",28Oct2019,1

She lives a few states away and recently flew into town for the weekend and she drove all of us (our other friends) a little crazy. She screams everything she says, has no regard for boundaries and is always on edge ready to pop off on someone who may accidentally bump into her at the bar. She was trying very hard to sleep with one of our friends who wasn’t interested, so In the middle of the night she took her top and bra off and tried to climb into bed with him. He told her no and she kept saying she was so scared to sleep by herself and was just being so rude. It woke me up and I told her to shut up and go to bed. He was so weirded out he slept with me the next two nights. 

Not to mention I have to drive ~3 hours to get her to and from the airport and she kept saying “oh, dinner is on me!” “I’ll treat you since you’re driving me” but never really did. She gave me about 1/2 the gas I used to cart her around.

NOW, she texted me asking my plans for New Years and I already started making plans with people and she asked if she can come. I don’t know how to tell her no.

88,"I’ve been best friends with her for almost 8 years now. We’ve been together through thick and thin. Now high school graduation is right around the corner. She doesn’t tell me about anything in her life. She didn’t tell me she was applying for out of state colleges, scholarships. Hell, even today I found out she was bisexual because i saw her mark that she was LGBTQ in her college application. She’s never expressed anything about it to me, and while i could not care whether she’s straight, gay or bi it hurts she didn’t tell me. I played it off like i don’t care, which doesn’t help my situation.

The only reason I now know that she’s applying for all of these schools is because her mom told me and i had time to get over how upset was i didn’t find out first hand from my best friend. I’m the last person in her life to get caught up on anything important, and when i do find out it’s from a mutual friend or her mother. 

I’ve tried to confide in her to hopefully get her to open up in the past. Recently i told her and another friend about a boy I’ve been crushing on. They only made fun of me because I’ve never given off the vibe that I’m interested in that sort of conversation. 

I feel like a fake friend, and somebody she doesn’t truly trust. it hurts a lot because I’d do anything for her. I know i can’t force a person to talk to you, but how could i try and convince her to tell me about her life?",28Oct2019,1

Im a 20 yr old female and I have been on birth control or SSRIs for depression since I was 13 years old, but I have NEVER been horny and have ZERO sex drive.

I feel so terrible because it has always affected my relationships and leaves me in tears all the time because I end up being told or feeling that I’m not being enough for my partner. 

I still do have sex as much as I can for them and try to be into it but it’s so hard to always keep it up. my current boyfriend recently was frustrated with me for once again my lack of interest in sex and told me that most guys see 50% of a relationship as sex, so how is this going to work? 

I’m at a complete loss, I even ordered horny goat weed off of amazon to try to increase my libido? Im perfectly fine with the idea of never having to have sex again and the only pleasure I get from it is feeling emotionally close. I get wet sometimes, but never orgasm. it’s just so bad that whenever sex is brought up or initiated by my partner I feel so much anxiety to perform right and make sure I act really into it. 

Has anyone felt like this and found a solution? Especially within relationships?

90,So on Saturday there was a big party and fast forward a couple hours past the party games and drinking comes this situation. I’m sitting on a couch and everyone is kinda winding down as it’s late and a girl sitting on the couch’s armrest looked uncomfortable so I asked if she wanted to sit next to me where there was room. She did and before she sat down I already had my arm up on the couch so when she sat down I adjusted a little and now it’s around her. She didn’t flinch or seem uncomfortable. She held conversations with me and others and was laughing and smiling so I moved my hand down onto her thigh and the same thing. She didn’t mind and wasn’t uncomfortable to my knowledge and never told me to stop or anything. Btw she had on those jeans that are ripped all the way up her thigh so I started running my fingers into the rips and under her pants and still the same thing she didn’t stop me. I never made contact with her vagina but I was pretty close on her thigh. She still didn’t seem uncomfortable but after a few minutes of this she moved my hand away and I never attempted it again but I still had my arm around her and my hand on her thigh. Later in the night after we both had moved to do whatever I sat back down next to her and this time I asked if I could put my arm around her and she said no and that was that. Nothing else happened and I didn’t push her for anything. Now come around to Sunday(today) and one of my friends is telling me that people are saying I sexually assaulted her? I was confused and a little upset. I’ve been trying to get some more information but haven’t gotten it yet. I will update if I do get some though. I just wanted some advice from the community on what I should do to stop a rumor like this or if it’s not even a rumor and I actually did sexually assault her.

At this point, I can’t see it getting any better - I wake up to hear fighting and go to bed hearing more.

Mind you, everyone they called was not on campus. I was not aware they were calling my other friends bc they stepped out into the hall to do it. I went to check on them bc I noticed they left and asked if they were talking about me and they said they were dealing with boy trouble... I’m like ok... then my roommate texts me screenshots of the texts that the girls I was with were texting her and to sum it up they said I was passed out on the couch and that she should pick me up.. I call her to clear things up and my roommate is like “wow you can talk? They made it seem like you were black out drunk”. I then clear things up with the two other people they texted. The girls who texted them had no idea I knew what they had done.

117,"I’ve been working for Company A for 18 months, and recently they told the entire staff the business would be closed permanently. They gave us 4 weeks notice. I found another job with Company B. It’s similar work, a 30 minute drive away. Company B were very happy with me, but could only offer me the occasional shift for the foreseeable future. It was better than nothing, and I really loved the environment; management were respectful, and the work was more rewarding.

2 days before Company A was due to close, the staff were told they were “saved”, and the business would close for 3 weeks, then reopen. However, the saviour was a donation, and the problems that got them in financial trouble in the first place have remained, so at a guess, it will go belly-up again in 10-12 months or less.

I’ve continued my work at Company A, and Company B offer me as many shifts as they can, but I have to turn them down sometimes as it clashes with shifts A have me down for. I have become more and more frustrated with A, as I’m treated like a fool, even though I have more experience than the manager and other 2 senior staff combined. I’m pulled up on minor things that are irrelevant, but also blamed for other people’s mistakes. When I try and explain it isn’t my mistake, I’m made to look like I’m trying to pass the buck. The other senior staff are good friends with management, and have made major mistakes, without reprimand. I’m spoken about poorly behind my back, other staff have noticed and mentioned it to me. Even my medical condition, told to management in private, has been brought up in front of staff. The urge to leave is strong. The reason I stay is the regular hours, and a sense of obligation. 

Company B have just offered me 2 permanent shifts a week, with the possibility of more. I’m treated with respect there, and it’s been hinted that a management role may be in my future. It seems like a no brainer, right? Company B treat me better, and are less likely to fall in a hole in 10 months. But there’s more to it...

My husband and I are about to buy a home, and switching jobs means another 6 months before we can apply. Also, Company A have 2 staff taking leave this month, and need me to stay to cover for them. Without me there, they’re screwed. Taking the job at B is basically signing me up for a whole heap of drama from A, and the town in a small one... 

I have to make the decision today; to stick with a less satisfying job that may die soon, or go with one I love, hold off in the house, and prepare for major fallout. Reading back through this, the decision looks easy on paper, I don’t know why it doesn’t feel that way..",28Oct2019,1

125,"CW: self harm 

I am not going to get too much into my background story, but basically, I am covered in self harm scars and it’s really hard for me to live with them. 

I do understand that this is something I’ve done to myself. But there’s a major disconnect for me between the action and the consequence. Without getting too much into it, I have never self-harmed sober. It has always been something that has happened whilst extremely intoxicated. I think it was something that drunk me did in order to feel *something* 

Anyway though, I have been “clean” from self harming for about a year and a half now, but it is really hard to me to accept my scars. Although most of them aren’t visible (legs and shoulders) I do carry some pretty nasty ones on my arms. 

I *know* it doesn’t really matter what other people think of me, but at the same time I feel like people immediately discredit me when they see them. I feel like people immediately make judgements about me based on that, and honestly, it really  bothers me

Also, I am studying to be a teacher, and quite honestly, it is not something I want my kids to see. I don’t even want them to see that and understand it as an appropriate way to solve their problems.

Both would be amazing experiences. On one hand I’ll have these amazing memories with my family that’ll I’ll cherish forever. One the other I can literally live in another country for 5 months for extremely cheap. I feel like either way I’m giving up an amazing transformative experience. Just as a side note my family is extreme close knit and all of my favorite memories are on vacations we’ve taken so that is swaying me a lot. What would you do if you were me?,28Oct2019,1

129," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

Recently we asked this friend to watch our home and dog while we left for the weekend. We have a small amount of emergency cash in our home and he and our step son are the only ones who knew where it was located. We check the amount prior to leaving and noted a large sum (about $250-$300) was missing. We got suspicious and bought a camera to ensure our home and pets were cared for while gone for the weekend and to possibly see if our friend was the one taking the money. We caught him red handed on camera stealing nearly $50 from our emergency fund. Now we are pretty certain he is to blame for the remaining $250-300 that is missing as well. 

Can relationships be mended after this amount of betrayal and disrespect? How should I approach him? 

The last time he watched our home we found a condom wrapper in our kids bedroom.... we talked about it and fixed it and our relationship has been fine ever sense but I just can’t believe he would stoop to stealing from some one he knows and ‘loves’.

You know how everyone says don’t live with your friends and you and your friends think that you’re the exception to that rule?

Yeah. 

Myself and my three best friends moved in together in the beginning of August. There’s 3 bedrooms, but 4 of us so two of them share a room.  Prior to this, I lived with one of them for 2 years - let’s call her L (we were roommates our freshman year. Didn’t know each other before) and we lived together great. We were best friends and rarely spent a moment apart. We lived with two other girls this time and one moved out for her boyfriend and the other for her sorority. We decided to move in with our other two friends - let’s call them G and W. L and G share a room and bicker/fight constantly. W and L (excuse my French) have their heads up each other’s asses so bad it’s insane. This means that if L and G bicker, W takes L’s side no matter what and vice versa. I try to mediate and end up pissing off whoever’s “side” I don’t take. I have really bad anxiety and I come from a home where there was a lot of yelling/arguing so this makes my anxiety so bad that there will be days where I can’t eat and even days where I get physically sick. I feel like my relationship with L has changed so much that it will never go back to the point that it was at. It almost feels like she replaced me with W. On top of this, I want to get a dog or cat to help with my anxiety (both my dogs have died recently and they were the biggest source of relief when it comes to mental illness for me) but W is allergic to cats and for some reason L is vehemently against me getting a dog (she loves dogs and we’ve considered getting one in the past but I genuinely think she just likes to say no to anything I want all the sudden). So I want to move out because 
A. The fighting
B. I want an animal
But i don’t know how to say “I wanna live on my own” without them hearing “i hate you and that’s why I want to move out and I don’t know how to say “part of the reason I’m moving out is so I can get a pet without them hearing “I would choose a cat over you any day of the week”.  I love them all but none of them are able to have difficult conversations and I think that’s integral if you want to live with friends. I don’t know what to do. Please help.",28Oct2019,1

Okay, so I need some help. I'm not suicidal by any means. My life is great, and I'm not depressed or anything. I have a cat and he's the best part of my life (no offense, I just like animals more than people). Nothing's wrong.

I just don't want to live. 

Life is hard but ultimately useless. I'm a tiny speck in the massive universe that has no end. If I die, who cares? I mean my family and friends will, of course, but I mean, does it REALLY matter? No. It doesn't. Now, I'm not going to kill myself or anything, so you don't have to say ""life is worth it! It'll get better!"". I don't care about that bullshit. My feeling don't matter and neither do yours. 

If the earth exploded, 🤷 it doesn't MATTER. These are just my opinions so plz don't attack me. All I want to know is why? Why do I feel this why and why does know one else?

If I hurt someone s feeling enough to where they won't let me make it better (it's happened to me before, I still don't know why she was upset) who cares? We're all gonna die. It doesn't matter if we're friends or not. I don't need anyone in my life. But I still want them. It's so weird. I don't know what's wrong with me. There's no reason to be alive right now. But if I were to kill myself (hypothetically. I'm not ok?) I wouldn't jump of a bridge or hang myself, I'd just take one of those pills or something idk. I'd want my family to know that it's not their fault and I wasn't depressed, I just don't care. 

Again, I'm NOT going to do anything.

But seriously, I could murder someone and it wouldn't matter 🤷. 

It's not worth my time to live. But I care too much on my family's and friends feelings, that I would never do anything.

Honestly though, if I had know one. I'd totally be dead by know, not joking.

I literally have no friends, I can't seem to connect with people at all. I don't like being on my own, I prefer being with a lot of people and socializing.

142,"Hello advice givers,

This all happened 6 years ago. 

Let's call my friend Mel, me and Mel were good friends in high school but she was a user and quite selfish as a friend. She didn't make real connections with people, rather used them as props. She would never do something she didnt feel like doing to just be a good friend. For example, she didn't come to my birthday even though I really wanted her to and asked her about it multiples times. She said she had to work which I later found out to be a lie, she just didn't want to go. It actually ruined the whole night because I was in a new area and didn't know many people, it made me feel alone.

We went to the same college, however she would never want to meet up. I asked her for coffee about 3 times and she cancelled last minute each time, the 4th time I decided I was done with her. She had made, new shiner friends and that was fine. 

The next week, her father died. She called me, upset, wanted me to see her. I put everything aside, covered my shift at work and used my last dollar to drive 2.5 hours to see her. I text her in the morning ""when do you want me to come over?"" I wait all day, until about 4 pm, the reply is ""sorry was super busy, cant meet today"". I understand it's a hard time, so I leave it. Later, I see on instagram she is at the local bar. She chose to go to the bar with someone who lives in her area rather than see me who drove all this way for her.

The next week was the funeral. I have no money to do the drive again and I feel like she wouldn't care if I came or not at this point. So I don't go.

After this, we never spoke again. I wished her happy birthday for a few years ( at the time I felt like I was being the ""bigger person"" ) to no reply. I had no idea Mel was pissed about me not going to the funeral until I heard though the rumour mill she was complaining about what a bad friend I was, years later. 

What really frustrates me is that I look like the bad guy. I mean her father died, that's terrible. Any decent friend would go to the funeral right? 

This weighs on my mind at times as nothing was said or spoken about. I don't feel like I can explain myself without giving Mel a list of reasons why she was a bad friend first.

145,"Hi r/Advice Redditors, 

&amp;#x200B;

An extended family member of mine is at rock bottom right now and I could use some help on how to best pull him out of it given the situation/resources available. 

Situation:

* Early 50s male who's career entails construction management (cabinets/flooring jobs here and there). 
* Two special needs kids that are 14 years old
* TX resident recently became jobless and then evicted from home for not paying rent. Thanks to my Uncle him and his children will have a place to stay at our expense until he can get on his feet. 
* My Uncle intends to assist in rehabilitation, but is strained himself and cannot be there all the time to help coach him up. Him and his family have an already difficult life and caring for this family member will certainly test his marriage/household. 
* Family member and kids recently moved into new space. His old space was like an episode of hoarders. He is depressed, and you can tell based on the shape his car and house that he has been for some time now. 

Advice I could use help with from reddit:

* He's is depressed and in his early 50s. I'm sure he hasn't seen a doctor in years. He's overweight and likely as risk of serious illnesses that could shorten his life. My family and I believe we need to get him fully evaluated and on some anti-depressants. What would be the best way to move forward with this? The closest major metropolitan is Houston, TX. 
* His children who were adopted in his more prosperous days have special needs, but have not been tested and cared accordingly from what we can tell. One child has epilepsy and does receive care for that. They do have Medicaid to help with that, but what else could be done for these children? 
* Since the children are special needs, he brings up needing to be home with them so he can care for them. How can he reboot his life with a job and what not if cannot leave the kids alone aside from sending them to school? Advice here would be appreciated. We were thinking he could do like amazon delivery routes to earn money and have flexibility. 
* He likely has debt. We're thinking credit checks to see where he is at and do some sort of debt consolidation. We would of course take ownership of his financials as well until he can get situated. Any advice here? 
* At the end of the day, we cannot do everything for him. How do you motivate someone who is so depressed would likely commit suicide if it wasn't for their children?

Now, I want out. I feel like the industry as a whole lacks genuine connection between people. Friends aren't really friends. People turn on eachother based on rumors rather than working out differences. And everyone talks s**t. There are definitely plenty of good things in the industry and I'm very thankful for all the experiences I've had, but I'm just not happy. 

It's toxic and gross and I want a better life. I want to travel the world with my wife and family. Spend more time with my real friends (none of who are industry). I want to work towards developing real wealth and comfort in life. Something very difficult in the bar world, even as an owner.

- Ren and I like each other, so I might be bias 
- everything that happened is confirmed by both sides 

So my friend Ren, used to be best friends with this girl named Marie. And they hung out everyday in the summer. And then for some reason Marie cut off all communication with Ren. Marie then started hanging out with people that have been nothing but awful to Ren in the past. Ren struggles with mental health issues, so she instantly blamed herself for the distance. Ren’s birthday was coming up, and she was throwing a party, and even though Marie had ignored her for about a month now, she decided to invite her to see if she could fix their friendship. When Marie showed up to the party she only stayed for 3 mins and then got a group of girls to leave and goto a movie. And basically dip on Ren. While Marie was with the other friends she talked shit about Ren, calling weird. Come to find out the reason Marie distanced herself is because Ren and her got really drunk and Ren gave her head. Which made her uncomfortable. She texted me today asking for forgiveness (as I was mad at how she treated Ren). She also mentioned how her new friends exclude her.

Me (16M) has a friend of about 3 years (19F). We are very close and talk about pretty personal stuff. She messages me today that she is in a very tough situation and has no idea how to get out of it, thus why I come to this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier today,  unbeknownst to anybody, she went on a online dating website geared towards finding/being a sugar daddy (she frequents tinder, has never sent nudes before, and has had light relationships with others). This was a huge and very unexpected step for her. She managed to find somebody, and over time with talking to him (she has not told me explicitly why she did the things that she did, only that she did them) send him her banking information (probably to do with the 'sugar' daddy stuff), stripped and masturbated to him over FaceTime (he claims that he did not know and was not recording her) and therefore gave him her phone number. 

&amp;#x200B;

He threatens to tell her parents, and tells her he knows who her dad is. He claims he did a reverse phone lookup and found his name. It is just a matter of time before he gets her number. The reason he wants to tell her dad is that he does not believe that she is over 18, though she even send a picture of her ID. This means that this person also knows her home address. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest reason she can not tell her parents is she can not afford to lose their trust. (She comes from a fairly strict east-Asian household and a highly competitive high school on the east coast). I proposed to her that, though she would not like it, she should just tell her parents. She has already locked down all of her bank accounts so this person can not socially engineer his way into them; she has also de-activated her dating website account. 

&amp;#x200B;

She feels that she was sexually assaulted because the person on the FaceTime told her that if she did not do whatever he asked her to do (over camera), he would call her parents. What can she do here? Is the safest/wisest option to come clean with her parents and then contact authorities, banks, etc. or would it be to sit still and figure stuff out with him/with herself.

161,"First of all, this is a xpost from r/relationship_advice I just want as much help as possible. 

 

I just recently starting dating someone (F21) and she is AWESOME. The absolute best girl I've ever been with, she goes above and beyond for me in so many ways. She is empathetic, patient, and an absolute dime. We've only been together for a month or two so maybe I've just got on rose-colored glasses but I don't think so. She has blown every other girl I've been with out of the water. She makes me feel validated and is obviously proud to be with me. She doesn't hesitate to praise me or talk me up. But I'm becoming really worried because of how I react to things.

Usually, I'm a pretty calm and collected guy. I mess up every now and again and get butthurt/irrationally upset at things but, for the most part, I'm good at taking jokes and just getting along with people. However, every single time I get involved with a girl I end up taking things so much harder. I think the root of a lot of my issues comes from personal insecurities that only seem to surface when I get in a relationship. I get upset at all kinds of things that don't even make sense. I would give examples but they are so ridiculous sometimes that it actually embarrasses me to confess to them.

I struggle with jealousy and trust. When I become upset I don't get angry or anything, just sad. Sometimes I will react by pouting or just going silent. A lot of the time I KNOW that I'm being irrational. I KNOW that if one of my friends were to say/do the same thing that she has done I wouldn't care at all or I'd joke back. When she does it though... I hyper analyze it. I become obsessive about it, sometimes for hours. I try to get it out of my head, I'll go to the gym, call a friend, do homework and many other things. None of it makes it go away.

I've noticed that the only way I can really quell these insecurities is by addressing them. I hate addressing them though. It makes me feel like a burden. It's like I will realize that I need to just drop it but I can't and the longer I let it simmer the more I start rationalizing my feelings. Or making excuses for something that 100% should not be bothering me. Like I said, she's phenomenal so she hasn't given me any indications that she's giving up on me or anything. I just know that I'm going to inevitably to push her away if I don't get a handle on my emotions.

So Reddit, how do I drop things that shouldn't bother me? How do I muster up the strength to joke back with her instead of taking it so personally? What do I need to do to control my emotions and reactions? Why do I only seem to get this way when I start dating someone?",28Oct2019,1

165,"I (30M) recently was \*fired\* from my job as a graphic designer at a creative agency in NYC. I've consumed many of JP's lectures and I'm currently reading 12 Rules. I've changed a ton this past year mostly relating to self-responsibility (ie gym, finances, self-worth) and I feel more confident than ever. The job I had was uninspiring and my body language definitely said so. When I was confronted, I listened, stayed calm and collected, but also was extremely blunt. My manager/Art Director didn't seem to fond that I was being blunt and honest about the project. After a few more attempts to motivate myself, I just couldn't fake it any longer - which ultimately lead to my dismissal from the project, which somewhat caught me off guard.

I've been having a lot of wild mood swings from pure joy, to extreme anger, to blissful excitement. I feel like I'm a ""shitty person"" for getting fired and I feel ""betrayed"" by my coworkers who I saw as ""friends"" (which is somewhat flawed).

I feel like I'm walking into the unknown without any ground to stand on - I feel invincible and fragile at the same time. Do you guys have any advice or wisdom in a situation like this that could help me coupe with this weird point in my life?? Cheers y'all",28Oct2019,1

I’ve known I was gay for a really long time, but I’ve never really worked up the courage to tell anyone since I live in a conservative small town and I don’t think I’m ready to hear some of those reactions. I do think most of my friends at least suspect I’m gay though, since I have a naturally feminine demeanor and flirt a little with guys anyway. Except this one hot straight guy, who I don’t know what thinks about me because what could be his advances either seem like weird “straight guy gay jokes” that are supposed to be funny or just some way for a confused and horny teen to express his urges. Other than that, he’s really nice to me with random little things and has asked to hang out a couple times. He’s gotten close physically when we sit together and has “playfully” hugged me from behind, which I thought was a pretty clear sign he liked me at first, but now I don’t know because a lot of straight guys do weird close physical things like that to me and act like it’s just a joke or something. I’m developing feelings pretty fast but I know he’s straight (or at least that’s what he’s been identifying as) and I think if I continue to hang out with him I’ll get myself into something that will be too painful to get myself out of.

168,"Apologies for a long post. Trying to describe the situation and vent at the same time. I am at a bit of a standstill on my current situation. On the morning of Thursday October, 24th my younger sister's 3 month old, deaf, Pitbull puppy went missing. We live in a motorhome-type area that has two entries to three main small streets so the community in here is pretty closed in. Her puppy Nala is an all white, possibly albino, Pitbull and she's also deaf. She is small enough to crawl under the gate outside our house to get out but she never walks around on her own. If she gets out she stays right outside the gate barking for someone to let her back in. She's not house broken yet so we started leaving her outside in the mornings while my sister is at school and my dad and I are at work, most of the time my mom is the only one home in the mornings. She disappeared and my sister put up fliers almost everywhere in a mile radius from our area and no answer until this morning on Sunday, October 27th. Some guy mentioned that he has our pup and described her in a way the picture on the floor wouldn't allow and that he lives in Delano which is about 30-40 minutes away from where we live. My sister and the guy started talking about returning Nala and at first he didn't want money and sister insisted. Slowly he started asking for money and meet at our house but that is too sketchy for my taste and we insisted on meeting half way or picking Nala up ourselves. Where we stand now is he is demanding money to be wired to him but we have no confirmation that we won't get scammed out of $500 that he's asking for. I am upset, mad and feeling defeated. We now know she was stolen and sold elsewhere and there's not much we can do about it. My sister contacted the police and they are filing a theft report with the information she has of him which is just the name of the city and a possible fake name he have her. If there's anyone who has dealt with something similar to this, do you have any advice on how to resolve this issue?",28Oct2019,1

(Which is no fun.)    
 So yeah is there some kind of way to kill bedbugs if there's any chance that they're on my guitar. And no I am not going to inspect it to see if I can find and kill it.

3.through friends/family sisters etc. Sadly all my sisters friends are in a relationship or have kids or not interested at all in dating and my they don’t really hang out with anyone these days they kind of keep themselfs to themselfs also through friends don’t work I’ve never been introduced to a girl by my sister or friends if anything they cramped my style

4.bars/clubs I’ve tried this! All the women are in groups with their boyfriends or men they are close with normally 2 guys and 2 women and never see a women alone ever and I’ve even tried not trying to see if a girl came and approached me and nothing happened left disappointed

5.hobbies/group events sadly no one my age is doing this and mostly it’s guys that are doing this and people go with who they know I can’t keep joining group events to hope to get close to a girl (which in my opinion will never happen)

 .

I love my grandma, she's a sweet and caring person. The issue is that she does not like to do a damn thing around the house. 

.


My mom, two sisters and I live with her. After my mom's divorce she wasn't exactly financially capable to live on her own with three children. 

.


Some back story, even before we've moved in she has been absolutely awful about keeping her house clean. Every time we would visit it would be a complete and utter mess. Not necessarily trash but she is an extreme hoarder with literally the most complete random bullshit.

.


Boxes full of anything she could find at a thrift stores or anywhere else. Dishes piled up. Anything that could be a mess, would be. When we moved it we actually made it livable. Moved a bunch of her junk to the shed- which might I add is about the size of a house and almost completely full of a bunch of crap she's just thrown in there and forgotten about.

.


Now, there are four of us, not including my little sister who is with us half the time and her dad the other half, and three rooms. My grandma has a room, which I might add again- completely trashed. My mom has a room which she keeps decent most of the time. Then there's the other room which use to be my room. Until I moved over 1,000 miles away then it turned into my sister's room, which is also full of my grandma's bullshit hoarding mess.

.


So, I sleep on the couch. This wasn't much of an issue when I wasn't working because I would keep the house tidy and we didn't have a dog yet. By no means am I saying it was always clean, but it would never get bad like it is now. This is where the issue is coming.

.


She works, she is capable of cleaning. She is able to help us when we clean but the thing is that she DOESN'T. Once in a blue moon will she do the dishes. We will all be cleaning together, while she just lays on the couch and watches TV or she will run to her room and lay down back there. Not even trying to put an effort into cleaning. 

.



I finally have a job, my mother works, and my two sister's go to school, and my grandma works. Nobody is ever home but she decided to get a puppy. A mixture of Australian Shepherd and German Shepherd. If you don't know that's a very active dog. 

.


The thing is, she didn't ask us how we felt about it. Which is perfectly okay, it's her house. Here's the issue. She expects US to walk him, US to clean his shit and piss off the floor AND keep the house clean while she just lays on the couch all day. 

.

She doesn't take care of this dog. She forgets to feed him. She doesn't play with him. She doesn't know how to take care of dogs. She yells at him for jumping and wanting to play even though he's a puppy and just wants love.

.

 I do it because no animal should have to go through that. I'm the one taking him out to play, giving him food, training him to do things. Even though I had no say, this poor dog doesn't deserve hatred or a shitty life. My mom is pissed she got the dog because we ALL knew this would happen. She's had dogs taken from her because she can't take care of them. 

.

He's an active dog and nobody gives him attention but me. He can't go outside because he's still a puppy and it gets really hot where we live so we can't just leave him outside while all of us are gone. 


.


My mom works over 40 hours a week and I work over 30 hours a week. Her longest shift is at the most 10 hours and that's two times a week TOPS. The rest are 8 hour shifts and sometimes 5 hour shift, which I understand, she's older. She has bills to pay, but we all do. 

.


What makes me resent her is that our house is covered in shit and piss from the dog because he can't go outside if we're all gone ALL day. I have to sleep in the living room and I literally can't because it smells so fucking bad. It's absolute bullshit.

.


 She gets off work, lays on the couch till late at night when I should be sleeping for work and then whenever she decides she wants to sleep, then she'll go lay in her bed and finally I get to lay down. 

.


I'm starting to resent her. I appreciate that she gives us a roof but what's it worth when I dread coming home after a long day of work just to sleep in a piss and shit covered room. 

.


What's a house worth if I don't even have a place to put my clothes and other belongings? What's it worth when I have to go to work with an aching back because I have to sleep on this uncomfortable couch every night? 

.


My sister tells me I need to be thankful but does this one thing really outweigh all the bad? Does it? I know it could be worse but I think telling me she gives me one basic necessity should overrule all the bullshit she does is almost the same logic as telling someone that ""well their your family so you have to love them"" even if they're toxic as fuck.",28Oct2019,1

Im a second year college student, I've had an eating disorder for the past 3-4 years, I have no family I can trust, and I've been mentally occupied with an abusive ex boyfriend who cheated on me for about a year now. I feel such consuming anxiety and depression every single day of my life. As soon as my classes are over, I walk to my car and smoke weed. I know I've been using this to fill a void in me but I'm not sure I know what that void is. I feel like theres a heavy boulder on my chest and it makes it harder to breathe and I've felt this same feeling since primary school. It comes and goes at times, sometimes (usually when I'm starving myself and losing weight and a relationship I'm in is going good) I feel happy and content with life. But 95% of the time I feel like the biggest failure ever and I should just commit suicide. I can read this back and just tell myself to get over it and I'm being a drama queen but this is how I feel 24/7 and the only times I can escape it is when I'm smoking or sleeping. I know if I just get myself into a cycle where I'm getting up early, going to every class, eating healthy, going to the gym I'll feel so much better and wont feel so down all the time. I just can't make myself get into that cycle and every time I do I eventually burn out after 2-3 weeks. I know these substances aren't making it better overall but it just kind of feels like I don't have the drive to pull myself out of this miserable situation and I'm constantly looking for crutches. It hurts even more when constantly looking at how often my ex looks at my profile or comparing myself to his new girlfriend or seeing how much time they spend together  just constantly having thoughts about it. I just feel like a complete letdown all the time and its causing me to be antisocial. I don't really talk to people at uni because I feel like I'd be socially awkward and I also feel like we wouldn't really have anything in common/we'd be fake friends.

192,"I'm a sophomore in college, and over these past few weeks I've developed this weird problem. I'm normally a good student who likes class, but now every time I'm in my classes I get really nervous. Something about being surrounded by all my classmates and being unable to escape without missing notes really stresses me out. I get really hot and sweaty and my arms and legs go numb. My stomach feels sick and I get this tingling feeling in my hands and face. The worst part is the shaking, which is completely uncontrollable. I know that other people notice, because I've gotten a few ""You alright, man?""s from people. This makes me feel worse, because it feels like everyone's watching me freak out. I wouldn't call it a panic attack or anything, because I'm always in control of my breathing, but it's definitely a horrible feeling to have every time you're in a class.

As a result of this, I've started skipping my classes, pretty much all of them. I never intended to do it, but the idea of losing my shit in front of everyone made me so nervous. And the more classes I skipped, the hard it's become to return to them. I have no idea how to handle this. I thought of lying about a relative's death to explain the absences, but that feels really shitty. I thought of explaining the situation to my nicest professor, but I don't know how to do that because I know it's irrational. And even if I do get the absences excused, how do I return to class without feeling sick?

I've spent fourteen years in school without having this problem, so I know that if I can figure out a way to get myself out of this mindset I'll be fine. Does anyone have any tips for forcing my brain to think logically about the situation? I've tried cutting out caffeine, because I've heard that helps, but that didn't do much for me. Has exercise helped with anxiousness, in your experience?

I'm pretty stressed out, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",28Oct2019,0
193,"So a few weekends ago my girlfriend had a party at her apartment. Her roommate's boyfriend's cousin came over at some point. He lives a few blocks away but that was the first time coming to the apartment. I don't know all the details but he commented to somebody that he thought my girlfriend was hot. The next morning everyone seemed to know about the comment and were kinda joking about it. Anyway, like two weeks later I notice him and my girlfriend recently became friends on Facebook. Obviously, I wasn't super pleased and I asked her about it. She said he friend requested her and she accepted because she figured it wasn't a big deal and she's one to add just about anyone on Facebook. She told me she was sorry if it came off the wrong way and she promptly unfriended him. I was pretty upset and told her I thought it was pretty fucked up that she accepted it and that he's not even friends with his cousins girlfriend of years and I asked her how she would feel if I did the same thing. She was apologetic but assured me it didn't mean anything. I don't know. I'm still upset about it and I worry it's a sign that she's prone to indiscretions. Any advice is appreciated.",28Oct2019,1
194,"And I just don’t want to — 

My Senior Year in High School and I’ve just gained this sudden weight of not caring anymore: my grades aren’t the best, I attempt to change but don’t, I just hate school now, my SAT score isn’t good at all — I’m a complete mess.

I had to work late tonight and forgot I had homework. And here comes my Mother of lecturing me, which I don’t mind the lecture; just the part of seeing how she is if I were to act this way when I’m in College.

12th grade has *somewhat* shown how College will be for me. And, for that, I don’t want to go. I don’t want to waste my time. I have learned who I am: someone who truly doesn’t care about school.

And I tell my mother this and she says “Well, you’re going! What you want to do, there’s no other option” which makes me even cringe even more that I am forced to go. When, I’m reality, I don’t want to go! 

I don’t have a ‘Plan B’ if I don’t go; I don’t have any type of experience or some sort of backup plan. I guess i have interpreted in my mind that if i don’t go, my life is meaningless and I won’t have any sort of experience with Computer Science/CyberSecurity.

And I see everyone around me having these awards, scholarships, acceptance, recommendation when I’m just being a free-floating amoeba. 

I want to go and experience life. I don’t want to waste my time on College. I’m ready for something real, something unique. I still want to try something with Computer Science/Cybersecurity, but I’m just totally drained of school and the shit that is associated with it.

195,"My other half just got a new job after not being employed for about a year (after her father passed). I want to be supportive and proud of her but 3 days before she applied for this new job, she had told me that the manager of this establishment is on trial for Sexual Harassment against multiple girls who already have been working there. 

This whole thing has been taking a huge toll on our relationship as she believes that I’m not supportive of her new job. She believes that I’m against her getting a job at all. 

I have never discouraged her from getting a job but I always advised her to get a job at a place that is safe and productive toward her future and her dreams. I’ve encouraged her to apply at many different places but she denies them due to fear of rejection. 

Today was her first day and she chose to withhold that she would be training under the same manager that had been accused of sexual harassment by multiple girls. 

I’m trying to be supportive and ok with this but I don’t know what to do or what to feel anymore. I understand that she can handle herself (as she keeps stating to me) but as her other half, I still feel resentment for this manager and fear that she may become just like the other girls who have had to encounter the sexual harassment. 

She doesn’t understand why I’m being so protective of her and I’m afraid that this might come between our relationship that has been going strong for 2 years now. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way?

I’m 19(M) and my gf is 20 (F)
We met with each other two summers ago at my workplace, we started hanging out and talking etc etc..
After a year, our relationship, to me seemed like it was slowly dying off, we weren’t having any fights or anything like that but just seemed a bit awkward at times. I started not finding her attractive so I suggested something “dangerous” knowing she would breakup with me, and the thing I suggested was VR sex.
Surprisingly she accepted it. So we started doing it, played VR sex games while having sex which was shockingly nice but she said she wasn’t getting any attention or any affection and said she also wanted to try it, being the dumbass person I am I tell her that I’ll help her get one by paying 50/50 she agrees and we keep having sex like this for a year now.

It’s not that frequent as before but we still do it.
Should we stop before anything bad happens or is it just messed up.

201,"My stepmom and dad to their credit, got me away from my also abusive stepfather, an action which was very costly to them and i am eternally grateful. 

However, as time elapsed after settling into my new life, she started to.. change. 

After her biological son moved in (Also 16M), everything seemed to change.

She holds me and my sister to extremely high standards for everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Grades, Cleaning, even our Timing.

If we aren’t up to her meticulous standards, she won’t say anything to us. She’ll just go and talk crap behind our backs to our dad and have him reprimand us for whichever heinous sin we have committed.

For example, if we have bad grades, we get screamed at, cold-shouldered and ostracized from the whole family. 

But what happens when her little angel son gets bad grades? 

Oh wait, he doesn’t. Because he’s online schooled and **SHE DOES ALL OF HIS WORK FOR HIM.**

I couldn’t care less that she does his work for him. i honestly couldn’t. But don’t do HIS work for him, then go and try to punish us and teach us about “Responsibility” when you do his work for him.

I can’t be the only one to see that this is nonsense. 

That’s just the tip of the iceberg, even worse, my sister, step brother and I, we all work at a facility that they both manage (they being my father and stepmom).

My stepbrother picks and chooses what days he comes in. Some days he’s “just too tired to come in” and they both just laugh it off like it’s some sort of joke.

But then my sister does the same thing, and oh my lord. Oh my oh my. It was a HUGE DEAL. “She’s lazy and this is completely downright disrespectful” Literally i’m not making this up. 

Me and my sister were given chores lists every weekend, no big deal, i don’t mind doing it.

But guess who is never expected to do anything.  Ever. You guessed it! Mr mommy’s boy himself. He’s never handed any task on these lists. He never does his own laundry, he’s never asked to do the dishes, he’s never asked to feed his dogs (But i get screamed at if i forget to clean my cats litter box for top up their food dishes), or clean up after his dogs when they shit all over the house, or anything of the sort. He has no sense of responsibility, work ethic or common decency.  

It’s not even just measurable stuff like that. If i call her when she’s out, i always get voicemail and i have to wait for her to callback. 

But him? First or Second ring always. 

For the record, i have nothing against my stepbrother. If I could get away with half the shit he does, i would do it too, believe me, i’m not going to lie to you and tell you i’m some perfect angel. Because i’m not. Far from it infact.

202,"I'm hoping for some opinions bc I've dealt with this for years now. Idk if my view of this is wrong.If my views have a point or what. 

A couple of my husbands family members went through his cell phone while on a visit,years ago. At the time I had a twitter connected to his. I ,at the time , posted links to this blog I used for creative writing (a lot of it was erotica). 

They found it and began reading it and I had no idea about it. I stopped using it or linking it on Twitter. I use a writers name not my real identity.

Eventually, I found out via a drama moment with a mentally disabled family member of his, they were following this blog bc they were discussing it in front of this person, and this mentally disabled family member blabbed it.

Eventually,I deleted the blog,the email,the ENTIRE account they initially began following and created another account altogether(which should have been the end of it).Completely different account.

They followed it as well.....I have created probably 10 completely different accounts-some what unlisted but public bc of a couple of readers I KNOW personally, who read it. They have directed ppl on their Facebook to it. They know I know all of this. They talk about it among themselves.

I could just shut it down by not using any platforms OR privatizing it[. So](https://completely.So),I understand that. My view is....they have followed me on every single account I have made.And I think it's [creepy. My](https://creepy.My) view is- do you have any thing better to do than follow me around from place to place? I think it's odd and obsessive they put so much effort into shoving their nose in my content to the point, deleting the original they found through snooping, wan't enough to solve [it.Is](https://it.Is) it just me or would any one else have a problems with this obsessive following?

204,"Not today, but last night I went to a Halloween party with my boss and we ended up going out to the bar, then back to her place for drinks with a few people.

The drinks with friends lasted about 30 minutes, and the whole time she couldn't take her eyes off of me. I think everyone in the room could tell what was going on too because when they were leaving they were all winking at me and laughing. 

When everyone left and the door shut, we were both standing there staring at eachother and she says ""so are we really going to do this?"" At that point I knew I was going to get my frik on.

We started making out as we headed to her bedroom, taking off our shirts and pants we fell on the bed and continued to make out. 

Out of nowhere she stops me and says that ""this can't happen"". I knew that second that I wasn't going to get my frik on. I didn't really question her because I had a gut feeling that she didn't want to put this inbetween our work relationship.

So I did the respectable thing and put my clothes on and went to the next room to sleep on the couch. Not even a minute later she comes to get me and says I don't have to sleep on the couch and brings me back to bed to sleep with her. After that everything went black and we both crashed hard.

In the morning we were both extremely hungover and had some laughs about the night but never really touched upon what happened between us.

Now this is the best I could piece together the story as I was wasted and I'm having troubles remembering what happened. So I texted her today and said ""sorry about last night"" she responded ""it's all good we were both really drunk"".

Now here's the stupid part, any reasonable person would brush this off and go along with their merry life but not me. I think I did something stupid to make her say ""we can't do this"".

Am I overthinking this or should I take it how it is?

I'm also nervous as hell to see her at work tomorrow, going to try to play it off all cool but knowing me I'll be awkward.

Edit: I thought I should mention I'm 26 and she's 36, she always bugs me because I'm so young to her. Don't know if this has anything to do with what happened but I thought I'd throw it in there.

205,"So, my brother, He was 17 at the time and I was 14(female). When he would babysit he would send me to bed extremely early and would get really mad if I got back up. I just thought he was being a jerk, until one day I learned what he was doing. My parents had gone through the kidlogger on my computer (which was in a family area) after not doing so for a while. And I was getting in trouble for watching porn. Except the thing is, I really was NOT watching porn. I'm 18 now and have no reason to lie about it, I could care less. But I tried to explain to my parents that it wasn't me. They countered by showing how there was porn right next to my email window, where chats were sent and received with my friends, also 14 year old girls. He was talking to them, reading my personal chats, his little sister, with his dick in his hand. They were never sexy chats either, which confused me, I was never that type of person so ""talk dirty"". I pretty much quietly cut him out of my life after he moved out. There was no confrontation with him because it would only be denial, and the emotional strain of trying to get others to believe me was unbearable.

When I found out about this, it was after moving away and losing contact with those friends, so I never had a way to tell them. Now though, I am in contact with one of those friends, who informed me that my brother had reached out to her a couple months ago trying to contact me because I refused to contact him. She doesn't know of what he did and I really don't know how to tell her, but with him trying to contact her I don't know how to approach it.

They are around the same ages as my kids so it’s been like a party everyday. And the way things are going I’m thinking their parents might lose their parental rights.

The other day my oldest foster kids asked what would happen to “David” their 12 year old brother(He went to the home of his fathers great aunt). The aunt said she’s told old (75) to raise him and will put him back in the system if the parents lost their rights. 

I made a promise to my son, 11, that if we took in children he would always we the oldest. We promised we would never take in a child older than him. And he does not want to give up being the big brother.

I told my foster daughter that David will find a good home and that we would stay in contact with him , but she REALLY wants me to foster him and potentially adopt him. 

One negative thing is that David has been arrested several times. I don’t know a lot of the details but he is not the best influence.


All these factors, my son losing is position as the oldest, David’s criminal history is leading to a big NO.

213,"TLDR; At the end

Hey guys. I’ve been a lurker here for some time putting my 2 cents in where I feel like I should. But now I believe I’m in a situation that I’m stuck on.

For context my sister is 6 months older than me, we have the same dad but she was adopted before I was born because her mom was in prison when she was pregnant and I’ve never met her in person.

Earlier this year, I got a message on Instagram from her saying “this might sound weird but I think I might be your sister” and I automatically knew it was her. My dad had told me I had a sister and she would be getting in contact with me, same name he told me and everything. she also had baby pictures of me and my brother to prove it.

She lives in a town 72 miles away, which is way closer than my brother (158 miles away) and I’ve only met him 3 times.

When she found me I was overjoyed and so excited to finally have a sister, I had been waiting to meet her for years. So I called her and we talked for a long time. Mainly me, but she didn’t really give off that sisterly vibe if that makes sense?

When she calls me, I drop everything I’m doing so I can talk to her. She acts like I’m not even on the phone. She’ll call talk to other people in the back ground while I sit there and listen to their conversations until she says “hey pikachu0903 I have to go call my friend really quick.” Not to mention she’s very popular and is literally friends with her whole town, while on the other hand I’m an introvert that stays in the house and doesn’t care for most people.

She’s always to busy to talk to me on the phone or text me. She’s even come to my town a few times but hasn’t attempted to see me. She’d call me and say “hey I’m in (my town)” and is get so excited but then she’d say “but I can’t come see you I don’t have time. I’m only here to go to the mall and see my other siblings” then I’d feel heartbroken and wonder why she even called to tell me. I’d prefer she not even tell me she’s here if she can’t even come say hi.

Recently, I convinced her to play this game called PUBG with me on the phone. I know it’s kinda dumb but when we started playing we started bonding a bit more, and I actually started to really enjoy talking to her.

But one night recently I asked her to hop on and play with me, but as usual she said she was too busy and that she would play after 9pm. 9 o’clock rolls around and she didn’t even call or text me.

I didn’t hear anything until that morning when she basically said “I’m sorry and you can be mad if you want but I don’t have time to play games on my phone, I know I promised but things always come up and I don’t have time”

I said  that it’s not about the game, that I’m busy with school and work as-well but I still try to make time for her and basically told her everything I said above.

Then she said she’s in so many extracurricular activities she just doesn’t have time for me.

After that I just said whatever forget it I don’t really care. I’m kinda hurt and irritated but I’ll be okay. 

But last night I saw on her Snapchat that she went to a party and before that she was doing a lot of random stuff with her friends I got irritated again and messaged her to say.

“I’m sure you don’t have time for me though right”

And all she said was that she went to a party and she’s not gonna feel guilty for having fun and that I was bitching. Which I don’t want her too, but it’s the fact that she literally has time to do EVERYTHING but talk to me.

I told her I have the right to be mad, and that she’s not trying to listen to me. I told her I feel like I’m not important to her and that she puts everything before me &amp; that I don’t understand why she reached out to find me if she was gonna be like that towards me.

She said I don’t have the right to be mad because she didn’t do anything to me. Then that she was to tired and didn’t have time to listen to my shit. (Surprise surprise)

I said I didn’t care and she said it seemed like I ddI when I wrote a book (I typed a really long paragraph expressing how I felt)

That hurt my feelings so I said it’s because I really care about her but I felt like she didn’t care about me, I felt left out of her life.

She said she had to go, she’s always gonna be busy and I’m being over dramatic.

At this point I’m at a loss and I’m genuinely hurt, I have no one to talk about this to, and I’m not sure if I really am being over dramatic or what I should even do. I have no other family and when she found me it’s like I finally had a chance to have that.

TLDR; My sister found me on the internet but is to busy to ever talk to me, and says I’m being over dramatic for getting upset about it.",28Oct2019,1
214,"So these group of guys(previous) “friends” of mine ditched me which to that I said “fine whatever Ik they were fakes anyway it’s better for me” but now that I have joined a new group of guys they decided to start chirping us and shit. Calling us pussies and shit(even tho they call the cops at the first sign of trouble) which I don’t particularly like being disrespected but I can tolerate it without getting angry. Now the real question is what do I do? 1. The smartest answer would be forget about them. 2.Go fight them not because I am angry or anything. I just wanna put these little pussies in their place. They think they top shit I want everyone to see what pussies they really are. So they stop running their mouths.
Now they will get the cops involved if we do fight because that’s just how they are, the other issue is they won’t be the aggressors and will be acting in self defence, plus since they wanna be cool they will get people to record it. So they will see who started it.

215,"so original when we were friends he had no problems talking with me one on one, and just having small normal conversations. recently however he stopped talking to me, and when i try to start conversations he seems super uninterested/over it. it’s mostly annoying me because he still acts like we are decent friends around our mutuals and will use me as a talking point, when he never talks to me anymore. if he’s going to talk about me (positive or negative) he better be willing to talk to me.

i’m not sure why he would do this. i’m not that popular, so talking about me isn’t going to raise his social standing or anything. from what i hear he doesnt necessarily say bad stuff, my friends say it’s all good, so i really don’t get it.

since we have only been friends for like 4 months, i would be okay with showing my anger and frustration with him, but at the same time we do have lots of mutuals, and i will see him in my classes and i don’t want things to be awkward.

His friend likes to party. Once he moves things start to get out of hand. Tried to rein it in and I failed.  We have a hearing on Monday that they expect CW to show up to. 
CW told me to go in his place, that he had to do it before and it will be fine.

219,"My ex was my first love, we were together for 10 years on and off. After 9 years he finally asked me to marry him and we started planning our wedding. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted but I really couldn’t care cause I just wanted to be married to him.

Two months before our wedding he was arrested for something I had no idea he was involved in and it crushed me. I went through the stages of guilt from denial to anger and finally to acceptance. I stayed in contact with his family trying to support them, even after I had accepted that he was guilty because these were people I loved and cared for. They had accepted and welcomed me into their family. 

The week of my birthday, 8 days before what was supposed to be our wedding day I changed my number, deleted my social media and cut everyone off. I sent him a letter to tell him I knew he was guilty and wanted nothing more to do with him. It broke my heart even though the feelings of love I had for him made me sick to my stomach. He wasn’t the man I thought he was, he was/is a monster. 

Now I find myself having trouble moving past this relationship and trusting people. I’m not sure what to do, only a few of my very close family members and friends even know the real reason our wedding was called off. How do I move on and trust again?!",28Oct2019,1
220,"I’m 26 and after being attacked by both my brother and my father physically I left home and never looked back. It was hell on earth, I struggled hard, especially with my entire family turning their backs on me in an attempt to make me go home.

I made it though, I moved to my state capital and got my first apartment. But I can’t fully enjoy my peace because of my family.

They continue to call me and call my mother (one of only three members I still have contact with) despite me already saying I want nothing to do with them.

Nobody seems to understand why I want nothing to do with my family, I was the scapegoat, everything I did spread around the family, and shamed and dismissed for saying it was wrong that all three members of my family have physically assaulted me. 

I’m alone a lot now, but it’s worth it not to hear what’s being spread around about me and not having to be bullied into living my life a certain way. 

I feel like I can’t escape, I hate my family to be honest after seeing how they really were, turning their backs on me because I wasn’t doing what they wanted me to do, they now try to come back around like I’m still going to love them.

My father, the head abuser of all of this is a manipulative and very sneaky individual. I can have no contact with him because the smallest opening he can use, a text happy birthday, a phone call leads to him suddenly popping up at my job, or being up in my face, the call or text being leverage for his attempts at trying to get me back under his control. 

My family is abusive, they only treat me this way, other cousins and family members leading much worse lives than mine but they feel a need to keep me at home where I can be monitored and have someone up my ass 24/7.

I can’t take it no more, I feel paranoid now that they will pop up here and follow me now that I’ve cut off all my family to finally be rid of my father. What can I do to finally be at peace and forget everything that happened to me.

In my case everything I went through and losing just about everything I own in the process of cutting of toxicity meant something because now I sit in a new car, live in a great city and work a good job.",28Oct2019,1

222,"throw away because this is incriminating in my real life.

**tldr: I have a crush with a friend I can't be with and the feelings make it difficult to be his friend**

I have a massive crush on my best friend. It wasn't always like this, but the past \~6 months have been intense. I have no chance at being with him because he tried to get with my other best friend already (about 10 months ago). She liked him too, but things were too complicated (my girl best friend had personal issues) and it didn't work out. They were forced to get over each other and cut each other off unless they had to see each other through mutual friends. If I got with him my best friend would be livid, and I would feel horrible, so I decided to never pursue it. Here's the issue.

When he doesn't text me back I get sad, when he talks about other girls my chest hurts. I freak out over my outfits before we hang out to just chill in my room or eat fast food. I over think everything I say to him. When were watching netflix on my bed alone or eating at a fancy restaurant, I can't live in the moment because I'm wrapped up in how badly I want to romantically be with him. I cry half of the time after we hang out because I wish things were different. He's funny, charming, smart, fashionable, kind, fucking perfect. I'm head over heels for him. Sometimes I've dropped hints because of my lack of self control, and he never responds to them in the slightest. I have no clue if he feels the same way but won't say because of the same reasons, but I doubt it.

This weekend there's a party that he, AND my other best friend will be at (I'll be there too). If they get drunk and finally end up together, my world will shatter, but I need to outwardly show I am happy for them.

I keep telling myself that him and I are not going to happen and it can't happen. I know it's wrong, I know I have to fight it, and I try my best, but I can't make this crush go away. How can I cope with these feelings? I don't want to lose him as a friend.",28Oct2019,1
223,"So my husband and I are making a move across the country. We currently own a small apartment in the city and I’ve been super excited to live in a decent sized house. My husband will be working away most of the time (7 days away for work and 7 days at home). Recently my best friend decided that she wanted to move with us and suggested that we should all rent together until my husband and I find an area we want to buy a house in. 

I haven’t lived with friends for years but my best friend would be the only friend I would consider living with. My husband thinks it’ll be a good idea as it will save us money until we buy. 

I mentioned to my best friend that I’d love to live with her but I don’t want to give up the lifestyle I currently have (having my own space and having space for my husband and I) She was fine with this and suggested we find a place with a good sized master and 2 different living spaces. 

As I haven’t lived with friends since before I met my husband I’m curious what would be the fairest way to split the rent. My friend suggested to split it 3 ways but I’m thinking more of a 60/40 situation (she was quite against the idea)

We are looking at 4 bedroom houses, my partner and I will share the master, my friend will get her room plus a spare room for her home office and we all share the kitchen, laundry and the other spare room for guests etc but have different living areas. We will split utilities 3 ways (I think this is completely fair even though my husband will only be there half the time)

224,"This literally happened to me yesterday, I tried to explain a small joke that I had made about my relationship with my brother and she called me ungrateful and told me that I will never amount to any because I use people, meanwhile I was just trying to point out the fact that my brother said he'd do something small for me, but he didn't so I made a small joke about it.

She then proceeded to ge ahead and blame my father's side of the family for my ""attitude"" and they are the reason why I can never succeed in life, which is *rude*. My relationship may not be on par with them, but that's too far.

I told her that she was a hypocrite because when a kid threw me into a bench in high school after I told him to stop yelling racial slurs at me, she specifically told me not to blow this out of proportion even my life was in danger (I was admitted to hospital and I had to get stitches for my injuries) because I would be ruining someones life if I pressed charges for assault.

226,"So, I (37 bisexual female) have several mental illnesses and due to that (or rather mostly do to that) I am a nervous, anxious, awkward, walking hot mess.

I've been looking for work for months and finally found a really sweet gig working at a upper-scale-ish seafood restaurant.

I was training in the kitchen and chatting with my trainer, the kitchen manager (we'll call him Dave). Dave and I were talking about our families and he show'd me a picture of his son. Of course I do the ""Awww! What a looker!"" bit and then I get distracted by an order coming in. 

I turn back to Dave to ask him a question and he shows me another picture of what I think is him and a cat. I only barely glance at the picture but in order to not be rude and say ""Aww, what's her name?"" as I'm waking away.

Behind me I hear, ""Her? Oh, you mean..."" Then I was out of earshot.

Fast foward 2 days. It's Dave's day off. I'm out back smoking with a couple of the kids working in the kitchen and we're taking about San Francisco and I say ""The only thing I don't like about San Francisco is...""

One of the kids goes ""All the gay people?""

I say ""No. Of course not,"" and finish my thought.

So. I start thinking about that weird comment and how a few days ago I was talking about getting called a TERF because I don't think it's transphobic for a lesbian to not want to have sex with a trans woman. 

Then I realized that picture was not of Dave and his cat. I think he was showing me a picture of his partner and now because I am a bubble headed flake I look like a total fucking douche bag and I have no idea how to rectify this situation with grace or tact.

Please, please help me! I love my job and Dave is such a nice guy and we have so much in common that we could easily be friends in normal life and it kills me to think that he thinks that I am an adversary.

230,So hey all.. Im M18 and i really really need advice. Im feeling lost and im feeling down. Me and my girlfriend broke up 2 days ago it wasn't over something serious it was about us arguing a lot the past month. We've both been busy with school and I gotta work and get my driving license and we are in different cities so we only see each other every weekend. So we started arguing over small things we had a couple big arguments but we were okay. So the other day she uploaded a photo that i didnt like i wont get into details but we argued again and then from a small thing it became a huge one. She said she was done with relationships she didn't want anything to do with relationships and with love in general she wasn't done with me but was done with love. We spoke today i told her a few things that i didnt say when we broke up asked her to give me a chance to fix things but she didn't want. But she also told me that she wouldn't let anyone love her or love anyone herself wouldn't want anything to do with other guys. Then i asked her if she would call me to fix things even if she misses me slightly and she said she will. I also said that i hope someday sooner or later she realizes what we are loosing and that she would want us to be together again and she said that she hopes for that too. Then we told each other I love you  and we haven't talked since then. She is very special to me she is the first person who i open up to that much and the first person i shared so much with. We talked about everything from our darkest thoughts to marriage to the weirdest sex kinks and etc and I know for a fact that im very special to her. She wanted a promise ring for Christmas just last week she was looking at rings. And also wanted me to promise her that i would be there for her through thick and thin and that i would be there for her forever and that i won't ever leave her. She has problems with her family also her friends are not the brightest either so the only person she really talked about things was me. She's everything to me. So my question is do you guys/girls think we broke up for good? Do you think we would get back together? Should I just give her time so she would cool off? Im open to any kind of advice and opinion so please feel free to comment everything helps. And to those who read it all thank you so so much. ❤️,28Oct2019,1

233,"On Wednesday I started getting random messages from a fake account on instagram. These messages were from someone saying that they “stole my girlfriend  from me”. I ultimately ignored them and just told myself it was someone jealous. i asked her if she knew anything about them and she pretended to be upset and said she didn’t know. 

On Friday i was waiting for my girlfriend to finish work to facetime. I called her and i spoke about our relationship and going over how we can do better to avoid fights because we were currently going through a rough time. I was in my feelings talking to her and i felt like something was off. She didn’t seem upset or sad when talking about some of our arguments we had. It took a while but i finally forced it out of her and she actually didn’t have work. She told me straight to my face that she fucked another guy. I have never been so heartbroken in my life. It felt like i was shot by a gun when she told me that. Me being so distraught i asked her how could she do that and still tell me she loves me. She told me that she didn’t want to tell me because i was going to be mad. No guilt, no remorse, no sympathy. She didn’t cry. How can a person say they love you and see a future with you if you are fucking other guys behind my back. I called her all these nasty names, i blocked her on everything, and i was so upset that i told myself i’m going to take all the gifts she gave me and burn everything. i found myself sitting outside in the cold at 4:00am. Honestly probably the roughest night of my life. i’m not suicidal but i felt like dying. I now realized that the guy who was harassing me was this guy she fucked. she knew all along and lied to me. 

I never slept one hour that night. I sat there paralyzed . The next morning she was talking shit on instagram about me. her mom even defended her and told me i was a manipulative liar. Fast forward to Sunday. I have tried to do all the right follow up actions: spend time with family and friends, distract myself, workout. It’s all temporary. Once i’m home and all alone I fall into a scary hole of depression. I feel alone and all i can think of are negative thoughts in my head. I don’t even know who the fucking guy is and now i’m pretty sure they are dating. I haven’t been eating anything all day long and i’m losing a scary amount of weight. I have a nauseous feeling in my stomach from when i wake up to when i fall asleep. 

I don’t miss this girl. I miss the beautiful 2 years we had together. She was my best friend we did everything together. She was there for me and I was there for her. I protected her, i cared for her, and i loved her to death. I don’t know how to recover from this. I know they say time with heal but I never knew i was capable of falling in this deep in a hole of depression. I feel numb and empty inside.

239,"After a month, I am still upset over this situation.

My Dad and I are only children. Dad(61) has a still living aunt (101) who we still care about. 

My great aunt was honored by her town in Aug. Over this festival I friended on FB one of his cousins. She had her crazy streak in the 1970s but until this happened thought she grew out of it.

My parents own a farm which was until the 1990s, the family vacation farm. We own it 100%. Looking back on it, the cousins still think of it has ""theirs"" and this caused the blow up.

About a month ago, this cousin went off the handle on me over a slew of pictures she posted disappeared. Since they were of my Dad and the farm. I was suspected to have done it. (Most likely, she removed them herself by accident).

She then started to bring up a situation that happened when I was 12 over the farm. We threw off a tenant farmer in 2009 over bad farming practices. They evidently side with the tenant farmer even though we never could have an opinion on the situation. The tenant farmer is a distant cousin. The current farmer's (age 50) grandmother and my grandfather were first cousins (for reference).

The tenant farmer before this blow up happened has long been suspected of tampering with tractors on our place. But with no real proof. But the same day as the blow up was the same day we padlocked our barn up. We found 5 kittens dead that were dump offs (we do not have cats) that someone dumped off and let them die as our barn is a storage shed.

We feel that blow up with cousin is confirmation that the tenant farmer did the animal dumping along with a list of other stuff happened around our place. Its quieted down since with breakdowns as we got cameras and everything is locked up.

I cannot help but think, these cousins had these tenants believing they had a share in our place. Telling them that it was ok to dump the kittens off (as my dad loves cats). And then when we reacted, got yelled at for not being ok and being too faced.

After a month, I am upset over this situation, and feel this family is dead to me. I have the support of other branches of the family, and through work meet further (not toxic) relatives all the time. So I have support.

But how do you get over the messy and final blow ups in the family?",28Oct2019,1
240,"Hey everyone!  First time poster in this sub.  I really need some advice and I'm hoping ya'll have some ideas.  This is LONG (s/o to ADHD medication, it won't let me stop rambling) so I'll apologize now.  

I graduate college in December with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from a school in NYC.  I love living here and there's plenty of opportunities in my field (even if it's super competitive) and would like to stay.  

However, the starting salary for the types of positions I'm looking at are super low compared to the COL here, like 35-40k pre-tax, which is 33%ish in the city.  I don't have car costs, just the subway monthly, but rent is so high.  I currently live alone (thanks to bartending and my parents for some help) and don't think I want to give up that luxury.

So I'm considering moving.  I just have no clue where I want to go.  I know I want to stay in a decent sized city.  I don't think I want to live somewhere that relies on cars, but I'm open to it.  I'm not super outdoorsy, but I love concerts, art exhibits, comedy, foreign films, etc.  The only places I'd completely rule out are stepford wives-esque suburbs or SF because I've heard it's just as pricey as NYC.  

Another piece thrown in is that I most likely have an offer as a sales rep for a major brewery somewhere in the NE or mid-atlantic (think cities from Boston to Richmond, including NYC) and I'm lucky enough to have some say in where I'd like to be if I accept the job.  

However, I really want to go into brand strategy one day and work at a media company, record label, or beverage company (again, I'm a bartender.  It's my field of knowledge.) . I'm concerned the sales job wouldn't set me up for that pathway.  I'm looking at other opportunities that align with my long term goals as well, but having an idea of where to live would narrow down the application process a lot.

Basically, I'm your run-of-the-mill almost grad who has no clue what I'm doing.  I'd love some expertise (especially if you've been in this position or industry!) on what the right move is.  Thanks in advance for any help

246,"Okay, quick background info. I (F16) live with my two little brothers (11&amp;4), mom &amp; step dad (not technically a step dad because they weren't married but he's the only father figure ive had) Two Fridays ago, my mom abruptly broke up with my dad. It broke everyone. It was so out of left field, and for a while I thought it was my fault. My dad is very good at hiding his emitions, but I could tell it hurt him... especially when he tried to hold it back. My mom said it was because she didn't love him anymore, and had different goals. So my dad accepted it. Life moves on.

A few days after they broke up, my mom became secluded. She spent the first few days after the breakup texting God knows who on her phone (just an FYI, she sent over 4000 texts in comparison to my 300) and the only reason she stopped is because my 11 y/o brother asked her why she was always on her phone. My dad was taking it well, mostly because he knew none of us were leaving him especially since she had a kid (4 y/o bro) with him. Me and my dad would talk about what was happening, and how we were doing whenever we were alone going to the grocery store, or something like that. 

The Sunday after the break up, my mom goes to meet some guy she met online at a restaurant for a date (which, at the time, pissed me off like hell). She said she finally realised she ""needed more friends"". A few days later, she starts talking to a different guy... Ill call him Cody. Cody lives in Utah, and we live in Washington. Yes this is important.

A week goes by. Mom is still talking to the dude online, and Dad is trying to hang out with me and my two bros to distract himself. Recently (we're talking like a few days) my mom announced she was going to visit her dad in Eastern WA. Okay, thats fine. She's planning on leaving in November for a weekend. Sounds good.

Today, my 11 y/o brother was getting picked up from his friends house by my mom. They get back, and the rest of the night seems fine. 

I just found out from my brother, that when my brother and mom were in the car, she told him she wasn't actually going to her dads... but to Utah.

Now, she told my brother that she wasn't going to meet the guy. She said shes only going to a church there... but i call bullshit.

I dont know whether to tell my dad, or how to do it. He deserves to know, but I dont want my brother in trouble especially since mom has been moody lately. Any advice is great, please... Im desperate.",28Oct2019,1

248,"I’m just gonna dump fucking everything on here until I can talk to my therapist tomorrow, but basically I was involved in an active shooter situation at the NorCal Great America’s Halloween Haunt this past weekend. According to the Santa Clara PD there was a robbery with a weapon and some kids started shouting shooter, either confusing the situation or trying to get someone’s attention. Whether they meant to or not, they caused a huge panic that made everyone start sprinting for the exits, because I mean who wouldn’t panic when they hear there’s a shooter at one of GA’s busiest events of the year? 

I have no idea where it started in the park, but it was around 10:15pm when I was exiting the stall of a bathroom that I realized something was going on. I was with a group of 7 friends and I went with 2 others to use the restroom and when I left the stall, the bathroom, which was previously packed with people, was completely empty. I immediately knew something was wrong because of this, and when I got outside to speak to my friend who was waiting for me, she said to me “there’s a shooter.” I pulled her and the other person I was with into a stall. There were three other girls in the stall with us who were panicking and crying. I phoned my mom and told her I loved her before I decided it was a better idea that we went for the exit of the park. I have no idea how we managed to navigate our way out amidst the darkness and confusion and hordes of other park guests, but thankfully we hadn’t made our way too far into the park. We were huddled behind a police vehicle but people kept getting startled. I couldn’t decipher actual danger from the scared and screaming crowds so we decided to meet the rest of our group at a nearby hotel. We were all safe in the end and none of us got hurt in the chaos, which unfortunately others can’t say the same. 

I was sick to my stomach the entire time, and it didn’t help that I just scarfed down half a funnel cake 15 minutes prior. Throughout it all I was just thinking that this wasn’t real, that I never thought I’d be in this situation. I thought that i was going to die, but at the same time I was telling myself that I wouldn’t let us die here. There was never an actual shooter, which I’m thankful and angry about at the same time. But the panic that filled that hour was very real. 

As a person who struggles with anxiety and previous traumas already, I don’t know how long itll take until I feel safe from these types of things again. It’s still a lot to process, but I’m wondering if anyone has any insights to share or experiences like this?",28Oct2019,3
249,"I have no proof. I guess, that's why I am here. It's 1:18 a.m. I'm wide awake. So is my wife. Because we both crashed around 3:30-ish. Woke up an hour ago. This has been happening lately. On weekends. Never on weekdays (that I can think of). 

On weekends for the past six months, my wife and I have crashed mid-afternoon to early evening. We're noticing it, now. At first, not so much. Maybe we're tired. Exhausted after a long week. These are the thoughts I used to rationalize my sudden desire and need for weekend afternoon nap. 

I think they're dropping pills into our drinks. I've been trying to catch them in the act for a few weeks now. My wife thinks I'm fucking nutso. But, tonight (this a.m.) she's thinking what I'm thinking. The kids are drugging us. Two of our children are prescribed sleeping aids. We keep them locked up. But the older two know what key it is. And I've noticed the keys turn up missing from time to time. Start a little search party in the house. To no avail. And. Then we find them on our dresser the next day.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I haven't called the kids on this shit yet, as I'm worried it will straight up piss off my wife. But I know the two oldest, those dudes are getting high and drunk. 12 and 13. It is what it is. It's not an everyday thing. But some days my 12 pack will just disappear. Or a few beers will.

I want to focus on the subject at hand. Right now, I'm groggy and am not thinking well. This happens every weekend. I don't know what to do. How to stop it. Getting down to the nitty-gritty; I honestly believe my wife's mother and sister are behind this. I could write for an hour as to why I think she would put the oldest three up to this, but I don't want to because it doesn't really change or add to shit. 

The last month, I've been dumping out my beer or soda if I leave a room and come back in only to see one of the kids suddenly in the room I just left. I've pointed it out to my wife. That whenever I leave my room or a room--wherever I'm dwelling at that moment--one of the kids will instantly move in. Like I step out, they step in. Out of nowhere. It's happened too many times for it to be coincidence. At night. When I'm awake. The kids will come downstairs (my bedroom is downstairs; theirs are upstairs) and peak into my room. And seem shocked when they see I'm awake. I tell them to get back to bed, but the wander down again within an hour.

I don't want my wife and I to start making false accusations. We're both pretty livid right now. Two of the kids are still awake although they're pretending to be asleep. How do I address this? Obviously, I need to know for sure. I've thought about hiding a camera in my bedroom pointed at my soda, but my wife isn't down for the clown. 

Here's a great example. I'm painting the doors in my house. So one by one, I'm pulling all our doors down by the hinges. Last weekend, I did the boys room. Asked them to help. My oldest had the hammer and the flathead screwdriver needed to remove the door. He randomly went down stairs after we pulled the door. I followed about a minute later. Went into my room. To find him seeming a little out of sorts--surprised to see me--and he rushed past me to go back upstairs to his room.

Right next to my soda on my desk was the hammer and screwdriver that he'd just had. I asked him why he put them on my desk, and he claims he didn't, and he got really sketched out about it. He was like: ""I don't know why the hammer and screwdriver are on your desk.""

I was like: ""You had them when you went downstairs. Nobody else was downstairs.""

Him: ""I really don't know why they were on your desk. I didn't do it. Why would I do that?""

Me: ""\[NAME\], I came down two minutes after you and you were in my room. You left the hammer and screwdriver in my room on my desk.""

Him: ""No I didn't. Sorry. Got the wrong guy. God, I hate it how you blame everything on me. All. The. Time. It gets old, dad.""

He was seriously, the only person who was downstairs at the time. And when he was denying it. His voice shook. His face reddened. And a gleam of sweat formed on his forehead. He was up to something in my room. I dumped my soda and went about my day.

What should I do? I want this stop. I can't ask for it stop if they're going to keep denying. Plus that'll piss off my wife. I'm just backed into a corner with this shit. I really think the kids are gumming their nighttime meds and feeding them to me and wife, so they can jerk off all night and play Fortnite.

Please help.",28Oct2019,3
250,"

My elderly mother came to live with us 1.5 years ago following a stroke that rendered her no longer able to live independently. So we renovated our front room at our expense, furnished it with all the things she would need; electric bed, electric chair, walker, wheelchair, etc. also at our expense. She came with a suitcase of old stinky clothes full of holes that were promptly replaced at our expense. I help her with her daily self care and help her with her meals, take her to her Dr appointments, do her laundry, clean her room, the whole 9 yards. I love to do it for her. I love her. We told her she would have free rent for the first two years because our daughter lived with her rent free for two years a while back. Daughter took advantage of her and I’ve been pretty sore about it since. I always felt bad about that so this is my way of making it up to mom even though mom doesn’t expect it. She’s a sweet lady who has often been taken advantage of.

Some years ago she met a  man who became her renter. My two brothers and I thought it was odd that she cashed his checks and his vehicle was put into her name. and that he had a wife “back home” AND a girlfriend who spent the night frequently. This man introduced her to “The Minister” who she ended up writing a check for $200,000 to, to invest in diamonds in Africa. He and his wife left their three young children with my mom while they supposedly traveled to Africa for what was suppose to be 2 weeks but turned into a month. They eventually came back, retrieved their kids and disappeared never to be heard from again. The first man, the renter, was apprehended late one night and sent to Federal Prison for cocaine trafficking. My mom paid $40,000 for his lawyer and sent him money each month while he was in prison but there was no fighting the charges. He was deported after he served his time. I could go on and on but you get the idea she doesn’t make good decisions. No, she doesn’t have dementia or Alzheimer’s. She is mentally all there. Just makes crappy decisions and is easily taken advantage of.

Mom likes to listen to conspiracy theorists. She believes in UFO’s. She hates Trump and thinks the sky is falling. She keeps telling me she needs to pay of our mortgage because my husband’s place of employment is going to go out of business (it’s an airplane manufacturing facility he has worked at for 31 years) and all the banks will go broke. She thinks this next downturn in the economy will be worse than the Great Depression. She has been mentioning paying off our mortgage for about a month now and each time we tell her no. I’ve told my one brother that she keeps saying this and how uncomfortable it makes me feel. This would be the bulk of her remaining life savings and we just don’t feel right about it. Well tonight she was extra insistent about it and insists she pay it off THIS WEEK. I told her to call the brothers and tell them what she wants to do and if they think it’s a good idea then we will agree. I said this because I know my brothers are NOT going to agree with her and maybe after hearing from them she will drop it.

Don’t get me wrong, I would LOVE to have our mortgage paid off. Who wouldn’t? I’m not able to work because of my caregiving duties and so that exacerbates our situation but I just don’t think it would be morally right to accept her gift. What do YOU think? Wouldn’t I just be another one taking advantage of her if I let her pay off our mortgage?

TL/dr; Elderly mom who has history of not making good financial decisions and who has been taken advantage of pretty badly since dad died is insisting she pay off our mortgage. I’m uncomfortable with that.",28Oct2019,2

253,"So lovely Reddit, I’ve been lucky enough to be on the wonderful online dating apps and on two occasions have seen my friend/acquaintance’s bf on two separate apps.

Our relationship: She’s more of an acquaintance because we live in the same bldg and have known each other for over 5 years but we don’t hang out socially outside of this. But we’ve always been friendly and chatted in the hallways. 

Regarding the apps: The first time, it was on bumble and I thought about telling her but I just let it go, giving him the benefit of the doubt (like maybe he just never deactivated his account). But a few months later, I saw him on tinder and he definitely has recent pics up. I didn’t try to match or talk to him or anything, so technically he hasn’t done anything “wrong” other than be on the apps. What do you think Reddit, should I tell her?

A big hobby of mine lately has been programming, I’ve put apps onto the appstore, and I plan to go into programming for college. Part of me wants to tell my friends because I’m excited of where I am in programming, but then again, I can’t see them hanging out with a “programmer”. So my dilemma is: do I show them the apps i’ve made and risk weakening my friendship with my only friends at school or do I wait and tell them in college, when programming seems much more of a realistic thing for me to be doing (for my future career).",28Oct2019,2

swipe right on a dude cause he's cute....fully expect it to be a one night stand....it wasn't.

we talk 24/7 he comes over twice a week spends the night for 1-2 days, he almost forces me to let him buy me meals, and anywhere we stop he has to get me something or it's a whole back and forth, he invited me to his friend's party upon getting there I'm greeted by said friend with ""Oh I've heard so much about you, he hasn't shut up, glad to finally meet you glad you could actually make it,"" (last bit because I refused to drive an hour for a party the day before)  later asked him about it and he just said ""he saw that video I took"". 

So, me bein me, I confronted his friend (with him beside me) ""so you've seen me naked?"" kid said ""haha yeah"", but then started trying to be my friend but nothing more was said on the ""told me all about you"" subject. I keep telling my friends he's just doin shit for show, cause he likes to flex on everything so it's not out of character imo, but 

given the amount of time we spend together, given that we haven't stopped talking in 3 weeks, the amount of shit he battles to buy me, the fact I never have to lift a finger almost ever (i.e. every door opened, dude even pops my knuckles for me), the pet names, his constant prying for how i treat other males or what I say to the males in my inbox, this encounter with his friend.... I dont know what to think....like it all adds up to him wanting a relationship

260,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here but I just really need some advice as I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm sorry for the long post!

For starters, I'm a 19 y/o male and I suffer from a neurological disorder called Tourette's Syndrome. If you don't know what it is, it basically causes me to have both motor(muscle) and vocal tics which get worse based off of stress, and the disorder goes hand-in-hand with some learning disabilities, as well as anxiety. My face is pretty much constantly in pain and I probably look pretty weird to a lot of people. Overall, it pretty much sucks but I've had to live with it my whole life so I guess I'm used to it.

During my senior year of high school (last year), I got my first, and only, job. It was alright at first, and my family was super supportive of it, but it got really stressful over time. After half a year, I ended up quitting to focus on school and a few other things that I wanted to try out and learn (such as game/UI/web design), but not after I had developed some pretty bad tics. They're the worst ones I've ever had and they've made me miserable ever since. Since I quit, my mom and her boyfriend (the main people I live with) have stopped being supportive of me. In fact, they even track me now, although I have no idea why they'd want to do so.

I'm currently in college, and the only way I'm affording it is with a scholarship I was awarded for writing an essay about what it's like to live with Tourette's Syndrome. However, even with this, I only have a few more months until car insurance eats up the rest of what I saved up from my first job (yeah, California can be brutal). It's also stressful because I have to maintain a certain GPA to keep my scholarship through each semester, but in doing so, I don't have much time for other opportunities. As of right now, I have a few (decently well) upcoming paid opportunities for designing user interface for games, but at the same time I'm also swamped in schoolwork. 

Living with my mom really stresses me out. For whatever reason, whenever I'm here I just feel extremely sad and it makes me want to get out of the situation. I have a couple friends that want to move out as well, so I wouldn't have to cover rent cost all on my own, but it's still pricey. I could get a job if it came down to it but I definitely can't balance it with school, and it'd have to be something that isn't too stressful for me. 

I feel as if I can't really balance these upcoming opportunities with school, but I also don't know what I should do. I've sort of been on the fence about all of this for a while, but recently it's been starting to become more apparent.",28Oct2019,2
261,"Well I'm not good at formatting stories and I'm typing on my phone so if there's any errors I apologize in advance. I also made a account just for this purpose so if you're sus on why the account is new, there's your answer.

I am in highschool so if this seems childish please feel free to tell me so, but I broke up with my ex s couple of weeks ago and it troubles me a lot to know if I was in the wrong, and if I was the toxic one in the relationship.

1. 
We were messing around and we got into a play fight, it all leads up to him saying ""Fine go talk to other dudes(I think he says the N word after, not sure since I deleted everything)."" I'm very sensitive, yet I have anger issues so this immediately didn't sit well with me so I became hurt and angry. The next day during school I give him the cold shoulder and he begins to text me what he might've done wrong. I tell him about it and he apologizes, he says that his Friend's sister said it and he thought it was funny and typed it. (I'm still confused on whether he was telling his friends or it was an inside joke)

2. 
We got into some argument which he thought was a play argument I'm guessing and sent a photo of a crib with the caption ""Aight get in since you want to be a baby"" once again, didn't like that and I figured it was the last straw and dumped him after an hour or two of conversation and ignoring his messages. 

When we met up he wanted to give stuff back which was some pocky and an old (but in good condition Nintendo DS) We both didn't want it back so I told him to sell it. He usually has a deep voice but his voice seems strained and forced, which I assumed meant he was pissed at me. After that he hasn't spoken to me since and looking back this, I feel like I hurt him and I'm the toxic one in the relationship for not taking his jokes lightly. But at the same time I just didn't think it was funny and hurt me.  As far as I know, (to basically rub more salt in my guilt wound) He seemed to adore me. We were really close and friends since elementary so I feel like when we broke up over some jokes I didnt find funny, it probably destroyed any positive feelings or image  he had towards me. Though how he views me doesnt affect me too much because I wouldn't blame him, it hurts knowing I won't be able to have any fun memories with him anymore and that its all a thing in the past. 

Once again, if you think I'm stupid and the reason we broke was childish I get it and I don't mind if you tell me so I'm open to all criticism and whether or not I was the toxic one so I can move on a bit easier.",28Oct2019,2

What actually scares me about death is the effect it may or may not have on those I care for. I just feel like if I wasn’t concerned about how my loved ones would be affected, regardless of how.

I'm 24 and weigh 195 lbs and my brother is 17 and weighs around 160 lbs I think I'm not sure. So we were picking for the game of chicken and me and my brother were partners. He didn't want to because he said I was too heavy for him to carry. I thought that he was just being mean because I'm not that heavy and my family and the other family finall pressured him into playing. So about 10 minutes before we actually started I got on my brothers shoulders to see how well he could carry me and I didn't really care at the time but he was really struggling. He kept telling me that I was too heavy but I just thought that he was being annoying like little brothers usually are and told him to be quiet. The match started and as we were fighting the other team for about 10 minutest my brother started saying that he couldn't keep it up and was slowly sinking underwater. His head was completely submerged but no one noticed since we were all caught up watching the competition. I had my thighs squeezing his neck so that he wouldn't try to put me down or get me off of him and so I wouldn't as easily fall off of his shoulders. whilst we were in the competition. So due to my weight pushing him underwater he was suffocating and trying to lift me off of him which I didn't notice and we ended up wining which was cool. So after we won I noticed that he was underwater so I told him that he was being lazy and to get up and I grabbed his hair and started pulling it trying to get him up. He emerged from the water and his face was completely red and he was crying and barley holding me up. I got off of him and he ran back to the room and I was so embarrassed and sorry.

269," So we had a really rough breakup. Together for 5 years. We have a daughter (17mo) and she has an 8yr old from a previous relationship, a house, and three dogs. After we broke up she was cold and mean towards me and i was trying to fix things and make it work. She wanted no part in that. After about a week she put a lock on her phone and would always try to use the kids against me(youre a piece of shit if you dont watch the kids so i can go out). We still had sex like once or twice a week. This lasted about 4 weeks. I moved to my buddies to give her ""space"" because thats what she said might fix our relationship. She took down all of our pictures and redecorated the WHOLE house and bought a new 3000$ bed. Meanwhile shes having me over to watch the kids EVERYDAY. Making it impossible to give her the space she wants.

I also want to add that she is not thinking about our kids what so ever. She just wants what she wants and thinks the kids will be fine. Every time i talk to her on the phone her daughter is asking when i'm going to move back in and she shrugs it off.

I talked to her about how she needs to start looking for a place to live and she starts calling me a piece of shit and shes not moving out how could i do this to our children etc etc. She hasnt contributed to the mortgage or bills in a couple months at this point.

Anyways i wake up yesterday at my buddies house and decide to text her.

ME: Hey how are you and our daughter doing

Her: Good and step daughter is good too but you didnt ask about her

ME: Oh i didnt realize she was home from her dads

Her: I hooked up with someone and i dont want to talk about it and im not giving you any details.

I called her and asked if she felt bad or anything and she said no i didnt want to tell you to avoid all the drama and i didnt want to hurt you (as like a second thought)

270,So a girl I have liked for awhile and I have been hanging out more. We had a chance to spend time alone and we had a great time. She texted me the whole night and blowing up my phone and gave me all these compliments and was being very sweet to me. Fast forward two days later and I texted her a funny article about a tv show she liked just to get her attention today and I got no response. I havent said anything awkward and havent like asked her out or said anything stupid. It's strange that she just didn't even say one word back after how much she bothered me a few days ago. I see her at work all the time and havent said anything rude or embarressing. I literally asked her how she was doing at work yesterday when I walked past her and things seemed fine.,28Oct2019,1

273,"Hello,

I'm 29, I never had a girlfriend or anything close, I don't know why and I'm at a point in life, where I can't bear it anymore. I don't even know if I want to have a women I just wish to know why noone is interested in me. 

I'm not shy, I have low selfesteem but I don't show it. I don't think I'm very attractive, but I'm not ugly either. 

I'm not stupid, I have a Masters Degree and a very good paid job. 

I'm tall and skinny but I work out a lot and I think I'm pretty strong for my build.

I've been talking to a lot of women my entire life, I had a fair share of femla friends, but not even a single one ever wanted to go out with me. 

I cannot sleep anymore, I can't focus on work anymore. Baiscally my life is breaking apart just because of this fact. 

Is there anyone who might know what to do. Could a psychiatrist help? 

Thanks",28Oct2019,10
274,"First off, this as a throwaway to protect anonymity of all involved.

Here's the issue: a very close friend of mine recently came to me for advice regarding their partner. Their partner had a very poor time of life this far, with an addict mother, abusive ex, not-in-the-picture father, and apathetic at best family. They have struggled with depression their entire life and currently live with said apathetic family, specifically grandparent, who is unsupportive and generally downright mean.
They are very unstable and as the friend said, talking to them is like a mine field. The friend is unhappy in the relationship, and wants a way out.
Herein, dear redditors, lies the issue. The friend and myself are fairly certain they (friends S.O.) will commit suicide if friend does break up with them. This is not, in my opinion, a manipulation tactic, but rather an actual likely outcome, as they have not threatened directly to do so as a consequence to a breakup.
Neither myself not my friend wish them any harm, as they are genuinely a good person, and would definitely prefer to at the very least be able to talk on occasion.
When the friend asked for advice, the only thing I could think of involved asking the mental health unit at the hospital to see to them asap after the breakup happens, so that's where I hope you all come in.

I genuinely care about both of these people, but having the friend stay in a relationship they aren't happy with isn't just a bandaid solution, but one that harms all involved. Please, anyone who may have some idea on what to do to keep them both safe, give your advice, it'd be hugely appreciated.

275,"I'm 22(f) and about 2 months ago I got drugged, snatched, raped and dumped (on the side of the road) all in one night. It was one of the most horrible experiences of my life. I called my mum and cried my eyes out. She said to me ""not now bub, I'm busy with work"" since then she hasn't called, asked how I am or even talked about it. A few times I called her to tell her that I was scared I was pregnant (she didn't pick up) and even when I called to say I was really struggling did she care. Here's the worst part, she is famous for being one of our countries best trauma therapists...everyone asks me how amazing it must be to be her daughter. Inside I feel like I'm dying. Not because of the attack but because I just realised that she doesn't care for me but her clients, her conferences, anyone else gets her care :( I guess I want some advice on how to get past this, I don't know how to stop the hurting",28Oct2019,2
276,"Our family is super homophobic and I don’t know what to do. I’m pretty sure he thinks I’m homophobic too because we never really talk about it, but I’m gay af. 
I never gave any thought into his sexuality because dude bros, my brother like the opposite of a gay man (even super masculine gay men are more gay than him, and I don’t mean to push stereotypes, but I had no idea there was even a possibility of my brother being gay). I’m saying “gay” rather than bi because after my realization,  I realized hes never has a girlfriend. 
My dad is blatantly homophobic and is a prime example of toxic masculinity (which was of course forced into my brother). He’s the type of dude who sees a same sex couple kissing in public and calls them disgusting and to take it somewhere else. I don’t think my mom cares that much, but she’s never gonna stand up to my dad. 
The reason I’ve come to realize he’s gay is because of his best friend who we’ll call Fonzo. They met in college and since then have done LITERALLY everything together. If you call one over to hang out you best be expecting the other to be tagging along. And now you might be thinking, “well I’m like this with my best friends all the time! What’s wrong with hanging out?” Well i will ask you two questions. 1. Are you female, as female relationships tend to be closer than male relationships, and 2. DO YOU HOLD HANDS WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND, SHARE THE SAME BED, ARE PLANNING ON MOVING INTO THE SAME ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT, AND STARE INTO EACH OTHERS EYES RANDOMLY? They act like an old married couple, but like a new couple at the same time.

278,"Hi! I’m 15F. Ever since I was young, I have always wanted to do video editing, whether it’s personal music videos or travel videos. Editing is a big passion of mine &amp; my parents are very accepting of this as they have seen my work. I want to base my income and job around youtube, which is an extremley risky thing. I couldn’t think of doing anything else in life, editing is truly what makes me happy &amp; my true passion. Ever since I started college, I got bullied pretty bad, whether it was verbally or physically. For my first two years of school I would mostly spend my time at home or with the councillors, which meant I was hardly ever at school. I moved schools 3 times due to this, and at my last school I just had extremley bad social anxiety. I could not even show up to a class without breaking down, I couldn’t show my face and I would spend the whole day hiding in the bathrooms. My parents and teachers started realising that I wasn’t in class for a few weeks. My parents are really supportive and they understood my case so they decided to pull me out until they found a solution, that solution was to do home school. I do online school now, which means I just work on my own schedule. I do a class that revolves around video editing &amp; my teacher has put me on to doing work which is way above my level as she thinks I’m much more advanced. I’m struggling a lot with math &amp; science, and I just feel like I’m not going to finish school due to this. That worries me quite a bit, but I also just feel like school isn’t right for me. I feel like Im learning things I wouldn’t need to know for my future, or for what I want to do. My parents want me to go to university but I just don’t feel the need to. I want to start my editing now &amp; do what I want to do now. I feel like school is just getting in the way of my editing and just unmotivating me. I feel like if I start now, there’s more of a chance that I could get successful in what I want to do. School is just a big stress on me and completley unmotivates me to do anything! It gets in the way of me actually doing what I like &amp; what I want to do in the future. 

Summary : I want to editing in my future, getting an income through youtube. School is really stressing me out &amp; I feel like it’s just not for me as it’s unmotivating me and not actually helping me with what I want to do.

281,"   Hello!! We’re both 19 y/o and I’m so confused as to how to address leaving her. She’s not necessarily toxic as much as she weighs me down.. I feel horrible for saying that because the way she is isn’t necessarily her fault. She’s been horribly sheltered since she was a kid, only child too. She never had many friends growing up and her appearance was always the target for bullying. She’s understandably very timid, insecure and naturally very self centered.
   I thought her constantly changing the conversations to herself would evolve the more we hung out once I moved back to our home city a year ago. We knew each other in middle school but never spoke til then, she barely changed.  But despite constant efforts to help her in conversation, even involving me being blunt, she refuses to grow and understand balanced conversation. If it wasn’t about her, then the conversation would fall relatively flat. Whether because she didn’t know how to respond, or was thinking about something of herself to talk about. Aka interjecting our conversations with irrelevant topics about her life. She would not continue unless it was about her.
   Or unless she was asking if we were smoking weed or eating food. All insisted at my expense, granted when we started hanging out I always offered to pay when I could because I understand she isn’t in the best financial position. But neither am I, she knows the hard work and hours I put into making barely enough, yet she acts almost entitled and never forgets to hint at These things. 
   The thing is she’s not a manipulative person, she doesn’t know people well enough to manipulate or use them. And she isn’t a mean person by any margin. She’s ignorant. But she doesn’t have the capacity to grow with me. I dread making plans and have stopped. I want to leave because I feel weighed down, but I don’t want to be cruel because I understand it’s not her fault, I just don’t think we should be friends, we’re nice but not close. She feels closer to me than I do her which is what sucks the most because I feel like our friendship is fraudulent and I led her up only to dip out. But it’s not good for me. What do you think I should do?",28Oct2019,2
282,"So I’m not sure if I’m supposed to split this up into multiple posts, but I’m starting to freak out and could use some advice. For starters, I have extremely controlling and protective parents. They’ve been a source of anxiety and depression for me, and honestly moving away to college has been one of the best experiences of my life.

With that in mind, I lost my virginity to my girlfriend last night. She’s had several sexual partners, and I’m fairly sure she’s clean of STDs (although to be honest I didn’t ask). The condom slipped off while we were together, and I’d like to go get tested just to be safe. I also may have been raped by an uncle when I was young (very long story) so it’s been weighing on my mind for a while and I’d like to take care of it, regardless of the chances that anything is going on.

However, I’m still on my parents insurance and they see every charge to the account, so I’m a little worried that I’ll be disowned if they find out what’s going on. Additionally, I only have around $4000 in savings, college tuition next semester is going to cost roughly $6000 out of pocket, and I have absolutely zero financial support from my parents. I don’t have a job at the moment because my class schedule is so weird, but I’m planning to get one fairly soon, and now that I’m starting to run dry on spending money it will probably be within a month.

On top of all of that, I found out about a year ago that I have phimosis (fairly severe), and it actually really hurt when I was with my girlfriend, so treating that is another reason that I’d like to get off my parent’s insurance plan.

I feel very trapped by life, student tuition bills, and the fact that I don’t have anyone I can really talk to about any of this. Does anyone know of a good way to tell my parents I want to move off of their plan, and any sort of insurance plans that can at least partially cover my trips to the doctor, without ruining the rest of my savings? Should I just forget getting medical help and deal with it myself?",28Oct2019,2

285,"I work in IT and looking to continue working in this field. I have a few certifications and a decade of experience, but no degrees so relocation for a job is not something I can usually get.

I am growing tired of the state I live in currently. Housing is too expensive, rent is too expensive, gas is too expensive, the job market is terrible regardless whether you have a degree or not, taxes are too high, and everything feels against me here. I have two states in mind that I'd like to move to.

The issue I see in getting a job elsewhere is that I do not have an address in that state or near that area and that would be a red flag against me. Even if I were to get a PO box, it'd be obvious from my most recent and current employer that I'm out of state.

I don't have friends or family living in either of these states which makes me feel like this is a chicken and egg sort of deal. To have a job, I need housing. To have housing, I need a job. I can't get one or the other without the other.

One of the states is only 300 miles away and I would be willing to meet for an interview if I was considered by driving/flying there, staying in a hotel to be on time for the interview, but I'm just worried about my application being tossed with no serious consideration for any positions I apply there.

In the other state, I found cheap housing that is so cheap, I could pay for half of the housing up front in cash, but I would still need a mortgage and need to pay per month for it so I'd still need the job being there and I don't want to buy a house there only to be stuck there with no money to pay for the new house while I look for a job. I thought about roommates or renting out the housing and staying here for a while, but I'd need to wait for people to apply for rent and be around for upkeep of the house, so not really an ideal sort of thing here either. I'd be willing to meet for interviews here, but this state is thousands of miles away so I'd need to fly out for each and every interview which isn't something I'd be keen on considering how many interviews I've been on that go nowhere.

I am pretty sure this is far higher than any plan should feasibly be, but cannot verify as I have never touched auto insurance payments in my life. I advised her to call the insurance company and talk with them about how much the plan is (she has the paperwork and info and all that) but she is hesitant because she's scared of taking responsibility for it. 

I don't know what to advise her to do, but I cannot just let it stand because $400/month is unreasonable, and I'm pretty sure her mom is being dishonest with her about the actual cost.

312,"My brother is 11 years old this year. His end of year examinations is coming in three days (Thursday) and yet he seems to not have any sense of urgency. My father is working his butt off trying to help him, but he doesn't seem to appreciate it. He just laughs, sings songs and escapes any moment he can. He also finds all sorts of excuses to escape having to study including, but not limited to, crying about small things like having to turn off the air conditioner, lying on his bed and refusing to answer to anyone, purposely eating slowly, going to the toilet a lot, or playing with my brother so that he doesn't have to study. For example, an hour ago, I accidentally broke the little plastic hook on his mechanical pencil, and he ran to the kitchen on the first floor and ate 3 cupcakes for half an hour. My father can't do anything about it as he has joint issues and has been instructed to minimise using the stairs as much as possible. He is extremely distracted and cannot focus. He is also very very slow, and just doesn't seem interested in his studies. My father tries his best but he's nearly at his breaking point, while my mother has given up and wants to ""let him fail and see"". The thing is, he doesn't care. He barely passed his previous exams, and his reasoning was""as long as there's someone lower than me it fine"". My father is proud of the fact that my sister and I held top in year academic positions in our schools and with his attitude, it looks like an absolute firestorm is inbound. He also has extremely low eq. His laughter is a series of forced out snorts, which is done on purpose and absolutely annoying. My entire family has told him to stop but he doesn't care. During dinner, he blasts Morgz on his phone at nearly max volume, and we can't stand his voice(sorry Morgz fans). He also impersonate Indians a lot, including their stereotypical hand and head actions and their accent. He also regular bullies my youngest brother, causing a massive headache for everyone at home. I hate him so much, yet he seems to go everywhere with my family. I've been staying at home and refusing to go out anywhere with him. 
Altogether, he needs to get his act together. Lazy, unmotivated, insensitive. I don't know how to communicate with him, he just turns everything into a joke. Talk to him and he will start quoting naruto. In the middle of dinner he starts singing panini. My father tries, but he can't connect. My sister and my youngest brother hate him, and don't want anything to do with him. My mother has more or less given up on him. The funny thing is, he was actually pretty OK when he was younger, but ever since he got his phones and discovered the many ways he can skive off work, he's just turning from bad to worse. I wish there was something I can do. Talking to him is ineffective. I have nearly resorted to violence to snap him out of it. Thank you for reading till here",28Oct2019,1
313,"I'm not sure if I should keep trying with my studies at university or stop wasting everyone's (and mine as well) time. I don't feel interested and motivated to invest myself into the subjects that are being taught here, so the only reason for me to keep going is to receive a document, which feels empty and to be honest I don't really have a specific need for it now. I'm on my second year and it's not getting easier or more interesting, quite the opposite in fact and I'm already starting to have struggles with certain subjects. I'm not saying that the university or the proffesors are bad, I just don't feel like this is something I want to do in life at the moment. I honestly would like to move out of my home and thinking about I wouldn't mind doing full-time job and save up money to move out.
Going to university wasn't my own idea in the first place, after finishing school I didn't know what to do and an acquaintance of mine suggested to apply to uni, after that I tried and got accepted and now I'm here.
I don't know what to do and I'm not sure how to bring this up with anyone that is close to me because I'm a bit anxious that I might disappoint and let someone else down and may look like a failure, but I also can't keep ignoring how I feel about this situation.",28Oct2019,1
315," This is a throwaway account. Also I'm sorry for any english mistake.

I’m not really happy with my boyfriend. He isn’t nice to me, he treats me like trash, he behaves shitty with me. He is a hypocrite and he is incredibly manipulative.

I should also mention that he is depressive, and chronically ill, which makes everything ten times harder. (And he will never go see a professional for the depression)

On the rare moments that he feels good, he can be nice and sweet, but when he is feeling bad (so, most of the time), he is mean to me. He often comes to see me only for sex, and treats me like trash otherwise.

Also due to various circumstances that I won’t detail, I can’t build a life with him. I can’t have children with him.

I am very submissive to him, and sometimes I feel like I’m his slave. He gets angry at me all the time for the slightest things, sometimes even things he does to me.

He himself often tells me that I should leave. He always says he knows he treats me badly, though he truly loves me and doesn’t want me to suffer, so I should leave and build my life with another man.

But here’s the thing.

I love him to death. I must sound so stupid, but I can’t help it.

I love him so much. I’m obsessed with him.

Sometimes, when he is angry at me, he leaves, and I’m scared he won’t come back. Every time, I have bad panic attacks, and I suffer so much.

I don’t have any friends, because even though I have no issues socializing and getting along with everyone, I just don’t care about anyone but him. 

I know all of this is so toxic, but I don’t know how to get out of it. I feel trapped, I can’t help it, everything hurts so much.

I’m not very happy right now, but I can’t imagine my life without him. I’ll want to kill myself.

I feel trapped and lonely. I don’t know what to do.

I just don’t want to feel so bad all the time",28Oct2019,2

318,"My other half just got a new job after not being employed for about a year (after her father passed). I want to be supportive and proud of her but 3 days before she applied for this new job, she had told me that the manager of this establishment is on trial for Sexual Harassment against multiple girls who already have been working there. 

This whole thing has been taking a huge toll on our relationship as she believes that I’m not supportive of her new job. She believes that I’m against her getting a job at all. 

I have never discouraged her from getting a job but I always advised her to get a job at a place that is safe and productive toward her future and her dreams. I’ve encouraged her to apply at many different places but she denies them due to fear of rejection. 

Today was her first day and she chose to withhold that she would be training under the same manager that had been accused of sexual harassment by multiple girls. 

I’m trying to be supportive and ok with this but I don’t know what to do or what to feel anymore. I understand that she can handle herself (as she keeps stating to me) but as her other half, I still feel resentment for this manager and fear that she may become just like the other girls who have had to encounter the sexual harassment. 

She doesn’t understand why I’m being so protective of her and I’m afraid that this might come between our relationship that has been going strong for 2 years now.

324,"Title. My friend is in his final year of school and has a really unhealthy family life, he lives with his sister and brother, who seem to be pretty stable except for the sister divorcing at the moment. He tells me his mother should be on medication but she has stopped taking them. Just tonight she asked him if she killed herself would she look after her kids.

He was telling me how he was having a panic attack earlier today and I was trying to help him with it. I suggested he go to a school councillor as he has a pretty good scholarship to a good school, but he was very resistant which I can understand but he’s also quite stressed by school and I feel at least informing school of his family situation can help reduce school stress. In large part I think he doesn’t want to go to councillors is because his school is founded on the toxic Christian belief that gay people are sinful.

I’ve been trying for a while to be a rock to him emotionally but I’m kind of at my wits end. I’ve tried being accomodating and stuff, taking him to the beach to get him out of the house etc. on Sunday we both went to a Halloween party and he got black out drunk (which was pretty concerning in itself) and I drove him home after a couple bouts of vomiting. Basically I think he’s using substances including various drugs to self medicate out of his home life.

I’m going through exams at the moment and struggling to balance my emotional health with his mental health along with study, he’s refused multiple times to go to the school councillor but I’m seriously considering sending an anonymous email to his school regarding his health.

So me and my GF have been together since January of this year, but were friends before hand (Sep.2018) is when we met. I am currently studying abroad in Japan and my GF is in Michigan,USA. I have been here for 2 months and come home in around a month. My GF contacted me last Monday and there was a pause. She said she was not happy. She said she had been doing some deep thinking (im assuming over the course of at least 1 or 2 weeks,) and used the following examples:

1. When I call you, it feels like ""Oh gosh, gotta call him, like a chore""
2. I have more interest in hanging out with friends. 
3. The only difference between my guy friends and you is sex.(shes blunt and straight forward)
4. I just dont think we are right for each other. 
5. you cant change my mind

This is when I knew something was wrong, I asked what can we do to fix it. She said this has happened before even when i was in the states (arguments, not violent at all) and that It has not changed. She said She thinks we would be better off as friends. This is when i began to break down. She never said she was breaking up with me, but i knew she was. She then proceeded to say I promise we can still be friends and keep swimming, dont drown, and go talk to people after this. ""I am only saying these things because i care."" I was crying and I said I knew something was wrong, she took that as me partially being mutual with the breakup, but I was not. (Apparently, she contacted our mutual friend and said ""I have news"". a few days after) she is graduating soon (dec), under a lot of stress with finding work and her job,hw,etc and i feel at fault because i was not there. 

She said she wants to be friends, but we have had sex (I was her first and she was mine,) and I have strong feelings for her even after healing, (not crying and actually bettering myself). Last Thursday i contacted her again (we have been talking Tuesday and Wednesday as well,) and I pressed her out of emotion saying we can fix this, she said i just talked to you.

 I'm almost 18 but don't let the age fool you. I've been through a lot and although I'm grateful for all that I have I can feel that things just aren't going the way I want them to be. This is not a temporary situation or some normal puberty depression stage, I have been constantly unhappy for more than 3 years now every single day.

 Don't get me wrong, materialistically I'm not missing anything - I have everything you could possibly want/need. It's just that I really never feel happy anymore, I never get even slightly excited and my passion for living in general has slowly died. I have a healthy family, a roof over my head, access to food and water and I'm living a life many people probably wish for. Some things happened in the past that probably kickstarted my life into spiraling towards what it has become but I'm trying not to look in the past since I cannot change it and it can only make me more sad than I currently am. 

 I have stopped looking forward to anything which I know is a really bad sign, at my age, I should supposedly be living my best life and I should be having tons of fun, making many memories and meeting new people. Everything that I had a passion towards slowly faded, I have tried getting into new things, finding new hobbies but it seems hopeless. 

I am currently really busy with studying and I have very little time for anything anyways, I used to workout every day and follow an eating regimen for a long time and it did bring some joy into my life but for the past year I haven't been doing that and I have gotten worryingly out of shape, I have become more distant to my friends and relatives and I have completely stopped enjoying every day life. I kept on telling myself that this would subside and things would get better with time but it's been 3+ years and things have only gotten worse.

What is the purpose and what should I do to feel happy again and love my life? Is it worth it to keep on trying to improve?

1st year Uni and studying Computer Science

I have suffered from very bad social anxiety for the past 3 years and as a result I have not had any friends for that amount of time nor have I made any friends in University. This completely threw me off the whole glorious Uni experience and I began not attending my lectures, tutorials nor my practicals. Instead I just walked around my city taking long journeys to kill time. No one other than myself knows about this, and since I live with my parents if they found out they would kill me.

Yesterday I checked my email for the first time in God knows how long and I just realised how fucked I was. There were talks of in class exams, group projects and all sorts of topics that I have completely missed because of the fear of Uni.

Now I am completely stuck on what to do and who to talk to because despite having missed most of the last 2 months, I really don't want to drop out of University as this would disappoint both my parents as well as my self as I have nothing else going for myself.

Anyone have any advice?

Over the years I've had the occasional crush but iv'e been able to dispel them because it's a relatively conservative school and I never knew the person I was crushing on too well, just friends from school. Well I've had this friend (18M) for like 4 years and he's quite attractive but I never really saw him in that kind of way. I just really valued our friendship. However, we are now in our final year at school and we (him and my other friends) have been spending a lot more time together outside of school as well. Over the past 2 months I developed an attraction to him and it's been intensifying ever since. Now it's come to the point where being with him is intoxicating, my heart beats faster and eye contact is so meaningful. I've personally never been in a romantic relationship, perhaps due to confidence/awkwardness. I like to think i'm actually fine in the looks department even though that's a bit shallow. He's been in a few, one long term, all girls obviously. When he and his long term girlfriend broke up, she told her friends that my friend was bisexual, this gossip eventually reached some guys at my school and that info reached me and some of my friends. The friend that im crushing on though never found out about the rumour about him because we all tried to keep it hush for his sake. Not a nice thing to spread rumours. However when I found out about this rumour (about 2 months ago) it kinda triggered the thought process about him and obviously lead to my crush on him. Anyway I don't know what to fucking do, it honestly sucks. Every moment I spend with him is both intoxicating and excruciating and I miss him when he's not around. I don't know if this is a crush or love or obsession. Honestly I think if I could stop these feelings I would, believe me I've tried. I don't think he suspects anything I haven't changed my behaviour around him at least not that I can tell. No one (except my parents) knows that i'm bisexual. Iv'e been wanting to come out to my friends for a while but I don't know how to do it without seeming like an attention seeker. I feel like at some point soon i'm going to have to confess my feelings for him because it's honestly taking its toll on me.

Second, does farting become a problem when having a buttplug in, or does the fart simply pass it and go out? Also is there a danger that poop will push it out? Third and final, what is the best material for a plug? Found one in metal (https://i.imgur.com/Q7HwDkd.jpg) to around 40$ and one in silicone (https://i.imgur.com/62pSh7x.jpg) to around 20$. The metal one is 2mm wider then the silicone one. and both is classified as small. 

I was thinking that the metal one should slide in easier, and that it does not tug the hair in my butt crack, like the silicone might do? Also the silicone one has a bit bigger base, that might aggravate the concerns that I mentioned. Which one would be the best option?

It's hard because don't like sharing my feelings I just battle them on my own. I am a huge disappointment to my entire family I just want to find meaning in something. Any advice is appreciated thank you a lot.",28Oct2019,1

357,"I work with a team of people who generally keep to themselves, except for one guy. Although we're encouraged to get work done at our desks, he insists on walking around the entire office, and chatting with people all day long. Surprisingly, he gets work done because he helps some of these people.

My shift starts at 7:30, I'm not a morning person at all. He is very energetic, and wants to talk the moment I sit down. He's older, so I guess he doesn't understand that headphones=don't bother me. I'm always polite when he talks, but it gets annoying at times. How t",28Oct2019,1
358,"I [16F] have been emotionally and physically, for a small amount of time, abused by my mother [49] for all of my childhood. The memories are painful and makes me go into an anxiety attack and sleepless nights just thinking about the pain i felt when she slapped me or hurt me just because I pissed her off and not as a form of proper punishment. She has also been gaslighting me and judging my own thoughts and emotionally manipulating me that this is for my own good and i shouldnt question it and that I was the  problem. She also made me feel like shit that a 6th grader made the kayaking team and not me [i was in 8th grade and not interest in kayaking but insisted i do it for the money, not because i like it, which i don’t.]

Now, that I am 16 and soon going away to college, she has apologized to me for anything she had done in the past and is trying to make amends with me. The problem is... i dont know if i should forgive her. Her abuse has made me an anxious person and made me the way I am now; low self esteem, not caring of myself, and impulsive eating to ease the pain. Should I really forgive her for her actions or am I in the right to not forgive her?",28Oct2019,3

362," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Oct2019,0
363,"my mom and dad divorced when I was around 10; I'm 15 now. Whenever the divorce first happened it hit me hard, this was around the time I was diagnosed with depression, and also around the time I started avoiding my dad and my new stepmom and stepsister. I felt out of place at the time, like he had a whole new family that I was no longer apart of. I would go months without visiting him. I really regret that mindset now, I've been visiting him more ofter for the past two years and I'm so much happier over there. Originally the reason I started visiting more is because it was an escape from my mom and her new boyfriend who genuinely scared me, they fought so much and I could hear every single threat from my room, she kept saying he was leaving soon but he never did. He's in prison soon but she still talks to him and puts money we can't afford to give up on his books. Whenever he gets out I'm willing to bet things are going to go right back to how they were. Something else important to mention: I went to go visit my sister awhile ago and I told the situation to her, she helped me and told my mom that she wasn't going to bring me back until she kicked that guy out or figured something out. She got mad which we were expecting but eventually she said he was moving out soon anyways. Sure enough he still ended up being there for atleast a month before the police caught him. My mom has been acting so much more cold since she started dating him, when I come home now I just feel drained... and like I want to go somewhere else. I know my dad would happily let me move in but I don't know how to bring it up to my mom. Any advice would help right now, I just feel stuck in my current situation, I don't want to hurt my mom by moving out.",28Oct2019,1
364,"Myself : I’m 26, I work as a journalist in France. I’m passionate about my job but I won’t say I’m ready to do anything for a job, I value the importance of the balance between work and life.

Right now, I’m at the end of a contract in the newspaper where I started my career, in the East of France. I’ve worked there 3 years and a half (I had other great work experiences in Paris and Montreal, Quebec). Journalism is a very precarious job, this contract will be the 25th I’m doing in this company and I’m really tired of it, financially and mentally. 

I like my job there, especially because I appreciate and trust my coworkers and I have the feeling that they trust me as well, whereas I’m still young. In fact, my managers « fought » quite hard to get me an interview for a more stable contract. This interview went well and they will offer me a job that I like and where I’ll be able, at last, to have some stability.

In the meantime, because I thought that this interview will never come, I sent some CVs to newspapers that I really like and where it will be a dream to work. One of them (top 1 on my list) is offering me a 2 week contract in Paris. It’s a big company with a lot of competition. If everything goes ok during this contract, they said I’ll have the opportunity to continue to collaborate with them, but it sure will be very precarious for some time. And I have no guarantee that it will work. 

Thanks to one of my best friend, I will be able to live in Paris for a relatively cheap price compared to the Parisien real estate market, which is a real shit show. 

The problem is that I’m pretty poor and I have a student loan for two years, so I have to be very careful of what I’m doing with my life. My parents can not help me financially. So going to Paris, even if it will be a dream job, is a long shot but something I’m really considering because I value the passion in my job. And it’s still a great opportunity that I fear will never exist again. 

I have calculated that if everything goes badly in Paris and I can’t find a job, I can stay there 4/5 months and I’ll have to leave and live with my parents, far from Paris. So it’s a pretty tight window to find a job in a VERY competitive field, where a lot of companies are not doing very well.

So, I have to chose between:

- A cool job in a great environment with the financial stability I really need

- A dream job with no guarantee it will lasts, but the opportunity is almost too good to be dismissed and I know I will have regrets if I don’t pursue it.",28Oct2019,1
365,"I am in my early 30s, a mother to a 22 month old, wife to a medical student, and a full time worker. I am also on break from getting my masters in nursing because life was getting too overwhelming. I work in another city where my commute averages 1.5 hours one way and that is M-F. I currently am the main provider as my husband pursues his dream, of becoming a doctor. Many months he is away on rotation (4th yr) and when he is home, he helps as much as he can but medical school is stressful and hard so I try to let him focus on that. I went to do my masters before I found out I was pregnant and we were planning on my MIL to help out while I was in school. However a few weeks after my daughter was born, she suddenly passed away of a heart attack and our plans were derailed. It’s hard for my mom to come help as she is not retired yet and I have younger siblings still in college and we are in different states. I continued school with positive thoughts that I could finish it....but now I can’t take anymore leaves of absences. All I have left are clinicals. I am feeling overwhelmed and stressed out myself. I constantly feel like I’m living in crisis mode. I can’t help but wonder if i have too much on my plate. I pay 90% of our expenses, as well as see to the house and childcare when my toddler is home. My husband doesn’t want me to quit my masters because I’m so close and it would help in the future. But I get no help. I basically single parent. At this point in my life I feel like I can’t do anymore without having a breakdown every week. I’m not sure what I want to ask here...just want some insight from an outside perspective I guess. Or maybe ask if it’s too much for me to take on all of this at this season in my life? I don’t want to regret quitting but I also can’t continue to live as though I am going to collapse from the overwhelm.",28Oct2019,1

367,"Okay lemme give you peeps some backround,I'm a shy, this is gonna sound a litle narcistic smart and good looking according to others, tho I have low self-esteem. Now there is a girl I have a crush on for quite some time. Everything thing started changing this September, we haven't had classes together for 3 months becouse I was sick and I didn't go to the school for a month straight then summer holidays started. Anyways, it's the first day we are choosing our class president, the whole time she is just looking at me and smiling, accoss the whole class room,this was anyonimous voting so she walked to the teacher's beanch and left the paper. Then after all votes were counted, I have gotten a  vote. That was a no biggie except me and my friends said that we  would vote for another friend and they did, we in Serbia have beanches were 2 ppl sit so I saw that they voted for him. Fast forward 5 mins,she and 2 more guys made it to round 2 of voting. It was a tought battle between 2 guys and I voted for her. That was her only vote. I winked at her and I think she saw that. Anyways meanwhile on all classes she would like stare sweetly into me and I made sure that wasn't a considence becouse we sit in different positions in Math and History classes. Now on History classes she sits behind me and my friend. That friend didn't show up one day becouse he was sick and one chad says something along the lines you don't sit here that's my place. As I was getting ready to say to that chad to  fricc off,she friccing yelled,, No, that isn't your place to sit!!! '',now she is shy too and I have found that pretty weird and sweet that she like tried to protect me... The sweet stearing continued. Now fast forward to 3 days ago, we were on excursion 'till yesterday around 8pm,so we  visited a lot of locations, had a lot of free time etc. I noticed that she and her 2 close friends were always close to me and my friend. We visited quite a few parks and cafes I noticed when she was in a cafe with 2 her friends she would smile at me and look at me the whole time, same goes with parks. I noticed that when we  made some eye contact she would just continue and I would probably stop it and get red. Now interesting part, during 3 days, we had spent 2 night on the trip, every night we would have to go to the disco, me and her aren't really types of ppl that like to dance, so we just sat accoss the room. Now she would frequently look at me even tho I wasn't directly from her. I winked a few times but I'm not sure if she saw that. Now the second night. We looked a lot onto each other then she started whisspering something to her friends. Now even her friends don't realy dance either. My friend agreed to be my wingman(It isn't anything hookup related to I just want to go to prom with her and generaly get closer to her). Her friends then came close to me and my friend(around a meter or 2, 3 to 6 foot) while we were sitting, they were the closer to us than any peeps dancing.Then I noticed that one of them would have atleast  had to have her eyes on me. I looked a few more times and then her friends run to her.They whisspered something to her and then they came back to the same place in front of us, they danced a litle bit more and I looked and her ofc and she did at me a couple of times. Then she came with them to,, dance'' tho it was all badly made, and I looked at her and she at me. Then she came back to the chair she was sitting. Meanwhile, while satellites did their thing she asked a guy she is kinda close not realy to dance she denied 2 times(plus a few weeks before he denied prom with her, so I think that cards are really on my side rn cuz she is kinda mad at him and maybe she likes me plus he made a few fricc ups, dm me if you wanna know). After all that, she left mid disco time even tho we weren't allowed to leave. Then her friends danced close to me and I had 4 girls dancing to stop me from watching others, maybe? :) And yes me being followed continued one the last day too, plus I forgot to mention that she and her friend sat behind us in the bus even tho that was on plan so yeah. Now confusing part, 5 weeks ago we had a dental cheek up, Boys went first then girls, the teacher started dictating a lot, then we had to ask girls for the first part and girls Boys for the 2nd part. I asked her Via Viber, I have her number and she has mine becouse our class has a group there. I asked her for the 1st part and I said that I will send her 2nd part. I went to take a power nap, meanwhile my mother asked peeps on the group and one other girl I hate. She replied after 2 hours, she was on a training, she said something along the lines like ok, give me 5 mins, then she saw the group chat, and she said ah I see you handeled it.I said that I was sorry and I needed it becouse I had to go help grandparents and she said nothing.2 weeks pass, I didn't go to a school for a day 'cuz I went to a professional orientation, I asked her very nicely to send me what they did etc. She didn' t even see it nor reply.I think that her sister probs deleted it or whatever. We texted each other a litle bit more and it was ok. So yeah I need help, and Anamarija if you're reading this yes I'm Koca (Andrej), ask me if you see this. Plus don't say to me to straight up ask her, I don't have balls for that. Edit:Sorry for probably bad grammar or misspeling.",28Oct2019,1

369,"I (23F) had a good group of friends in the city I grew up in, and I've never really had problems with making friends until now. I don't consider myself awkward, but I'm usually not the person to initiate conversations or put myself out there - I usually let people come into my life and then we end up being friends somehow!

I moved to a new place a year ago - it's a large hippie/beachy town and I absolutely love it. Only thing is, I miss my mates from back home and I'm feeling pretty lonely here. When I first came here, I was at a hostel (many people there were long term) and made a whole bunch of good friends who I saw every day. I always had someone to hang out with and I forged a few very strong friendships. Unfortunately these people have all moved on to new places now, and I'm left feeling quite lonely! I have roommates that I get on with, and a boyfriend, but other than that I only have acquaintances I see in town from time to time. 

So yeah - I'm a bit stuck. I'm not used to having to make an effort to make friends! What should I do? Anyone been in the same situation?

This is nothing new and she's become good at identifying when she's overthinking things.

How do I best bring this up with with her? As I mentioned she has pretty serious self-confidence issues and I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I feel like she really needs to be aware of this.

So let me start by apologizing for the length of time it took to update this for the people that requested an update. Also once again thank you to everyone who helped and commented. Sorry if there are mistakes or any formating issues. Sorry about how long this is as well. I haven't really processed a lot of this myself yet so I am kinda going on a tangent trying to put it all together.


So I have been dreading updating you guys a bit because I feel like I failed my son and all those who tried to help. I wanted to do so much more about this and ultimately wasn't able to do as much as I had intended to. 

I tried pursuing it more with the school and police but my son just completely shut down. When asked by other's if something happened he would just shut down and say no. When asked what had happened he would only respond I don't know over and over again. He stopped talking to me about it altogether. He wouldn't even talk at all sometimes. He became so stressed out and anxious by all of it. He ended up having panic attacks, sensory overload and vomiting from all of the distress. 

The day he started having such intense anxiety and physical reactions to everything I dropped pursuing it altogether. I felt like I was failing him by not doing more but I was not gonna put him through that anymore. These kids had already affected him so much. So I refused to pursue it any longer making him suffer more and things get worse for him. 

He is so different from who he was just a few months ago and it absolutely breaks me. He is depressed, withdrawn, anxious, angry and has zero confidence. His self worth is gone. They took his happiness, joy and inner peace away. It's like they took the rest of his childhood away and forced him to grow up well before he was capable of handling it.

He had this wonderful almost naive childlike innocence he had carried within himself. That has been replaced with pessimism, cynicism and disillusionment. He is left with sadness, self doubt and self hatred. His autism combined with this has left him just a mess and he is going to need therapy for a long time. He is a broken version of who he was. I can't begin to describe how much it hurts to hear him say the stuff he says about himself now. 

So the only thing I knew I could do to help him right now is to take him out of school and keep him in therapy for as long as he needs it. I notified the school he would not be returning this year. He is officially being homeschooled by me and he will continue therapy as well. I am giving him a lot of extra time and attention and setting up more support systems outside of the house for him as well.  

He was very happy to be taken out of school. I could see some of the heavy weight of the stress and anxiety just lift off of him when I told him he wouldn't be going back to school. He actually slept well that night for the first time in a long time. He is now a bit less stressed and anxious throughout the day. He is sleeping and eating a bit better. His daily break downs and depression have decreased a bit as well. 

Like I said though he is still struggling with all of this a great deal. He has changed a lot which of course happens anyway when growing from childhood into adolescence. But the fact is this bullying forced him to do that way before he was ready. This bullying changed his self perception, his self esteem and changed a part of who he is. He will now grow into a different person from who he was going to be. And all of it makes me feel incredibly sad and angry for him. But we will get through this. I intend to help him as much as possible to get his self worth back and for him to have some normalcy again. 

Lastly, sorry again about the long wait for this update. It has been a crazy time in our lives to say the least. Suddenly becoming a teacher and planning a whole school year in less then a month with no experience has been difficult. He also needs a lot of extra care and support from me as well right now. As I said in my first post I am a single disabled mother. As such I have a hard time keeping up with daily life as it is sometimes. And being low income I can't just pay to enroll him in online school so I have to do a lot of work to put together and try to maintain his syllabus for the year.

That being said I don't know if I can ask a question in an update. But if anyone who reads this knows of any good free or low cost educational or homeschooling websites for New York State, suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also any suggestions to help him overcome his self worth and confidence issues would be so greatly appreciated as well. Thank you again to everyone in this sub, you're an amazing community of people. I thank you so much for reaching out to help me help my son. 

TL;DR: Ended up pulling my autistic bullied son out of school, homeschooling him and keeping him in therapy. Pursuing anything more with the school and police was too much for him to handle. He is doing better but this definitely has changed his life and his self worth.",28Oct2019,8
375,"I’m Male 182cm tall lanky slim framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny and on the way home I went the shop for food and a guy was smirking at me looking me down and stared at me facially still smirking. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",28Oct2019,0
376,"I’m a 19 year old male and I feel like I have social anxiety which controls my life too much. 

I just want to list all the things I can think of at the moment that I think are ones that affect me the most. 

Firstly when I meet new people I’m not an extremely “social” or “extroverted” person therefore I’m most definitely awkward a lot of the time and find it hard to great a good first impression when meeting people. But once (and usually it’s the other person who initiates) a conversation/topic in which I can input my five cents is sparked I can talk about and laugh about with the person/s. In addition to this I feel like I do better when there’s at least 2 other people where I “tag along” to whatever is being said and that way am not exactly an odd one, but that being said I feel like this affects my dating life which I’ll explain later. I’ve got quite a few closer friends that I’m fine around but then there’s just friends and even there I can become my awkward self. 

I don’t think me being shy encompasses the underlying issue but because of this I find it hard to do the above. 

Secondly I really overthink what others see/think of me. What I just said could have been dumb or awkward, how I look maybe something is out of place, something doesn’t suit me or others wouldn’t ever wear that ... Because of this I spend a lot of my hard earned money on clothing that is considered fashionable and other products to make me look good, I constantly think about this, although at uni I see people wearing very very low maintenance casual clothes, and from a 3rd perspective I don’t think of them as weird or anything and try to mentally prove to myself that I wouldn’t look out of place at all. But in the morning readying up for uni I cannot force myself to wear something like that and also I cannot wear the same thing too often therefore I end up buying something else. At the moment this has sort of stopped but there’s a very thin boundary stopping me. Just want to mention this isn’t my biggest issue but I feel like it is part of the whole main problem. But in order to do something or say something I really subconsciously drill myself down of “what will the other person think”. 

And thirdly linking back to my social awkwardness it makes me bad at dating. There was this girl I met this March not going into details but she and her group of friends were drunk and randomly added me and a few friends. A week later when uni starts she is in one of my classes, and for the rest of the semester I see her only once a week but start regularly texting. Then in July I get a new job in which I spend 4 days a week in, and we’ve organised to meet up Fridays. The first two times we watch a movie in her car which is only a couple hour meetup, then some of the weeks she couldn’t so we’d go without seeing each other for several weeks at once but still text. Then in middle August we had a conversation and became a couple. One Saturday which I took off work I invited her over and we had planned to cook these dumplings together, did those and then just started watching a movie in my bed (where I think I should of made a move of some sort but obviously too scared to do anything) then she left for home. Another time she drove me home from a performance of her dance group and I think should’ve at least gone in for a kiss. Few weeks later she ghosts me for 2 weeks then breaks up with me over text. So most of our relationship was only over text which I’m not a fan of but irl I’m too scared/anxious to do anything. 

I feel like I mentioned the main things and would really love any advice to help overcome this social anxiety and possibly relationship advice too because that’s all I’ve been thinking about since the text breakup which makes me feel like I’m not good enough because any girl will think I’m too awkward etc etc.

I'm a web developer with 3 years of experience. I have a usual 9-5 job. For the last months it gave me a feeling of void. Coming here every day and leaving feels like a crazy routine and gives me 0 happiness. Also the fact that i can't manage my own time is a big issue to me.  


That being said i really want to start freelancing and working for my clients (don't have any yet. but there are potential small clients from a friend). Most people tell me to do freelance after work and when it's stable, quit the job. But to me, working 8 hours at work and then coming home to code more is just unreal. I feel drained after work and want to enjoy life from other aspects too.   


Now the advice i'm looking is if it would be silly to risk and just quit the job and spend all that free time towards freelance, because right now i'm feeling to comfortable to do anything in my free time. I have enough saving for around 4-5 months.

I feel like I've been going out of my mind lately. Every once in a while, the last few days more so than usual I've been having these moments where I look at a situation and I just know what's going to happen. And it's not like a ""From experience I can tell that this course of event is going to take place"", I mean feeling like I know ahead of time what someone is going to say or do as it happens, as if I've dreamt about them beforehand or something. It usually ends up in me being frustrated because I realize what happens barely ahead of time and it's never something particularly meaningful, last time it was me looking at the teacher and a friend as he spoke of his latest trip to Spain.

 I've tried thinking that it might be myself finding in common situations, but sometimes it gets far too specific for it to be that way. I don't even know what I'm supposed to think at this point, I've always considered myself open to the idea that everything is possible, but...

I have been dating this girl for almost over two months now. She is really great and I love her. From now on we will call her ""E"". Because I dont live at home anymore because of university she hasn't seen my friends yet. They all live somewhere else also study related and we usually see each other in our hometown. 

Because of a week off we all decided to spend an afternoon/evening together to laugh, drink and have fun. E told me she would be drinking that night aswell and we were joking of meeting our groups in the city centre. Her party was at the university campus and me and my friends were at my place which is about a 20m bike ride apart. She wanted to come over and I really liked to see her aswell. I told her she could come over but that I am having fun with my friends in the living room so that for the first moments she would be at my place I wouldn't be with her, she didnt mind this at all. I also told her that it's possible that my friends might walk into my room to get their stuff at times, she didnt care. My friends knew she would be coming as I told them.

She comes over and I let her into my room, we talk for a minute and I go back to my friends. At 0200h at night i tell my friends we call it a night because i want to go to sleep. They one by one kinda go in to my room to grab their stuff (not for any particular reason, just because they got up one by one). They all leave and I go to bed with E. 
She says that my friends were being rude by not even saying hi to her when they came to grab their stuff out of the room. She said it's common decency that when you walk into a room where other people are you are the one to say hi and take initiative in introducing you. I agree with her on this. But I have to admit that I had some trouble with her calling my friends rude. I had an absolutely amazing day with my friends and was defending them at first. I told her that it was probably a misunderstanding of how they went about the situation.
Long story short: she thought I had really dickish friends and said that next time she wouldn't tolerate it. I told her that my friends would never intentionally disrespect her and that they probably didnt think much about it.

Should I call my friends out on it? Or is she overreacting?

396,"  I’ve been offered a PhD position in a research field that I’m really into and have been working with before. My current position as a research assistant ends on the 31. of January which lines of perfectly with the start of the PhD position. There are, however, two “downsides” to the position that I’m vary of:

1. I would have to move to a new city 300 km away. That would result in me not being able to see my closest friends on a daily basis as I’m used to now. I do not consider this to be too big of a deal since it would still be quite easy to go back on the weekends. However, I have at this point established myself pretty well in the city (Copenhagen) that I currently live in and having to move to a new city in less than 3 months would probably results in me having to find an expensive and/or shitty place to live.

2. I would have to spend 12 months of the total 3 years in China, doing research on the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This part I’m really scared of. I don’t know anybody who has studied or spend any significant amount of time in China in order to get an idea of how living there is a westerner would be.

I’m not the most outgoing type of person, so my biggest concern is ending being lonely. All the close friends I currently have, have taken a long time to build up and I am quite afraid that not seeing them as often as I do now would just make me lonely.

My questions are thus two-fold:

Have you ever had to pick up your life and move to a new place away from family and friends, and how did you cope with it?

Do you have any experience with moving to/living/studying in China as a westerner?",28Oct2019,1

Only one of us can go and order else the place will get taken by someone else. So I decided I should go thinking of while she orders someone might misbehave with her. Fuck me. I was giving orders in the counter but still i was looking at her from counter as much as possible. We are 30-40 metres apart from each other. Then she called me and said, check if any other place is free. I'm a hothead and i always ask her why on everything but today I tried to be a nice guy and didnt asked why, instead i said, okay, I'll look for it. Then I called her to a table that was next to the counter. She was upset, i thought she is upset cuz a girl was sitting next to me om that table. So I asked her to sit next to me. She was still upset and kept asking her. Then she told me that something happened. I got tensed and figured out somehow that someone misbehaved from the way her head was down. After 10 or 15 mins, she nodded to me saying did anypne grabbed your breast.

I lost my shit, i asked her to point him out, she said that they left. It was a cheap trick they did, throwing keys on her feet and when she handed them, they groped. I know people are piece of shit. I'm angry at her for not telling me right after they approached. She said she couldn't get out of that moment and realize what happened.

I really disappointed her in the way of handling the situation. I did telled at her for not informing me ASAP. and she asked me what you could have done.

I did walked with her around the mall for the guys but couldn't find them. I dont even know what I should seek from the rest of the world. I have a feeling that is new and don't know what it is.

401,"Hi guys. I really have no idea whether this is the right sub, I haven't needed such advice since I joined reddit yet, but if my post doesn't belong here please let me know. 

So I suffer from C-PTSD and along with that I experience panic attacks. Most times it helps to talk to my bf but he's at uni now sooo... well, I'm about to order some clothes. I totally hate shopping. I'm 25 and during the last 10 years I went shopping for only a few times, I still wear clothes from 10 years ago. I'm just not into it, I have a complicated body, nothing ever fits and I'm also very interested in producing as less waste as possible. However, now I really do need new clothes. Most of my clothes don't fit anymore, some are broken (is that the word? I'm not a native speaker) and I started to dislike most of them, which is probably normal after such a long time. So after a long period of delaying today I decided to give it a go. I've found clothes that should fit well and that I like (more or less). However, in total it would cost about 200€ (approx 220$) and when I saw that number on the screen, I noticed myself panicing. 

And now that I think about the number, I panic again. I really do not have any money. We live together, we're both students are we're barely able to pay our rent, food and such. When my boyfriend left and saw the total prize, he already made jokes about how I shouldn't let it get higher - and it was at 100€ at that point. 

But I need this stuff. Rationally I know that there's no reason to panic. It's not like I'm wasting money because shopping is my hobby or something, I'm not doing anything irrational, I'm simply buying stuff that I really need because I'm trying to practise a little self-care and wearing clothes that are not too small / too big / 10 years old / broken is part of that self-care. 

But telling myself these things doesn't help, I still feel this panic. It reminds me of all of our money problems and how much pressure there is on us. My boyfriend's done with studying next year, however I just started. 

I've been experiencing a very long, intense trauma flashback for the last 5 days, which means I'm basically not able to live like a normal human being because during those periods I'm so oversensitive that everything but my couch is too much. Which is why I have missed uni for a whole week now. I feel like shit, like a failure. I'm sitting at home, trying to buy clothes that I don't have money for instead of being at uni. However, I'm getting off the track. 

*Do you think I should buy those clothes even though I don't have much money?* Or is it too much? If that's important, it includes hoodies, warm sweaters, shoes, socks, underwear, pants, tights and a dress (the only thing I don't need but liked). 

Sorry if that's a dumb question. 

TL;DR: Bf and me live together and have basically no money. I haven't bought clothes for years but really need some new ones now. Even though it's necessary to spend the money on the clothes, I feel extremely guilty for it and am about to have a panic attack.",28Oct2019,1

409,"Hoping this catches a few people's eyes...

Our Christmas tradition has always been buy lots, and lots, and lots, and lots of gifts and receive lots, and lots, and lots of gifts. My parents (Father and Step-Mother) are pretty wealthy, so they just go absolutely ALL out for us. My step-brother and I spend a lot of money on my parents and for each other as well, as we both have families of our own and toddlers to buy for. My parents are very giving people, as they give thousands to multiple charities and their church every year.

Problem 1: Last year, we decided that the next Christmas we would approach the parents about scaling back on the gift giving and try to use the money we spend on each other for families in need. We spend too much time making Christmas lists of stuff we really don't need. Yes, we've been spoiled growing up and yes it's always been great to have these extravagant gift exchanges over the years. But we both have good jobs and make good money, and we just don't need the large amount of gifts. We're also both at a point where we'd be much happier giving these things we don't need to people who aren't as fortunate as we've been. All I need these days are comfortable socks, baby diapers, and damn belt that actually fits me. 

Fast forward to last week. We approached our parents about our idea to scale back and use our money to buy for kids/families in need. We knew this was going to be a tough sell. My father is as laid back as they come and really doesn't care what we do but my step-mom is absolutely crushed. From their perspective, as I previously stated, they already give a lot to charities and their church so they always look forward to giving us things. Every year she decorates the house for two weeks, spends hours wrapping and planning, you guys know, that's just what you do for Christmas. And it's her absolute favorite thing to do every year, by a mile. She took it as we don't want to spend as much time with them on Christmas day. My father called us today and said we have to get this figured out because she's devastated. I knew this wouldn't be easy but I honestly don't know what to do.

Problem 2: If we are successful in making this transition, what's the best way to give to families in need? We've always done the church giving tree stuff, but I'd really like to do something more personal. Instead of just giving random toys and stuff to families that we'll probably never know we'd like to actually buy stuff that a kid actually wants. Yes, I know that less fortunate kids will be happy with anything, but every kid has favorites and it'd just be nice to give them something they'd never expect. I'm very new to this maybe there are some obvious answers/perspectives on how to go about this entire post.

410,"Hi! I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on what to do about a change of heart in terms of my university degree.


I'm about halfway through my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology  and, with all the science involved in the degree, I've discovered an interest and ability to comprehend science that I never thought I had.

I had a strong interest in Biology in High School, but nobody in my family is particularly science-y, and my overall lack of confidence in science made me drop it in my final year.


Now I really wish I had majored in Zoology instead of Psychology.



Would it be in my interests career-wise to switch to a Bachelor of Science in Zoology, minoring in Psychology and Marketing? Instead of a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, minoring in Marketing? 


Cost wise I can afford it, but it will take a very long time to build up enough points to account for a science degree, as everything I have taken so far is in Arts.

If anyone has any sort of experience in changing from an arts to a science degree, or understands the job market from a different perspective to mine, I'd really appreciate some advice!!!

412,"Long version: Sunday morning, i drive up to the gym with my 2 children in the backseat (they go to the kids’s room while i work out). I find a tight parking spot, a bit too close to a hydrant and back into the car parked behind as closely as possible. It takes me minutes to park, i am being very meticulous not to bump into that car and i leave a very tiny space (couple inches) between my back bumper and his bent license plate, that car has tons of space behind it and is parked like 2 feet from the sidewalk, so moving out for them won’t be an issue. Oh goody, i think to myself, his bumper is already all sorts of dented and scratched so the driver is obviously a street parker and we all got messy bumpers to show. This is a busy section in Brooklyn NY with very limited street space. I am in the gym for 2 hours and when i get out with the kiddos, i go to grab an umbrella from my car to go to a Starbucks down the block, and i am confronted by this weird dude who gets way too close to me (i am a 5.4 female and he is a 6+ ft male) and claims to have called the cops because i damaged his car. Now i look and see that my bumper is touching his license plate which it wasn’t before, but even if it is, so what, he still has all that space behind him and his dents are old and don’t even look compatible with my bumper.  I kind of think this guy clearly appears unhinged and menacing and this is some kind of extortion game, so i proceed to go to starbucks and he yells all sorts of things after me, claiming i had committed hit and run and i’ll pay. Come back from Starbucks, get the kids in the car, the dude is still there, still weird, so i wait for the cops who show up minutes later.  Two nypd cops show up, and even after acknowledging his dents are old and not compatible with my bumper, i have nothing sticking out of it to cause sharp angled dents, the deeper scratch he claims was made by me is clearly old and partially rusty (!), no paint on my bumper - they still proceed to write a report ! He also says that he had parked the car in the street the night before and when he came in the morning, these damages suddenly appeared - even is that was the truth, there is zero proof that i made them, who knows how many cars parked in my spot between last night and 9 am ! In the meantime the dude if effing me off, threatening that i am done and acting in all sorts of menacing ways, even refusing to leave after the cops are gone and trying to lock me in the spot. By now, this individual has my name, driver license info, he took pictures of me and i am very disturbed by this more than anything.  So, reddit, what to make of this?  We got lots of scammers and crazies in Brooklyn, but to have the police report filed is insane. In 20+ years of driving, this is my first police report, i barely get tickets, forget about traffic violations.  TLDR",28Oct2019,1

415,"I’m a senior in highschool and I have played basketball since 1st grade. Ever since freshman year basketball has started to become a downhill slope, I absolutely despise it. I dread every single practice and dread the games even more. Last year I would literally pray that my coach didn’t put me in because I didn’t want to play that bad. Nothing about it is fun anymore, my coaches take it too seriously and I only like one of my teammates. The thing is that since I’ve played for so long and I’ll be starting this year I feel extremely pressured to not only play but be really good. My parents grandparents neighbors etc. will be so disappointed if I quit but I really don’t want to do it anymore I want to actually enjoy my senior year. What do I do?",28Oct2019,1
416,"I have been with my boyfriend for nearly three years. Recently I have been feeling very numb and there has just been a shift. I cant say for sure what he even has because he has not sought help. I cant rely on him for support, any time I come to him with an issue he somehow manages to turn it around and talk about himself or his childhood. Last year we got in an argument (because I was talking to one of his friends), he punched a wall and broke his knuckles, he had to be operated on and blamed me for the whole thing. He has said many times that he wants to die. On one occasion he went to the kitchen and picked up a knife but I managed to take it off him, he then kept trying to jump out the window and again I managed to stop him. A few months ago we went on a night out, got into an argument and the entire way home he was cursing and shouting at me, getting in my face, and aggressive eg. hitting walls, bins, anything that was in his way. When we got home he cried that he wanted to die and told me to leave him alone. This is scary for me and not the first time it has happened. I eventually got him to calm down and the next morning he apologised. Then the following afternoon he had another episode and this time was holding a razor to his wrist. Again I managed to take it off him. I feel like any time we have an argument I'm unable to walk away because I think he's going to hurt himself. A few months ago we went for a walk and had an argument, I walked away for 2 minutes and then got worried and turned back, he disappeared for hours and I could not contact him. I was worried the entire time he was going to do something and when I eventually found him he said he was considering jumping off a cliff. I have pleaded with him since last year to please go and talk to someone. He refused for a long time but the time we went for the walk he promised me he would get help. I haven't followed up on it because I'm tired of putting pressure on him and dont want to argue. Recently I've been telling myself that if there is one more incident I'll leave him. I don't know if it's wrong to think like that because unless he gets help it is pretty much inevitable. I can't talk to my friends about this because I don't want them to have an altered view of him and I know what they'll tell me to do, likewise with my family. I feel like I'm his punching bag, he calls me every name under the sun, and I know it's not him its his issues that make him say it but it hurts because it happens time and time again. He is an incredible person but I feel like if he really loved me or cared for our relationship he would try to sort himself out.  I just feel alone and want some advice. Thanks",28Oct2019,1

420,"Hey there. So I'm 19. I've been online friends with this guy for 4 years now. He's depressed 24/7 and mentally exhausting to deal with. I've lost sleep worrying over him and am constantly anxious because I worry he'll kill himself. 

I've also been catfishing him and lying about my identity the whole time. This started when I was 15 and immature as hell. I'm 19 now and in college. I've wanted to leave for FOUR years but I haven't because I'm afraid he'll commit suicide if I abandon him. I've had to ""rescue"" him during mental breakdowns and reassure him that everything's okay 200-300+ times. It's almost been a daily thing.

Recently I've been distancing myself and hardly talking to him. Not out of rudeness, but because I need to put my own mental health first. And it's unfair to lie to him. It's time to go our seperate ways. All's been well until yesterday when I looked at his Instagram spam account. Hardly anyone else follows it but me. He said that he's on the edge of suicide and his home life makes him depressed. When I asked him about it last night, he said there's no use stressing his parents out about it and told me not to worry. He said if his mom or parents knew, it would make everything so much worse. 

Should I contact his mother on facebook, send her the screenshots of him wanting to kill himself, and use a fake account? Here's the thing. I want his parents to be aware so that the responsibility is off my shoulders. I've been caretaking this guy for 4 years and I'm mentally and emotionally drained. At the same time, I'm terrified my friend will commit suicide if he finds out I betrayed him and told his parents. I know him well enough and it sounds like something he'd do.

Also, I'm terrified his parents will get the police involved and track me down. Perhaps they'd want to investigate me if my friend killed himself? Just because I was his friend and all. This literally cannot happen. I'm not who I say I am. My friends and family would be mortified. I've met the man I want to marry and our relationship would be destroyed if he knew I catfished an innocent guy for 4 years. 

I'm so stressed. I'm so anxious. And I'm just sad. What the hell do I do? I care about my friend's wellbeing so much, but I'm super fucking terrified. 

Thanks so much.",28Oct2019,2

I've only ever been planning my future for what they need, as in, I keep talking about going back to school to become a nurse, or phlebotomist, or anything in the medical field. I don't want to work in a hospital, or another nursing home. I don't love my job, just my bosses.

427,"I am currently a full time student and working 2 jobs that clock in at about 60 hours a week. 

In my younger years as a fresh 18 year old I had the very fortunate freedom to chase a dream and gave myself until 24 to become something within that dream and if not, I’d need to go back to school. I screwed around and had my fun but never focused the actual crafting the skill within my dream, just partied. Felt fulfilled and confident in my lackluster decisions. Once I hit 24 I extended it to 25 but reluctantly ended up walking away from the pursuit due to not making much progress. 

I then started working in the field in which I am going to school for to get the license I need to be in a higher position to be financially stable. After a couple of years away from the dream and some growing up, I tried revisiting it with a new “goal oriented” head space but I can’t get back into the mindset of having fun with it and take it too seriously which kills the creativity I once had. I tried to start up hobbies and try new things but nothing is sticking. 

Then last night I was talking to a person that currently holds the license I am working so tirelessly towards and she confided in me, that she too feels a lack of purpose and is not sure where her life is going and that just complete destroyed me and threw me into a deep depression. I’m not sure what’s next for me or what my true purpose is. Can anyone provide clarity? Or maybe personal experience with the same thoughts?

So, a little backstory, I have this friend I met at uni a couple of years ago, but the past few months I've realised I've become quite obsessed with her, something I didn't realise was happening until it was too late.  I think it's a combination of wanting to be with her and wanting to be her (downside of being a lesbian I guess). I think it took me by surprise because she isn't my type at all. 

Anyway, it's getting to an unhealthy level where I've noticed that it is impacting on my mental health. I constantly check her social media, get excited when she messages and when we hang out.

So my current situation, I have a friend staying in my spare room, he was living about 400miles from our hometown before this as his parents moved him closer to them after a suicide attempt. After 4 years he had decided to move back but needed somewhere to stay for a few weeks to get a job etc. I happily offered my spare room thinking he would have a job and be out within a month maximum. It has now been 8 weeks. 
He still has no job, and barely even seems like he is trying to find one, since living with me, he has been claiming benefits and once getting them has been going to the pub and spending it all on alcohol and cigarettes.
I had previously alluded to the fact that he could help to put it towards bills as hes living at mine without paying rent but hes only given me £30 in the time hes been here.
When he first moved in I asked him not to download torrents on my internet, and I only found out he had been doing this after I had a ""cease and desist"" from my ISP ( he was ""sooooo sorry"").......
I found out at the weekend that he has also been helping himself to my beer and food (which again I had asked him not to).
He seemingly claims he has no other friends or relatives that can take him in ( I have a feeling that this is a guilt trip so I dont kick him out) he just doesn't seem to be taking the hint, so how do I tell him to GTFO without sounding like a massive a**hole?",28Oct2019,1

However, I’ve become disheartened about my chances of getting into grad school for this because they’re competitive programs and the job market in my state isn’t great for either.

I do still plan on applying for both though.

I also plan to apply for a Masters in Cyber Intelligence. I work for an IT company and have experience in basic IT, entry level programming, website management and design, SEO, etc. The program is meant for people who don’t have that much of an IT background, but want to learn and get experience which is perfect for me. I may or may not get in though and may or may not land a career out of it. 

The final degree I plan to apply to is for my JD at a local (but well known) law school. I think I have a fairly good chance of getting in because I have the references, a solid GPA in undergrad, and will be taking a prep course for the LSAT.  

 I really like the idea of going to Law school because the campus I’d be attending is ONLY for law students. I’d get a chance to be part of a community again, which I wasn’t able to do much of in undergrad because I always had to work and took half of my classes online. 

I would also love to be able to spend my life helping people. I’ve always wanted to be a leader in my local community, be able to get into politics,  and make my family really proud.  I would love to one day be a judge in the juvenile court system. I feel like with a JD my options are endless and I could go into a lot of different subsets of law.

I have a dilemma. My boyfriend took my house keys to work with him which means I can't lock the house when I leave for work. He can't come back home to give me my keys because he works about an hour away and it's his first day back after finishing his courses (so it would look really bad).

I contacted my boss who got angry about this stupid situation and so I feel compelled to leave the house open and go to work. I work in an office that sometimes gets busy. My coworker has the day off today, so they would be down 2 people if I don't go in. But, that happens sometimes and it's usually manageable.

We live in a suburban neighborhood that seems pretty safe (haven't heard of any break ins near us) and the weather is also terrible today (cold, icy, snowy) which means I doubt many people will be out and about.

So what would you do? Go to your job and leave your house unlocked or say ""yeah I fucked up but I can't leave the house today""?",28Oct2019,1
443,"Here's a back story.

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 6 years now, I'd admit that I'm losing interest in our relationship and in her generally.
I still care for her, but I don't know if I still feel in love. I'm always lost and unhappy when around her. We often have fights these past few months. Its really depressing...

Then there is this other girl around where I work, she works beside our store. For the first month that I've worked there we never really talked or interact with each other until a month passed, just a subtle eye contact and we look away from each other. A few weeks passed and we now smile at each other whenever we do an eye contact, one day we had lunch with our colleagues, we didnt really talked that day. A few more weeks passed and she asked me if I want to have lunch with her. I said yes, so we had lunch together and talked about work stuff. Now I don't know how we got to this point, one day we had lunch together and we were crossing the street and she grabbed my arm while we were crossing. I thought it was just nothing.

Then our colleagues planned to drink out at a pub one night and they told me to invite her, and I did and she said yes she'll come with us. She was working at a different store that night so I had to come pick her up with my motorcycle. I picked her up and we went to the pub. We sat next to each other the whole night. She had a little bit much to drink so she was pretty tipsy, I didnt drink that much cause I was gonna drive her home. On our way to her house, she was leaning on my back trying to sleep, I had to wake her up because that's too dangerous and told her to stay awake. I dropped her by her house and we gave each other a hug.

The day after that, we got pretty close, fast forward a couple of weeks. started talking and messaging each other and we always get lunch together.

A few days ago I asked her to come hang with me, we went on this tiny cafe, stayed there for a couple of hours, I was lying on her shoulder, she was stroking my hair with her hand. She also layed on my shoulder.

A few days after that we went on a park, I held her hand for the whole time we were there. She layed on my shoulder again and I did the same, we were there for an hour. When I was gonna take her to the station where she would commute to go home, she walked close to me took my hands and put it on her and she hugged me and I embraced her tightly and kissed her forehead.

Whenever I'm with her, I feel alive. I don't have these thoughts of not wanting to live anymore. We're both attracted to each other and she is a really nice person.

But there's something inside me telling me I don't want to be with her, because I don't want to hurt her and I don't want the same thing that's happening in my relationship with my girlfriend to happen to us.

I know I'm doing all kinds of wrong things behind my girlfriends back and she doesn't deserve it. Nobody does.

444,"So I [F,23] went on a date with this guy [M,27] I met off the dating app Hinge. We chatted for a day before I gave him my number. The conversation has been nothing but great from the start. Actual conversation not, “so you’re hot send me nudes” hookup culture bullshit. We even had a conversation about hookup culture and we both are on the same page that’s it’s quite ridiculous. 

He asked if he could take me out on a date last Friday and I agreed. He lives about an hour away from me and I like the food more in his area so I decided to drive there. He took me out to sushi as we discussed that’s one of my favorite things. As soon as we got in the car the conversation flowed effortlessly. It didn’t stop all night. We are and he picked up the $70 bill (which I thought was reaalllllyyy nice). He asked if I wanted to get a drink at this corner brewery in downtown and I agreed. We ended up going upstairs of this bar and watching baseball for about an hour. Conversation still flowing. He then asked me if I wanted to go back to his house, but not in a douchey demeaning way. I agreed.

We went back to his house and he was showing me around and what not. We ended up having sex (which I don’t think having sex on the first date is taboo. If the attraction is there it’s there. But I don’t make a habit of sleeping with random men and am definitely not into one night stands.) He was nice about everything. 

He walked me out and before I went out the door he said, “I hope you make time for me in the future.” And gave me a kiss goodbye. I said I would. 

It’s been 2 days since I’ve heard from him but he was also with his friends and family all weekend for a celebration of some sorts.

To the point of just saying ""im going to kill myself"" after any minor inconvenience. However, I have never went around asking people how sad they would be if i killed myself.

I kinda know that the message was a joke, but a joke like that makes me concerned for whats actually going on.

So, should i go to my school or not?",28Oct2019,2
447,"4 weeks ago, i didn't reply to this friend for one week because i was incredibly busy and due to depression.(I got a new job, i was sick and I had guests over). I left her on read, and honestly forgot to reply.

She messaged me a week later ""hey, was it something I said"". I told her of course not and explained why. And then we started talking like normal.

but for the following 3 weeks, she replies to me exactly once a week, saying the same things I told her(she had guests, she has depression, she was busy)

We used to chat almost every day. Sometimes she wouldn't reply to me for 3-4 days, but i never asked her if it was because of something I said. She was simply busy so I understood, but when I do it I feel like she's making me feel guilty for it (that's why she only replies to me once a week). She also makes sure she leaves me on read, every time, and she only replies the next week.",28Oct2019,1
449,"Im in college right now and just got a girlfriend. Theres this dude that also likes my gf and every time im not around he would try to get really close with her. 

He would start drawing doodles on her book with cute message on it. My girlfriend even told him not to sit at my place which is beside her. But he doesnt leave until I arrive. I even told him both of us are dating but he plays dumb acting as if he doesnt get the message. He follows us everywhere whether it be lunch, at the library studying or in class. I guess class is somewhat unavoidable..

Another reason why we don’t like him around is bcuz he fked over with my gf’s friend’s feelings. Btw my circle of friends is my gf, me n hers friend. All of us dont want him around.

451,"Sorry for the long read. So I’m 21, I have a great family, I have a girlfriend who I think could be the one (still unsure), and I’m in community college learning to become an electrician/HVAC worker, and then possibly getting in engineering degree in that field after. Now this may look great and all that, but I feel miserable. 

This all started my sophomore year of school, at the same community college I’m at now. I started majoring in finance and did well my freshman year of school hoping to transfer to a prestigious business school to get a job in investment banking, and I was on the right track; high gpa, getting involved, have connections to my cousin who worked for a hedge fund, so on. Then sophomore year came along and I started to doubt that career path, that I was in it for the money only, I didn’t want to be stuck behind a desk, so I switched to undecided, and then eventually pre med (yeah crazy I know) and then transferred to a 4 year school to continue pre med. 

At the 4 year school, I completely was unfocused because of a few unfortunate events within my family, and basically failed out. I could’ve switched back to business at the university but chose to do a fresh start at the community college by doing the trade program there with the electrician/HVAC program because I do like working with my hands; the program is also connected to an engineering bachelors degree program which is very good. But here I am, wondering why I left finance and fucked that all up in the beginning, as shallow as it sounds, I like luxurious stuff, I like finance, but I also don’t want to work behind a desk, and then kick myself for even thinking of doing something just cause of money and material BS. 

I also gained weight (not fat or anything, still relatively skinny just super out of shape and a few pounds added on). Stopped wearing my retainer so my teeth shifted back, tried wearing it again but it hurts so much. And just not happy for whatever reason. I don’t know if I still want to be with my girlfriend forever, I love her to death and she’s my best friend but I’m so young. I tend to overthink everything as well, I just need help or advice, especially with my career path.

Her response was “I’m down as long as we can find time in our hectic schedules”.

Over the weekend, I was out of town and my car was parked on the street in San Francisco. Came back to my bumper almost entirely off and a note w contact information. I just called her and she said that she would prefer for me to get an estimate and handle this personally without insurance. 

Is that a good idea? I am open to it, but I want to make sure that I am limiting my liability and that I don't get scammed or something. She seemed like a very sweet old lady on the phone but I know that doesn't actually mean anything. 

Also of note, the mini mart below my apartment saw the whole thing and said something to the effect of that she ""probably shouldn't even be driving"" and seemed very out of it. I am also considering the fact that she wants to keep insurance out of it to ensure that she doesn't lose her license/was potentially intoxicated, but I have no actual evidence of that.

464,"Hi everyone, 
So I work as a junior architect at a small firm in NYC. Really nice residential projects but the office is falling apart and I've been here for 6 months. 

I started to get a feeling something was wrong mid September.  The firm only had about 3 active projects left and 2 are very close to completion. There has been a lot of talk of potential projects but nothing has been coming in. It's reached the point where no one comes in on time and barley works! Feels like I'm on board the sinking ship. 

About two weeks ago the principal (my boss) and his #2 and #3 call the 3 others of us in one at a time for a meeting. I was thinking this was it it's over for me here. But the contrary they wanted to tell me I've been an asset to them and they want to keep me on but told me the office is switching to a 4 day work week to stay afloat. This means less pay! I wasn't pleased to hear that part. Here's the weirdest part my boss said ""If you'd like to look for another job by all means, even #2 is getting another job, (and she was nodding) and if you need help getting another job let us know, but maybe it can be part time for you so we could still have you on."" it was all the talk, all at once. I was perplexed by all of this and didn't know what to say but all I said was I appreciate you telling me the situation. 

By the looks of it were not getting busier any time soon. Out of the five employees one is moving away back to Australia till next year Another are also going away for long travel. My boss is barley in the city. It's me and my other co-worker now in the office sitting on our asses. 
Everyone is on the way out. 
I know the situation could be worse but honestly  I'm just not happy here anymore and feel so unmotivated to be here. 
I graduated this past year. now have a just bit over a year of experience with a previous job, included.  I started applying to other firms. But really got me in a rut not hearing back from firms and just thinking about my resume. 

I want to tell my boss that I want to be at a much larger firm. I do have a good relationship with him we talk and he is very friendly but when I take a step back it’s clear I’m not work for a firm at all more so this needs to be done help me out. So should I have a serious sit down with my boss and ask about looking for job connections or just get a hold on wait to get an offer myself and then jump ship?",28Oct2019,1
465,"Basically I was working at my work place for a few months and completely learned and presented everything. It seemed as if I worked there for years!

Boss had noticed it was perfect, there is only one position higher and it was with another higher qualified and experienced co worker. 
We were very fair and I didn’t mind. 

Then, a unfortunate life event had occurred and I had left without notice for a period of time approx 1 and 1/2 months. 

I did let them know unfortunately just not in advance 

But they have decided to take me back and I am grateful. 

At this point now the upper position coworker is leaving, I would be doing her  positions tasks basically taking over because I am most experienced and good at the job. 

I feel and know from coworker as well that I should be taking over her position and obviously the benefits and pay. 

I just wonder what would you guys advise on when to bring this up. I will prove myself and I kinda have already but don’t mind waiting a little longer even though at that point benefits aren’t really going to matter at this point. 


Should I wait till the end of the year? Should I bring it up before hand? What would be the best way in these circumstances.

470,"**TL;DR** \- I (F/40s) have a meeting with my grandboss (my boss's boss) on Thursday and I worry I'll accidentally throw my boss under the bus or bring some unintended drama to the mix, looking for a way to frame my concerns and issues in a meaningful way.

Context: My boss and I are the only new hires to our team, both of us were hired this year. The other coworkers have all worked together at least six years, some more than 10.

Recently a co-worker ""Ann"" who is one level above me but not my manager, stepped in regarding a situation that was not hers to manage but my boss was on PTO and not available. I was insulted and embarrassed that she did this, I let her know I didn't appreciate it, and when my boss was made aware, he was also pissed. I'm told by two coworkers I trust that Ann did not intend anything bad by doing it, it came from a good place of trying to help me, but my boss hasn't laid the law down with her about boundaries and that it shouldn't have been done in the first place. He proposed months ago that she mentor me since I'm new to the company, but I declined the idea due to personality conflicts, he has since shifted her mentorship to a young staff member but she's not doing well with that and apparently still thinks I'm hers to keep an eye on as well.

I like my boss as a person but I'm not sure how effective he is, and I know this is all his to deal with but he doesn't seem to be trying (or really aware he should). Part of the issue is that our team doesn't think he's effective either, and they don't trust him (which is likely why Ann jumped in). I don't want to throw him under the bus with my grandboss, but I think it should be brought to light because it WILL happen again with Ann until our boss says something. I've let my boss know I feel like it's his to deal with because I don't know their history, if this is something he's addressed with her previously, etc. 

There are other issues I plan to raise for his insight that are unrelated to this, but this is a notable thing and it's hard to avoid.

How should I approach this without causing drama with interested parties, making a tattler out of myself, and also making the meeting productive?",28Oct2019,1
471,"    I’m in college meaning that I am surrounded by people and teachers. But, I’m having an issue with my “focus”.  Whenever I have to do classwork and when someone talks (It doesn’t matter who, but is usually teachers) I lose my focus, and I can’t have it back as I grow restless and things just won’t go well for me because the only one affected would be me.  Literally, I had to get out of the classroom to “reset” my brain. It worked until the professor spoke again (explaining the class, etc...)  I don’t know what to do and this is not good for me because well....is college and I need to keep up. For example, today in class we had to do an investigation about a subject and I was writing the introduction. I already had it structured and knew what to write until the professor spoke again, and my brain just switched off leaving me in thin air. I had forgotten what I was going to write and “how”....:

For me to work better, the room must be silent without a voice or noises. 

Then I grew restless and frustrated and stopped doing the assignment because my brain “fried itself” and now I have some sort of mental lock or something like that. My body is restless as well, my legs as well (like the restless leg syndrome?) and now I’m irritated as I’m writing this because I couldn’t concentrate again.

472,"This is kind of a weird one, so buckle up. Obviously a throwaway.

So, I know everyone sometimes has dreams of becoming rich and/or famous. I get it. 

But I feel like something is... wrong with me. 

I've always liked music - ever since I was young; liked to sing, learned guitar and piano; always writing songs. That fell away when I started getting bullied super hard in school. I abandoned the thought of ever doing anything related to music because I'm so self conscious and have no confidence. 

I've sang in front of people before and they tell me I have a great voice (I'm sure it's just average); even won a couple karaoke contests. But that doesn't mean I'm good enough to become a *professional*. That would be delusional. 

I work full time right now and I'm saving to pay off some bills and get my own place. I haven't played guitar or piano in over a year and I only sing to myself in the car. But lately, I have this really weird... need to write music. And of course the fantasy is that it gets really popular and I get a following. 

The fantasy is never centered around being famous - it's more centered around my voice and thoughts being heard; being creative; living up to my potential and being recognized for that. I think I just feel like I have a lot of things to say and I want people to feel my feelings with me through music. (That feels like it sounds moronic when I type it out.)

Now here's the thing, I've become... obsessed with this idea recently. I don't know if it's a mood thing or what. I was considering buying a microphone and mixer and guitar so I could start recording, but that's ridiculous. I definitely don't have enough savings to do that. 

I'm aware that a career in music is beyond difficult to be successful at and is basically just a cesspool of nepotism and marketing/branding tactics. In fact, I usually severely dislike ""celebrity worship"", but I have this... need to be successful at it. What is wrong with me?

475,"Alright, here's the situation.

I'm currently studying abroad with my university and after the program finishes, I plan on traveling through Europe for a couple weeks with some friends. However, since these plans were made, one of my buddies and I were made aware that the third friend we'd be traveling with was a pathological liar. Long story short, there were times he would verbally assault his girlfriend before coming to hang out with us, and we'd have absolutely no idea anything had happened. No signs of distress, no changes in behavior, nothing. One time he returned with a cut on his face, and while he passed it off as a nick from a sharp fingernail, I later learned it resulted from smashing his head on a door. These stories were delivered with the utmost confidence, and I was honestly unable to pick out any signs that might've led me to believe he wasn't telling the truth. Before the summer, I claimed some distance and didn't really speak to him.

After returning to college, he seemed to be a completely changed man. Sober (once relied heavily on substances) and with a restrengthened belief in religion, I thought he had gotten some help. We caught up, and I began to trust him again. However, I quickly learned that he had been lying to his girlfriend about his sobriety (without her even inquiring about his drinking habits), and I catch him in small lies from time to time. He is apologetic and understanding of his wrongdoings when called out, but his guilt only lasts until he believes you have forgiven him, and nothing about his behavior changes. 

Both my other friend and I don't feel comfortable traveling with this guy after the program ends. Our plans are real loose, and I'm realizing we're going to have to rely heavily on each other to make things work, but I don't think that I am ready to engage in a cross-country journey with someone who, and I quote, ""doesn't see how his actions have an affect on others"". I've reached out to some friends for advice, but they all feel like I'm abandoning him in Europe for two weeks, despite all my reasonings.

What do I do? We leave in about a month, so I don't know if it's too late, or even moral, to tell him we're changing our minds about our plans. He had put me into such a state of disillusion that I don't even know what to believe from him, even when it seems like he's being perfectly normal, but I can't help but feel some guilt in the idea of just leaving him. Do I push through the two weeks of travel, or is there a way that seems humane to inform him we feel it's necessary to part ways? I really want to enjoy the experience, but can't help but feel like I'll be paranoid beyond belief the entire time.",28Oct2019,3

exactly this time last year my mental health was at an all time low. i was majorly depressed and suicidal. i had to delete my instagram, snapchat and facebook accounts and apps because i was so tired of it all. i also did it in a way as a cry for help (spoiler: no one found a way to check up on me) which really made things worse on me given the state i was in. 

i’m okay now. i pulled myself out of it around december of last year. i had to leave my job in january for a ridiculous reason not related to my mental health, and it took until earlier this month for me to find a new job. 

my problem is that i’ve still had a super hard time with the loneliness and isolation. i only have one friend who lives on the other side of the state. i’ve been interacting with a lot of people at my new job. i have good and bad days/moments. i don’t have friends, per say, but i’m happy with how things are progressing. i take it one day at a time, sometimes even an hour at a time because of triggers. other than that, though, i don’t have much of a way to connect with people. i have a huge urge to get back on social media. i just don’t know how to do it. i don’t know what to post or say. i know that i want to do it. it’s figuring out that initial step that’s difficult because i’ve quite literally had to relearn how to socialize. 

does anyone have any advice? it would be so incredibly appreciated.

TLDR; i need advice on how to come back on social media after being away from it for over a year, because i had to recover from a severe episode of depression, isolation and anxiety. i don’t know what to say or post..",28Oct2019,2

483,"Hi guys.

So I've been offered this job as a hardware and software support maintenance type of guy for this company in my town. It seems like quite a lot of work and pretty independent (which I prefer). This is in Sweden btw. 

The pay they offered to me when they called me to offer me the job was about 2,370 dollars a month plus like 250 dollars for extra work. I was hoping to get a pay of at least 2,580 dollars a month. They claimed that they can't offer me higher and that it's the standard pay for a guy with no experience. I'm twenty one btw. 

The job seems pretty good and the people there seem nice, good hours and weekends off, regular benefits.

What do you guys think?",28Oct2019,1

I have a shift today that is from 3:00-10:00. The last 3 hours isn’t so bad because after 7:00 they let you listen to music and stuff, but before that feels like forever. I would ask my managers for more work when I am done but they throw me on a cash register and because I have social anxiety that’s a big no no.

486,"I recently found out that I had completed all of my required credits to graduate from high school this December. My parents are both very opposed to the idea, but their only arguments are that one more semester will help boost my subpar gpa (only by about .2), and that I won't have anything to do during my time off. I was planning on working more to save some money for college, and possibly doing a volunteer program abroad (something like [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net))

Right now, I'm enrolled in a dual-credit school, and by December I will have 37 credit hours. If I stayed another semester, I would be able to do up to 15 more, but they would mostly be electives, as I have all but one of my gen-ed classes completed. I'm getting these credits from a local community college, so I know they probably will not transfer to the four-year colleges I'm applying to, as most of them are out of state. It feels pointless to take classes that I don't need in order to graduate and that might not transfer (also, though I get a discount, I still have to pay for these classes.)

Also, I'm just feeling really burnt out. I haven't had much of a break since I started this program in Aug 2018. I got perfect scores in all my classes (maybe not impressive for some people but I was a failing student my first two years of HS :) ) I did extra summer classes, I went on a cultural exchange to Japan, and I started working at a great job that is giving me tons of experience for my intended major and career. I feel like this break would be good for me, and give me some extra time to prepare for college :)

489,"Little context to start - I live in the UK, and about two days ago, we had a carbon monoxide poisoning scare in my house. The source was in the downstairs flat (owned by the neighbours I’m worried about) and set off our alarm two floors up. The fire brigade pumped the whole property through and everyone inside was checked over by paramedics who didn’t have any worries.

Since then, we haven’t seen or heard said neighbours. This isn’t unusual, we haven’t lived here for long, don’t know them well, rarely cross paths, but I’m an anxious person.

This morning, there was a weird smell coming from their flat, and it’s gotten worse. I tried knocking on the door and ringing the doorbell but have had no answer. It’s entirely possible they’re out as I have no idea what their jobs or schedule are, but I am worried.

Then my best friend said, “Well, if there was a baby in the road and a kitten, would you kill the baby or the kitten?” And her girlfriend said she would kill the baby. They both basically said they would kill the baby. It fucked me up. Who would rather kill a human life than an animal? It just made me really mad. They didn’t understand why I was so upset.

496,"Okay, so this is probably a stupid question, but I really just need some good advice haha.

So, i’m in High School and I have seen this guy countless times this year and every day we make eye contact like 5+ times a day, which is kinda strange cause there are many people in my school. He is 2 years older btw. The reason I like him is cause i feel this really weird undeniable connection towards him.  

One of my guy friends is friends with him and he has told me about him, thats how I found out his name and stuff like that. 
But the thing is, I can’t stop thinking about that guy. He is on my mind like 24/7 and we have never even talked. I have liked him for like 3 months now. The amount of times we have made eye contact in the weirdest situations, even if its just for a split second while we pass each other down the hall. I think he feels it too tbh. Like I would catch him talking to his friends and then they all kinda look at me at the same time and smile (which i think is kinda weird) 

But anyway sorry for talking so much about that boring topic. 

So about 5 days ago I finally got the balls to message him (and we have never talked irl.) So He was really sweet and didn’t give short scrubby answers and was really nice (but it was really awkward) but we didn’t really talk much (just like 9 messages between us) and he said he had to go sleep.
Oh and he ended with “Goodnight (my name) maybe i’ll see you tomorrow”
I didn’t even see him the next day lolol
But honestly he didn’t really seem interested

And we haven’t texted since, cause i just thought that if he really was “interested” he would have messaged me again right? Cause I don’t wanna seem clingy or weird by messaging him again if he clearly doesn’t seem interested. BUT I DON’T KNOW. I’m scared he thinks i’m weird that I just have his number or know who he is or something like that. UGHHHHH
Should I wait for him to message me? Or should I just message him? Omg please help cause i really am clueless.

Right now, I’m scared and freaking out. I’m a mom to two special needs children and I have no idea what is going to happen. 

Okay, let me start off by saying I’m 28/F. When I met my now husband, I had just left my ex husband after a year of marriage due to his constant drug use, alcoholism and him trying to kill me. I wasn’t perfect, but I was working 3 jobs trying to support us. I had just lost 100+ pounds and wanted more for my life. He got really insecure, tried to kill me, and I booked it. 

I met my now husband a month later. Long story short, it was chaotic in the beginning. He was super douchey, there was constant miscommunication, we were drinking heavily and somehow I ended up in this weird love triangle with his best friend who fell in love with me. That was a mess. I got pregnant after 3.5 months of just knowing my husband, we weren’t even serious. After I got pregnant, things settled down, the drinking and fighting stopped and we found we actually got along pretty well. Something that really bothered me was he was completely unaffectionate and didn’t like PDA. I thought it was me, and that was the constant source of our fighting over the next several years, until he was diagnosed with autism after our oldest was diagnosed with autism. A lot of things started clicking. 

By now, within 6 years, we are two kids deep. He has a drinking problem and is a functional alcoholic. After the birth of our second child, things were super hard. When we met, he was of bodybuilder status and I was super fit, gym rat. After a few months of being together, we gained weight because we drank a lot, we were going out a ton. I got pregnant and gained 30 pounds and I gave birth at 173, from my usual 125. I snapped back after the first child, but after the second child began my nightmare. I started having all of these health problems and after years of searching, being so unwell, my husband missing a lot of work, tons of money spent on doctors appointments, a hospital psych stay, I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos, POTS, severe venous pooling, hashimotos. I could barely take care of my kids, I gained a ton of weight and was over 200 pounds. In the last 2 years, we’ve had sex probably 5 times. And that brings me to me being asexual. I thought something was wrong with me always. I’d have my hormones tested constantly. My thyroid has been in range and fine for a while because I work out and eat clean. I had the ovary hormone tested. I’ve had imaging. 

I have no sexual desire ever, I don’t think about sex, need sex, I could live without it forever. I think people are attractive for sure, but I never get hot and bothered over anything. I can reach an orgasm by a vibrator but it’s hard. Sex has been the number one issue besides finances in our relationship. I don’t ever want to have sex and he needs it all the time. I also don’t think I’m attracted to him anymore. He has let himself go and I’ve even told him, he just doesn’t care, he wants to drink all the time but he says he drinks because of me. I’m not innocent though, I was diagnosed with bipolar as a teenager. My moods have been totally fine, I just went on medication about 8 months ago and WOW everyone has noticed a dramatic change. It’s been great, Zoloft has helped tremendously. The only thing that got worse was my impulsive money spending. I had been in therapy for it, and when I’m manic, I will spend a lot of money. I recently spent $600 in a month and I just feel sick over it. So I do have the money spending issues. Other than that, we never really fight, but we (HE) avoids everything and I’m a huge confronter. We went to marriage counseling after I threatened to leave him over his lying and drinking. We went and we talked a lot about my finance issues, our therapist recommended several things we could do to lessen our financial load. My parents gave the same advice. I begged him to because I told him I couldn’t stop spending money alone. That I desperately needed help and he just sat by and watched it all unfold. 

Everything is in his name. We have one bank account- in his name. I’ve been a stay at home mom the last 5 years, since right before my first son was born. My credit is horrible thanks to my ex husband plus medical debt that I’ve accrued over the last few years. Whoever said medical debt doesn’t hit your credit is a liar. Car, his name. The bank account is in his name. House is in his name. Utilities, everything is in his name because like I said I have horrible credit. I don’t want to take all his money, I just don’t want to be screwed over and be thrown out on the streets when we both agreed that I’d be a stay at home mom. I gave up my life raise and do everything to my two autistic sons and it’s been effing HARD. My husband is spiteful, angry, stubborn and I feel like he will be petty and just mad that it didn’t work out that he will try and screw me. I just want to make sure that I’m not on the street. We’ve been married for 3.5 years. What can I do now? I have no degree 😩 I have my HS diploma, I’ve worked at several daycares, was a nanny for several years, have tons of customer service experience. The only thing holding me back is I’m not sure how I’m going to get a job if my husband is at work and my youngest isn’t in school yet and we can’t afford daycare yet. We have no one to watch him either 😭😭",28Oct2019,1

I try to reach out to my old friends, to catch up and to hang out. They say they’ll look when they can and eventually I don’t get a response anymore. 
My other friend goes to a university a bit further away, and when I asked her to hang out/go to a party for halloween, she said she wasn’t going home that day and that there was nothing interesting in her city to do together all the while she had mentioned on facebook she was going to an event.

Don't get me wrong, I still do all of my homework, but it's always a challenge and I'm hating every second of it.

My current plan is to find an entry-level job when undergrad ends, and then go to grad school like a year later.  I'm not even sure I'll be able to do that though, because it's just a psych degree.

Does anyone have any tips of overcoming this burnout?  Do online classes sound like a good idea?

509,"On Saturday my (15M) dad was happy one time, but then from what I heard, he was arguing with his fiance about her wearing something revealing, and left with doors slammed and yelling outside. He came back silently and went upstairs and remained up there for most of the day, and that's where my brother(13M) stayed. Knowing this, he probably got the anger of my dad thrown onto him. On Sunday, I figured out why. He apparently went across the street to a gas station/supermarket to get a drink, but never told my dad. He then yelled at him and told him as long as he'd be with him (my parents are divorced and we alternate between houses), he wouldnt be able to hang out with friends unless there was parent supervision for the next year. That shut the house up real quick. No words were said unless they were really small conversation, but nobody talked to my dad or each other unless needed. Today, when going to school, my dad started talking. He told us that no one talked to him yesterday, and no one talked to him all week about how he was and if he needed anything (he had a surgery on a cyst near his hip which limited his physical abilities), but I can't seem to talk to him, I feel like anything I say would ruin his mood and I always keep silent. He told us that we hardly interact with him and hardly talk to him anymore and what hurt me the most and made me cry was ""I dont even know you two anymore."" He then said ""I'm gonna fucking die. I dont know when, it could happen anytime, but there are some days where that day couldnt come any faster."" That made me really concerned. I want to talk to him but I dont know how to. It's hard to talk to him these days. What do I do? If you need information let me know, I'll give what I can. Sorry if there are holes in the story that need to be filled, I'm a bit emotional right now",28Oct2019,0

Hi there redditors, I need a little advice on what to do here. My gf's brother and his wife have a 3month old baby and recently decided to be antivaxxers. Me and my gf are quite literate in science and know about how dangerous the anti-vaccine movement can be. (My mother lost all muscle in her left leg because she didnt get vaccinated for polio in time).
 My gf was talking to her mom and expressed her views on how dagerous and lethal it can be for the baby if not vaccinated. Every argument is pushed aside with ""you gotta respect their beliefs"" or ""thats just your opinion"".

The rest of the family isnt necessarily anti-vax, they are just impossible to reason with. Nobody will stand up and say anything in fear of ""disrespect"". The worst is, that another family member is a nurse, and she too will not voice concern because she wants to stay respectful. 
My gf is being looked down on as someone that just wants ""to start a fight"", and thinks she is ""always right"".

We live in Europe, while they live in Australia (WA).

My gf has a real concern for her baby niece, as she knows even Measels can be seriously damaging or even deadly to babies. Its also hard on my gf to be branded as someone who attacks her family's ""belief systems"" when all she wants is a healthy niece. Its affecting family relationships. 

Is there any advice you have, since reason and conversation seems impossible? 


Thanks in advance.",28Oct2019,1

Hi guys.

So I've been offered this job as a hardware and software support maintenance type of guy for this company in my town. It seems like quite a lot of work and pretty independent (which I prefer). This is in Sweden btw.

The pay they offered to me when they called me to offer me the job was about 2,370 dollars a month plus like 250 dollars for extra work. I was hoping to get a pay of at least 2,580 dollars a month. They claimed that they can't offer me higher and that it's the standard pay for a guy with no experience. I'm twenty one btw, not my first job but I have limited experience in this field of work.

The job seems pretty good and the people there seem nice, good hours and weekends off, regular benefits.

What do you guys think?",28Oct2019,1

Obviously this really disrupted my sleep cycle and I already have sleep issues. I was unsure of how to approach the topic of payment. Normally she pays $10/hr for when I have him in the evening. 

I got there right at 3:30 like she asked, however she didn’t leave until right at 4. I got him up and ready and he was on the bus by 6:45. She sent me $25 on cash app. 


I’m a little angry because she didn’t even pay me for the full $10/hr that I usually get (which I was there for) and I was expecting more for it being such a wack time of night.

So, my best friend has been suffering from low self-esteem and sadness for a long time, but right now, it's getting much worse.
She started having sessions with a psychologist nearby and it was the only way she could take everything out of her chest through words since she just couldn't say the truth when someone asked her about her feelings.
Yesterday her father decided somehow that the psychologist isn't helping her, it's making her worse instead, so she's not going anymore. 
Today, she showed me some notes she wrote yesterday. It was pretty obvious that the note was directed for her father and that she needed help immediately.

540,"i recently ( about 2 months ago) got a new job at a small cafe in my town. While i was very excited at first there had been many problems in my eyes and this being my second job ever i don’t know if i should be concerned or if i’m overthinking it and making problems out of nothing and would love any advice i can take 
When i first started out i found it hard to take breaks because obviously when it gets busy you need more people but if that happens when i’m going to take my break they keep me on and that leaves me not taking my breaks sometimes or them getting annoyed. It’s gotten to the point my coworker has had to tell them to allow us and keep up with breaks because they don’t. 
As well as my two bosses i guess one is just her mom but they hardly trained me on drinks and mainly left it to the workers and is now “training” me in food just a couple days ago after almost 2 months of working there. 
I was left to my own devices on my second day in food on the busiest day and when i asked for help she expected me to be able to do everything myself and left me alone not even considering switching even though i mentioned it earlier that day. Allowing me to be in the back almost having a panic attack alone while she helped my other co worker in the front. 

Along with that they have super high expectations that even my co workers were surprised because they were trying to train me and since there no training standards set up so,i had many different conflicting opinions on what i should be doing. Along with after almost a week working they expected my friend who also works with me to close alone without a key. 

My boss refuses to pay over time for closing and expects us to do so much in so little time so if we do go overtime she gets mad at us ,so at this point i don’t even write it down. Also if we miss something because we ran out of time she also gets mad. 

Now i don’t know if this is an issue but i feel like i don’t get acknowledged my friend makes a mistake i do then they get mad at her but never me.  i’m only told what i do wrong mainly by my co workers and friend while otherwise i feel like i’m floating in the background. 
My co worker who has been there for so long is starting to rant to me about how she’s unhappy with the workplace but she’s been here longer and has a better idea of it. 

Then lastly she took away a majority of my hours to someone who just started 2 weeks ago and when i talked to her she brushed me off saying that my co worker was available those days and she decided to let her get in the routine of work and saying how everyone wants more hours so she would see if anything came up. So now for a month i only work 2 days or even 1 day a week and that’s not enough to sustain myself.

I would like to preface that I have been in a depressed mood lately because of some stuff I haven’t really talked to anyone about. That’s why I’m not sure if I am overreacting.

I have a friend that I feel very close to (10+ years of friendship) that doesn’t live anywhere near me so a lot of the time we spend together is online playing games. Playing games is usually an escape for me from normal life so I am always playing some type of game in my free time.

Well a couple of days ago we were all online playing some games together when we were all planning on getting online for a bit to take a break. As we were all going our separate ways we talked for a few min about how we should all be around later and we will play some then. So because I’m not really wanting to do anything else I switch over and play another game by myself for a while.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I decide to go back to playing the game we were all playing earlier and do some solo stuff. When I get on I see that my friends were all playing. I didn’t really think anything of it at first. I join up with them and start jokingly giving them some shit about not inviting me back. It turned out that they had already been playing for a bit and my friend that I am close with invited everyone but me when he got back on (we had all made plans to play again later when he got back on). He felt the need to message everyone else to see if they wanted to get back on and play except for me.

I called him out and he said in a condescending tone “I was only going to play a few games”. Made me feel like I was in the wrong for thinking the way I was. If that was the case why would he invite anyone else and not me? I don’t believe that. I get the feeling that he didn’t want to include me and is just lying about it to save face.  I left after that and have been kinda short with him since.

It may seem like such a small thing but it has genuinely been bothering me since it happened. It felt so deliberate and I didn’t feel like I was getting the truth.

Like I would catch him talking to his friends and then they all kinda look at me at the same time and smile (which i think is kinda weird) 

But anyway sorry for talking so much about that boring topic. 

So about 5 days ago I finally got the balls to message him (and we have never talked irl.) So He was really sweet and didn’t give short scrubby answers and was really nice (but it was really awkward) but we didn’t really talk much (just like 9 messages between us) and he said he had to go sleep.
Oh and he ended with “Goodnight (my name) maybe i’ll see you tomorrow”
I didn’t even see him the next day lolol
But honestly he didn’t really seem interested

And we haven’t texted since, cause i just thought that if he really was “interested” he would have messaged me again right?

I feel like shit when I’m in school because his friends are making fun of him about what happened but i feel like everyone at the party is judging me because of what happened and he’s getting away with it. and I can’t stop thinking about how disgusting the whole thing was. he even asked if I wanted to fuck in the bathroom to which I attempted to run away from (because I was NOT into him at all, I just didn’t give a fuck) but he wouldn’t let go of me until he eventually did. I can’t look at him in school and I just feel like people won’t invite me to their parties because of what happened because I was drunk and stupid once again. what do I do?",28Oct2019,0

557,"Hi. This might seem to be a bit silly but ill give it a try. 8 months ago me and my girl were finally able to buy our first (used) car. We started working a few months earlier in another country and with some small family help we bought 2008 bmw car. The price was 6k euro which was not expensive nor cheap for this type of car. We needed the car to go to work and surely we wanted to finally start going out somewhere after 5 exhausting years of college. We were happy for a week. Then shortly after the first trip we got check engine light on. It was terrifying because we know nothing about cars but we tried to be positive, hoping it will be some small repair. 2 workshops couldnt find anything. The third authorised worksop said that they have some suspicions but we need to leave a car for a check. Estimated repair cost 300 euro. We took 3 days off work and have been waiting for a call. When they cold it was like a shot to the leg. 1300 euro for repairs. We choked it somehow hoping that it will be the end. We had to borrow some money but we fixed it. Yet a day after we got it from workshop we got check engine light again. To cut long story short it took us sth about 6 trips and totally over 1700 euro to realize that this authorized workshop wont help us. We ordered a tow to our old country (another 300) and fixed problem there totalling costs to 2100 euro. Dont get me wrong we were thinking about selling this junk all the time but initial loss (before first repair) would be 2000 euro and everytime we were promised that this is it, this is the last part that needs replacement. After this event we had a few months of peace (not to count costs of four new tires and brakes but these are normal costs). The car was working acting weird sometimes (like rpms going a little too much down for a second) and weird rattling noise but nothing serious. During our last trip to our old country my father said that it would be good to change timing chain because it was causing this rattling sound. We agreed because it was cheaper to do it there and we knew that we need to use this car for at least 4 more years before we will be able to buy sth different as we have to save for a wedding. It was supposed to last 3 days but lasted almost 2 weeks because someone delivered wrong parts two times and lift in the workshop broke. Like this was cursed. We paid another 300 euro and went back to germany hoping that it was good investment for the future of our car. We were wrong. Two days after arrival we realized that workshop put wrong seal on the engine and we have oil leak. We had choice to drive it 700 kilometers to the workshop that did it or do it on our cost here. We opted for second option as fuel costs would be as much as we would save on warranty. Another 250 euro lost. Two weeks passed and today i had to call mechanic as something is squeaking in the engine. It will take probably 300-400 euro to repair it. And during this whole time we couldnt get rid off this annoying rattle sound which makes me worried that it will someday come up as some serious failure. So as you can see counting only repairs (not counting tires, brakes) we have already spent over 3k euro on a 6k worth car. (If something doesnt add up its because i wanted to cut technical stuff and make it shortest possible). We need a car to go to work and trips to visit parents. We are pretty desperate. We spent a lot on this junk so selling it now would be painful but repairing it also is. I know we should have sold it long time ago but we had hopes. We dont want to take a loan to buy sth new because we need money for the wedding in 1.5 year. What is your advice? Keep it ? Sell it?",28Oct2019,1
558,"My ex has (had?) a new girlfriend. This is my child’s father and we were together for four years. I haven’t been taking this well at all and I have been drinking a lot which I’m currently trying to quit. Recently my ex has been telling people he wants me back and he might of broke up with his girlfriend but I’m not totally sure. Anyway I tend to become A CRAZY BITCH when I’m drunk. Last night He was ignoring my messages and I quickly became very angry. I started cussing him out, calling him over and over again, making fun of his new girlfriend, sent him selfies of me saying how much better I look, etc. If that isn’t crazy enough, I then proceeded to message his new girlfriend tons of photos of me and him to make her feel like shit and bullying the hell out of her basically. I even commented on an Instagram photo of the two of them saying how he has been telling people he wants me back. Then I suddenly decided to apologize within like 5 minutes which probably made me look even more insane. Then I apologized to my ex. Blocked them on everything, deleted all the messages, and then deleted my fb and instagram app off my phone. I didn’t get one message from either of them the entire time I was doing all of this. This is probably like the third time I have done something like this to them and each and every time I have been wasted. I would NEVER do this sober, and I’m really not a mean person but I’m just so hurt and angry over all of this and adding alcohol makes me go absolutely insane. I know I definitely need to quit drinking. But now what else do I do? I feel so horrible and so much anxiety over what I have done. I know it’s not the gf’s fault, and even if it was I shouldn’t treat people like that.

559,"I’m a 16 year old boy, I have (or had idk) maybe 2 people I’d call my friends, a boy and a girl, but I started feeling like they only spent time with me when none of their other friends are available and they only think of me when they need a favor or something. 
So every time I see them or hangout with them, I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I’m just a substitute, especially when they’re with their other friends and they barely talk to me then. 
So I stopped texting them and talking to them, and though I feel pretty lonely now, I’m hoping I can get new friends which is very unlikely so I don’t know if I shd go back to them, we spent a lot of time together, but now they barely talk to me if their friends are around. it’s just favors and hi and bye. Yet I’m their ‘best friend’ They’re pretty amazing people and id love to be with them but it only makes me feel sad because of these thoughts. 
I guess I’m not a very interesting person to be with, i stammer (a lot) and I’m pretty quiet. But I do my best to start conversations with them but it’s clear I’m the substitute friend.

562,"I (20F)  just got licensed as a CNA a month ago, and have been looking to start work ever since. I have applied to multiple places. I am especially paranoid, because earlier in the month, a different place than the one this post is addressed about told me they wanted to hire me, and that all they needed was five references. I got them in for them that same day. I never heard from them again, despite efforts to contact them a few times afterwards. I'm incredibly doubtful that my references would have given me a bad review. I felt burned, but moved on.

Anyhow, fast forward to this past Friday. I had an interview with another place, one that I am VERY interested in. When I went in for the interview, I was very happy with the facility and staff. I sat down with the staff coordinator and the scheduler, and the three of us talked for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Everything went over SO smoothly. She then took me on a tour of the facility, showed me what area I'd be working in, and addressed me to the other CNA's as the ""new hire"". She scheduled me to get my fingerprints done for the level 2 background (literally fifteen minutes after the interview because the UPS where I'd be completing it is down the street). She said that would take the standard 24hrs - 7 business days. 

They told me to put in my two-week notice with my current place of employment (I work as a cashier at a lower-end grocery store), as they would need a solid start date for me in order to send me the new hire paperwork. She said she'd be working until 4:00pm that day, then gave me her business card to call and email her to let her know when I put in my notice, so that she could email me the new hire paperwork. So after I finished my fingerprinting, I drove straight to my current place of employment and handed in my notice. I then proceeded to call her immediately after doing that, at about 2:30pm that day, no answer. I left a voicemail. The next couple hours after that flew by, no call back. Okay, no problem, people get busy- so later that night I sent her an email stating my last day at my current place of employment, and expressed my gratitude for interviewing me and that I was excited to start with the facility. I figured at that point she would call me back Monday.

Well, today is Monday, still no call. I called once more, but didn't leave a voicemail. At this point I'm going to refrain from contacting again until next week, as I don't want to come off as obsessive. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ever ""what-if"" question in the book has been flying through my mind, especially after being burned once by another place. I'm trying to put my fears at ease by assuming that they may be waiting for my background check results to come back in before getting into contact with me. I have zero criminal history, so I know that's not an issue. I don't know if me getting fired from an old job would have to do with it... I was let go from one cashier job, purely due to their policy which states that three cash register discrepancies of $5 over/under within a years time will result in your termination. I've went on to successfully work another cashier job (where I am currently employed) for almost a year and a half with no issues. I don't see how a cashier job would be relevant to CNA work, so I can't imagine that would be an issue.

I realize I'm probably jumping the gun because so little time has passed, but the stakes are high for me as I've already put in my notice, and I've been burned prior to this experience. Any advice on how to deal with this situation and the possible outcomes that could result from it would be greatly appreciated!",28Oct2019,1

I lied about how old I am. I had actually taken three years in community college before transferring to a 4-year. Most transfer students only spend two years in CC.

So last year, when I moved in, I told everyone I was a third year. No one questioned it, and no one cared. This year, I'm a fifth year senior.

I told my roommates I'm 21. Two of my roommates from last year are the same. One of them is different.

The new person asked my birthday, and I jokingly said ""that's confidential."" They still haven't gotten a birthday out of me.

I have alluded to, twice, that I spent three years in community college.

I don't think anyone cares, but it's become kind of a meme. ""Michelle is so private she doesn't tell anyone her birthday.""

If it's discovered that I have been lying about my age, they're going to think I'm a liar. I don't want that to happen.

577,"Hello All!

I joined a helicopter flight school recently to tain to be an instructor with the company. The owner asked me to put an amount upfront, and I gave him $9000 upfront. I used only $1500 of the $9000 that was originally on my account. I am moving states due to a new job and she refuses to return the remainder of my $7500 back that was unused. First she said that she would return my money back in $700 increments which would take over a year to come back to me, and now she tells me that she can't even do $700 increments. The owner's husband doesn't want to return the money back to me anymore, and i now saying that it is nonrefundable. They said I signed a contract, which states that I have to use the money in school with a period of 1 year. They never once mentioned this to me, nor do I remember signing a contract. They even refuse to give me a copy of this contract they claim I sign. He send me an email telling me that he used my money to buy a helicopter. He never once told me that he was using all my money to buy a helicopter. I wasn't present at the time of the transaction. They used my card which was on file, and charged me $9000 for 3 hours of instruction. That is what the Square receipt says. There is no way that 3 hours of instruction costs that much, as nobody would fly helicopters if that were the case. The itemization is showing a charge, when it should be a credit. My other square receipts have signatures from me, but this one doesn't. I had to call my bank to approve the transaction verbally while I was at work, and the owner ran the transaction at school. I even remember telling the Capital One rep that I was putting the money to my school account. The owner kept telling me that she was buying the helicopter for me, when she already had another helicopter. The new helicopter isn't in my name. Other students and instructors are flying it. I have a commercial license with an instrument rating and haven't flown in over 7 years. I just got checked out again by one of the owners who also happens to be a CFI. Since there is now a shortage of instructors, she keeps asking me to fly with student pilots or pilots who haven't flown in over 20 years. Since I am rusty, this is a liability. I told her that I want to be a good instructor and hence have to learn and take my time. She kept asking me to give her a time as to when I would get my license. Nor have they checked my documents such as my medical, as I don't have a  current medical. I have told her that I will be endangering life and property if I fly with these students. I accidentally got another email too where they accidentally asked me for money to buy the second helicopter thinking I was another student. They later apologized and 6 hours later asked me for the money instead. They are using student's account money to buy airplanes. Money that students have yet to use. She mentioned to me that she now has a second airplane in an email, the same airplane which she once claimed was mine. She said that there wouldn't be any trouble henceforth getting flights in. More helicopters, more flight time, lesser student being turned away. I disputed the charge with the credit company. The owner of the flight school has removed me of the scheduling system(Flight Schedule Pro), where I could see my school account info, instructors, students, account balance, last flight details etc. I can't even schedule any more flights if I want to. I always felt pressured. People studying at this school did not even know any theory. Mind you they were close to getting their solo. I even taught many students ground class. She even wanted me to fly with an instructor who didn't fly in over 25 years and get them ready. I was also asked to train student pilots, and was told that I would not get paid. These students were new/rusty. This is my hard earned money which she used. This happened to another student student too. They filed a police report, disputed money with their bank and got it back.

My girlfriend of nearly two years just left me. She was literally everything to me. I abandoned all of my friends to spend all my time with her. We lived together and didn't get out much either. 

Right now, I have no life. She was my life. I don't have any friends that I have common interests with, I don't have any hobbies that I enjoy, and everyone in my grade is nothing like me. I want to get out more, but I lack the motivation and its hard because I live in a rural area. The friends I had before my transition/relationship were only my friends because we went to school together or because we bonded over interests I no longer have. I don't know what I'm into anymore. I traded all of my old interests and hobbies for spending all my time with her. She was like family, for a long time, it felt like my only purpose was being there for her and pursuing my transition. Those two things made me content with life, but now I don't have anyone to be there for and I'm starting to lack the motivation to persue my transition. I'm not doubting it, I just don't have the motivation to spend hours in the bathroom making myself look good anymore. 

I feel like 14/15/16 is a huge period of change in everyone's life and I kinda missed out. Everyone feels like they've moved on and matured and I'm just stuck here spinning my wheels getting nowhere. I want to branch out and talk to new people, but I don't really have a personality anymore. I was so devoted to her that I let my own life disappear. All of my old interests just make me go ""bleh"" because they remind me of the guy I used to be. I don't know how to branch out and meet new people because I've been socially isolated for so long. My counselor said meeting new people was the key to finding my inner self and who I really am, but I just don't know how to do that. Before I met her, I only really hung out with my mom and her friends. Mentally, I feel like I'm closer to a 40 year old than my own age and I just feel so disconnected from everyone. How do I break this cycle? How do I get out? How do I join clubs when the only clubs I'm vaguely interested in are Ham Radio and Radio Control clubs full of retired people? I used to get along really well with people several times my age, but now that I'm not a guy anymore... I feel disconnection from them too. 

Basically what I'm asking is: how do I get back into things? How do I discover new interests and meet new people when I have nothing in common with them? How do I ""get a life""? And how do I interact with people my own age?

The last job was paper and they just put the time u were suppose to work no matter what. I'm super nervous about it. Been here for 3 weeks now. And today I came in at like 8:45. I'm scared lol. The lady said she has to 'flag' the times. Idk what that means.,28Oct2019,1

He's mentally disabled and could have put it anywhere but I think it's in his room and we can't go in there while he's asleep.

583,"So here’s a situation I feel I may need some advice on. So my roommates and I (one is my brother, and the other is his friend) we are in a situation where we have to find a new place to live. Currently looking for a 3-4 bedroom house, living in a 3 bed right now. So my roommate (brothers friend) has been looking for houses but they are all more than what we are currently paying for monthly rent, he also has a bunch of stuff(he plays paintball and works on cars) that he would need to take so space is everything for him (something I personally don’t care about) with that as well as my brother is currently not working and hasn’t been since February of this year, I feel that with him not working and the requirements or needs that our roommate needs(big house, two car garage, master bedroom) and my brother not working, I’ve been considering moving out on my own and parting ways. Has anyone gone through something similar? To me I feel like this solution would be easier cause I know I can take care of myself(started a new job this year and is making more since I moved in our current place, and have been taking care if most expenses since my brother doesn’t work) but my thing is I wouldn’t feel bad about leaving, I would feel bad that my brother would have no where to go. I know I can’t be there for him always but I know if the shoe was on his foot he would help me out. My point of this post was to explain what I’ve been stressing about(finding a place to live and dealing with my brother and roommate) and what I should do, either stick with it with them, or just do my own thing at this point. Any feedback would be appreciate from any perspective.",28Oct2019,1

588,"Hi, I (28 M) am posting here because I don't know what else to do.  


My GF (28) is someone I met online in an art community. We've been talking and growing closer, but she's quite ill and gets barely any support from her family. She lives in her father and step-mother's house, but isn't allowed to use any kitchen appliances, dishes, or food. She is trying to get disability, but her family intentionally keep her mail from her for weeks. She sleeps on a mattress on the floor. Her father justifies this by saying that ""He's already paying for her medication and car insurance"" and that her conditions ""can't possibly be that bad"" and that ""he lets her dog stay here too"".  


Her doctors are suggesting surgery for one of her medical problems, and if she gets it, she'll be laid out for two to three weeks in recovery. All he's suggested he would do is get her a box-spring to put under her mattress on the floor. After asking if I or another friend could come by to make sure she was taken care of, her father and step mother both said ""No"" revolving around some kind of concern about theft and the danger of trusting in strangers.  


She is incredibly distraught because she wont be able to drive, or take care of her dog, or even get around the house to do things like get water and use the bathroom without some assistance. I'm extremely frustrated, because while my family isn't perfect, this kind of downright abusive imprisonment and neglect against someone I love seems utterly evil and absolutely unjustifiable.   


Is there any legal way to compel their cooperation in either allowing me to give her the support she needs, or to force her parents to provide the after-surgery care she requires? If there's no legal way to make things work, what are our options? She doesn't want to lose the little financial support she does get, and I live in a completely different state, pretty far away. I am so worried that this abusive neglect will lead to her getting injured, or an infection, or worsen her already frail health. She wants me to help her, but is afraid that the turmoil caused by my coming down and trying to take care of her or taking her out of the house during the recovery period will cause all of the little support she does have to evaporate and that she'd be homeless and sick.   


I'm just so gorram worried and I need some advice. I don't know what I can do to help her.",28Oct2019,0

So I’ve been seeing this guy for the last couple weeks, about 2/3 times per week. We are aware that we’ve started to develop feelings for each other, and somehow got onto the topic of what we are looking for romantically. He doesn’t want me seeing anyone else, and vice versa, good sign usually right? But then he went on to say that he’s trying to improve all the negative aspects of himself as he was horrible to his ex girlfriend. So he doesn’t want a relationship for now since he’s trying to do some self care. He wants to be seen with me in public and all that Jazz, but just doesn’t want to put a label on it because apparently the pressure of it brings out his worst side. He did say that he wants to be exclusive with me though.. What does this even mean? Like what’s the difference between being exclusive and being in a relationship??

So to start off, my parents have a family cat that we have had since he was born, and of course has lived with in their house his entire life. He was always potty trained and they never had issues. He is/was an indoor/outdoor cat. 
A few years back my brother brought home a dog, and the dog freaked out our cat too much and he ended up accidentally hurting paw which kept him from using the restroom outside. Long story short, he began having a habit of pooping/peeing around the house. ( His paw is completely fine now, the habit just never broke ) my mother has tried all sorts of cat litters, we have tried retraining him and so forth to fix it. Well, now my parents are wanting to redo the home and they're tired of keeping up after him, and have talked about rehoming ( With a heavy heart, mind you. ) I offered immediately to take him because if he has to be removed he is not leaving the family and who he is familiar with, that's just not how things are done for me. He has a very special way of being taken care of and I don't trust anyone else but myself to make sure things stay familiar. 


Now here's my issue. I also have a cat who lives a specific lifestyle. ( she hates everyone and everything but me, my boyfriend, and luckily our dog. She is the kind of cat who will hide away and not come out until it is only us again, and will literally just starve herself if she has to to stay hidden. ) 

I'm asking for advice on if there's any solution to my parents situation with our family cat, if anyone has gone through something similar and found out things that worked? They truly don't want him to go but it's becoming the reality.  

Also asking for advice on how to help two very specific lifestyled cats live together. I don't want to drastically change my cats lifestyle because she is easily stressed ( she had a very rough upbringing, she was found in an apartment with 30 other cats just abandoned, and withering away ) and will isolate herself. I also do not want to do the same to our family cat ( who had a perfect upbringing for a cat, but is also easily freaked ) so I've thought about collecting our family cats hair and spreading it around my house to help with smells, maybe bring him over a few times just so we can test the waters etc.

I know the basics like put them in seperate rooms, but once my cat realizes it she will isolate, my goal is to keep this as stress free as possible. Any advice is GREATLY appreciated. Thank you for reading!

TDLR; Parents are close to getting rid of family cat with specific needs, I offered to take him because we have had him since birth and don't want him to be completely removed from us.

599,"I (22F) work at a small business that deals with customer service. My coworkers are all great people and I really like them, but the job itself is really bringing me down with exhaustion and dread for the next shift. I need this job right now because I have student loan payments coming up next month, but it’s so hard to keep going every day because I’ve been struggling with depression for the last number of years and it’s been really hitting me hard the last number of months.

So I called in today because I desperately needed a mental health day. I chose today because I knew I also had tomorrow off. It would give me enough time to breathe and face the rest of my week. One of my coworkers (let’s call her Christie) filled in for me when I asked and was super kind about it.

Unfortunately, *another* coworker (let’s say Jessica) called in today, which made coworker “Ginny” have to take her place super impromptu. Jessica didn’t find anyone to take her place before calling in, leaving Ginny in a tough position.

Long story short, Ginny asked me to come in for her tomorrow since she’s working today, which kind of negates the entire reason I called in today. I’m only dreading this week MORE now since I was really hoping that today and tomorrow would be mental health/fighting this fucking depression days.

600,"I'll start this off by introducing myself as a 16-year old 'atheist' growing up and living in an extremely Christian environment in Europe.

This week we got a little leaflet from the government in the post about how to sign up for the donor registry and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the importance of it and how much I want to do it since. My family and the highly Christian environment around me (literally everyone I know in real life is a Christian) all oppose being a donor for various reasons, all strictly backed up with theological arguments. So anyway, this afternoon I signed myself up to be a donor but I didn't get told until after signing up that a letter would be sent to our home confirming me signing up to be a donor. I am in some deep (DEEP) shit if my family finds out about me wanting to be a donor and therefore not being a 'good Christian'. I would definitely lose all of my privileges like gaming etc. and probably be forced into some programs to become a good Christian.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I don't live in US. I feel to clarify that detail because due to it's a different country things may -and probably is- work in a different way.

I live in a really small city with 120k people where 50k of them are student at the university. For some bizarre and absurd reasons -this has to do with ""living in a different country"" thing where it's hard to explain- I don't have many friends here. Actually I have only 2. Again for the same reasons there are no place to socialize. Having new friends is hard if not impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I'm 2 hours drive away from a metropolitan area -actually the capital city- and while I am there I really have fun. Lots of bars and cafes and many events taking place... My problem is since I don't live in that city people don't want to be friends. Even tho we get along, people cut the connection while I head back. I have place to stay there, so I can go there anytime I want but I can't convince people over there that I can come regularly. I don't know how I can start a social network over there.

610,"I'm looking for advice, but also have to get this off my chest because I don't feel comfortable talking about this in detail with friends/family. I am in desperate need of help, I'm slowly losing it.

Last year, I met a beautiful, sweet girl. We met through mutual friends, but she had a long-term boyfriend at the time. We had an incredible connection from the get-go and I fell for her, even though I knew she had a boyfriend.

Apparently she was feeling the same way about me, but because she is the amazing girl that she is, she stopped talking to me out of respect for her boyfriend (with whom she was not happy). Cue a few months later, apparently they broke up, she invites me to her birthday party, and we get together. She told me how I was always on her mind, even when we weren't talking.

Every moment after that day was bliss. We spent every day together, every moment we spent with each other, we fell harder. I can't put into words how gorgeous, how sweet, how caring, how amazing she is. She really was the one. But unfortunately, only a few months after we first got together, summer came, and both being foreign university students, we went back home to our countries, apart for 2 months.

While away from each other, we were always talking, always calling, making plans for the year to come. Unfortunately, with the distance apart, I made some stupid, dumb mistakes, and I slowly started pushing her away with my immaturity and childishness. I only realized what I had done when it was too late. 

I fucked up, and we ended things before we even got to see each other again. I was crushed. After seeing me act so strange, she couldn't even look me in the eyes when she came back. It broke my heart. It was awkward, cold, distant. 

I don't want to make this too long, but what we had was really something special. The kind of thing that happens once in a lifetime. I know that I will never, ever find a girl like her again. And that it had to end because of my own stupidity, it kills me. 

It's been almost 2 months. I still think of her every day. Every morning I wake up, I wake up with this horrible feeling, the first thought is how could I fuck up something so pure and beautiful. How could I fuck up with the only girl I ever truly loved. I have no motivation for anything anymore. I don't see my friends anymore. I don't go to the gym. I don't eat much. I have no interest in dating. I hadn't cried in years, nowadays I cry like a bitch thinking about her. I stopped smoking when I met her, nowadays I smoke a pack a day, all the while feeling hopeless and lost.

I miss her so, so fucking much. And it doesn't help she lives 5 minutes away from me. I look at the pictures we took together, the messages, voice texts we sent each other, I reminisce the good times, but I know none of it will bring her back. 

I used to be a happy guy, even before I met her. I was confident, full of life, energetic. Now, I genuinely don't derive enjoyment from anything at all. Some days I can't even sleep, so I take heavy sleeping pills and alcohol.

My mom has commented on how much weight I've lost. They're concerned. All this bullshit over a girl, I know, but I can't help it. I've never felt this way before, I feel so incredibly hopeless. 

This girl was really special. And now she's gone. And all I can think of is, what we could've been. I just want to pick up the phone and tell her I miss her, but I know it will only make matters worse. I really don't know how I can deal with this.

614," I’m stressed out because I don’t know what classes to take since I don’t know what degree(s) I want to pursue. I think maybe both a BA and a BS but I don’t know. For a long time, I was certain I wanted to be a doctor, but now I don’t think I can make it through like 8 more years of school and pre-med and med school and residency. I also thought that maybe a doctor wasn’t fulfilling enough for me. Then I wanted to be a vet, but the same problem. Until recently, I was certain I wanted to be a lawyer, but now I’m super confused. Career quizzes have been really unhelpful. I’m only a freshman so I have time, but I’m feeling super disoriented because I don’t think I want to just do psych and political science anymore in case that boxes me too narrowly. I feel like I’ve been avoiding taking science classes because I think they’ll be too hard or too much work/effort (even though I did fine in high school) whereas I get through humanities really easy. I know I can explore courses, but it’s hard for that to be helpful when you can’t exactly explore careers. I’m interested in politics, law, civil rights, history, science (esp chem and engineering), psychology (which I know a lot about, thus a potential psych degree), and crime/criminology. I feel like my interests and goals are always changing and I can frequently see myself doing totally different careers, which makes me feel really stuck in terms of what to study.

Here’s a list of things that I’m interested in doing as a career and their reasonings:

\- Lawyer or specifically a prosecutor especially for human trafficking cases/domestic violence. I feel really strongly about the topic and enjoy my law class and putting together cases

\- A doctor? maybe? Just to work in a nice primary care practice as a pediatrician 

\- A vet to work with animals (also open to other jobs that involve animals in other ways)

\- An FBI agent — especially solving stuff or doing criminal profiling or figuring out linguistics in cases or something like that. Or being on the ground to research what happened/how it happened/who the perpetrator was. I'm really into true crime podcasts

\- epidemiology maybe? like mapping viral outbreaks

\- Art conservation

\- Archaeology, both like discovering stuff from history and conserving it

\- Politics, especially as a senator. I feel like this is a job that could result in significant change for people, which is important to me for some reason. Like it feels like I could do more than just help 1 person at a time (doctor)

\- a job as similar to Mythbusters as possible

I hope to travel a decent amount in my life (doesn’t need to be career-related) but I’d like a job that involves a degree of “figuring out” and “critical thinking” as opposed to a set routine and going through the motions bc I don’t want to get bored. I want to be able to really invest myself in my work instead of feeling like I’m just carrying out tasks. I really don’t want to work in an office (as in a cubicle) all the time or work in academia, or a job that just helps others live their lives (counselor) bc I want to do something on my own. I also don't think I want to do journalism. I want to do something that is cool, interesting and allows me to do original things and be knowledgeable about many different things. 

Is there some job out there that just runs experiments or tests to answer problems? Or that gives me the flexibility to try out lots of things? What should I study now to leave my boxes open? How can I figure out what it is that I want to pursue?",28Oct2019,6

Maybe I’m just weird, idk. My friends have told me to suck it up and just talk to a guy, just get to know him but I’m not that person, I want him to talk to me and ask me out.",28Oct2019,0

621,"I used to live with my dad and his wife but got out because I attempted suicide too many times for me to go back. The hospital said I could not go back at all. 

My sisters, however, still live there. They’re 15 and 12 and endure emotional abuse from my dad and his girlfriend.

I want them out of that house. My grandparents and aunt would both take them. But it’s emotional abuse. I don’t know how to get this fixed. CPS hasn’t really been able to do anything. I just want to find a way for the emotional abuse to be recognized and for my sisters to be free.",28Oct2019,1
622,"I think my best friend of 6 years and I (both 21f) got in a fight. I know this may seem extremely trivial but I am at loss. I really don't know what I have done so completely wrong and I'm hoping someone can help me. Sadly I can't post screenshots as our first language is spoken be almost noone. But I will translate what happened. 

Some context:
I am going through an extremely stressful time at the moment and it's messing with my mental health a bit. Nothing dramatic I'm just down in the dumps.
So my friend and I planned a girls trip to Amsterdam to relax and have a fun time. We were supposed to go the coming weekend. I planned everything because I always do cause I've always been ""the mother of the group"". 
Last Wednesday we were supposed to book everything.  We agreed to call at 9pm and do it then. 8.45 I get a text from her saying she forgot she owes her mum money and she can't come. I'm obviously sad but there's no use in being angry so I let it go. We agreed to go to the pub on Friday night. Friday 4 hours before we wanna go I get a migraine and I ask her if we can go Saturday instead. She says yeah no worries but she won't be there before 9 cause she's gonna smoke a joint with a friend in the arvo.
The next day around 4 she tells me she won't come because she didn't sleep much and needs to study for a test. I say okay and then comes the mistake. 
I say: we probably won't see each other before I go abroad. (I'm leaving early January). I meant it as a joke because our success rate has been low lately. We have the same humor and know each other inside out so I thought it was clear it was a joke. She never responded to this message. 
Today I saw her at uni. We were in an info meeting. When i saw her come in i smiled and waved at her but she looked away. Then when it was over she walked out and i said her name quite loud. She kept walking. 
I had to catch the train and texted her asking if she was mad. She read it but didn't answer. Then I texted her again and said I'd rather she tell me instead of ignoring me. Then she said she's not mad she just didn't know how to respond and that she didn't see or hear me earlier. I explained my what I meant by my joke and that I didn't mean any harm. She says okay she's glad. I then say I'm sorry if it came across as angry I was really sad that weekend and maybe I could have worded it better. Then she says she thinks I'm childish and passive aggressive  and that's not how she wants to be with friends. I say I'm sorry I really didnt mean it as passive aggressive but I don't want her to twist my word. Then I said I think it's a bit rich of her to say I'm childish when she ignored me for two days and probably would have continued to do so had I not texted her and that she could have asked me if she didn't know what I meant with my joke. She then said: I don't wanna discuss it. We have no problem as long as you treat me with respect. But you didn't and I can't accept that. If you agree all is fine if you don't then we don't need to talk.

Then I said: I really don't understand why you are so aggressive all of a sudden. I made a joke and I thought you'd get it. But I can see how it could have been confusing. I'm sorry that I upset you that was never my intention. But i think you're not being the most respectful atm either. I'm not sure if maybe there's something else going on or you're stressed in general? If so you can tell me and we can talk about it. But I think it's unfair of you to say that I'm the one who's childish cause after all I texted you to see if we're okay.
Then she said: so, all good?
Tbh I was a bit taken aback because she completely ignored everything i said in my previous message so i asked her if she could acknowledge my message to which she said: not up for it. No nerve for it. If it was a misunderstanding we don't need to discuss it.

Now what's important is that we are both linguists and my friend never not used a subject in her sentences but she didn't use one just then. We have talked about psycho linguistics countless times before and she told me that she does this to disrespect others if she doesn't seem them worthy of using a subject and that it's cool cause noone ever realises but obviously I do. So then I said: I at least think you should apologise as well since we both felt disrespected by each other, to which she said : I'm sorry you felt disrespected. 
Again this is a psycho linguistic concept. You make it seem like you apologise but you don't actually acknowledge you mistakes you say you're sorry the other person perceives your actions as hurtful. If someone else had apologised like this I would have let it go but not with her. This is another topic we spent hours analysing and she always tells me how much he hates it when someone does that. So I'm certain she did it on purpose because she knew I would pick up on it. I didn't say anything after that. 

We haven't talked since and to be honest I'm quite upset. I feel like she treated me with no respect in this conversation. I see that my first joke could have been misunderstood but i am at loss as to how it could escalate like this. I'm especially hurt because i think that after six years of friendship I deserve at least something more than ""not up for it"" she completely refused to talk about it unless i accepted what she said. I'm so confused. But I'm also angry. I think it was completely out of line, UNLESS there is something I don't see. Maybe I said something upsetting but I can't see it. If so please tell me. I would apologise immediately. But if not I'm planning on not texting her again. She is very stubborn and probably won't text me either and if she will she'll pretend like nothing happened but I can't do this anymore. 
How should I proceed?

623,"My bf (M/19) and I (F/17) have been together exclusively for 7 months (known each other for a long time), we're deep in love. He lives 4000 kms away, in a different country. He is doing a dual course so he's here for 8 months and there for 4. He is in his first year of med school, I'm in our home country in my first year of college. With the time difference, his classes, self studying, working hours, the time he takes out for his family.. all that corresponds to about 15 hours a day, 5 days a week. I am a fairly busy person with 8 hours of college and commute, 7 days a week. My college will end in 3 years. His MBBS - 6 years, MS - 4 years. I am doubting if I can wait this long. With long distance on top of all of it.

We have a 5-15 minute call on alternate days and we talk for 2-3 hours on weekends. We don't have unnecessary fights so as not to kill the little time we have together. We have phone sex 2-3 times a week.

I love this man. I love him more than I love anything else. I don't want to see him go. He means the world to me. I'm not a very patient person in general, but he makes me want to wait. For him. Because I know everything could be perfect.

I have been thinking on this over and over. This relationship doesn't sound feasible to me. I don't know if this could go on for much longer. He's probably always gonna be too busy for us. I realize that I'm thinking years in advance. But I've been unhappy for a while now and I'd like a clear path of where we are heading.

Should we break up? Will it just hurt more if we  continue this and break up later? Is this always gonna be like this?

625,"So last month I joined a roleplay Discord server of my favorite fandom and it's been great until now, I met some people that like the same stuff I do and we've had a goof time toguether sharing memes, art... I'm pretty much into roleplay and with 8 people more we started building a story toguether. Long story short, my character starts naturally dating another character after some days writing.

We keep working on the story and his writer and I become very good friends, nothing more. Until yesterday that we were speaking in the #general chat and this guy casually mentions something about school.

School. Motherfucking school. I left school two years ago and I work full time as a 20 years old now. It made me freak out and I DMed him instantly asking about it. I told him in a nice way that if he was underage I wasn't comfortable roleplaying nsfw stuff, he brushed it off and he didn't want to tell me his age which is okay. 

I thought the message got clear until today, we all start roleplaying and his character starts getting... romantic and flirty, which would have been cute except that now it's creepy and disturbing. He never told me he was underage, but there's no way I'm believing he's an adult after the school comment.

I told them I had to go and I came here to ask because I'm feeling so anxious right now. It's the first time I go trought something like this, it feels so wrong to keep writting romance with him now. But our story is mostly action focused so it'd change that much to stoo the romance shit.

The problem is that... I don't know what to do. I don't know how to deal with this, everyone ships our characters and their own characters badly to the point that we have running jokes and memes about them, and I feel I'm going to ruin for everyone if my character starts rejecting his advances.

Also, I'm afraid to DM him again and ask about his age again, I don't want to pressure him into telling me something he doesn't feel comfortable with, but if I act like nothing happened I'd feel like uncomfortable, or like a groomer or something worse.

Ugghhh, I need advice, this shit is fucked up and I don't know what to do. We're not dating, we only roleplay, but it still feels bad to roleplay with him in that way.

I also don't want to delete my account. This fandom is small and this is the only active Discord server of it and it's amazing to be part of it because none of my real life friends like this series. If I started over with another identity I'm sure they'd recognize me after some time.

Any advice? I feel like shit, I don't want to continue this anymore but I also don't want to lose his friendship and this community and what I've built with them. Thank you.",28Oct2019,1

3 weeks ago I got the flu.

1 and a half weeks after getting the flu I find out I’m also pregnant.

Not even 3 days after that (after complaining about not being able to keep anything down, all symptoms of HG, etc) I was hospitalised for acute dehydration and kept in well overnight on IV fluids and various meds.

Get discharged with prochlorperazine, which worked OK at first.

It’s been literally a week since I was discharged and once again my sickness is getting worse, can’t keep anything down including water and can’t leave bed. I’m trying to sip water to avoid becoming dehydrated again but idk what to do.

Waiting on call back from general hospital about appointment dates for an abortion, which has already taken a week to sort this far but I don’t know how far along I am and I’m getting pretty worried and stressed.

Let alone not having been able to work for this whole time and I’m not on a contract yet so they’re not paying me sick pay so I can’t afford my bills.

I can’t do anything normally, I can’t eat, drink, wash, sleep, I just want this god damn demon out of me already.

So some months ago my girlfriend (17y) told me (18y) that she was raped by this one guy. I didnt really know how to handle that Informationen and was really enraged and was about to beat the shit out of him. Then my girl told me that i shouldnt do that and calmed me down. She said i should just leave things how they was and let it be. I should just forget about it because it wouldnt help her and would only make things worse for her because it would bring up old memory etc. But i told her i cant just let that slide especially when such thing happens to the person i love. At the end we both agreed if he messages her, talk to her or something else to i could do what i want with him. But today me and my girl were chilling touching each others etc. But after some time I dont really know ehat happend but i must have touched her some kind of way that reminded her of her past with that guy and she just jumps up pushes me away and starts crying. I have never saw her like that and shes usually a really strong woman who doesnt cry. After i calmed her down she didn’t want to be touched or talk with me and just wanted to go home. Now she went home and i dont know what to do. I cant live with the fact that something like that happened to the person i love and i have never felt this kind of hate for a person.

Me and my family have been in a scramble to find a way to get me home as soon as possible, but it's been hard to discern whether or not I should take the bus to Redding then take the Amtrak going to Sacramento, or find another bus going down the 101.

634,"So my situation currently is that my family is selling the house I'm living in. It was my grandmothers house but she is now in a Retirement Home and we need the money from the house to pay for that(part of the money from selling the house will also go to me and my siblings when she someday passes(she is almost 101.))

A family friend of ours BROTHER runs this Adult Living building in town. I went and checked it out. Some of the people are a tad sketchy looking, but I try not to judge a book by it's cover, so whatever. This is a large house with probably 20 rooms all taken up by someone or multiple people. Shared Mens and Womens bathrooms as well.

So we're friends with the sister of the guy that runs this place, and originally he promised me my own single room ""because of who I was."" So I went and checked it out. Not the worst looking house in the world. Some of the doors and things are a bit shabby, but overall it looks nice. Included in the monthly price($850) are 3 meals a day(8am 12pm 430pm) and any medication I might need if I get sick and need antibiotics or something(I don't take any medication for anything else.) So not a bad sounding gig...

But I just have these concerns...

My first concern is sharing a bathroom with 10+ men. What if I got a job, needed to shower before work, but the shower is already in use by someone and there is already a line up... Guess I'd have to go to work smelling gross??? That doesn't seem logical to me.

My second and largest concern is that when I went to check out the house, the 24-hour on site support staff showed me around and then showed me the room I would be getting. It's quite large. Larger than my current room. Nice high ceilings. But I noticed right away that there were two beds, not just one. I don't need two beds...

So later that day when I got home, I gave the guy a call and asked him ""Could I move one of the beds vertically against the wall or something to save space?"" and he told me that ""temporarily you could, but unfortunately we aren't able to give you the single room anymore. I had no choice and had to give it to someone, there was nothing I could do about it. I will do everything I can to keep you in that room by yourself, but if by small chance someone had to move in there, they would just have to move in there."" ..............................

So I was promised a single room, but then he had to give the single room away because someone higher up made him. This is a huge red flag for me... So I talked to my father about it and asked him to call the guy and talk to him. My father called me just now and let me know that the guy that runs this(our family friends brother) said there would be virtually such a low chance of someone else moving into that room with me that I shouldn't worry about it...

But why shouldn't I worry about it? If this guy promised me a single room, then the higher ups force someone into that room before me, then what's stopping those same higher ups from forcing someone into the double room I'd be going into?

This worries me sooooo much... I'm a night owl, and I spend MOST of my time at home on my computer. My computer is on 24/7 and the fan to it is pretttty loud. Most people would not want to listen to that while they're trying to sleep. Plus, while I'm up late night on my PC, I'm on discord talking to people, laughing, getting a bit rowdy... That kind of thing. We play competitive shooter games, and it can get a bit... Like I said, rowdy.

How would that even work if some random person was put into my room with me? All of a sudden I'd have to turn my PC off or something when they wanted to go to bed? Fuuuuck THAT.... Or dealing with someone snoring next to me while I'm trying to sleep.... NOPE...

The guy that runs this place really tried his best to say that there's such a small chance this would happen but.... If someone else had the authority to put someone in the single room I was originally promised, who's stopping them from putting someone in my room with me...

I'd hate to accept this offer, move in, and then a week later it's like ""Hey sorry, but you're going to have a room mate.""

Next thing I know it's ""Hey can I use your computer for a minute to check something?"" or ""Hey can I check my facebook really quick on your computer?"" to which I will reply ""No, sorry."" but then that will create this ridiculous animosity between me and someone I'm literally sharing a room with.... Then while I'm gone and they're there, who knows what they would try and do with my PC... They might try nothing... But they might try and get around my password and use the PC while I'm away...

Again... The guy said I PROBABLY wouldn't be getting a room mate, and that the chances are SOOOOOO low but..... Even a 1% chance scares the shit out of me.

I am not in a position at this exact moment where I HAVE to take this deal. I have 3 months to find my own apartment(which all go for relatively the same amount of money, just no meals or meds included.)

I feel like if I got a job and found my own apartment that I would be able to sustain myself more than capably. 800-900$ a month for a 1-Bedroom and I'd be making at least $1900 TAKE-HOME pay. MORE than enough to live the kind of lifestyle I live AND be able to save money on top of that. (I live a very quiet and hermit style life. I DO go out with friends and what not, but most of the time I am on my PC at home during my free time.)

What do you guys think? I know this was a lot to read but I just wanted to get everything out there and get some advice.

Personally I truly don't want to take this deal, but my father DOES want me to take the deal...

I'm just so scared it's going to backfire in my face and before I know it, I have someone I'm sharing a room with and then have to deal with all sorts of rules I don't want to deal with.",28Oct2019,1

638,"Hello all!

I’ve found my way here after a few restless nights having dealt with some troubles regarding the situation mentioned in the title. I am currently working with a student who is passionate, kind, and I believe well meaning- but she has an issue with dominating class discussions. 

I’m going to have to tread carefully here in order to protect the confidentiality of any information this student has given me, and to be respectful to her.

I teach several classes at a local college In the literature department. These classes revolve mostly around mythology. 

The class in question is a class that is divided into two halves, we just spent seven great weeks exploring Ovid’s Metamorphosis and now we’ve moved on to Dante’s Inferno. 

The way I structure my class is essentially a discussion based approach. The students aren’t tested often on the reading, and don’t have any written assignments during the semester. They face a total of two tests and two assignments throughout the semester, beyond that I encourage reading but largely class participation, whether that’s in the form of speaking to the class or listening intently.

This young woman is very excited about the material, and early in class a dynamic developed where she would bring up several
topics and I would excitedly roll with them, encouraging the involvement. I even have made jokes in the past that were something like:

“Don’t mind the front row and me, we’re just having a talk over our morning coffee, please jump in if you’d like”. 

I recognize now that this was encouraging performance that went on to dominate class discussions. 

Recently as we switched to Dante this student became much more active, interrupting my readings and asking very philosophical questions that were not always easy to connect or follow. I spoke with her last Monday after class when she approached and asked me herself if she was speaking too much during class. She had been very late to class that day and I essentially said that I encourage participation, but to please be on time if you’re to do so. I said pretty flatly that she shouldn’t come in late and then dominate the class. I also encouraged her to ask students questions and to think about what they may have to say. I ended the short discussion by saying that if she had longer topics to discuss that is understandable (Dante does inspire these thoughts) but to please come to me in my office hours after class instead and we can discuss them then. 

What happened next was a full hour of discussion in my office, she spoke of her past, her connection to religion and many other things I won’t disclose here. At the end of the meeting I thanked her for the discussion and affirmed that these thoughts were better suited for discussion outside of class and asked her to be aware of the class dynamic and not to domicile the class, 

Although she happily agreed the next class day she was very talkative if not more dominate. I decided on the spot to take a tack where I would answer her question and then quietly say “remember what we talked about Monday”. And she would nod. 

On the fourth time she interrupted I decided to speak to her quietly right there, as the class had been thoroughly disrupted and students were being cut off by her in mid thought. I told her quietly that she had come to class late and that she can’t dominate the class. I said we can speak about her thoughts after class but to please tone it down essentially. 

She did speak a few more times but it was better that day. 

It’s still been an ongoing issue where I need to remind her inside and outside of class. 

This problem has thoroughly shaken me after years of teaching. The Irony is far from lost on me that we just spent seven week discussing Ovid. A book with themes of people, especially men in power silencing women who want to speak, leaving them voiceless. The issue and that irony have been somewhat corrosive. 

I always encourage my students to speak heir minds, and wish that many students felt this comfortable speaking. I so admire her enthusiasm but we can’t seem to connect on social cues and how to find the right spot in class to discuss something. 

I would appreciate any advice, and I appreciate your time greatly.


TLDR: Student is very exited about class but is now dominating and interrupting discussions with myself and other students. I’ve spoken to her several times outside of class and once inside of class about being wary of dominating the class and have put my foot down on interrupting. Unfortunately this student still seems to be acting similarly, and I would hate to have to one day remove her from class simply for being excited to discuss the thoughts and emotions that our reading invokes. 

Thank you!",28Oct2019,1
639,"It looked like this:

""Babe can you please pick me up either from Bar X just around the corner or at work please?"" And then the response:""Ok leaving in 10""

I asked her about this yesterday but she didn't give me much information. She said she was ""pretending to text me."" Why would she do this at all? It's got me thinking:

1: She has a car; if she's hanging out with people, they probably already know that. Why is she asking to be picked up?

2: Regarding the response, that's not how I type. Wouldn't she subconsciously mimic me? Maybe not, though.

3: This was sent at 7:30PM on a Monday. It's kind of an odd time. She gets out of work at 4:30-5 unless she's at the occasional happy hour event, but I don't think she was. And even if she were, why would she need to send these messages?

4: Her own phone number was/is labeled ""wh\*\*\*"" with a heart next to it, as though it were me. I'm not sure how recently she did this.

5: Why did this exchange take the form that it did? It's kind of specific for a fake exchange.

I’m starting off a bit strong by saying i want to fucking die, not figuratively, but literally, i think about ways to kill myself all the fucking time. I’m so angry at the world for putting me in such shitty situations and i can’t do anything about it. Growing up my mom was an addict, my dad didn’t give two shits about me and always left me with my mom while she was nodding out and falling on things or down the stars or driving with me in the car with her while she had been up for days and was falling asleep, running off the road and me yelling at her to wake up. I get really anxious when i hear loud noises because of all the screaming that went on during my childhood. My dad only ever cared about my older brother who, OF FUCKING COURSE has no problems with his weight or self image or anything while i’m fucking either eating a shit ton and trying not to cry or i’m not eating for long periods of time and constantly get called anorexic. My mom would have seizures all the time and while i was staying home watching her making sure she was still breathing after each one, my dad took my brothers places like to fucking six flags for hours while he knew my mom was doing these things. She told me if she wasn’t breathing then to do CPR on her and call the police and it scared me shitless. I was around 11 years old and knew how to deal with my mom having seizures alone. While i was 11 up until i was 13 or 14 my mom would be doing all kinds of drugs, having mental breakdowns and screaming in the bathroom, crying and screaming to me for help because no one else listened to her but me and i was fucking 11. I was the only one that took care of her when she had crashed our car and one day i walked in on her trying to kill herself with a rope around her neck. 

I constantly just bottle shit up and do all the drugs i can find. I recently got 100 dollars for my birthday and spent all of it on drugs. When i can’t take life anymore i lash out of people in my family or just do shit like this and delete all of it because i constantly feel annoying because all my life i was talking with my mom making sure she was okay and not trying to kill herself and never developed the right social skills. I’m always the funny one in the group but it’s all a fucking joke it feels so fake it makes me sick. Am i just freaking out or is this something serious? I asked my parents for help (like therapy) but they just told me it doesn’t work and i’m just better off not doing it.

648,"I'm going to start off with telling a little bit about myself. I started going to university late 2016, for computer science. Before that I did something called ""Fachhochschulreife"" (I live in germany), which could be compared to college I think. Main emphasis of that ""college"" was also computer science. In university, I always felt like everyone was way more motivated then me, asking questions constantly, coming up with creative ideas. I felt really out of place. Programming was the only thing I was kind of good at. That was also the reason I chose to go with computer science. And because everyone told me I'm a computer guy when I was young, because I liked to play games. But in university, I felt completely outclassed. Everyone was talking about all the projects they did in private, what they were part of and so on. I wasn't a motivated guy before, but that slowly really destroyed my motivation.

I stopped my studies in early 2018 and switched to an apprenticeship in that same year. My studies really didn't go anywhere, because my first thought was always ""why even bother?"" as soon as something looked like it would require more work and the payoff was uncertain, because I didn't know if I could even fully grasp it. And that hasn't really changed. I think that is the biggest weakness I need to work on. I see that, but it feels impossible. Now in my apprenticeship, I feel less misrable, actually I would go as far as say I simply feel nothing. Talking to my colleagues at work, they all seem so invested and interested in what they do. I just can't bring the same motivation as them. Maybe computer science and programming is just not for me?

As a kid, I've been the ""leader"" of our group, I was outspoken and confident. Somewhere along the way, when puberty hit, I lost all my confidence, became shy and only wanted to be an ""observer"". And I haven't really recovered from that. I constantly feel inferior to other people. Those are also the reasons why I never had a girlfriend, not even close. I never felt like I was worth it. I can't imagine why someone would like me over someone else.

I come to you, because my only friend that I was able to talk to about stuff like this moved to another city when I was around 14. I'm 23 now. My friend, contrary to me, has become very successful and he travels the world constantly, so it's very hard to sit down and just talk. He told me he has connections, if I ever need help getting a job, but I don't even know what worth I even am. I don't want to make my friend look bad.

I'm very slightly overweight, I wanted to lose weight and become more fit several times, but the same exact motivation problems ensue. Everytime I look at something longterm and uncertain, I tend to lose all motivation. I looked into learning to play the piano, because I love music, but the same thing happened. I looked at what other people achieved and instantly felt like it wasn't worth it. ""Why even bother if I can never be the best?"" is something that always slips into my mind and I can't block it.

There are things that I do enjoy. I still like gaming, competitive too, even though the same motivation problems arise there too and I usually stop when I think I hit my peak and might fail if I continue. I'm very afraid of failing. I love travelling, exploring new cultures, new food, new languages are things that I like. I love music and it has a huge effect on me. Very good music makes me tear up and actually makes me feel kinda happy. I actually like talking to people, even though I never start a conversation myself, unless I have to, work related or something similar. I rarely talk about myself though, I usually just like to listen to what people have to say about themselves and their experiences. Weirdly enough, even though I get very nervous before exams, presentations and so on, I usually enter ""my zone"" if I prepared enough and enjoy the feeling. It's the only time my fear of failure isn't on my mind.

Sorry, I've never been good in writing longer texts like that, so reading through that could be a little bit messy.

I feel lost and feel like I have no purpose. Any kind of help or advice would be appreciated.",28Oct2019,1

650,"Honestly, there were red flags I shouldn't have ignored. It seems that she doesn't really care about me or my feelings at times. She sometimes cancels plans last minute because she doesn't feel like doing it, interrupts me when I'm talking, etc.

I was pretty upset yesterday because of what she told me to do. She wants me to pull my foreskin back and keep it back. She just randomly told me she wanted this. I told her it was painful but she didn't seem to care, coming up with excuses like ""Won't you get used to it? Just try it for a day"". I just said ""Alright"" and ignored the issue.

She's very subtle about making demands. She doesn't get overly mad or angry, and it's scary sometimes. She makes lots of friends but she never seems fully connected with people, as if she only sees them as a source of entertainment.

653,"I'm living with my dad and seeing a therapist now. I'm on some psychiatric meds as well.

I have problems with weed, alcohol, and the law. I was arrested once at age 18 for a class B felony. I had stolen a little over $300 worth of property from three separate stores. Shoplifting still continues to be a bad habit of mine, but I've kicked my graffiti habit. I channel a lot of my anger and negative feelings through more positive outlets now. Music (I play three instruments), gardening (I grow various flowers in my room), and painting (it's like graffiti but without the negative consequences). 

I'm 21 now and I feel so directionless. I'm embarrassed to tell my friends and bandmates that I'm unemployed and uneducated. I play bass in two separate bands, only one of which brings in any money and we don't get paid much per gig. The other band is run by a delusional guitarist / singer who thinks his original material is going to make him a star, but we can't get any gigs and his voice is mediocre. I would quit the second band but at this point it's just something to keep me busy because finding a band is hard. Most of the established bands in my area are run by baby boomers who won't give me the time of day because I'm young, and the rest are run by melodramatic Gen X'ers and Millenials who only do ""post-progressive hardcore djent metal"" or some other dogshit and won't give you the time of day if you don't listen to the two specific bands they are influenced by. Essentially, it feels like a dead music scene here, and most of the musicians I meet are airheads, ego-driven, judgmental, or just plain bad. 

I can't seem to find a job anywhere. I put in a lot of applications but very few will call back. At the places I really want to work (comic / movie / record stores, music shops, Home Depot / gardening stores, craft stores) I'll go in one or two more times to check on my application. All these places are hiring right now, and I can't get a single call back. I'm worried it's because of my criminal background or something. 

I just needed someplace to vent. If you wanna give advice, go ahead it's all welcome, because I can't tell anyone IRL how dissatisfied I am except for my therapist. I'm just so sick of it all.",28Oct2019,1

655,"I was hired to do budgeting for a small team in a major company not long ago.  I gave up a sure thing for this role because I thought it was a great way to get my foot into the door.

Fast forward to about 2 months in, and my boss is now using me as his personal assistant and I'm at odds about it because this isn't what I've been hired to do.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to help out and do things that aren't technically part of my job, but this is on a different scale.

This person now has me doing their expenses, printing things for them because they can't be bothered to use the printer, and ordering office supplies.

If they wanted a personal assistant, they should've hired one, but generally speaking, a PA doesn't come with my technical skills which is what they were looking for in someone to fill this role.

I'm now at odds with how I feel about working here, even considered quitting because I feel it's BS now.  I am not an FTE and contracted through a recruitment agency.  Do I let my recruiter know my thoughts and have him handle it from here? Or do I bring it up myself to my boss?

657,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 1.5 years, and we have discussed getting engaged in the near future. The only problem is his adult daughter-- she is a senior in college and she refuses to acknowledge our relationship or be anywhere near me. She will not go to events if I am attending and makes that well known to her father. She also refuses to speak to him about me. She is convinced I broke up her parent's marriage, even though I didn't and and her father has told her it was not true-- but her mother keeps telling her otherwise. (The divorce was pending way before I came along)  She is a grown adult who only comes around for holidays and when she wants something (i.e. a car to take to school, money for spring break, a new cell phone, etc.). 

Last year, since it was the first set of holidays since he got divorced, I gave up spending any time with my boyfriend's family because his daughter threatened to not attend if I was present. I decided to give her the space she needed  because it was their first holidays as a divorced family and I hoped she would eventually warm up to me. 

In a few weeks, my boyfriend has tickets to see a football game at her school. She will be sitting in the student section with her boyfriend, but she has made it clear that she does not want me to attend with my boyfriend (the stadium holds 15,000 people- it's not like it is a small thing). Her school is 6 hours away and will require my boyfriend to stay overnight at a hotel. I want to attend the game-- it is a big deal (a huge rivalry in college football that includes a big tailgate, etc.). I feel like if my boyfriend does not make it clear to her that she cannot dictate who he dates, this will go on forever. But I also know that he fears he will lose his relationship with his daughter if he brings me. I respect that, and have told him multiple times that I am completely ok with him going out for dinners with her, to go shopping, etc. but that I did not want to miss out on any fun/big events (for example, I was uninvited from a similar football game last year for the same reason-- I agreed not to go because our relationship was still relatively new to her).

She needs to realize we are serious. I am more than fine with staying at the hotel so they can get dinner together or whatever else they want to do, but the tailgate/football game is open to the public and I feel like by allowing her to reject me/control who attends, will only further give her the idea that her behavior is acceptable and will continue throughout the years.

663,"My previous role was a manager in a small and niche area of expertise that most folks view as a dead end. I liked the work and did it well but the pay definitely wasn't great (I only made 1-2 dollars more than my direct reports making minimum wage, and less than associate-level positions in other departments) so I decided to look for other jobs that didn't have me scraping by every month and constantly groveling for a raise. I ended up with a few offers but the main two I was choosing between were 1. a great job in the same kind of role but only a few dollars more than what I made, and 2. a job in a totally new and unknown specialty to me that paid twice as much, at a large company that would basically be a shiny gold medal on a resume. Everyone I knew pushed me towards the latter as the obvious choice, even though my heart kept telling me to go for the former: it sounded like a lot of fun even though I wouldn't be rolling in dough at a golden company, everyone I met was great and passionate about the job. Something inside me was screaming not to take the latter job based on my observations from the interview and the people I met. But I kept telling myself, how bad could it be? I truly wish I had listened to my gut.

First week, I discover the place is constantly on fire. Which isn't new to me, but I didn't expect the place to be so disorganized and everyone so busy that no one had even prepared my equipment and computer, and I ended up not seeing these for the next few days. I spent most of that time twiddling my thumbs and shadowing stressed coworkers who were trying to train me while also speeding through their tutorials so they can meet tight deadlines ASAP. The sheer volume of steps I had to learn for every individual task and the speed in which they were taught to me went by so fast I started feeling like their words were going in one ear and out the other. The following week in they start fully expecting me to know what I'm doing even though I hardly had any actual practice, and my questions are met with ""I already explained this to you"" or ""I can't answer this right now, ask someone else."" Everyone's too busy with their own work to help me figure out my own, at one point I hadn't even seen my manager's face for a full week even though he was in-office. Then the fun part comes in.

We're very clearly understaffed as what was originally a team of five was now being reduced to two. One person quit before I started, another had to understandably go on medical leave. But the weirdest case was this: the company suddenly decided to move another teammate to HQ or a ""special project"" that seemingly only they can do? Which left me and the remaining coworker splitting the work of what I feel should be for 5-6 people. When I asked if they were hiring more people to help us, the answer I got back was basically a no. So here I am with a lot of new work to do, one of which is super high-pressure and has no room to mess up (it's so high-stakes that they make you write a company-wide apology letter if you make an error. I've already had to do two!) and a slew of other items that basically have me working OT every single work night just to finish it all on time. I was assigned to participate in a bunch of meetings where I have no idea what's going on or what's even being said (since as mentioned earlier, this is a new role outside of my area of expertise, it felt like being a history student trying to converse about Java with seasoned engineers) and expected to write reports and respond to questions on things I knew nothing about. I have no idea why they didn't give these higher-level, higher-stakes duties to the more seasoned employee. I learned from a coworker that most of the crazy work we're doing right now isn't even our ACTUAL job duties- we're temporarily filling in for another short-staffed department!

This whole experience has me questioning my abilities and is tearing my confidence apart- it's been three weeks, I should get this by now. But I clearly don't. I feel like I'm going crazy or that I'm in way over my head, like I oversold myself and gave my new company snake oil, or lied about being a great worker who's able to learn quickly back during our interviews. I can't even get a moment to speak with my manager about my struggles because his entire schedule every day is booked to the brim. I don't even know if I WANT to speak with him because I feel like he's not going to be able to do anything to help, it's clearly a larger organizational issue (what kind of company just moves an employee when their team is already understaffed?) I'm left wondering if this is my fault for sucking so bad or if it's their fault for putting all this responsibility on a new person who isn't even 30 days in yet. I'm just pressing buttons and typing things and hoping nothing explodes.

Anyways, the stress has affected my eating habits and I can't sleep. I only have the appetite for one meal a day now, also ended up getting sick over the weekend and have been sleepless every night with racing thoughts and anxiety. I've been throwing up for the past few days now and passing out or crying in my car after work. I had an alcohol problem as a teenager and I'm thinking about picking up the bottle again for the first time in years. I've been having loud alarm bells ringing in my head telling me to walk out and quit, while another half of me says I should be grateful to have a well-paying job, and stick it out. I'm at a point where I'm wishing they'd just fire me, I'm probably okay with penny-pinching, surviving off top ramen, and taking lower-paying jobs over this. I've even been having suicidal thoughts because I feel trapped, I'm one disciplinary action away from having a full nervous breakdown and checking myself into a mental hospital. Getting punished for messing up at this job has been so humiliating and I'm finding myself more thin-skinned than I realized. The worst part is having been a manager before and wanting to speak up and fight for my team's working conditions like I've done successfully in the past, but I can't because I'm in a lower position now. I feel so emasculated.

So do I just stick it out and pray I don't kill myself from the stress? Maybe this is just growing pains and I'll learn the ropes after struggling for a bit. It's still early enough to where I can't really tell if I'm just being negative about my abilities and that's clouding my vision (I'm a perfectionist). The other employees will be back in a few months and things won't be as bad. The job title itself is a really great one and would guarantee me a set future with good pay for the rest of my life (just at different companies, for sure), if I can survive long enough and not get fired here for making too many mistakes. Many people get through jobs that are even worse than this. I'm used to being naturally talented and learning things quickly and have never been bad at a job before so this experience is all new to me. Suggestions to help cope with this kind of stress are much appreciated.

The other option is to walk out.  If I walk out now, I'm probably going to have to go back to dead-end work making barely enough to survive, but I'm starting to feel like I'm only good enough for that kind of role and not smart enough to do... whatever it is I'm doing right now. I really have no idea if these working conditions, even if they're temporary, are worth any amount of money they pay me. Every day I wish I took the other job offer. I'm having weird fantasies about different ways I can announce my quitting or proudly refusing to work under these conditions. But I don't know if I have it in me to quit a job so early, it feels incredibly embarrassing and will definitely burn a lot of bridges and possibly blacklist me from working in this industry ever again.

tl;dr can't decide if my thin-skinned self should put up with my new hell for the sake of a better future, or walk out before I have a nervous breakdown.",28Oct2019,1
664,"My wife and I have seen a few signs that one of my daughters might have an eating disorder.  She's currently in middle school.  She's always been very slender but a few weeks ago we've noticed that she's not really been eating very much, even her favorite foods.  She's skipping breakfast and either not eating supper or not eating very much supper at all.  We've been encouraging her to at least have a little but I don't know if she's developing an eating disorder or if something else is going on.  She also had an anxiety attack at school.

Im 24 y/o so the thought completely slipped my mind when asking my landlord about internet last month when we set up the lease. Are there any other decent alternatives to cable internet? Ive called ATT, Comcast, and other local providers but none say they are available. ATT mentioned satellite internet but Ive never heard of the company they referred to (Viasat) and Ive honestly never heard anything positive about satellite internet. Ive looked into Verizon's mifi's as well and think they may be a viable option but Im just so unsure. My wife and I stream heavily and I play Xbox daily. Is this going to be possible?",28Oct2019,1
669," Im 19 and im in my second year of university. Recently i started feeling depressed and anxious everytime i think of my university, or anything related to it. 
  All my life i was dreaming of working, i belive that is because i never had to work in my life before. During school years my parents were earning enough, so i didnt have to work. And during my first year of university i had so many lessons that i would come home at 5 pm, so i would be free after eating and other necessities at 6 pm. So i was unable to experience work of any kind. 
So after last year i still have 3 unfinished subjects,( i was skipping lessons because i thought i can easily do and finish everything. Turns out i was... wrong)
  Furthermore i hate most of the teachers, maybe not their personalities in particular, but their subjects.  I just dont feel comfortable learning things i dont enjoy, nor think of as useful. 
  When i was choosing the profession ( Any based on math and physics ), i didnt care what to study, i just had one goal in my mind, to finish uni and start working, that was my sort of dream, as wierd as it may sound. And it is to this day. 
  So all that added up slowly, and now i feel sick, anxious, depressed,everytime i go to university i just dont know what to do. I feel like vomiting everytime i think of doing anything i thats connected to university in any way.
  I belive i owe you an Explanation why do i have to be in university. I live in Russia, and after school, unless you study in university or have any medical conditions, you have to go to army for one year. Which actually makes you dumb, its not even funny how terrible it is. You lose one year of your life, and after that most of the people dont go to university and just go on without education, which is required for 90% of full time jobs.
  I started to think of any solution, i have kind of a plan in mind, but i feel like it can do serious damage to my life, or make it better. In my mind i was thinking of signing up for repeating second year, which would make the rest of the year pretty much free,( i would have to wait untill next year and finish all the subjects from first year) and i could go and work on any job. At the time i would go in another university and sign up for a course there( i will quit current uni) and just start studying from first year (some finished subjects may transfer, which is ofcourse a good thing)
  
Please help me, tell me if i sound dumb, or its a normal thing, maybe some people have gone through changing university, i just need someones advise. Or im just lazy and i have to man up and finish everyhing in current uni.

TLDR: i hate my university, but i have to study in university, otherwise i will have to go in army( in russia unless you study or have medical conditions, males have to go to army for one year, which is really unpleasant). I think of qitting current uni asap and working( working was my dream) until next year, and start from scratch in another university ( some subjects grades may transfer to another uni). Tell me please, if i should do what my heart and soul tells me to, or i have to step up and finish everything in current uni and im making a deal out of nothing.",28Oct2019,1
670,"Imagine you walk into a miracle shop, confetti rains down from the ceiling and balloons erupt from the floor while all the other patrons start looking at you and applauding. You see a salesperson approach you with an award winning smile and says ""Congratulations~! You're our 10,000,000th customer! Here, please accept this mansion, luxury car, all the clothes you could ask for and a billion dollars! No strings attached, not even property tax or anything :D"" 

You respond ""No thanks."" turn around and walk out just in time for a guy to pass you on the way out. He claims all the prizes and internally you're like ""Son of a bitch!"" for a few seconds before going back to feeling nothing. 

Even in those rare moments where I do receive something like that be it something small like a donut from a coworker or some strange currency I found on a busy city street, I feel just awful before, during and after. The bigger the ""thing"" the more powerful the negative feeling. My chest nearly caved in when one of my co-workers ran into me in public and offered to spend the day with me. 

Sometimes I lean into it though, much like pressing your finger into a bruise I try to see if this affliction will ever subside. So I bought a plane ticket, booked a hotel and went out into the world with the intention of experiencing something that makes people happy. Although after the plane landed in my destination I was unable to leave the bathroom stall because I was so sick with myself that I threw up for what felt like hours. I booked a new flight back home and spent the rest of my time off sleeping in my apartment.

671,"I have had my first generation microsoft surface laptop for a little over a year. I've been using it for school so I use it a lot. I dropped it recently and the track pad popped out, and not surprisingly- its running painfully slow. In addition to this, I noticed the sides of the screen yellowing a few weeks prior to dropping it. I've done some research and visited a few repair shops. The general consensus seems to be that it can't be fixed. I tried to open a repair ticket wirh microsoft and the only option they gave me was a replacement for $450. That's not too bad, so I decided I could just do that. I was thinking that maybe I shouldn't though, since it's not easy to fix and every break would require a new laptop. So my question is- should I buy the replacement or get a completely different laptop that is fixable? If so, does anyone have any recommendations for under $500? I love the Surface, and stick to Windows generally.",28Oct2019,1

673,"My (now ex) gf (23F) of almost 4 years broke up with me (22F) on Wednesday. I found out she reconnected with someone from her past and realized she loved her. I confronted her about it and she told me the truth and said they had sex the weekend before when we went to visit our families (the girl lives 3+ hours away from us). She told me the main reason for the breakup wasn’t that but rather that she wasn’t happy anymore. She realized she just didn’t know how to leave anymore because we were too comfortable and she didn’t want to hurt me. She said she also felt trapped because we live together and I basically pay for most of our living expenses, and she just got back in grad school and doesn’t have much time to work. 

Initially, I broke down and asked her to give me a second chance. After we talked and discussed things that had been happening in our relationship and within ourselves, I realized we both needed to grow on our own too because we had become too codependent on each other and it just wasn’t healthy anymore. Don’t get me wrong, our relationship wasn’t bad either. It was honestly the best 4 years of my life and I’m so grateful for her and all the things she helped me through and everything we did together. I learned a lot about myself and grew a lot in those years, and she did too. 

We agreed we would stay living together and just keep things like how they were in the sense of most of our normal best friend dynamics. We share a bed, but we don’t try to cross the line kinda thing because it’s not about that. It has been okay I’d say, better than what we thought. The only thing that’s weird about this is that she’s in love with someone else, but I’ve sorta made my peace with that, because I can’t force her to choose me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still in love. 

We went mountain biking together again after over a month of not doing so on Saturday and we had such a good time. She said that we hadn’t communicated like that in so long when biking. She said I always brush her tips off or look annoyed, but this time we were both giving each other tips and enjoying it more than ever. Then Saturday night she spent her whole night talking to the girl on our patio, and I went to do my own thing and then to sleep when I got home. 

Yesterday she worked in the morning I went to run some errands. We both got home at the same time and just chatted a bit and then I went to take our dogs to the park while she napped because she hadn’t slept last night and worked early. When I got back she was studying and after we ordered a pizza and watched our show together. We talked about how ever since after we discussed what has happened, we have been getting along so much better and actually listening to each other more and just being kinder, so I feel like that’s what makes me feel like she thinks about it too. Afterwards, I went to the gym, and she went to study, after I got home, her and the girl got on the phone and just stayed I outside talking all night again, I went to bed. Obviously these things bother me a bit because I’m still in love, and after all, it doesn’t affect me as much as I thought it would. 

My thing now is, I’m not sure what I should do. I don’t want to pressure her, because I know she’s still figuring out how she feels about this girl, they have been dealing with these feelings for each other since well before we even met, they just never got closure, but now their lives are in completely different places but they’ve finally successfully reconnected. 

In one hand I just want to give up and stop thinking about fixing things with her. But it’s so hard because I feel like I just fall in love with her every day again. 

In the other hand, what I’d like to do, is to wait. Keep doing life together for a bit longer. She won’t be able to move at least until December. Let her explore her true feelings and get her life together, and maybe she’ll fall in love with me again too. 

I’m currently just working on myself. Working on new healthy habits and getting rid of bad ones, working on my relationships with parents and friends, and I have people that love me and support me. I’m the kind of person that hates being alone which is why I don’t want her to leave, but I know that once this period is over, whatever she decides will be it, because I can’t just sit and wait for that long either. 

I guess I just wanted to hear people’s opinions or experiences, if you’ve gone through something like this, from either side, because I think trying to under what could be going through her mind would help me too. 

Thanks in advance y’all.",28Oct2019,1

675,"My BF (40M) is close friends with serval women he’s slept with. He’s almost started relationships with some of them but couldn’t bc of distance. Most of his friends live in other parts of the world and met during their visits to the vacation town we live in. He speaks to them regularly and they still travel through often, tho he’s kind enough to introduce me when they’re here. 

When I (33F) asked him to explain some of the relationships a little better so I could understand, he’d mentioned they’d had sex before but he has a gf now and respects this. When I asked if he would pursue them again if we broke up, he answered honestly that he would, but I need to not worry about that now as it’s “negative thinking” and “unreal” at this time. 

Personally, I start to cut constant communication with men I’ve slept with in the past as I feel the sexual chemistry is inappropriate when I have a bf. He doesn’t see it that way and refuses to let go of his friends for any relationship. 

His last girlfriend demanded he cut out all women, so I think he’s concerned to lose his autonomy. I’m very supportive of his relationships with female friends but have started feel uncomfortable with some. I don’t feel that he’s cheating, but rather keeping his options open. It unsettling. 

Am I justified in feeling uncomfortable or just insecure?

680,"I was at a concert last night with a friend, and we were dancing in proximity to a table of men who had bottle service. They were pretty kind to us, and eventually, one of them offered to pour me a drink because they had more than enough alcohol to go around. I happily accepted — this is a big city, and drinks at this particular club are like $15. Of course, I realize now how tremendously stupid this was. After about twenty minutes, it was exceptionally clear that I had been drugged.

I lost all motor control, and could only mumble “something’s not right” to my friend who quickly grabbed me and dragged me out of the club. I collapsed outside on the pavement. She told me this morning that she spoke to the bouncers. They knew what table the guys who had done it were at, but as she put me in an uber, realized that they had fled the club after they saw security taking care of me. 

My friend and my roommate took great care of me, but needless to say, I woke up this morning feeling like I had gotten hit by a truck. I still feel awful, and I don’t remember much. Since we have so much information about what time this occurred, what these men looked like, and what table they had been occupying, my friends thought it would be a good idea to press charges. At the very least, prevent this from happening again.

I have a minor surgical procedure scheduled for Wednesday where I’ll have to be under general anesthesia for about half an hour. Again, nothing major. When I called the hospital, they told me to go to urgent care to get a drug screening. If I’ve been roofied, there’s a good chance the drug will interfere with the anesthesia I’m put under. They need to figure out what I was given in order to clear me for the procedure.

Here’s where I’m in a bit of a pickle. I’m not a habitual drug user — I smoke weed pretty constantly, but I live in a legal state, so that’s not an issue. However, on Friday night I was offered a single bump of cocaine at a Halloween party and thought “why the hell not?” My issue is that I now need to go in for a MANDATORY full drug screening. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I feel like the cocaine is going to show up, and then what? 

Should I go in for the screening tonight? Should I just call and reschedule my procedure? Will the cocaine show up? If it does, what will the hospital do? Should I try to press charges or have the club track the guys that did it down? This is really just a big huge fucking mess, and none of my friends know how to help me. ANY advice y’all have at all would be great.",28Oct2019,7

682,"So hopefully I don't make this too long.

I recently graduated college and got a job with a big four accounting firm. Obviously an incredible job and a great opportunity for a career in accounting. I had to move to another state for the position and have been here about two months. I am only two hours away from family but due to the long hours I will only get to see them once every two months or so. For context I am very close with both my parents, my youngest brother, and my girlfriend lives there also. Honestly the job has sucked so far, they work you consistently and to be honest my enjoyment of accounting came more from finding problems I could fix rather than doing tedious audit work. My manager has no interest in teaching and expects others to ""take care of me"" (clearly someone who wants to be partner) and I can't see myself ever sacrificing my life in the pursuit of a higher position and more money. My father was a teacher for a lot of my life, and I personally have been helped in my life by a few of my teachers. I think this is something I would like to pursue, and since I would work in New York the salary is pretty competitive (more than I currently make but with less room to advance upwards). This would allow me to be way closer to my family and have more time to see them. Also I have always wanted to coach basketball. My high school coach has told me he wanted me to help him coach and said he could see me doing it on multiple occasions. I can't do that while working at an accounting firm 8am-8pm during prime basketball season. I know it is a pipe dream but it would be incredible to even be a college coach and something I really desire. I am just torn because this accounting position is something I have worked for most of my life and is truly a top 10 job you can start in business with. Any thoughts?

She’s super nosy too - I’ve had countless run ins with her because of hiding cigarettes around my room and alcohol (she doesn’t like me drinking at all) and I know I’m going to have to bring this behaviour over into my new flat because she’s going to be nosing around trying to find something.

For the past few years, there have been times where I think about something, or realize something, or believe something, and it freaks me out. A lot.
When I get worried about something, I tend to obsess over it, looking for an answer, or plain worrying to no avail. After a long time, it tends to go away and I stop worrying or freaking out about it. And then there are long stretches of normal in between. I feel good during those moments. I feel myself and I don't fall down spiraling for months.
Yesterday, I had one, and now I'm worried this will grip me for months. I know it's idiotic and I hate myself for even worrying about something so stupid and crazy. 
I was watching Ted X Talks last night, and stumbled upon a ""computer simulation"" thing. Per say, it's not the computer simulation theory that got me. It's what he said in the video. He brought up something called Solipsism. 
It's also known as the ""other mind"" theory/long-sought-after philosophy question. It is completely illogical and I dont know why it scared me so bad. That was yesterday, and it led to this: I'm terrified of driving myself insane. It's incredibly horrifying and I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. I'm Christian, I believe in god, yet there's that ""what if"" part inside my head that drives me to feeling scared or paranoid. It is completely illogical but I can't stop worrying.

My dad is always that one funny dad that makes my friends feel at ease, cracking dad jokes but unfortunately not like that behind closed doors.

I don’t know if my dad is genuinely abusive or if it is just me being sensitive, you can give me your opinion on this.

Ever since I was little, I remember my dad always hitting my mother and one time, I was asleep next to my mom and brother but I woke up in the middle of the night to my drunken father choking my mother and that was very traumatic. I get flashbacks every night. They have almost been divorced several times but my dad always finds a way to persuade my mother regardless of the many times he almost killed her. I also recall once during Christmas my parents were in a fight. My dad dropped my brother and I at my uncle’s house to stay for the night and he said he will be coming back later to join us. We waited for my dad the whole day and my uncle was worried. Keep in mind that my uncle knows about the abuse and I always had to call him crying whenever my dad was out of control and he always came to help. So my dad never came to my uncle’s house and left us there for 2 days without answering any calls until I had to text my friend who lives in the same neighbourhood as us and told her to go to our house and ask my dad to pick up my calls. Fast forward my father finally called 1 day after that and told my uncle to drop us off at home. We went back and everything seemed normal except that my mother shaved her head. We had a maid and she explained to me that when my brother and I were at my uncle’s, my dad was beating my mother up and dragging her around the house from her hair while the neighbours watched and did nothing (the maid wasn’t there at the time but the neighbours told her what they had seen). I was only 12 at the time and didn’t know how to process the information so I dismissed it but I couldn’t imagine what my mother went through. There’s also been instances where my dad called 13 year old me a “whore who will lose her virginity as soon as she starts high school” to my mother after flipping over my entire closet and making me, my mother and brother sleep on the floor during winter. He also smashed the TV and water glasses and left the glass all over the floor and whenever I brought my friends over I blamed it on the cat. There’s so much more but I’d rather not recall that. I don’t even remember being happy. My parents fought too much throughout my childhood and called each other all kinds of names. They never let me sleep at night because they would fight all the way to 3 am and I always feel like it’s my fault. He keeps bringing me into the argument and blames me and threatens to kill my brother and I.

Now we moved to another country. He works everyday, gets off once a week but never stays home to look after my younger brother and I. He always leaved to some mysterious place during his day off and never explains. My mother also works everyday minus weekends. Every day we are alone at home (my brother and I) I have to take care of household chores plus school. My father leaves me some money and tells me not to spend it all in one day. I have to make lunch and dinner for the entire family and have to go grocery shopping every single day after school. Groceries are expensive so of course I have to spend a lot of money in order to eat. But when ever I spend too much he will scold and shout at me and remind me how irresponsible I am but I keep telling him that I don’t want to bear on the responsibility of taking care of my brother and doing everything at home from laundry to mopping to tidying to cooking because I don’t have enough time left for my studies. He guilt trips me and uses the same excuse everytime: “But I’m so tired from work, you ungrateful brat” I know he is always working to provide us with money but I’m still too young to do everything. I sound like a spoilt child but trust me I am not. My parents don’t want to buy their own food or get a maid because they say they are too tired to do so and a maid cannot be trusted. I’m failing my exams and they are still putting pressure on me and telling me to study harder. 

In addition, my dad always calls me in the evening when he is at work and tells me to go out and buy extra stuff because he forgot to tell me so I always have to go out around 3 to 4 times to get him what he wants. I always tell him that he can get it from his workplace because there’s a supermarket nearby but he always uses the same excuse. I tell him that I have to study and he gets very angry at me and my mother defends him. If I don’t make enough food, I don’t eat and have to starve which happens too much and I am underweight. I only eat once a day and sometimes never. I survive on energy drinks and cup noodles I purchase at school. Not surprised I haven’t dropped dead yet, really looking forward to it.
I have complained to my mother countless times but she always makes me feel bad and tells me “he is your father, obey him” and I can see that she is very afraid and submissive to him. She acts all tough but I know she is mentally scared of him. Whenever I rant to her about my problems, she ignores me. Once I told her I was being sexually abused by my teacher when I was 10 but she shouted at me and got angry because I didn’t tell her. I was so scared and my teacher threatened me not to tell anyone but I trusted my mother. But not just that, she has terrible mood swings and always gives me and my brother silent treatment at random times so we never know what is the matter. I gave up on talking to her because sometimes she will respond and sometimes ignore me completely. Whenever I confront her about it she says “I am a very complicated person, no one can understand me”. Whenever she stays at home during weekends, she forgets to feed us. She would always complain about having to cook and leave my brother and I hungry. At this point I’m used to having a growling stomach and empty pocket. I don’t have an allowance but it’s okay. I don’t deserve it.

Whenever my father comes back at around 10 pm, he bosses me around even when I am studying for exams. He always complains about every single thing on earth and I cannot take it. He guilts me every time and threatens me and I always feel unsafe around him. Whenever I feel down or sad he will scold me and throw things at me. God forbid I have personal problems. I had 3 friends who committed suicide and whenever I feel sad about it he tells me to cheer up and stop being a bratty little bitch. I wish I could join them. It never works.

Nowadays, I am dealing with something I don’t know how to explain. I am reminded of my dad by everything and it is disgusting. Even his voice makes me irrationally angry all the time. Everything I see reminds me of him and I cannot enjoy anything in life without thinking of him. I feel repulsed even by sexual themes and innocent things. I’m also afraid I am treating my young brother how my dad is treating me. I feel like I am abusive and toxic without even trying. I call him names and I feel like shit afterwards but I always apologise and show him I never meant those harsh words. I am scared I might turn into another version of my dad and I don’t want that. I am genuinely trying to better myself and I think I am doing a good job.

I am planning on killing myself sometime soon. I’ve tried twice but they never work so hopefully it will this time. I missed a lot of details but I tried to explain briefly. If you read this far, thank you. I have nobody to talk to so I resorted to reddit.",28Oct2019,1

697,"I woke up yesterday afternoon to find an email receipt for a Bernie Sanders campaign sweater. The address is in Ashburnham, Massachusetts... I live in Asia and haven't been to the US for over a decade. I clicked the link to the website it was ordered from and it does appear to be the legit Sanders campaign store ([store.berniesanders.com](https://store.berniesanders.com)). However, on the order page there is a ""Contact Us"" link that does absolutely nothing when I click it. I replied directly to the email that sent me the receipt yesterday but haven't received a response yet, and I want to avoid calling a US number if I can to avoid unnecessary expenses.

The most baffling part to me is the fact they used my name and email, but apparently no other info about me. Is there a reason people do this? I double-checked my card, bank, PayPal, Google account, etc. and nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. I don't recognize the last four digits of the card used to make the purchase either.

704,"I bought a surface laptop 2 in January of last year, and about 6 months later the battery stopped charging. I bought a new charger assuming that was the problem, but when that didn't fix it, I called Microsoft. They told me to send in my device, that they'd fix it, and if it was irreparable they'd replace it.  I sent it in, received my follow up correspondences exclusively in German, then received a new laptop in the mail. When I inquired as to the whereabouts of my old laptop, they said they'd wiped it and I couldn't get it back. When I plugged in the replacement laptop... it didn't work. I bought yet another charger, and that too didn't work. Microsoft offered to replace the second laptop, so once I again I sent it in, they sent me a replacement, and... it doesn't work. So they sent me a new charger, and it still doesn't work.

At this point I have received three faulty devices in a row, I have lost all the data from my first computer, and I have lost multiple work contracts because I needed a computer to carry out the work.

705,"Im 16(M) and i am extremely introverted and socially awkward so as you may imagine i find it pretty hard to make friends, spwcially since i don't play sports.
I am greatful for having some friends but now i've started to think that they might not be my friends after all. You see, i never feel awkward when we are together in silence and i go out with them but only when they suggest to do something in the group chat, many times however i learn in school as they are talking that some of them went out and i wasnt even invited. What hurts most is that the two main ""friends"" that do this live on my block and a couple of blocks from me and they don't even take me into consideration. Other thing that usually happens is that our school is near our houses so my ""friend"" who lives in the same block always invites everyone in the group to his house to eat, however not even once has he invited me. He tells me to bring a lunchbox but the few times i do, he invites everyone except for me. They dont even chat with me, i only talk with them on school and when we go out. What hurts most is that i am always there for them and they never seem to be there for me, i am always made fun of and im the only one to be made fun of, they mock me and ignore me yet act as my friends. I think this might have contributed to how i am feeling lately, ever since a couple months ago i cant have fun, i dont enjoy myself doing things i used to enjoy, i dont see life as something to be greatful for or anything, lately i've become indifferent(not suicidal, just indifferent, i actually fear death).

706,"I’m currently in my third year of uni, my course is considered full time, the lecturers present the course during the week for the students on campus, then they present the course in a night class over 2 nights (6 hours in total a week), at a venue more local to me and a few other mature students. So as you can imagine, we are doing a lot of individual learning, and probably aren’t getting a lot of what the campus students are getting. Which is fine, I signed up because I wanted to fit it around me working full time. 

The university didn’t have a lot of interest in the course, so they have decided to stop offering evening courses at the venue I attend, but are still obliged to complete ours. But rather than have 2 classes once a week, they have now cut us down to 2 classes every other week. It’s not ideal, and I’m going to miss out on a lot of valuable time with the lecturers, so I’m a little annoyed I’m still paying the same amount as my first 2 years. 

Anyway, I have just gone through the material for this weeks ‘at home’ session, went to google for more help understanding it, and found the exact same lecture online from a completely different teacher. Feel like the uni just doesn’t care at all, so I really begrudge paying my uni fees. I have always said I went to uni for the education, and not a piece of paper.

I have also felt her soft PUSSY FUR and I have put part of my finger in her, but her camel toe is small and tight. . We are going to be alone this weekend for about 5 hours. I want her pussy so bad. I know she is so tight and I would ROCK her world. Any ideas? I really WANT THIS. NEED HER PUSSY BAD. I will use lube as well because I don't want to hurt her too badly.

I told her that making love is important and she will die before she is 13 if she does not have loved made to her. She is scared and does not want to die. I told her, that if I can make love to her and keep it a BIG SPECIAL SECRET she will be fine. I think I got her hook line and sinker!

711,"This is going to be long, so I apologize in advance.  
Cast is as follows (not real names): Me: 36/F; Jim: brother, 4 years younger - married to my best friend from HS. He and I live in the same state - the rest of our family lives in a different state; Jenny: SIL/friend; Kyle: youngest sibling, 15 years old, Bonny: our mother’s stepmom, raised Jim with our grandpa.
 Backstory: I was raised by my father after my mother lost custody due to drug use (among other issues) when I was around 3, and her side of the family never made any attempt to be part of my life. They also left me to the foster care system when mom lost custody rather than take me in until my dad could come get me - again, I was a toddler, but I remember this bc I was initially put in a group home due to this and it was AWFUL.  They did, however, take in my brother, Jim, when she lost custody of him a couple of years later and raised him as their son.  So needless to say, I have never been close with that side of the family.
Now FF to the current situation.  My youngest brother is 15, and has wanted to get away from mom for years because her living situation is not safe or stable, but she wouldn’t let him because she relies on him for income. She has never worked, and survives on the welfare she gets for her kids, and he’s the last one. Recently though, she had a change of heart, and Jim flew down to pick him up and got power of attorney before she changed her mind. We didn’t know what had changed her mind, but we all wanted to get him out of that situation, so we didn’t question it. So Kyle is here now and enrolled in school, living with Jim.  A few weeks after he moved up here, mom emailed to tell us that CPS was going to call, and we were to lie and tell them Kyle is only visiting, and would be back in a couple of weeks. It turns out, she had planned to just not inform the state that he was no longer in her care, and therefore continue collecting for him under false pretenses, but that plan was dashed when the police were called to her apartment for a robbery, and they saw the state of it and reported her to CPS (she’s an animal hoarder and there is feces and rotting food all over the house). CPS then made a visit and demanded to see him, so now her benefits are on the line. We told her we will not lie to the authorities for her, so she suddenly started pretending Jim had kidnapped him under the guise of bringing him for a visit. This is obviously untrue - she signed over power of attorney so we could enroll him in school here FFS. When that didn’t work, she went to our grandparents and told them (she doesn’t have the balls to ask me directly) that I need to let her move into my house if Kyle is going to stay here so that she “can be close to her baby”.  To be clear, it’s so she’ll have a free place to live since she’ll no longer be getting welfare for Kyle.  The grandparents then went to Jim and told him to tell me that it’s my “responsibility” to take her in since I have a three bedroom house and only my young daughter and I live in it. Not that it matters, but I use the third bedroom as an office as I work from home full time. I said no. First of all, taking her in would mean I’m responsible for her for the rest of her life because I know she’d never willingly leave. Second of all, she’s on high dose methadone, and she frequently leaves it lying around unlocked - I have a young child, and even a drop of that could kill her. Third of all, I work from home and don’t want someone at the house all day distracting me. Fourth, I know what kinds of people she associates with and she freely talks about her methadone - I don’t want these people knowing that two women and a child live here alone and there are drugs to steal.  Grandparents tried to pressure me, but I held fast.
Well apparently mom is now saying she is going to demand Kyle fly back (he does NOT want this) if I don’t agree to let her move in. She told all of this to Bonny, and Bonny emails Jim telling him that the responsibility for all of this is on me, and it will be all my fault if Kyle has to go back.  Jim is on my side with all of this, but the emails are, understandably, stressing him out and putting all of us in a terrible position. I don’t want Kyle to be shipped back to live in a cesspool, but I also don’t want to have to take her in and put my daughter in a potentially dangerous situation.  Kyle’s dad is not much better off than mom, and doesn’t want to take him in, and Jim/Jenny don’t have the time/money to contest for custody.  Advice?",28Oct2019,1

713,"So, long story short, my mom has custody of my niece, and I wind up doing most of the childcare. I have schizophrenia, which prevents me from working, but due to my mental illness, I get enough money to live off of, just a couple grand a month, tax free. It's a bit more than minimum wage, in case that matters. 

I've tried online dating off and on a few times, and every time the topic comes around to what I do for a living, interest seems to be lost when I tell them I'm a stay at home uncle, but I always mention that I do have an income and pay bills. I've gotten advice to wait after a few dates to bring up my mental illness, but I can't seem to get past the getting to know you texting phase and then on to the actual dates. 

I do well enough with taking care of the house, dishes, garbage, sweeping, mopping, wiping, niece's piano lessons, managing groceries, dinners, and packing my kid's lunches and it's all easy enough for me. But most of my day is spent watching shows, playing games, reading, or in online chat rooms. I'm also trying to teach myself to crochet. Which is in stark contrast to after school and weekends, which are full up taking care of my niece and I hardly get a moments peace. It feels like I've got too much spare time because I usually have 6-8 hours free every weekday, but at the same time I don't get time off because I have to get my niece ready and pick her up everyday and weekends are chaotic, me and mom trade off picking up after my sister who comes to visit her kid for one and a half days each weekend(supervised visitation). 

Also, since my mom is bad with finances, I manage the emergency fund and pay all of the bills besides rent and internet. So, I'm not a freeloader living in my mom's basement.

I am either going to find employment elsewhere or keep on if things can improve. However,  I highly doubt they will.

I brought the issue up to our employer as I am the manager of the business. He stated we have to wait it out and we will get more hours as it gets busier. He expects ""loyalty"" from me specifically because of my experience and skills. Loyalty goes both ways, not one. This clashes with my morals way too much for me to stick it out.

716,"So basically I don't have a lot of money so I go to an university hospital that allows me to get Psychological therapy and psychiatric help for free. I've been doing this for almost an year and today I went to talk with the Psychiatrist about the medications I would need to take. She said that I had ADHD and I had to treat myself with Ritalin but she said she wouldn't be able to give me a receipt (despite being sure I had ADHD) because she had to ask the  Psychologist about that, since  apparently a lot of people in psychology don't believe that ADHD exists.  


I always felt dumb, irresponsible and lazy and then she tells me that I won't be able to get myself treated just yet due to ideological and bureaucratic issues with the institution and  conflict of interest between  Psychiatry and psychology.

He lives with the mother of his two kids and their relationship is strained at best, think on and off but he has no choice but to live with her (dads passed away and mom is equally as useful as dad but still alive). The issue is that almost daily his ""baby mama"" finds something to get angry with him about and uses the leverage that they live in her family home to kick my brother out and he typically has to wait until she falls asleep to use his keys to sneak back in and sleep on the couch, sometimes paranoia involving him and other women, sometimes unfounded belief that he may have taken money from her, the list goes on. This past weekend, however, she kicked him out entirely and he basically had to sleep in his car, I live a couple hundred miles away so I couldn't house him.

724,"Hey everyone. I wanted to ask for some advice from you guys about my current situation. So, for some info:
I'm 16 years old and a high schooler. I finished my finals last year of high school, and decided that I wanted to do 2 years of a more difficult level. There were 2 reasons for this: I got through my previous 4 years of high school very easily, with good grades and with pretty average effort. All my teachers always told me that I could do the higher level that I'm doing right now easily. The second reason is that I did not know what kind of school I wanted to go to, and I didn't want to make a wrong choice. Now let me say this: The decision to stay on my school and do this higher level has been the worst choice of my life BY FAR. I regret it horribly. School has now started for about 8 or so weeks, and my first few grades have been terrible. The thing is, I have put in 100% maximum effort so far. I studied extensively and very long for the tests that I had, and I still got shit grades. So far these 8 or so weeks of school, I've been incredibly unhappy and sad. Now, my father has always been a very very hardworking man, and a huge perfectionist. He is constantly pushing me to work harder and harder, and gets very mad when I mention that this level of school is way too hard for me. He tells me that I am lazy, and never study for anything and that I can't play around anymore. I will admit, my previous 4 years of school I passed with minimum effort and pretty lazily. However, since school started I have promised myself to work as hard possible to get good grades. He told me that failing this year is not an option for me. And honestly, when I see my dad, who gets home very late from his job every day, we only ever talk about school. I share zero hobbies with my dad, and we never talk about anything else then one thing. School. I continue to put in very high effort into my studies, but my dad never thinks it's enough. I honestly fear for a very big quarrel coming up, since the social atmosphere between me and my dad is just not healthy. I will finish this higher level of school if I pass this year, but if I don't, I'm planning to go to college and specialize in my interest (Medical science and Chemistry). However, my dad said that's not an option. What can I do to easen the tension between me and my dad?

TLDR: Harder level of school is terrible and way too difficult, have been studying with maximum effort and still getting bad grades. Dad doesn't think I study and scolds me for not studying even more. All of this is making me very very unhappy.

Sorry for the big wall of text, and I apologize for my grammar, English isn't my first language. Any advice on this matter is very welcome and helpful!",28Oct2019,1
725,"I have PTSD and bipolar disorder. I take medication to help, as well as hormones because I'm trans. I take them everyday at 8 am and 8 pm. I recently got a pill divider because I'd screw up and take them late or forget. So the divider separates them by sunday am, sunday pm, monday am, etc. That way, they know if I've forgotten to take my meds because they'll still be in the divider if I've forgotten. I also text my mom every day just to assure her I remembered.

Today my mom came home sobbing and I heard yelling. She refused to talk to me, and my stepdad started yelling at me about how I'm not taking my meds. I was confused. I literally said ""what the fuck?"". He repeated his question and I told him I've been taking them and he would know if I missed them due to said divider. He kept saying I wasn't taking them because I've been ""up and down"" lately. Which is fair, I had to quit my job because I had a particularly bad episode after a coworker called me a slur and that triggered me. I couldn't sleep because of the late hours, I was working myself too hard, and I ended up sleeping for two days straight and not eating. I'm ok now, but I haven't been going out much besides when my best friend is off work. I don't know what he's talking about otherwise.

This has happened before and he wasn't listening to me so I just walked away. I was dressed up because I was going out with my friends, so I packed a bag and now I'm staying at my friend's house. 

What do I do? I know it'll be a shit storm when I go home, but I don't know how to approach this situation at all. I know they'll say ""this rollercoaster has to stop"" or ""we're sick of this up and down"" or something, but I legitimately don't know what they are talking about. What do I do?",28Oct2019,0
726,"Most recent example: I met a girl through tinder, we initially wanted to hook up, I backed out, we met up nevertheless. We ended up in her apartment and agreed to let the pants on. We watched netflix together and cuddled for hours and hours, also made out. Eventually she fell asleep on my chest and I stroked her head for an hour. She briefly woke up, smiled, held my hand and fell asleep again. 

I can't describe how happy that made me. I had to go, so I woke her up. She was pretty tired but pulled me towards her one more time, tried to cuddle with me again, gave me several kisses on the cheek (which I love!) and then gave me one last kiss on the lips. I swear to you, I came home as the happiest man in my city. I had 0 expectations before the date but it went sooooooooooo well. 

I told her that I enjoyed the time a lot and that I would love to meet up again. 

Now here comes the overthinking part. I know that she is a very sleepy person and that she also does not look at her phone as much as I do for example. I eventually learned that she was not on tinder for easy hookups, even though I had very much the impression at first. 

She answered my text nearly 14 hours later. She was really happy about my text and agreed to meet up again - however next week because she was so much under stress.

So here I am thinking that she might meet up with someone else instead. It breaks my heart. I always try make time for people who want to meet up with me. And here I am thinking that I am not that important to her, just an afterthought. Also I know that she is frequently online on social media but she does not answer my texts, at least not fast. Now I did not double text her or anything like that but it does make me sad that she is active but not paying attention to me or my texts.   

Like I am also under constant stress, we study the same thing and we both work part time. But if she wanted, I would reschedule some things in order to meet up with her.

I have been single for about 4 and a half years now, trying to work on my flaws and anything that may affect me in the future.  I have learnt to love myself.  This has been an amazing process in my life &amp; love me for me. The thing is, is that I recently started talking to this new girl.

And I haven’t felt happier, but I can’t rap my head around the fact that I’m super upset too. I can’t explain my thought process but here it goes. 

We’ll call this girl ‘jen’.  Now jen is this amazing girl she is both 10/10 both physically and her personality!  She is cute, responsible, smart and all around a great girl.  We have been talking for about a month now and I’m so happy with her.

That broke my heart mainly because he hid it from me for 3 months. 

So I messaged the girl and she sent me screenshots and told me the real story. He invited her over Oct 5, we had been dating 2 months. Told her he was talking to someone before and it didn't work out. She said they only talked and hung out for a couple of hours but never had sex or anything.

I confronted him about it when he called me today while at the airport. It took him a minute to admit the truth, he apologized and truly sounds heartbroken. He keeps asking me to let it go and begging me to move past it. He said he would get out of boot camp to come home and fix things.

In summary: we had a strong friendship with a lot of narcissism from his side, ending with really unfortunate misunderstandings. He probably feels bad by know; I still feel angry and sad. My very best memories of high school were with him (i.a. he positively laughed at almost anything I said or did) and some of the worst were because of him. I kept having contact with him because I thought he didn't know any better; he wasn't smart, really, and is still in the same high school while everyone's graduated last year.

I deleted any and all online media related to him. Every picture, his number, text messages, et cetera. Even going as far as deleting all my social media accounts, just to never encounter him ever again. He had blocked me already by then. But I kept two physical ""memorabilia"": two group photos of two excursions and a drawing he made for me, which I used as a bookmark. I couldn't throw them away; I never had the anger or ""emotional"" strength to do it, because I couldn't feel sad or angry forever, right?

I didn't think much of it until just recently when I started talking to him more frequently and realized that I really would enjoy spending time with him outside of work.  

Well, he hasn't extended an invitation again, even though he still talks about hiking, and I'm thinking it might be because he thought I wasn't interested since I didn't give him my number.  My question is, should I bring up the fact that I'm still interested in going?  If so, how?  I was thinking of asking if the offer is still open but I'm not sure if that is the right thing to do.",28Oct2019,1
761,"I [M24] met a girl [F22] earlier this year who was absolutely stunning. Smart, beautiful, funny, interesting, and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl. We talked and drank until midnight and we were too tired to continue. We didn't wait long to see each other again, and again we talked and drank all night. We had similar interests, personalities, senses of humor, everything.

However, she was only in the States temporarily and had to move back to Germany. In the end we were only together for about 2 months, and she has now been gone for 7. We agreed to stay in touch, but left the status of what we were to each other unclear. It was like an unspoken agreement that we couldn't continue dating with that distance.

At first I lied to myself and was convinced that it was no big deal. It was only 2 months, there are plenty of other girls. We ended up texting over WhatsApp less and less until it got the point where we had not spoken in 3 months. I was sure that we had both moved on.

Last week, all the emotions I have bottled up inside me suddenly burst. I still love her. I am more of a wreck now than I have ever been over a girl. I love her now more than I ever realized I did when she was here.

Last week I caved and texted her that I missed her. She replied back a few minutes later that she missed me too, and that I should come visit her in Germany. That made me so happy.

She asked me if I had found another girlfriend. I told her no, and that nobody who I have tried to date made me feel the same way I felt when I was with her. I told her that even though we didn't know each other for long, she was special to me and that I still think about her a lot. She said that she also felt we were really close, but felt silly saying it out loud since we only dated for 2 months. We texted back and forth and got caught up on each other's lives over the weekend.

I don't know how to bring up that I still have feelings for her. I strongly suspect that she still has feelings for me as well, but long distance relationships are so difficult... We are both very career-oriented and barely had time for each other while we were actually close. I want to ask her about her thoughts on dating long distance, but first I need to find out if she still has feelings for me and I don't know the best way to do it.

769,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting. I got a taxi from my house to work and the taxi driver made me feel extremely uncomfortable. He was leaning sideways rubbing his shoulders against mine and gently pushing me. He made comments about a casting couch and me paying for extras from him on top of the fare. He took me the wrong way down a dead end towards a wasteland beside my work claiming there was a different office block down there. I work on the third floor and can see for miles through the window in that direction and there is nothing down that way at all. He generally just made me feel very uncomfortable and I was shaking a little when I got out of the car. I told my co-worker who wanted to call the taxi company immediately but I pointed out that he would probably know it was me and he had picked me up from my home to my work which is basically the only places I ever am (work nightshift 🙄).

770,"Basically, my girlfriend of almost a year is Christian, and I consider myself closer to a [Christian atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_atheism) than a fully-fledged Christian, and she stays over often. We have had sex many times, but pre-marital sex is forbidden according to the Bible. Recently, she revealed to her friends and community that she stays over at my place overnight sometimes, and they started to worry about her, which makes her feel that she's doing something wrong, which stresses her out.

Flash-back to earlier conversations we've had: We've had this discussion about pre-marital sex many times, talking about how people these days get married in their late 20's and early 30's, and that being unable to have sex until then would be *not nice*, to say the least. However, we have also talked about how people who ""play by the rules"" and get married immediately, also tend to have relationships that crash and burn and ultimately end in divorce. Thus, we want to take it slow, to preserve our relationship for the long-term.

Back to the present-day, in this most recent discussion: I told her a story in which, for me, I had a situation where I was following the advice of my friends and family (mainly my family), but I wasn't happy with my life. I ultimately decided to be accountable for my own happiness, and to make decisions that would help me achieve happiness, even though they weren't what (mainly) my family wanted for me. Over time, I gradually surrounded myself with friends that, even if they don't agree with my decisions, still respect those decisions, and today, I feel much, much happier with my life.

I'm sure this anecdote I gave to her in this most recent discussion had some implications such as implying that her friends are not supportive and respectful of her decisions, but I also don't think it would be productive for her to abandon her church community either.

I suppose that it's important that I told her that I think that some of the things the Bible says are outdated, like condoning slavery and banning pre-marital sex.

I truly love and respect her, and I think she might be the most wonderful and kind person I know. I want do my best to keep this relationship going, since I value it so much, but even if this relationship doesn't work out, I would respect her decision(s) no matter what it (or they) is (are).

What should I do, if anything?

I have a feeling that this is a pretty common situation, so I wanted to ask a community that has probably seen this situation many times.

Thanks for your time reading my story!",28Oct2019,1
771,"Hey Reddit.  Throwaway for anonymity.

32(M) here, struggling with drinking and becoming more reclusive lately.

Just as a bit of a precursor, I've had a fairly decent life for the most part - good upbringing, a comfortable lifestyle, lucrative career, loving wife, and so on.  Of course common growing pains and struggles like anybody else, but nothing out of the ordinary.  So I really don't think there is some deep or dark underlying issue here, unless I am totally blind to something.

Anyways, I am just looking for some advice on how to control my drinking and stop being such a hermit.  I built a bar for my garage awhile back, and it's become a pretty typical hangout for me and a group of 5 or so friends.  In theory it's great, I save money by drinking at home versus going out to a bar, I don't have to worry about drinking and driving or leaving my car somewhere, etc.  But I am starting to feel like it has become more of a curse than a blessing.

The first problem is that it has given me a platform to binge drink more often, especially on the weekends.  I also smoke cigarettes when I drink, which my wife absolutely despises, so I'd imagine it's not ideal for her to watch her husband drink until 2 or 3 AM as soon as the weekend hits and come to bed smelling like an ash tray.  Not too add the health issues that drinking and smoking like that will inevitably cause.  I've managed to roughly keep it to the weekends, but lately there have also been week days that friends will come over to watch whatever hockey/football/baseball game is on and drink.  It's like once I have a couple beers, my off switch disappears, and I'm up until midnight drinking when I have to be up at 6 AM for work the next day.  As a side note- the day after tying one off is horrible too.  I am essentially a waste of space and sleep in all day, on top of having major anxiety spikes during the ""bounce back.""

The second problem is that I feel like it has caused me to seclude myself to my house more and more over time.  I have ALWAYS been a social person - kind of known in my group of friends as the guy that would go with them to bars and make friends with everybody there by the time we were closing our tabs.  A lot of that is alcohol induced, but I've just always enjoyed meeting new people.  That being said, I feel like the older I get, the less I want to deal with people and the more I just want to stay home.  The shitty and more selfish side of humanity has become more transparent to me lately, and instead of giving everyone the benefit of the doubt like I have done in the past, I just make excuses to stay home.  Usually something along the lines of ""I don't feel like dealing with drunk assholes at the bar,"" or some variation of that.  As I'm sure you'd expect with an extroverted personality though, this causes cabin fever pretty quickly and I begin to get stir crazy.  Which ultimately ends up leading to friends coming over and binge drinking with me to scratch that itch.  It's a vicious circle.

I've sparked up quite a few interests lately, from taking audio engineering classes to doing some very entry level woodworking, but I just can't help but feel even more reclusive when I don't drink.  I know my wife loves it when I don't spend the weekend binge drinking and it gives us a chance to reconnect since we are both so busy during the work week, so I have been trying to keep that in mind as well.  I've always said my drinking isn't a problem because I can easily control it, but I'm starting to think I don't have as much control over it as I wanted to believe.  My wife knows what I'm going through and has been very supportive, but is not entirely sure how to help.

Thanks for listening!  Any and all advice is welcome.",28Oct2019,1

in my environmental class we planted some herbs in ""ecocolumns"" and one of my partners put an acorn he found outside in the aquatic chamber where we kept our fish. a couple of days later he took it out and put it in the soil chamber, where it remained for a couple of weeks. then, my other partner told me to take it out because it was ""nasty"", but i couldn't because it had rooted. now, about a week later, it's about ten inches tall and our project has ended. I took it home and now its living on my window-sill in an eight inch tall plastic pot my teacher gave me.

this is the first plant i've had that i truly want to help it survive until adulthood, since my teacher said i could plant it at the school in the spring, but i have no green thumb and know next to nothing about caring for plants, especially an oak tree indoors during autumn/winter, so i'd love any advice y'all could give!

also, our sapling, now named chicken (long story) grew up under a grow light. do you recommend i buy one off amazon for 15 bucks, let it sit in the sun, or under just a normal lamp for around 12 hours a day (i read that was ok online somewhere)?

783,"Hi folks,

I am currently employed as the only full-time worker for a relatively small company specializing in commercial falconry. My days are split between assisting with breeding operations and participating in the control of pest birds at farms, landfills, etc. This is a fairly small field where I am from, and it is my absolute dream job. I love every minute of my work week, which consists of three days breeding, two days bird control totalling 35 hours per week. I am paid a differing wage between these two jobs within the company; just over minimum wage for the breeding, and almost double that for bird control. 

I started working for this particular company not as a paid employee, but as a full time volunteer working 4-6 days a week for 4-10 hours per day. I did this for about 10 months before an opening became available, and I took over as the full time employee. I have been in this position for about a year, having started the bird control portion of my duties about two weeks ago.

With the background in place, I have started to become frustrated with the constant changes enacted by my boss, which are often given with vague or no reason.

It began when I was a volunteer. I was told by my boss that I would start being paid November of last year. I was given a start date and everything. However, that day came and I was told that the start day was now mid-December. This happened twice more, with my real start date being February. I was never given any tangible reason, only vague 'things have changed' answers. This caused a lot of strife in my personal relationships, including my father and girlfriend. I did start eventually and things were great. 

My current issue is my time performing bird control. A position was made available, and I was told I would start in mid-September. This date was again changed to the start of October, then again to mid-October. I was told I would be working 3-4 days a week at this position, but this has now apparently changed. I was told not by my boss, but the other employee at this position that I would only be working 1-2 days in this position. This has again caused strife in my personal life, as it affects my ability to move out of my house, pay mounting bills, and is causing my girlfriend to be cold to me. I accepted the start dates in the past, I'm a patient person, but promising me a higher-paying position and then going back on it without telling me seems to be a much harder pill to swallow. 

I do not want to quit this job. It is my ultimate dream, and this is not a position that comes up often, if ever in my area. My boss is an incredibly experienced individual and has greatly helped me learn the craft, but this is getting to be too much. 

How can I deal with this? I understand I need to speak to him, but I have no idea what to say and whether I am demanding too much. Thank you very much!",28Oct2019,1

786,"I'm going to begin by apologizing because this post may get a bit long.

Back in October of 2018, my best friend's grandma offered me a place to stay with her and the rest of my best friend's family (in total there are seven of us). In a verbal agreement, the grandmother offered us discounted rent at $200 a month as long as one of us was working full time and the other one was enrolled in college full time. We agreed (me (24F) being the one working, best friend (20M) being the student) and I ended up moving in with them in January of this year. 

Things were okay for the first couple of months until the grandmother started asking for an extra $100 to help pay for necessities for the household (toliet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent) and we ended up negotiating $50 instead of $100 because with only one of us working full time, it would make money tight but the grandmother said she understood and accepted the $50. She then asked for another $150 the following month for groceries which we flat out denied because we buy our own groceries and make our own food, which bothered the grandmother and she started sprouting off about how we're a family and family looks out for each other, yada yada. 

During this whole time, the grandmother had been going into our room and sorting through our belongings and looking at our opened mail which we didn't know she was doing until I came home from work one day and saw her standing in our room, going through our folders where we organize our mail. She made the excuse that she thought we accidentally took one of her letters she left on the table. After she left the room, I went to the store to buy a lock for our door so that only best friend and I can unlock the door. The grandmother was huffy about it at first because she said it's her house and she has the right to know what's going on under her roof but she quickly stopped talking when my best friend mentioned that we pay rent for that room and we deserve privacy.

Things started getting very rocky after I changed the lock on the door. The grandmother would demand to know where we were going, whether we were leaving at 6 am or 11 pm. She'd hear us walking up the stairs, come out of her room, give us the whole talk about how it's disrespectful for us to not tell her where we're going, and then watch us from the living room window as we're leaving. Now, when the grandmother and I are the only ones home and I have to go somewhere, I ALWAYS would let her know that I'm heading out and not to worry if I'm not home for a bit. My best friend on the other hand doesn't go out of his way to tell anyone besides me that he's heading out which has caused a lot of tension with his grandmother. But personally, when I'm leaving for work at 6 am, I don't think I should have to go upstairs and wake her up to let her know I'm going to work when she knows full well that I'm always opening at my job, at the same exact time, all week. I also tell her my schedule whenever the new one comes out and I've offered to write it down for her but she says that it would be unnecessary. 

The grandmother started getting on us for every little thing as well: if we ate any of the food she bought, she'd yell at us. If we didn't eat any of the food she bought, she'd yell at us because it went bad. No matter where we parked, even if we parked in a spot she gave us permission to, she'd make us move our car just to have us move it back to the original spot we were already parked in. We're also not allowed to park in the driveway or in front of the house because those spots are already taken by other people who live with us, and it doesn't matter if they're not home: THOSE SPOTS ARE TAKEN. She'd see me cooking and start criticizing everything I was doing, from the pan I was using to how I cut the meat. She said I drink too much water and that my best friend takes too long of showers and that we're single handedly running up the water bill (said we owed her almost $300 for the water bill one time). We're never allowed to invite our friends over because ""we get too loud"" even though she allows the other people in the house to throw huge parties, loud music and alcohol included. 

One of the things that is a constant struggle within the household is that my best friend has anger issues and he's prone to yelling and swearing. He's currently trying to find a therapist who he feels comfortable with, but it's a work in progress; everyone in the house knows this. Today, my best friend was playing a video game where he ended up losing, and because of that he stared yelling and swearing which caused the grandmother to come downstairs and yell at him that S (best friend's cousin) was sleeping and he needed to be quiet. She then went on to say that the both of us are very disrespectful to others in the house. When I asked her how else we're disrespectful she said that best friend is loud and can't control his mouth and that we never eat what they prepare. When I brought up that she told us we couldn't eat what they made she said ""oh, that was only for that one time"". I told her that everyone in this house deserves respect and that best friend is loud, he apologized and is getting help for it yet every morning I get woken up from S's son screaming at the top of his lungs because he doesn't want to get ready for school and that's not fair to me or best friend since our room is right next to the son's room. The grandmother said that that's different and we can deal with him screaming. My best friend said that that's not fair and that he and I deserve respect just like anyone else in the house which resulted in the grandmother threatening to kick us out if we don't start learning how to be respectful. I texted my best friend's dad, grandmother's son, and told him what was happening and he said that he's the one who pays all of the bills and won't allow her to kick us out. 

I guess I'm just wondering if there's anyway we can smooth all of this over so that living together isn't toxic. We're not currently in a place to move out with only one full time job while living in Silicone Valley. Is what perspired even grounds to kick us out or is the grandmother just being unreasonable?

I used a bit of Hofstede, not Trompenaars and missed a lot of important points when talking about Teamwork.   
Then I had to do the business etiquette do's and don't's and I used researches I did on the internet whereas I had to do it from a cultural perspective.

790,"I have become incredibly emotionally dependent on a friend. This isn’t healthy for either of us, so I have decided that we should not talk for a long while, at least a couple months, but maybe forever. I need time and space to work on my personal things and we had become increasingly frustrated with each other over the past few weeks, so I think time will help if I ever do start to improve and feel I can have a healthy friendship, if she wants one. 

The pain is a lot right now. This is all I can think about. How much I miss her and want to talk to her. Replaying some conversations of ours in my head. I feel incredibly guilty and angry at myself for ruining what could have been a great friendship. I just miss her and can’t imagine not missing her.

801,"Just to get this out of the way, new to Reddit as a whole, only exposure is to Youtube comp videos. First time poster, so sorry if there is a subreddit for this kind of topic I just really need an outsider’s perspective on this.

Backstory: I’m a rather socially anxious person; history of fainting spells and panic attacks and if I could avoid social interaction I would. Essentially the textbook definition of an introvert. And my first major job after an internship was at a callcenter. I was a senior agent at the call center when I met my SO. I only liked working there because the calls were easy, the queue tended to be short, and the place would kick you out if there were too many people working and not enough calls coming in. It was only when I started noticing signs that the project we were on was about to be discontinued that I went job hunting, and landed a cushy banking job with little customer interaction, but same pay. SO stayed and was transferred to a project at the center that we always referred to as Mordor because they were behind an ever expanding wall that was dark with the clouds of stress and despair of those trapped on the other side. However he managed to land a position that pays him nearly double my current salary.

We’ve been together for nearly 3 years, and we just got married a couple of months ago. Neither one of us went to college, so no student loans, however we do have a mortgage and ever increasing credit card debt.  My wage is pretty much stagnate; I get up to a 2% raise based on my performance on a yearly basis, with no other bonus and overtime needs to be approved by management beforehand. I’ve spent the last year attempting to get into a higher position with the company with no luck. On top of that, in the next couple of years the state minimum wage will be hiked up, and either minimum wage workers will be earning more than I am or my job will become minimum wage, there has been no discussion of what will ensue (probably will be let go to be honest, which terrifies me). But with the current levels of debt in ration with our income, my SO wants to have at least the credit cards paid off before we can start having kids.

At this point, my SO wants me to be in the new training class that’s little more than a month away with interviews starting in the next few weeks. While the starting pay is 50% more than what I’m making now, the work will be grueling, the calls non-stop, and if too many customers leave bad reviews on my customer service quality, I could just as easily lose the job (such is the call center life...). The thought of going back stresses me out to the point of insomnia, and what sleep I do get often has reoccurring nightmares of events in my past that has lead to my elevated levels of anxiety.

I’ve had 3 interviews with other companies and recruiters in just as many months, not to mention the dozens of applications I’ve sent in. I haunt the job posts daily, and I’m running out of time. Should I just suck it up and try out for the position? Any advice on how to survive a call center as a socially anxious introvert?

Basically, my teacher developed a super rare disorder that restricts a LOT of the things they can do. They can still teach perfectly fine, but they have to go to the hospital often and have certain rules the school has to comply with. The principal of this school dislikes it and is now going on a power trip. He forced my teacher to do things that broke the rules they have to follow, and my teacher reported him, leading to some amount of legal action I think. 

Now he's pissed and trying to give us impossible rules to follow, likely so he can have my teacher fired. Doing stuff like only imposing rules on us, restricting things OUR class can do and not giving these rules to anyone else. Even implemented the BIST system in our class, which is basically think sheets and buddy rooms. We are a high school class. This principal is doing the best he can to get my teacher fired legally, and being a dick to everyone in our class in the process, and as far as I know all of it is legal, just sleazy. 

Is there ANYTHING we can do about this?

How can I go about politely requesting that my ex-wife give my son a bath or shower on a daily basis?  
He's with her 50% of the time and every time I see him after he's been in her custody, he is dirty and stinky.  
He's 7 years old, so he gets dirty enough on a daily basis to justify a shower or bath every day.  
I don't think she is purposefully not bathing him, but she probably doesn't think to make him take a shower in the mornings or even at night before bed.

Regarding her personality, she is a complete narcissist who cannot take constructive criticism without turning the issue around and placing blame on the person delivering the criticism.  I fear that somehow it will become my fault if I bring it up with her.

819,"I'm a long time lurker that is trying to voice what I have been feeling for the past 7 years of my life. Ever since summer started this year my life has been in the worst state it has ever been. It became a major topic for me after seeing so many posts on here about how important it is to let people know what you are feeling and to overcome hurdles of anxiety by just doing things that scare you.

  
When I was 12 my life changed forever, my parents would get divorced and the darkest spiral of my life would begin. I would have ups and downs then eventually hit rock bottom.

  
Of all the things that have happened in my life the only thing that mattered to me was my girlfriend (Let's call her J). We went through so much together, we battled our depression, we laughed, we could cry to each other, I helped her with her eating disorder, we did everything together. 

  
Then when I turned about 16 my life really got to me.she had 2 loving parents, my parents were divorced and distant. She lived in a big house with 4 bedrooms, I lived with my grandma in a 1 bedroom apartment with 5 other members of my family. She was constantly inviting me to events like Magic Mountain, going out to eat, the Cinema. Eventually, it got to me and I decided one day that I wanted to break up with her based on how worthless I was and how much I was holding her down. 

Little did I know how much worse it would make me feel and that this was a break-up I was going to think about to this day. I recently started talking to her again, after years of feeling embarrassed by what I had done. I had hoped it would make me feel better but it has made me feel so much worse. As I got to know more about her it surprised me at how much she had changed, she wasn't the J I had gone out with years prior. She is studying to become an RN, 2 years from a BSN degree, parties every weekend, constantly goes out to eat with friends, couldn't seem happier. 

  
I'm glad she is happy don't get me wrong, but just talking to her has made me realize just how shitty my life is still. I do have friends and eventually will have work to worry about, but I still don't really do anything outside of sleeping all day and doing chores just to keep myself busy. 

  
Everything I do just feels so empty, any time I'm alone I can't escape thoughts of wishing I didn't exist and how worthless I am. My anxiety is so bad that I can't take the last bite of most meals without gagging under the pressure of finishing the plate. I wish I was normal, I want to take the steps to escape these feelings, I want to do things and feel like I'm actually achieving something. I'm tired of being so empty, with only so many young years left. 

  
I know I shouldn't focus so much on relationships, but being with her was the last time I can remember being truly happy. So I just need some advice, is it worth it or even healthy for me to continue talking to her? When you had your first break-up how long did it take you to just get over it? There are so many details I left out for simplicity's sake but, people have who gone through something similar, what steps did you take to escaping this feeling of emptiness and thoughts of suicide?

828," Background about me: I’m from a Swedish-British family. I grew up in England but I’m also a Swedish citizen and can speak Swedish at a near-fluent level. I decided to move to Sweden to go to university because I hate living in England and because Sweden seemed to offer greater social mobility (most notably, free university and a grant from the government for living costs when studying).

My boyfriend is English and I met him while we were studying at the same university in Sweden. He’s the first proper boyfriend I’ve had, and I love him dearly. We’ve been together for just over a year now. So, we decided that when we both finished university at the same time, we wanted to stick together. Fairly early on, he got an offer to become a research assistant at the University of Copenhagen, leading on to a PhD position – a dream offer for him. We both agreed it would be nice to live together in Copenhagen. I was struggling to stay motivated for the final section of my bachelor’s degree – I just sort of ran out of steam. So, despite eventually getting top marks for my degree in English literature and history, I decided I didn’t want to a continue with university yet – if at all. My boyfriend and I agreed it would be a good idea if I got a job in Copenhagen and then maybe do my master’s in that area of Scandinavia later on, if I felt like it. Thus, I cancelled my contract with my apartment in Sweden, sold all my furniture and moved to Copenhagen.

Current situation: I’m now in Copenhagen, unemployed, and deeply unhappy. I’ve been looking for work ever since I arrived at the beginning of September – applying to everything from housekeeping, to café work, to the cushier office jobs. I’ve sent e-mails, made countless online applications, and gone around and given out my CV in person. One large disadvantage is that I don’t speak Danish (but then, I’ve also applied to positions in the nearby Swedish city of Malmö with no luck either). Another disadvantage is that as a graduate, I don’t have much employment experience. And I also don’t feel like there’s a clear career direction with my degree. I’ve had two interviews. I try to play to my strengths by applying for content writing jobs, and I’m currently in the recruitment process for a content writing job (but they’re taking *forever*).

But the fact that I haven’t found a job in such long time makes me feel like such a failure. I’ve never experienced unemployment before. My family wonder what’s wrong with me if I can’t get a job in a capital city with cafes on every corner. Meanwhile, my boyfriend says he’s stressed because he feels like me finding a job is the last thing on his check-list for settling in to Copenhagen. I feel like I’m not only causing myself worry but the people around me too – which, in turn, worries me.

Day-to-day life is odd. Every day I try to find a job, but sometimes I get so overwhelmed by all the different things to apply to and all the different cover letters to write that some days I feel stuck and don’t do anything at all. At the same time, I feel like I should be putting all my energy into finding a job, so that doing anything else - like finding friends - would make me feel guilty. I keep thinking that stuff like that isn’t a priority, and I can do that after getting a job. This makes me feel like I’m stuck in limbo, never really living life until I get that long-awaited job offer. But then I also feel guilty because my boyfriend keeps egging on at me about experiencing Copenhagen and getting involved etc (which he doesn’t really do himself, as a result of feeling overwhelmed by having me constantly at home). I hate feeling like a constant burden. 

On top of all this, I don’t have anyone to talk to this about for fear of worrying my family or boyfriend even further. If I do try to communicate discontent, then the general response is “well...life isn’t always easy, you just need to get on with it”. Of course this is true but sometimes I just want to be heard and told that it’s ok. 

I also feel like our relationship has become quite uneven. As students we were equal. Now, he’s got a well-paid position, and I’m running out of money. I used to have a buffer amount of money I could spend. But now that’s run out, so my boyfriend has taken over the costs of groceries. For rent money, I’ve had to start using my savings, which will just dwindle the longer I stay here without a job. I’m so unhappy feeling like I’m dependent. And I don’t even have money to do things that make me feel like a normal person, like getting a hair cut. 

The contract for our current apartment ends in December. So, now my boyfriend is often asking me to think about whether I want to stay in Copenhagen. He says I should make the decision by the end of the month because that’s when he would start looking for new accommodation - either for two people or just for himself. I don’t feel happy here but I don’t know where else I would go. My only other option would be to go back and live with my mother in England. I hate living with her. I love my mum and I get on fine with her but the idea of living together with that domineering woman in a constantly messy house in the middle of nowhere sends shivers down my spine. I think moving back home would break me. And I don’t want to leave my boyfriend. I find it so overwhelming thinking about how me leaving Copenhagen could be the end of our relationship. 

I don’t want all of this to be for nothing. But I also don’t want to be left penniless and jobless in a few months. What should I do? What would you do in my situation? 

Tl;dr I’m unemployed and running out of money but don’t know how to handle it.",28Oct2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everybody! My name is JaUM404, and I am an aspiring author.

I am interested in creating a manga style, once-a-month type story. I have some of the story already planned out and I am excited to begin, but there is one problem..

I can not draw for my life. Yes, I am practicing and improving over time, but I don't foresee myself reaching a level of artistry that I desire for this story.

That brings me to my next point, I need an artist. I know I ask a lot, and probably without any payout in the end, but I would appreciate it deeply if someone could assist me with doing manga-style art. I can't pay you, and I don't INTEND to be paid for the writing I create, but I would love to make this into a hobby.

If those two factors don't sway your opinion of working with me, then please, send me a message or comment on this post. Again, I realize those two are major turn offs for an aspiring illustrator, so I won't be hurt you are not interested.

Also, feel free to reach out if you would like to hear the story (at least what I have planned currently).

Thanks!

837,"Okay so I have a cat (Stevie nicks, 6 years old) and a new puppy (Jackson, 1 years old) that do not get along. The puppy was actually my moms and she couldn’t keep him anymore because he wasn’t getting enough attention and had lots of energy. I fell in love with him and said I’d take him. Didn’t think I would have an issue with him and the cat because Stevie has lived with 3 different dogs before/ similar in size. I stayed with my mom and sister for a period of time after college to get financially stable again and they both had multiple pets. She never had an issue with these other dogs except the initial nervousness and checking things out. And The animal rescue where we got Jackson said he was great with cats. 

My fiancé tried acclimating the dog and cat while I was at work one night. He brought them in a room and let them sniff eachother. The dog ran up and sniffed her and she swatted his face and cut his nose and then he chased her but my fiancé separated them. Everything I had read about acclimating dogs said what he had done was a bad idea and that once it gets to a point of aggression and attacking eachother, it’s too late and that it won’t be a good fit. So we tried a couple more times keeping them on the same floor of the apartment but the cat would hide and eventually find her way upstairs. So for the past 5 months we have had the dog downstairs and the cat upstairs. 

We just want our pets to get along and have the freedom to move around the whole place. But I fear damage is done and they won’t ever be safe around eachother. If anyone has any advice or tips I would greatly appreciate it! Sorry if I rambled on too much. First post on askReddit!",28Oct2019,3

I’m a 16 year old boy about to be 17 in about a few months. For a long time I’ve felt that I maybe just wasn’t on level as everyone else this could of involved anything, I wasn’t the best at reading, writing, or really anything. From my point of view I see myself as pretty average in everything and I guess this lead me to not wanting to try new things out because I felt I wouldn’t improve in the new thing I tried. Or just stay at average. Even if I felt I’m average, I’ve heard people say I’m smart, handsome, kind and well other things. I’ve always been told it from other people like so and so said you’re smart or handsome. I personally don’t feel that way. I’ve also kept my inner feelings to myself and never tried to tell my family since well let’s just say it was a rocky road for my family and me growing up. Never had much friends growing up since I always moved around. But besides all this I still got a girlfriend, I think she’s brilliant, gorgeous, hardworking, smart, and she’s adorably cute. I enjoy the time I spend with her. But lately I’ve found it I had thoughts that I didn’t like her hanging out with other people. I know this is wrong and want some advice on how I can more on from this behaviour.  Now more onto the motivation part I’ve been skipping school and not doing the homework. I know I should be doing it but I’ve been doing this since I was in grade 8. I knew I shouldn’t skip or not do the homework. I also want a job but I’m scared to start looking since I don’t have any references I can use to help me. I’m also scared because I’ve never really had a job before so I don’t think people will want to hire me. But even I want one I don’t have very much motivation to get up and try and same goes for school. I’ve tried multiple times to go to school and try to fix my bad habit but I find it I still end up falling back on my bad habit.

I’m sorry, I seamed to have wondered off in the wrong direction when telling about the advice I need. So I’ll try to keep it nice and simple. I need help on how I can help myself become motivated to go to school and maybe work.

842,"No, Im not exaggerating she literally said “junk food”. I’ve been eating 1 to 2 times a day so I wouldn’t eat her food. One of those leaks is from my own bought food and it comes out of my remaining savings cause I’m waiting to get start a job in November she says they’re hiring for. I clean any and every mess I make along with the others because I don’t want to be a burden.

It’s now at the point where my last message will be at 2pm, and finally answered at 10am the next morning. 20 hours. I took the four-hour delays as them probably being busy, and partially that they weren’t interested. Our conversations do not end, and just spill over into the next day, so are constantly ongoing. I have given them a few opportunities to just finish the chat, but they are always willing to continue, even if I give a blunt reply to dissuade them from replying.

Here’s the point. I feel like a mug for conversing with someone who takes ridiculously long to reply. If there was something I ever wanted to discuss, or get off my chest, they wouldn’t be around for me. However, even though this all annoys me, it is regular contact. It is keeping our friendship alive. They are continuing to show interest, even at times when I am less than forthcoming. What should I do?",28Oct2019,2

Pretty sweet. However, things declined very quickly.

850,"Hey so um I’m having trouble in my life right now, and it’s involving my relationship obviously according to the title but damn alright, so I met this girl I really love, we’ve been together for 8 months now and I really really love her to death and wanted to marry her, she introduced me to her family 2-3 weeks into our relationship which was something she never really does according to her and her sister, she tells me she loves me and wants to marry me all the time, she always introduced me to her family and family friends as her husband, and I loved it I thought it really sweet, she told me that she never felt this way about any guy before, she’s my first girlfriend and well I’m probably her 19th boyfriend or something... so anyway, before we met she told me her past relationships weren’t so great and she’s been through some really bad ones, but she had one boyfriend who she was with for 5 years and she said she really loved him but at a point he didn’t pay attention to her as much, so yeah, when we met we clicked so fast and it was really nice, we got close so fast and a month later we started to date, in February, we would see each other almost every day and have so much fun, around a few weeks before I met her she had moved one block away from me and she moved in with her best friend. I would meet her after she got out of work and just hang out with her for a bit and sometimes her best friend (a dude) would call her and ask her where she was and she would say that she’s running late and not say I was with her which was a little odd but I ignored it, overtime i noticed it happened more and more and she would have me as her wallpaper but the next day when I saw her it would change and it kind of seemed to me like he didn’t know about me, then I still ignored it and just waited for something obvious for me to point out, so one time I walked with her to the mall and she got a call from a private number and said she had to go and I said I’ll go with her and she refused, then the next day she came to visit me at work and got another call from the private number and I saw it and I acted as if I didn’t and she said it was her father when I asked so now I knew she was lying, so I brought it to her attention and she talked to me about it and said that he didn’t like me which made no sense since I never met him but I said oh okay, so some stuff happened and she moved out from there and back with her parents, all was good for now. A few months later I notice that when she would text anyone and I came near her she would close the app or turn her phone off and I grew suspicious as to why she did that but i ignored it again. She did this often, after a while I bought her a ring that she really wanted also a way to show her I love her, and she was so happy, so was I, I would literally do everything with this girl and I was so happy with her and so was she I could tell. A few days later a little after the time I gave her the ring she went to hang out with her friend Ralph and two other friends at their apartment, then she told me she got a ride home as well from Ralph, I never thought anything bad about it but I grew more suspicious and such. Fast forward to not long ago maybe a week ago, I thought maybe I should check her messages, it felt wrong, I hesitated for hours but decided to just do it, and what I found broke me completely... I forgot to mention we started dating on February 15, a day after Valentine’s Day, On Valentine’s Day I went to buy her a pokeball plush that she really wanted and I surprised her with that and flowers and her favorite chocolate. So in her messages I saw this old friend she spoke to and I saw that after she left me on Valentine’s Day she went to see him and gave him everything I bought her... not only did I see that but I saw that she was speaking to her ex’s and some of them didn’t even know she had a boyfriend... I was just broken at that point, I confronted her and told her everything and she began to cry and still lied. I found out she was lying through someone, I also found out that the best friend she lived with was her 5 year relationship boyfriend, and not just that but her friend Ralph that she went out with she cheated on me with him. There’s so much she did more I didn’t say, but in the end I still loved her for some odd reason, maybe cause I’m afraid to lose her and everything we’ve been through but I told her it was over and she lost it and went crazy, she said she can’t lose me cause she’ll never find someone like me, and I didn’t want to leave but it was too much to handle, she said she was going to kill herself and she had nothing left, her sister came home and tried to calm her down and I stormed down and just started crying, sadly got the attention of her parents as well and soon they found out and started crying and apologized over and over to me begging me for forgiveness on her part, in the end I gave her a second chance, all my friends told me and still tell me it was a terrible choice to give her a second chance and I agree, I try to make it work till now but it’s not the same, I don’t love her like I did before, I believe it’s over but I’m also afraid she’ll commit suicide, I’m afraid to lose her, I don’t want her to die but I also can’t be with her. She was about to do it two days ago when I was asleep but thankfully I woke up on time and spoke to her.

The only exceptions is my grandfathers name was David. We have a name picked out that is both our grandfathers, David Wendell.

Our first daughters name is Scotlynn, so i like killian a lot for the second of it’s a boy. What do you guys think?

854,"My husband and I have had a great relationship and have been able to communicate with each other so well. It’s one of the reasons I married him. We can usually talk about anything and joke about anything and even when we do fight. It’s usually a misunderstanding and we can talk and figure that out, we both apologize, and move on. 

Lately since his deployment, he’s been more anxious and irritable, which I get! He is on a combat mission and has a lot of people who’s lives he’s in charge of protecting. I’m being super patient with him and always consider his environment and his physiological state. I remind him all the time that I appreciate all he does and am so thankful for him. I support him in every way I can, including taking care of his 2 boys on all of my weekends and going to their football and soccer games 45 min away during the week. I’m very understanding with him that he’s busy, tired, hungry, stressed, and away from home and I always take this into consideration and don’t take things personally. But it just feels like he’s trying to start things for no reason now. 

This is his first deployment and we haven’t been married long so it’s hard on both of us. Sometimes I feel like he’s not taking into consideration of what it’s like for me and I’ve tried to talk to him some, I also do not want to stress him out about the times it’s hard and the times I’m feeling down. 

The past month or so has been the worst yet. He reads into everything I say and no matter what I say or do he always thinks I’m mad about something and immediately gets really defensive. For example, say he calls me and I haven’t gotten to talk to him in a while and we only get to talk for a second before he says “sorry babe, I gotta go. I’ll call you back” I might respond “aww, ok. Well I love you!” (I try to not say things like “aww” anymore). He only would hear “aww” and think that I was mad at him, and tell me how I’m being unreasonable and he can’t help if he has to get off the phone. It doesn’t matter how many times I tell him no, I only said aww because I was a little sad I couldn’t talk but in no way shape or form upset with him or thinking he’s just not wanting to talk, and that I just miss him. It seems to go in circles but I always feel like he leaves the conversation feeling salty and thinking I’m the one who was salty and never understand that there was no initial problem. 

Another example, we’ll be talking and I’ll try to talk to him about a few things that happened maybe something interesting I saw on Reddit, but he usually doesn’t have much to talk about that doesn’t add to what I’ve said. He’s usually really tired and most of the time if I say “ok, we’ll I’ll let you go so you can rest before you have to do X” he would either say ok or, no that’s fine I’m not going to sleep. He’s always known that I genuinely care about him and am coming out of a place of understanding but lately he thinks I’m being sarcastic. Now he’ll ask “why is something wrong?” If I say no, he’ll push saying he feels there’s something wrong and if I say well I just thought you’d want to go, you weren’t talking so I figured you were tired , he’ll gaslight me and say I was the one who was not talking (based off of the break after all my talking when I had nothing else I could think of). 

There’s way more that this, it seems something happens every other day. Weather my “tone seemed off” (even if day I told him I was tired or driving or something already and that may be the reason) , or if it’s because me wanting to get off the phone to go to sleep was “too abrupt” or “too random”  (even if he knows I have to work in the morning and it’s 1 am here). I just feel like I’m constantly having to “keep him cooled off” and convinced nothings wrong...when that’s the only thing that’s been bothering me and I feel like causing problems. 

Sorry if I’m rambling but the whole situation has me confused and exhausted, and honestly feeling like a crazy person. I tried to have a conversation with him and told him I understand that his brain is having to be in the state it’s in because he’s in a dangerous and stressful situation, it’s normal to be on edge. I asked him to remember who his wife is, that I’m not this salty spiteful person and if I’m truly upset about something I’ll say it. (He always thinks I’m lying when I say I’m not upset now). He seemed to understand and said he would try to do better but after that it didn’t seem to change and he seems more distant now. 

What can I do to avoid this? I feel so emotionally drained already, and on top of that I’m always having to try and reason with him and trying to avoid fights with him. I’m genuinely not upset with him (accept when he does this, but it’s more of being frustrated) so why is he always thinking I am?

855,"just looking for an opinion. so background, I got chlamydia 3 years ago and it really messed me up. I have really bad health anxiety and my doctor is aware of that, he's been my doctor since I was born. recently, I got chlamydia again from someone I thought I trusted. I have really been down the past few weeks after discovering  had it again. I went for a checkup with my doctor and the first thing he says is ""you're probably the only person I've ever known that has had chlamydia twice!"" while basically laughing. I found no humor in this at all. I'm still thinking about it and I feel so f\*cking shitty about myself. Why would a professional doctor ever say this to their patient. maybe he thought it would be a nice technique to scare me or something? I don't know and I just can't seem to understand it.",28Oct2019,1
856,"After attending college for 1 year, I ended up in a mental hospital within 2 weeks of my sophomore year due to a variety of reasons. I have taken this last semester off with the intention of going back to a different university in the spring semester thinking it was just my school I disliked. As the time approaches to go back, I begin to realize that it may just be college I don’t like. I am very much someone who advocates for alternative options, but am trying to force myself to make college be for me despite it proving horrible for my mental health. 

I have never really enjoyed school even when I do okay in it(somehow maintained a 4.0 my first year but idk how much that says), in fact I’ve basically despised every second of it. I love learning new practical things though. What are some good solid options out there if I choose not to finish my college career?",28Oct2019,1
857,"**First thing to note is that I have a pretty serious anxiety disorder**. I think I've also got paranoia, but I'm going to see a psychologist who could tell me more. The doctors can't diagnose that on their own. 

Today I was in the library. There was limited space so I asked this girl if I could sit next to her. When she looked up at me she looked terrified and I quickly looked away. She said yes and I was sitting next to her for about 2.5 hours before she left. I have no idea if she was looking at me during that time or not.


As I was sitting there other girls and older women were walking past now and then. Some smiled at me when I looked up (obviously that doesn't mean they're interested or whatever. People do smile at each other to be friendly)  and others looked shocked or something. I wasn't staring at them or anything. They looked at me first and when I looked up they had that scared look. 

This evening I was at a store. I was looking for a reusable water bottle and this woman who was working there was stacking/ doing something with a shelf I was looking at. She looked at me and I looked at her. She gave me an angry look and I just walked off. 

Soon after she was going around the store doing whatever she was doing, but I noticed her looking at me a lot. I eventually turned around and looked at her and she kept on staring at me for a few seconds  and wouldn't stop until I looked away. This happened twice. 

Some women are smiling at me and others seem angry/scared. 

**What's happening here**? Am I creeping them out somehow? I'm not looking at them first (except the girl who I asked to sit next to) and they keep staring at me. **It's making me anxious and paranoid that I've done something wrong, but have I**?",28Oct2019,13
858,"So to make a long story short, my boyfriend and I are 19, and he’s turning 20 soon. We’ve known each other for about a year and been together for a little over 6 months. We are both also in the military. Normally I wouldn’t add this detail but it’s a bit important. We’ve talked about marriage recently in the past months because overall the benefits of getting married great outweighs not getting married. Regardless of getting married or not, we both have determined we want to spend our lives with each other and getting married really only makes it easier for us when it comes to important aspects of our lives.

So after many months of discussion and determining how much we wanted to try and keep traditional, we decided to try the knot in the courthouse. Now comes the problem. 

Due to stigma, I’m worried about the backlash I might receive from my parents and family considering they haven’t even met him yet. (It’s hard to get leave at the same time) Anyone have any advice or maybe have been through a similar experience?

Tl;dr: Getting married at 19 after 6 months together, family hasn’t met boyfriend. Advice for telling family?",28Oct2019,1
859,"Everything hurts too bad or not at all. I can’t feel love or much of anything anymore I don’t know what to do but I can’t let myself feel better either because if I do I’ll be an even worse person. There’s only one way but I can’t take it. I’m too fucking weak,  disgusting, awful, and shitty. How do I not hurt myself anymore. It’s taking all my motivation to even write this I can’t even eat anymore. I’m so fucking pathetic and if I was remotely an ok person I’d keep this to myself but I don’t think that about other people. I have double standards I guess.",28Oct2019,1
861,"Before you guys say the obvious answer of reporting it, let me tell you some context first. I'm going to call my friend Sam, (fake name for obvious reasons). My friend's dad is more emotionally abusive than physical. While he does hit him, and throw stuff at him, Sam's dad never hits hard enough to leave a mark. Sam's dad (who I will refer to as Bob) also threatens to hit Sam's mother, but as been yet to do it. Sam has talked to his mom about her leaving Bob, but Sam's mother says it's easier to stay than to leave. I feel like it isn't safe for Sam or his mother to be at home, and I don't like the idea of Sam waiting until he's 18 to leave. But since there is no evidence, I can't report it. And if I report it anyway, I'm afraid Bob will act worse. I'm scared for my friend and I don't know what to do.",28Oct2019,1

863,"For some context, I'm a 16 year old junior in high school. I just moved countries, and so far, the move has just progressed into a downward spiral for me.

For some information, I used to go to a small private international school. Everyone knew each other on a first-name basis, both kids and teachers. I am now in a large public school with almost 1,000 kids per grade, and am **really** not liking it here.

To start off, because of some class recognition issues, most of my classes are with younger kids. Now, this isn't that big of a problem, but I am a person that gets bored very easily. I would much prefer being in a difficult class that keeps me engaged over tearing my hair out listening to things I already know. This placement takes school-- which was already excruciatingly boring to begin with-- and turns it into a living hell.

I'm also not really involved in anything after school (clubs, sports, etc.) so I don't get to meet people with similar interests. I did have plans to join some activities, but I never really found my footing &amp; lost the opportunity.

All of the above combined lead to me not adapting to the environment properly. I've cocooned myself into an impentrable shell, finding comfort in reclusion from the world. I spent most of my days &amp; nights mindlessly watching YouTube videos that I don't even want to watch. I'm just finding something to fill up the time.

It wasn't always like this. I was pretty sociable where I used to live and had a close group of friends. I wasn't the ""popular kid"" or anything, but I didn't feel entirely alone. And while I still keep in touch with them, time zones make it hard to communicate properly or regularly. It's not the same.

**Now, for the real problem** **(If you haven't read the above, I highly recommend it):** I don't make the effort to do anything anymore. Whether it is going out for lunch, doing things that I like, or even simple housework, I just cannot do it. I can't even lift myself off my chair. It's not even procrastination at this point. I'm avoiding things that I used to enjoy and would probably enjoy if I just did it. I make no effort to meet new people, talk to others, or go out of my comfort zone. For the last 4 months, I have been in a persistent slump. I've turned into the worst version of myself and I can't bear to see it any longer. I have no friends, no motivation, and no life.

And what's even worse that I shouldn't be this bad off. I live in a clean, nice house with a loving family in a great neighborhood, and go to a great school. My parents support &amp; help me more than I could ever repay them for. We aren't financially struggling, and I get a lot of my life taken care of for me (eg. food, laundry). In most cases, this should be a recipe for success. But here I am. I was given the gift of being born into an almost perfect life, and I am wasting it away living passively.

Moving can be hard, but it's been almost half a year and I haven't adjusted at all; not even a little bit. I just want to go back to being an active, goal-oriented person with friends.

I feel that my personality has morphed. I am just not the same happy, outgoing person I was.

I would love to hear the stories of others who have moved countries. Was it like this for you? Is what I'm experiencing normal?

On the other hand, if someone can just help me find the path towards bouncing back, I would really appreciate it.",28Oct2019,0
