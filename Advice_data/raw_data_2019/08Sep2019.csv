1,"(Premising what I'm saying by saying I'm from the UK and using UK terms). I'm UK based and I recently moved into a new flat. I'm on Universal Credit; housing paid and council tax paid. We're 8 days into this month and I have £3.95 in my bank ( [https://i.imgur.com/YSEVcaY.png](https://i.imgur.com/YSEVcaY.png)).  

I wanted to set up a Standing Order to pay for my rent, but I wasn't able to get to a bank. My nearest RBS is 27 miles away, so they convinced me to set up a direct debit I checked my bank later on. The rent had gone through but so had an extra £90. I read through my contract and yep. I didn't read the fine print. I'm powerless to do anything; luckily its a one-off thing. The water company wanted an advanced payment as its my first payment and I had to pay a council tax bill, even though I'm not supposed to. Its unclear why I had to pay it, but I'd be facing additional charges otherwise, and I'd rather not 

I'm terrified because we're still only in the early days of this month and this is all I have to live on. What can I do? I can't apply for a Universal Credit 'cash advance', my family are mostly in the same position that I am and I'm really fucking scared.

I'm an Insulin Dependent Type 1 Diabetic and I literally can't afford to survive. I've bought the cheapest biscuits I could get along with the cheapest bread and the UHT milk in a carton - if anyone can give any good suggestions on what I could do to raise a bit of money, I am open to all suggestions",08Sep2019,1
2,"So my therapist recently prescribed me an Emotional support animal. (ESA) I was going to adopt a kitten (They're easier to manage than dogs, which is useful for a full time college student), and still want to but there's one thing stopping me right now. I'm still a student at University, so I usually go home for the holidays and for summer. The problem arises with the environment at home. My family at home owns 2 Greyhound dogs, who I'm not sure are cat friendly. Amongst all that, I'm not sure my parents would approve. Now granted, I am an adult, and I can make my own decisions, but when I'm living with them they can kick me and the cat out if they don't like it. 

I'm really anxious to ask them about it (severe anxiety is my issue) I know that adopting the cat will help me immensely, and I would honestly care for it better than I care for myself, but should they decide to kick me out, or kick the cat out, I don't yet have the means to pay for an apartment. What should I do?",08Sep2019,1

6,"So, to start us off: I am a 14 year old girl. I have two cousins (m14 and m18) who live across the street. We have the same game systems so we exchange them sometimes. At the time of this story (and right now) I was home alone and my aunt and uncle weren’t home either. 

So I went across the street to grab my copy of Skyrim since they had borrowed it and saw that older cousin was cooking ground beef. I asked what he put on it and he said he hadn’t put anything on it yet even though it was almost done cooking. I told him that’s not how you cook and immediately picked some basil and thyme to put in it as well as salt and pepper. He said “I’m the cook, not YOU” and I responded by saying that he obviously was a pretty shitty one. He answered that by pinning me down, taking off his belt, and hitting me with it. I was screaming at him and trying to kick him off me when he did and he only was able to hit me once before I ran back home, locked the doors, and grabbed my foot long knife that my dad gave to me after he and my mom divorced (he let me go and pick out one of his favorites that he had). He came over and tried to get on the house and I ran to the bathroom and turned on the shower. I’m genuinely scared of him right now. And this isn’t even the first time he’s done something like this. He makes a lot of sexual jokes about my (above average size) boobs and just about my body in general. He also hits/kicks me a lot. He says it’s “just the way we were raised. You and your brother (m18) too.” Yes, my brother and I grew up fighting each other to the death but we’ve stopped as we’ve grown up. This cousin also hit on a close male friend of mine who is straighter than a fucking rod in every case except for Billie Armstrong (who he’s hella gay for) and made creepy jokes about him too.

So I was wondering if I could get a restraining order on him. Even if I can’t, the least I’m willing to do is take their key to our house and not let them in unless there are multiple adults in the house.",08Sep2019,1
7,My good friend is going out of state for a few months and was wondering if I could store 2 boxes with a hand painted dinner set their family has had for a long time.

Now after so many years my mom has finally moved on and created a family , she’s been through a lot because my dad cheated on her so many times and she kept forgiving him. I’ve been noticing some weird behaviors coming from my stepdad but first I thought that I was just being paranoid. But then once he came into my room while i was half asleep touching my face and telling me how beautiful I am. He tried to touch me so many times, grabbed my face trying to kiss me and I keep fighting back all the time, there are so many other times when he harassed me this is so fucked up gosh I find it so disturbing, like ten minutes ago my mom went to take a shower and he touched my breasts I am so traumatized.I just want to do something that involves not telling my mom because I would ruin everything or should I just keep ignoring it because everytime I think of something it would come to the point of my mom getting hurt, she’s already been through a lot you can’t even imagine and she deserves to be happy.",08Sep2019,131

10,"So, I don't know where else to post this, but about a year ago I had a really weird experience. I have always been afraid of the dark, mostly the unknown, so I've always slept with a light on. One time, I wanted to try sleeping without a light. It went well at first, but in the middle of the night, I woke up. 

Everything felt sharp. You know when you laminate a paper and the edges are a bit sharp, it felt like that, but only with my hands. Even when I touched my cushion or blanket. It was really warm and every single second it felt like a wall was coming at me. Like when you think of a color, you see it, but you don't. It was like that but with walls coming at you  and every single second I felt a wave of fear. 

After I sat down and turned on the light it kept happening. When I moved my arm or leg, it looked and felt like slow-motion. After a couple of minutes, I couldn't keep sitting there in fear and grabbed my phone in hope for some distraction. When I touched my phone it stung like my blanket. When I opened it, it looked like it was going in slow-motion while that normally never happens. 

After some minutes it stopped and I spent most of the night watching videos trying to forget it and sleep. After a couple of days I told my mom, who just brushed it off. I haven't told anyone since, but it still comes up in my mind every couple of weeks. 

Maybe it was nothing. Around that time I was in a really bad place so maybe that can help explain. I really hope someone can find an answer to this.

Ps: sorry if my english is bad, it isn't my first language.",08Sep2019,2

12,"I'll cut to the chase straight away:

I'm deeply insecure about my ability to hold on a job in my chosen field. 

This thought has me weighing on my mind a great deal recently. Now to provide some back story as to why I feel so down in the dumps about myself and my future:

So in May of last year I graduated in International Business and Italian but decided on holding out on pursuing any type of job in that field until I had a clearer vision of what I'd like my future to look like. In the meantime, I found a job in retail to make end's meet while I ruminated on possible career avenues.

The problem is I kinda do a shitty job. I've been banned essentially from using the cash register after making one mistake in front of a manager. I think the silly nature of the mistake (customer paid for an item that cost $6 with $10 note but I gave him back change of $6 until I quickly notified him of the mistake I made as he was turning his back to the checkout desk). It's not just that I've made, but the one's that I was on the verge of making. For example, a customer was paying a number of items among which there were two fragile item, when I decided to scan one of the fragile items and bubble wrap it along with the unscanned fragile item and place it into a bag until I realized 30 seconds later whilst scanning the customers remaining items that I had forgotten to scan it. 

In a previous job as a cashier, a customer comes to the counter with a few items, I scan them through until he decides he wants to have another browse of the shop. I put the items on hold until he's ready to checkout. When he came back I scanned only the new items he brought to the till, forgetting completely to add them into the sale that was on hold - meaning my till was down for the night. 

I can't say the mistakes came to an end after I was transferred to the shop floor. When I'm stocking shelves, for example, I'll often forget to put the label pack on a peg that I removed to stock up until 5 minutes later or even only when I've returned home and emptied out my pockets.

I really don't know what to do. I really doubt that I have the cognitive ability to keep my head above the water in any job at this point. I got accepted into a Master's program but I am really having second thoughts. I feel like if I can't gain the complete trust of my managers to carry out, what on paper are menial tasks, what chance do I really stand in a ''real'' job that a Master's qualification might get me?

Any advice would be much appreciated.",08Sep2019,1

16,"I’m 22 year old and female and I live in a dorm. Basically, I heard someone talking next door (I live in a dorm) but could not understand the words. The voice sounded really angry, derogatory and threatening and I came to believe that what I was hearing was a sexual assault. I felt like I heard the word kill. I ended up calling the police. I was extremely emotional and panicked. 

Needless to say, it was in my head. The police came immediately and the girl was alone on her room listening to music and unpacking her stuff. When I play back the recording which is only 10 seconds or so I do hear a voice (though I cannot make out the words, even on the highest volume setting) but it sounds more like someone talking on the phone or mumbling to themselves. I hear no muffled crying or slapping or angry-sounding threats. I’m seriously confused.

Is this like something I need to immediately tell someone about (like a doctor or therapist) or will they  laugh at me for thinking I am a special mentally ill snowflake when this is really no big deal? I was pretty sleep deprived it happened. 

When I told my mom about similar experiences in the past she said I was just attention seeking and she got really, really annoyed and mad at me and threatened to send me to live with my father if so couldn’t get my shit together. She also blamed me for letting it get this bad and not preventing it by taking better care of myself.",08Sep2019,1
17,"I have a Canadian friend that I met online. We've met once, and for a long time we were kind of flirtatious.

In the dream, because I had the one who had been hesitant to a relationship before, I was embarrassed and had been looking down as I spoke, but when I looked up she was right in front of me and kissed me. 
Weird. I mean, I had already been meaning to bring it (possibility of relationship) up to her but wasn't sure how to. And then this happened, and I'm not sure if it's even okay to mention. It would DEFINITELY be weird and off-limits to mention if it was sexual, but it wasn't.",08Sep2019,1

23,"I'm a 29 year old female turning 30 next year. Due to health reasons I live with my parents, and it kills me. I was a very ""normal"" and vibrant girl n my earlier 20s but fell ill in my early to mid-20s and am still not back on my feet. That's a whole other post in itself, but important for context, as I feel like the majority of my 20s have been taken from me. 

Thing is, I'm really freaking out now about leaving my 20s behind. I never dreamt when I got ill it would last thing long and it's only just hitting my lately that my 20s are nearly over. 20s seem like a decade where you're not a teenager anymore but not yet bogged down by life's bigger plans and commitments. You can pretty much get away with an extended teenhood, still look young, can be forgiven for partaking in ""young"" activities, dressing young etc. I have friends who are now buying houses, getting married, and having kids, and I haven't yet had that first experience of moving into my own place and decorating it and having sleepover movie nights with my girls etc. ...all the shit I see my other 20-something friends enjoying, carefree. I want that first tacky-but-cute apartment with the movie posters on the walls and a pole in the living room, goddamnit! I'm not ready for the big serious life stuff yet. It's boring to me! My style is also pretty young. I'm not ""chic"" and sophisticated like 30-something women are expected to be. I want to wear band t-shirts and try out Youtube makeup looks and wear skate shoes and yoga pants. I still look early 20s, so that's all good, but I'm just extremely terrified about this new chapter in my life. I'm afraid of what I'm expected to be, what I'm expected to have achieved by now, how I'm expected to act/dress/live. But I don't want to be that sad person who clings to their youth and still lives like they're 17 when they're 40 either. I just feel very conflicted and preoccupied with this, and it's effecting me on a daily basis. I don't know how to just chill and enjoy where I'm at, but I think it's largely because I am becoming aware on all I have missed out on. Can anyone offer any wisdom on this?

So I did.

Of course, the next morning, I severely regretted it and cut off contact with BD, but new guy is upset. Of course he is, I understand, but he was the main thing keeping me out of this extremely toxic situation and now will barely speak to me. I want to make things better, even if it means is just being friends, but I have no clue how to. He means the world to me and I just want to prove to him this won't happen again and he can trust me.

26,"I feel really guilty for pushing him away but I can't help it, it freaks me out a bit. Let me explain.

I'm ok with getting kisses from my mom and dad but not from my brother. I think it's weird. It doesn't help that he does it really awkwardly and often kisses my shoulders, neck and arms. I know he's not being sexual, he just has awkward social skills. But I still don't like it. It creeps me out when he leans in for a kiss and ends up kissing my neck, arms and shoulders sometimes. I wouldn't mind it if it were on my cheeks. 

Now I just have an instant reaction to be repulsed by him because of this. I really hate it. My parents think I'm being mean. But I just don't like it. When I've complained about it they say I'm being dramatic. But I can't help it. My body just cringes really hard and I want to get away.

28,"I was in a long distance relationship for 3 years and in 2018 she left me and I haven't seen her since. The first few months she would contact me telling me she still had feelings for me but didn't want to get back together. On important holidays she would reach out and say she missed me and I didn't respond. 

Soon after I blocked her on all social media and her number because every time she would reach out I would end up getting depressed because she would get my hopes up and then tear them down. After 3 months of no contact and 5/6 months not together, I reached out to her because I missed her. She said she wanted to talk and try and work things out, 2 weeks into talking she said she wasn't ready to talk consistently and cut off all communication. In my head I knew she was done and I let it go. I blocked her again and tried to move on. 

Two months later she emailed me (YIKES) saying she didn't want to lead me on or confused me but wanted to try and talk again as friends (it was poorly written and really didn't say anything meaningful). Being so hurt from this message I just ignored it and went on with my life, thinking that she isn't going to email again after not getting a response because that is so embarrassing. 

Well I was wrong. I received another email from her saying that she misses me and she's coming to my state next month and wants to meet. I was giving the email thought when my cousin sends me a message that she reached out to him wanting him to tell me that she was coming next month and that she **just** wanted to make sure I was okay. 

I really am at a loss with how to handle this situation. I just don't know what she wants out of it. We haven't seen each other in a year and have only spoke months ago and it didn't end on good terms. No matter how she treats me I still have feelings for her and its clouding my judgement.

I have 3 options ignore the email, respond back saying to stop contacting me (i've done it before), and respond back and talk. I don't know what to do, any insight would be helpful. Sorry for the bad grammar/format",08Sep2019,0
29,"
So a few days ago I remembered that I have access to my cousin's Google account ((He had given it to me almost a year ago because we were downloading each other's paid apps from Google play)). I was pretty bored that day so I decided I was going to see what was on his search history. Yes I know I'm not supposed to that kind of stuff and I did feel a little guilty for doing it but I found some things which concerned me and made me worry about him. So when I was scrolling through his search history I found one thing.. ""Everytime I see someone I imagine me murdering them"". I started to scroll down further and saw more things that really worried me; ""Why do I imagine killing someone even tho I'm not angry"" , ""Why don't I want to go out"" , ""Is it depression if I don't want to go out of my house? ""Why do I never want to leave my house?"" ""I did not attend school for a week because I didn't want to"" , ""It's been a lot since the last time I cried"" 

After this, it's just normal searching but then I come across this ""sometimes I feel really angry for no reason"" , Why do I get angry and sad for no reason?"" , ""I hit Myself""  .....  ""I hit myself with this home made whip""


I think he may be depressed or have a mental problem or something because I also suffer from depression  (and I was very close to attempting suicide) and I used to hit myself too. (He doesn't know any of this)

My cousin is like a brother to me and I feel really worried about him and I really don't know if I should tell my family because I feel that he will be angry at me for telling them and for looking at his search history but at the same time I'm scared that he might hurt himself even more so I have no idea wtf to do. I haven't told anyone about this yet and I talk to him as if nothing had happened. 

I think the reason he hasn't talked to me about any of this is because he thinks that I wouldn't understand or that I wouldn't care much but I really do and I know exactly what it's like and I really want to help him but he will be angry at me if I told him I looked at his history....

30,"My older sister (already married) is having her wedding at Hawaii next year, and there’s a bit of a conflict occurring here.

The thing is, both my family and my brother-in-law’s family are Japanese, with my sister and I (and my mother) being the only people who can speak English. I normally wouldn’t mind helping people by being a translator, but my brother-in-law’s family is REALLY trying to rely full time on us.

The last time we facetimed, they sort of started talking by themselves and said, ‘We can rely on you when we’re out shopping and stuff, but what about at the hotel?’ ‘Wait, we can just stay at the same place! That way, we can have you talk to the hotel for us when we need you to!’ ‘We’re bringing his younger sister’s baby, so we need you guys to ask the hotel and restaurants some things when we’re there’ ‘We’d actually love it if you could change your flight and get on the same one as us, I don’t know how to ask things in English’
They didn’t even ask if we had already decided on a hotel, or if we had any plans to go sightseeing by ourselves.

The problem here is this, my sister is the one having a wedding, so obviously she isn’t going to be staying with us. My mother, who is very proud about her English skills, always asks me to do the talking when we’re overseas, which means I’m going to be the one helping them 24/7. So why don’t we stay at a different hotel, you ask? Well, the only other option is to stay at the Trump Hotel, and I don’t think I can stand staying at a hotel with his name for 4 days without going crazy and embarrassed when my friends ask where I’m staying.

Am I being selfish for not wanting to be a translator? Am I overreacting to all of this?

I usually watch my twin nieces (3yrs old), while everyone else is at school/work. 

We only have 1 income because my brother (his kids) quit work for welfare stuff. Everyone besides my dad (mom, brother and 2 sisters) is home and doesn’t really help and expects me to take care of kids and clean the house. If they “help” watch the kids I’m expected to get them food or drinks while they barely help out.

(we can’t get her tags renewed because of my father) i used to drive a couple years ago when i first got my permit but that was when my parents were together. ever since i was 17 i haven’t been able to drive since i was never really home to be away from my mom and dad or when i was home they were fighting/my mom leaving to a friends. everyone was too busy to worry about me, and i 100% understand it, that’s why i didn’t say anything but i didn’t think it would go this far in my life.

now i am 19 living with my mom and sister, we have barely any money to keep going so any money i get/make goes towards our phone bills and such. i cant save up for a car or anything, i feel like such a loser in life that i don’t have that yet. and i don’t think i will. 

my father makes so much money that it would be so easy for him to help me get one but he doesn’t care. even if i did have a car my mom would just have to use it all the time because hers has gone to shit. 

i really think i’m not going anywhere in life because of this, all my friends probably think i’m a loser too. my relationship is failing because i can’t go drive to see him and i have barely any friends because of this. 
i cant hold a job because i have no way of transportation.

i want to move out soon but i have no way of doing this because of my situation. 

what should i do, how can i save up money when i am not able to do so.",08Sep2019,1

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

OK, so the last hour or so has been a whirlwind. I'll try to state all the necessary facts while keeping it brief.

My friend lives with her boyfriend and they are both on the lease for the house they rent. Tonight, they went out drinking and then got in an argument. Her boyfriend went off - smashed her TV and console, threw liquid cleaner on her then shoved her to the ground, hitting her head. She showed up on my doorstep crying with dried blood on her chest (I can't tell where the blood came from, I didn't see any open wounds though).

I suggested filing a police report. She said that her boyfriend is growing pot in the apartment (illegal in this state as far as I can tell - I don't smoke so I'm not up to date on all the laws) and she didn't want to get the cops involved because she's on the lease for the place where he's growing pot. I comforted her the best I could. She showered and is now asleep on my couch. I told her she can stay here for a while if need be, but I don't know how to help her move forward. She said the relationship is over in her eyes, but wants to stay in the house they currently share (she makes more money and covers most of the bills). So, she wants him to move out. She thinks he won't want to move out and will try to fight her for it. I know short-term, she needs to get some living supplies (she has no clothes or toiletries or anything with her, just what's in her car). I'm afraid for her trying to go back to the house to get her things in case the boyfriend goes off on her again.

So basically, there's no evidence of the abuse besides the destroyed property and a bump on the back of her head (blood washed off in the shower - didn't think to get a picture of it). She's complicit in an illegal marijuana growing operation in the apartment she wants to keep. We need to figure something out because she can't go back to living with this creep but I don't know how to get him to move out and let her move on with her life since he's on the lease.

Appreciate any advice ya'll can give. Thanks in advance.",08Sep2019,1
41,"I'll try my best to keep this as short and to the point as possible. I am on mobile so I apologize for formatting. We will call the puppy in question ""Shadow"" for the sake of the story, she is a 5 m/o lab puppy. I work at a Doggie Daycare where we see about 30-40 dogs everyday. Generally speaking, the dogs are super excited once they walk through the doors in the morning because they want to get out in the yard to see their friends, Shadow is one of these dogs. She is a regular, meaning she comes everyday, so she has an established connection with my other coworkers and I. Her owners seem caring and compassionate about Shadow's wellbeing, they bring a lunch along with her, ask us to take pictures of her and her friends ect. She is a super socialized dog and really enjoys daycare, always playing with the other dogs or in the pools, and has never showed any anxiety when in our facility. But things get a bit odd when it comes to pickup time. After being at daycare for 6-8 hours most dogs are overjoyed to see their owners again and go home for the day. When an owner comes to pick up, we go into the yard where the dogs are and call their names and almost every single dog will immediately go and sit by the door once they hear their name. Shadow is completely different, she doesn't necessarily run from my coworkers and I when we call her name to leave but she refuses to come towards us. Most of the time we have to drag her to the door by her neck scruff. Once we have her leashed up in the lobby and are preparing to hand her off to her owner, she goes completely limp and just lays on the floor (keep in mind most dogs are jumping all over their owner or at least excited to get through the gate). The owner says it is because she hates the car but my coworkers and I are  concerned it may be more malicious. She has to be carried out of the facility by her owner or she will try to come back through the gate, we are unsure what to do but multiple of us that have dealt with them feel like something is up. Keep in mind she comes EVERYDAY, so this is an everyday thing. Any advice would be appreciated, even to say that we are (hopefully) making something out of nothing.",08Sep2019,2

I'm 16 years old and met with a therapist for the first time today. I told him all about the domestic abuse that happened between my father and mother and he had to report it to CPS since I witnessed it as a minor. 

My father has been away because we had a restraining order on him, but there is no longer a restraining order. I still haven't seen my father since. CPS has not done anything since its been less than 24 hours, but my greatest fear is CPS bringing my father back into my life. 

I have been told CPS's main job is to keep families together, but I don't want mine together; we're dysfunctional and it makes me severely depressed. I'm scared I fucked everything up by telling my therapist. Am I overreacting? Or is there a chance he could be brought back?",08Sep2019,1
44,"This is going to be my very first post on Reddit. It's going to be a very bleak and sad depressing story and I'm desperate for advice.

For the purposes of the story, Venturing Crew is a subdivision of scouting that focus on older kids in high school. The key players in this story are my ex-best friend Tom, my brother Jerry, and the president of my old Crew, Terry (fake names obviously).

Alright, let's dive into this mess of a story. I was apart of my scouting organization for years, but have a had a history of being alone. I was a rash kid earlier on, but as the years progressed my changes went unnoticed. My brother would even call me a complete loser with no friends. I tried my hardest, and stuck with Tom as a safe haven in what i consider as a toxic place. In the last couple of months, before the next term of crew (rotation of officers and president), I decided I wanted to leave. I discussed this multiple times with my close friends and tied the knot with having a discussion with my parents.

However, unfortunately things would not end here. I discussed with Tom that I had plans of releasing a detailed account of my experience to the Crew's Facebook page (a private page for everyone apart of crew) with a google doc and/or video that discussed my story and reasons for leaving as well as criticizing the faults the program had. Everything was well word with intentions not to offend, but to educate. Many members had left before without leaving a trace, but I did not want to be that guy. So I sent Tom my 11 page essay on the subject (a deeply personal essay) but i specifically told him not to share to anyone because I was still unsure if i would go through with my plan. However he would throw me under the bus and share it with the Terry and consider it a threat. 

He shares the pdf in its entirety and they both establish it as a threat to the Crew. Terry then messages Jerry for assistance into hacking my personal social medias to shut me down and silence me. I have the entirety of their discussion and will share it (with censoring their info) when I figure out how. 

I don't know how to make this sound as important as it was to me, but I was heartbroken. My very own flesh and blood sold me out. My very best friend since elementary school went out of his way to expose something I didn't want to do and completely disregarded my feelings. The crew president, an eagle scout and the prime example of a leader did what i believe to be an illegal invasion of privacy.

My question is, what do I do? What do I say to tom, jerry, and terry? Since Terry did something extremely shady, is it punishable in any way? I was talked out of actually going through with sending my records to the individual crew, but should I just expose this to the world and have them be accountable for it? I don't know what to do. What to say to my own brother, what to do with making real friends. I know one thing, I want justice for what was done to me. If someone can help me, please reach out.",08Sep2019,1

1-I'm not sure if I will still like it after a year or so, and I'm afraid that the same thing that happened with the violin Will happens with the piano.
2-Even if I was shure, my parents would just tell me that ""they've already paid for the violin and the lessons"" and that ""I would give up on the piano just like I did with the violin"" (which comes back to me thinking the same)

47,"right so basically, I'm 19 and work a really crappy cinema job. The people there are nice enough and I probably have it better than most other places in terms of that, but management is AWFUL. Laura (lets call her) in particular has it out for me.

Ive been there for almost a year, and today at work I almost just left without 2 weeks notice because it annoyed me so much. I'm thinking of going to head office and complaining about the management there, in hopes it will change for the better, I want to know if its worth it when I have this ammunition:

1- I was being workplace bullied by a team member, I told the general manager and a supervisor/manager. They both told me that there was nothing they could do. 

2- Laura has blamed multiple times for things beyond my control, and for things I wasnt even there for. For example, a screen didnt get cleaned, which I got the blame for, despite the fact I was in an entirely different screen fixing a seat. There was other people outside who could have cleaned the screen. I asked management for help so we didnt get overwhelmed, to which my manager said ""No im busy ask someone else"". She later then said ""You know Im always there when you ask for help"". Laura then gave me a meeting on missing screens, and threatened she was happy to fire everyone in the cinema. 

3- I got blamed for a woman saying our hot dog gave her kidney stones. I have been told my supervisors, managers and the general manager that since our hot dogs are pre cooked, we are okay to microwave them past 75 and serve them. We didnt have hotdogs ready, so I offered to microwave it. My MANAGER Laura then did it for me, while telling me ""We dont microwave hotdogs"". She was the one who microwaved it, put it in the bun and served it. Then a few days later I get pulled into another meeting saying I gave a woman kidney stones and she now needs surgery. Maybe im wrong but, dont they take months to form? How could a pre-cooked and then warmed up hotdog give someone kidney stones worthy for surgery in 3 days? Doesnt seem plausible for me. 

4- Laura will grab me and pull me. This one sounds pretty bad, but it isnt as bad as it sounds. I dont think she even realises, but she will grab my arm and pull me/push me around. She has left bruises and marks before. I see she does this with almost everyone. I dont think she realises how hard she does it, and the fact I HATE to be touched. 

5- She will insult the workers. She referred to one of my coworkers as 'the big one', and looked a coworker up and down and said ""Really?"" when she was told they do dance. she is just very rude in that aspect.

6- Our staff room got broken into today, so everyone got spooked and checked their stuff hadnt been stolen, and moved it to the managers office. Laura got angry people were coming in to put there stuff there, and said she cant be bothered and doesnt want to deal with the people that broke into the staff room. Later she told me she contacted head office, so she at least did that. 

I could probably come up with more, but I'm hoping if I can get enough people with me to talk to head office something can be done about management. they all stick out for eachother and blame the team members when they do something wrong. I know its not as bad as most places, but honestly with a minimum wage job and extremely varied hours I feel like me and my coworkers shouldnt have to put up with it.

Do you think its worth going ot head office about? And if I did, how should I go about it? I dont want to be brushed off  again.Thanks for reading, I know it was a long one!",08Sep2019,1
48,"**BACKGROUND**
From 3rd grade to 6th, I took horseback riding lessons on jumping once a week for an hour. I looked forward to it every week and I loved everything about it. Even the mundane tasks like mucking out stalls, I had 0 problems with. 

**INCIDENT ONE**
When we were on a vacation in Hawaii, we went on a trail ride, where I fell off my horse. I have no idea what caused it. I was concussed and all I remember was one minute we were just walking and the next thing I knew, I woke up on the ground and couldn’t find my shoe. My mom’s horse had apparently spooked and she fell off too. Ever since then, my mom will not go near a horse, let alone ride one. Lessons continued when we got back. 

**INCIDENT TWO**
About a year or so later, there was an accident with the other girl in my lesson, Sophie. She was riding a mare who was brand new to the center and Sophie had never ridden her before. At some point, Sophie’s horse began to gallop out of control around the arena. I pulled as close to the railings as I could to try to get out of the way, and the the mare still ran into my horse from behind and my horse kicked his legs out at her. Sophie was screaming and the instructor tried in vain to stop the horse, but she kept picking up speed and eventually couldn’t turn the corners anymore and ran directly into the fence, where Sophie was flipped over the horse’s head right into a stack of unused poles and gates. I was fine, Sophie somehow ended up with just bruises. I don’t really blame the horse for this. Horses have bad days too, the weather was bad, and she was new. Accidents happen.

**WHEN I STOPPED**
Lessons continued for about a month after that, then my mom said we couldn’t afford it anymore and we stopped. I didn’t argue. I was sad, but lessons were $100 each and it added up. I understood, and was thankful I could even do it for as long as I did. (Still am thankful)

**NOW**
I’m a senior in high school now and I’ve been dropping the idea of taking lessons again for a few years, and now my mom has been saying it’s too dangerous and drops the subject. I know that it’s dangerous and it’s a 2000lb animal that needs to be respected. However, I also know that when you fall off, you get back on.

**WHY IT ISN’T ABOUT MONEY**
This made me think things over a little. I was a very active kid and when I stopped taking lessons, I was playing basketball, volleyball, soccer, and swim team, which all cost a lot of money. If it was about money, why did she make me quit the sport I loved the most? 

I eventually began to focus only on volleyball. The club I played in was expensive and I had private lessons 2-3 times a week $50-75 each. I got burned out from the sport and quit last year.

Also, we are very well-off. We live in a nice home in a nice area. We go on vacation about three times a year, usually abroad and we go to Europe annually. I know I sound like I’m boasting, but I’m only tying to give evidence that money was not the issue at hand.

**WHY I WANT TO START AGAIN**
I understand that my parents don’t have endless money and I’m not entitled to it. They have the right to spend their money as they choose. In no way do I feel like I am owed horse-back riding lessons. I’m only upset because my mom made me quit and lied about the reasoning, when in reality, it was because she was afraid of horses.

Now, I’m a senior in high school and I’m stressed out from all my school work. I’ve had two panic attacks this school year alone. Most of my friends were upperclassmen who moved away and I never leave my house except for school. I have virtually no social life anymore and I can count my friends on one hand. 

I just need to do something I enjoy again and working with animals is my favorite thing in the world. I worked at the local shelter over the summer and got to work with the horses for a little bit which was probably the highlight of my summer. 

I’m not a spoiled, petulant child who is throwing a tantrum at being told “no”. I fully believe riding horses again would better my life significantly and I’m almost positive it would not be a financial burden. I only think it’s unfair that my mom became to be afraid of horses and in turn, took away the one thing I loved the most. I have a good relationship with my parents and I would never tell her this, but I think it’s selfish. And I hate that she lied and couldn’t tell me to my face the real reason she made me quit.

Anyway, the only thing I’m putting on my Christmas wishlist this year is riding lessons. Any advice on how to convince my mom to let me ride again?",08Sep2019,1

60,I have been molested since the age of 6 and repeated raped since the age of 12. When I was six and older cousin of mine (17f)  molested me anytime I would go to her house. When it started I would say no but after the 6 or 7th time I just gave up fighting her. She would always say things like I knew you’d come along. When I moved away my cousin who live in the area started molesting me and I was so used to it that after the 2nd time I stopped fighting. After that me locked me in his room and would come in to rape me. He would bring friends and the would rape me together. This included people I had considered friends when I first visited.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

65,"OK so i know based off the title you guys are gonna think I'm a girl receiving dick pics, well that's wrong. I'm a guy \[19M\] who just got unwanted nudes from a girl \[19F\] and i didn't even HINT that i wanted anything of the sort.

However, there is a backstory to this before any judgement begins.

A few months ago I had been interested in this girl, although she lives a few hours away. she made initial contact with me through social media and me being an open minded individual decided to go along with her advances. we kicked it off great for that first week ( this was simply us talking and getting to know each other ) and after about 2 weeks began to Face time at night so that we could talk while she did her thing and i played games. even though she's a great girl, she had an attitude that revealed itself shortly after that completely rubbed me the wrong way.

I'm the type of person who is extremely patient but doesn't like to argue. I'm open to talking and hearing the other side of a story for any issue before giving my piece. however, I'm a logical person and a bit apathetic at times so i come off as blunt more often than not. that day she told me she didn't like a certain color of jewelry because it didn't contrast well with her skin, and then asked me that night if she should dye her hair that same color. 

i asked her why she would do that if she doesn't like that contrast, and for some reason she blew up on me and i immediately knew anything long term with her would end up with me losing my mind if she'd get mad at something i still don't know about. 

later that day i tell her that i think we would be better off as just friends. the day after she texts me and tells me shes going to kill herself. i immediately began calling her and an hour later she picks up, with multiple cuts on her arm and completely delusional. i managed to talk her down (this took place from around midnight - 3 am) and got her to wrap her arm and go to sleep. 

the next day she texts me and tells me that ""last night never happened"". 

i thought that was going to be our last interaction, but recently this past week shes decided she wants me again after about 4 months of no contact even though i made it clear i dont reciprocate her feelings. i VERY CLEARLY set boundaries but she slightly pushes her limits and the only reason i dont simply cut her off is because i would feel guilty if she did the same thing as last time.

just an hour before writing this she texts me saying "" im sorry for sending random half naked pictures but my body just looks SO good and i need someone to appreciate it"". i had read this through my notifications and thought that it was just swimwear (which she has sent before because she has modeling ambitions) and so i open them up and am assaulted by bra-less pictures and underwear. 

mind you, other women on said social media tend to overstep their bounds in terms of comments too and i've explained to her how i feel about getting unwanted sexual advances and comments and how i dont like the double standard, then she does this. 

i know most guys would welcome such things but im not one of them. i would simply block her but i dont know if maybe im being dramatic and i would feel guilty if she had another one of those self harming episodes. 

Long Story Short : Semi-Suicidal ""friend"" sent nude pictures without my suggestion or consent  with blatant disregard to the boundaries i set between us. dont know how to feel or what to do.",08Sep2019,3
66,"So I work on an office. I’m fairly low on the peaking order and I’ve not been there long. I manage projects and therefore have to interact with people from all over the business and get approvals for things and subject experts to write different bits of work, etc.

So on a particular project I have to get approval from a person who is responsible for a certain aspect of change that my project has to carry out. I sent him the documents to read and insure it’s all going to be done correctly. It’s honestly very easy stuff to look over and say, “Yes” or suggest a change. But I’m certain it’s all fine as I’ve had input from other people. But this guy HAS to be the one to approve it.

The issue is, he seems to be either ignoring me or just arrogant to it. It’d take him maybe 10 mins to look over it. But it’s been a week and a half. People are waiting for me to send them this documentation but I can’t until it has his approval. But he just won’t respond to my email, I’ve talked to him numerous times in person too. He just says, “Yeha I get to it as soon as I can”. There is absolutely NO WAY he’s that busy. He is just not doing his job.

I’ve escalated it to my Manager, who also spoke to him. Said it’ll be done. 3 days later. Still nothing! This guy is way to involved to even consider firing (especially for something like this), and my Manager can only escalate it and even then, he’s not going to be bothered. 

I’m seriously considering just terrorising him (in a professional sense). E.g. calling him every hour. Emailing him the attached every hour. Printing it off and putting it on his desk, etc. But it seems a bit much.",08Sep2019,1
68,"So for some backstory, I dated a girl for just over a month. Looking back at it I realise how manipulative she was. She broke up with me the second day of school. During our month together we had a few intimate moments. Never had sex but I did use my fingers in the back of my car twice (both times it was completely consensual). While we were dating she said ""if you ever try and break up with me I'll make sure you don't"". I thought it was gonna be something waydifferent, but a mutual friend of mine, after I asked him to do some investigation, figured out she intended to falsely accuse ms of rape. Problem is, he figured out tonight. Earlier today she called and asked me to get back together with her. After saying yes, talking for a bit, then hanging up I realised why I was happy without her. I want to break up with her, and was planning on doing so tomorrow, until my friend told me this bit of info. I don't know how to protect myself. I didn't do anything wrong, and it would be her word against mine. I'm probably missing some info about this situation but I can answer questions in the comments. I just want to know how I can protect myself if she does in fact accuse me of rape.

76,"I'm in a slight pickle. I moved to CA in June, switched residences in July. Had my car shipped in June.

I purchased my car in another state in early August of 2018. My car has out of state plates and has since then. CA has an absolutely ridiculous deadline of 20 days to register a vehicle after moving (DMV appointments are all months out???) and a law saying cars that entered CA less than a year after purchase must pay the difference in inevitably higher CA sales taxes on the car purchase price.

The deadline has long since passed, as I was waiting until after August. My current plates expire in October. Now, I'm a AAA member so I can register my car through them, but this would require me to flat out lie on the DMV form that says ""sign here or else perjury blah blah"" to avoid taxes. I've heard the deadlines aren't enforced very closely, but the form flat out asks you the date of your first residence in CA and date the car entered CA. 

My options are:
Be a good law abiding citizen, pay like $1000 in additional taxes / late fees.

I've never had a real job, I don't drive, I'm extremely lonely, I'm constantly at home, etc. And it honestly fucking hurts to see the people I graduated with, and people younger than me doing really cool things in their lives that I wish I could do.

86,"Ok, yes it’s a weird title but hear me out. I (F16) got hired at a fast food place on Thursday and today was my first shift. I can kind of tell they have low expectations/regret hiring me already, (which is 100% my fault). I mainly just did online training courses at work today, but co-workers commented several times on me being incredibly quiet (valid, I am), and the person training me is so sweet but I can tell she is a bit disappointed by how awkward I am.

Here’s the thing though, that’s how I get. I’m probably autistic (not diagnosed so don’t take that too seriously) and I’m very sensitive and like a deer caught in headlights in new situations around new people that I’ll know for a while. Basically, this situation of my first ever job is the literal perfect storm. I clam up and am super awkward, but once I get into the routine and know what to do and know my place, I’m pretty much a machine. I work hard, I speak super loudly and clearly, I’m very able to serve and communicate with people, and I do everything the way it should be done. I just have to get the routine. Its the difference between night and day, basically. Obviously I’m still me and still have my faults and am awkward and sensitive, but I do what needs to be done when it needs to be done.

What I’m asking here is how do I let my boss know this? How do I get into the routine and show them what I’m capable of before I get fired? I can’t just say it like it is because right now I can’t say it. I’m, for the most part, mute and can’t form sentences when I’m new to situations like I am this one. So right now all she sees is the outward, clammy, silent and stimming version of my mind taking everything in and memorizing the location and everything in it.

95,"I am not sure where to start with this but please hear me out. I have a B.A in a double major of political science and cultural anthropology and just got my Masters of Professional Communications at 23 years old. Right out of school I landed my first job at a small non-for-profit with only 15 people on the team. I was the only ""communications coordinator"" of the entire company, that was active and well known on an international level.

I was not properly trained (Assuming I am the only comms person), just thrown in and told to sink or swim. Most of my work was done relatively decently until they started piling up so much work all at once. I had 8 directors and a CEO give me materials of their own projects that I needed to work on in regards to its communications and it got overwhelming. Every task to every director and the CEO was a ""priority"" and my task list was overwhelming. I would get the job done but would make small mistakes in the details and directors and the CEO started getting upset and frustrated. I couldn't balance getting so much work off my desk quickly but also flawlessly. I spoke up to my CEO regarding how I felt but nothing was done and no one really cared about my workload and why some smaller and very careless mistakes happened.

Fast forward, the CEO of the company really was keen about me, he mentored me and then I started realizing that his comments would become inappropriate (commenting on my body) and would always find time to talk to me at my desk or in his office about his life, etc. We went on a business trip and he tried to hold my hand and I pulled my hand back and felt physically ill the entire trip. After that business trip, the CEO told me he can't talk to me anymore in a ""friendly"" way because people in the office spread rumors that he was ""favouriting me"" not even being there for more than a year that situation alone led to a few women in the office despising me and just recently one women in particular began really hating me.

One of the directors, who I've helped with certain projects, began to treat me badly and purposely get me in trouble by the CEO. Recently she has given me a very bad attitude, rolling her eyes at me, micro-managing my projects, picking on every single mistake I do and reporting it all to the CEO. Today the CEO called me into his office and yelled at me for an accusation that was not true and was told by that lady. She tries to overtake my projects, take all the attention away from the success of my work and really pushes me under the bus on purpose sometimes fabricating ""mistakes"" ive made while covering her own mistakes. I am afraid to speak up to the toxic and harrasing environment ive been in for the past year because everyone there is over the age of 50 and feels like they could talk to me and control me in a certain way because im younger. Recently, she reported a small mistake to the CEO and proceeded to talk to me telling me that she will continue to report my mistakes to him and that her suggestion for me is to start looking for new jobs...later on she called me on a Saturday to try and take back the comments she made regarding having me look for a new job, my assumption that she is afraid ill go to the CEO to tell him what she said.

There is more to this story but this is just a glimpse, I fortunately FOUND ANOTHER JOB recently and for some reason am losing sleep in telling my boss that I am submitting my two weeks. My contract does state I need to give them a 30 day notice but my new job is requiring i stick with the standard two week start date.

She has no problem at least acting like she's happy to see me (she might actually be, I wasn't *that* bad), but even so, I don't think she'd be very receptive to me asking her out. I think I might have at least a small chance if I got to talk to her normally for any good length of time, since I'm considerably less of a jerk than I used to be, but I have no idea how to do that without coming swinging out of the gates with the whole I-have-a-crush-on-you thing.

One more note: I've been informed that there's a good chance she's suicidally depressed over unfulfillment and frustration with her life, if that makes a difference. I'd prefer ***not*** to push her over the edge.

If you're curious about what I did that was so jerk-ish: I made fun of her religion-- no worse, I made fun of *her* because of her religion. Why would I do such a thing? I don't know. I wasn't thinking. And I was just generally an ass back then.

100,"There are 4 main parts to this,

(A bit of background info) I am a bartender at a pub and this is about my boss (The GM, General Manager)

1, He is always late for work and leaves early, most shifts he just says to the team leaders on shift ""I'm leaving early at \[Whatever\] time."" then leaves. And he is late for his shifts 50% of the time. Just last week me and the head chef was on the rota to turn up at 9am and we had to wait outside for him for 45 minutes because he was the only one with the keys to open up in the morning and he was 45 mins late.

2, just last week, a waitress went upstairs looking for him to ask something about a booking, she found him in his office, FAST ASLEEP. Apparently he'd been asleep for more than an hour. (Just after that happened he announced that he would be leaving early, 3 or 4 hours before his shift was supposed to end)

3, earlier this week, I was on a bar close with the bar manager, she did the safe count (That gets done every night) and she noticed there was £100 missing. She messaged the GM to see if there was an error or if there was a reasonable explanation to why there was £100 missing. He replied saying he'd just found it in his pocket, didn't know how it has got there and he'd bring it in tomorrow.

4, This isn't something to do with HIM but I find it a bit dodgy, if a table walks out without paying (We have back and side doors, it is easily done) the money they should have been paid comes out of everyone's tips. For my American friends out there I live in the UK, tipping isn't really a massive thing here, people tip if they think the service is exceptional and everyone pretty much gets that. But is that really legal for money to come out of everyone's tips for something we can't control??? F.Y.I: everyone shares the tips, they all go in a massive pot and they get split down the middle between bar staff, waiting staff and kitchen staff.

101,"I was able to get through a first semester course of java and do fine with minimal studying, but I got to data structures and it was just too much for me at the time. If I put more priority on school I maybe could have gotten through, but that's a different conversations. 

Anyway, now I have a different career path and it's going well, but I've tried to start learning coding a couple times now more as a personal improvement thing/I have ideas for games and I struggle to get the IDEs working properly. I feel like I understand methods and loops for the most part, but as far as how the IDE itself works I get really confused setting it up. And it bothers me that I can't know exactly how it works before getting into the project, even though I know that *actually working on something* is the best way to gain experience. As I said, I try to figure out how to get past step 0 of setting up the IDE so I can be on the same page as my YouTube tutorial and I'm just completely lost as to how to save my project or format the main or how the driver class connects to whatever..., and I always fail to find the solution by googling. And because I can't *describe* my problem well either (because I don't understand it, it's even less help for me). Furthermore, the fact that I'm stuck on step 0 and that coding frustrates me like nothing else (I rarely get angry in my everyday life, but put me to work on tech troubleshooting and it'll be about three minutes before I hit a wall and can't think straight), and I just end up quitting after a few hours of failed starting. It's discouraging, to say the least. 

I want to make some simple games to test out concepts and I was thinking of going into unity. I was wondering if I would even be able to operate that or if I would run into the same kind of problems? If I was able to do it, would that help me understand how IDEs function and maybe allow me to get into coding?",08Sep2019,1

103,"Info:

* 19 year old student | USA 
* No prior job experience (a lot of volunteering)
* Engineering student (with a shit schedule)
* Lives at home/no expenses

So I'm a college student living in a University town. I have no expenses beyond eating out with friends every now and again. I'm primarily concerned with this on a more academic basis than a personal one; my schedule for school runs from 8-2 pm everyday save Thursday, which runs from 9-12 am and then later from 5-9 pm. This is an engineering program, so it's a pain in the ass on top of the schedule and requires a shit ton of additional hours studying for the material/prepping for exams. I'm aiming towards a career in medicine, which means my priority is my GPA and I don't wish to endanger that.

  
The job is a campus position that requires a minimal of 8 hours per week, and is very close to my home. Basically, I just need some people to tell me to stop being a lazy ass and get a job. Alternatively, someone could provide me with a convenient excuse to not get the job and continue being a lazy ass. Either I'm fine with, I'm just nervous about doing this in the middle of school. I *do* have quite a bit of free time beyond school, but I also *do* have study groups with peers and I *probably* can get this job in the summer. I'm also concerned I'll take the job and find out I can't balance it with my studies and have to quit it, which would likely endanger any future employment there.

104,"Let me start by saying that I’ve been homeschooled all my life. I used to have a few friends but I moved to a new state 4 years ago and haven’t really had a single friend since then, I’ve met a few people (mostly girls) and haven’t maintained a good friendship/relationship for more than a few months. I do hang out at a few places but never talk to anyone there that I see regularly. I also have a job working in the kitchen at a small but busy restaurant and all my coworkers either hate me or don’t acknowledge me (they are almost all a few years older than me, I’m 17). I’m not saying that having a social life the worst thing in the world but I can definitely see it causing issues in things I do now/in the future. I’m a extremely quiet person but if someone does strike a conversation then I do alright, but if they don’t initiate it then I avoid conversation like the plague. Going to school isn’t really an option at this point because I graduate this year, also I am not sure if I’m going to college but if I do it would be for art. Which even though I’m decent at I still struggle with seeing that as a career when I have no social skill or experience dealing with people. I would probably say I’m depressed, but I’m not suicidal as I’ve never wanted to kill my self or harm myself.

106,"I've been friends with this particular person for just over a year, and and she was the first and only person I've ever clicked with. I know some people may say that an online friendship isn't real, but I genuinely really care about her and she's one of the closest friends I've ever had.

Im the past few months, she's become extremely close with someone else. I'll admit that I may have gotten a bit jealous too early. I wasn't used to her sharing so much of her time with someone else but I told myself to be rational about it. But then it started delving into half our conversations being about him, she started constantly talking about how great he was and started listening to me less. She'd snap at me more in conversation, get annoyed when I needed support because she wasn't in a place to deal with it, while also telling me how heartbroken she was whenever he was even slightly upset. Our conversations dwindled to two or three word answers to my texts while she was on the phone with him constantly, and when I voiced the fact that my feelings were hurt over the sudden change in her behavior, the message got brushed over and she was conveniently 'busy' for the next few days. This has been going on for over a month, and I feel like I'm crying daily over the fact that the only person who I feel cared about me doesn't seem to give a shit anymore.

Today, they confessed their feelings for each other. I already knew that she was interested, but what hurt me the most was that she had told him all the things that I needed to hear the most. That she cared about him, that nothing could stop them from being friends, that he made her life better, things she hasn't told me since before meeting him. It seems as though she only has place for one person and that person isn't me anymore. And if she's in a romantic relationship I can only see that getting worse. I feel awful because I want to be happy for her, but it only makes me feel like I've lost something.

My mental health is pretty bad right now, and I need a friend to just hang out with like normal. Is there anyway I can get us back to a friendship where she respects me too and our conversations aren't all about him? Or is it not worth me trying and just making myself even more hearbroken?

We are allowed to listen to music, but our music player obviously can't have a camera. I am wondering if any more knowledgeable people know whether such a device exists which *has no cameras and also can support the Spotify app.*

It's harder than one would think to find a device with no camera, but it's even harder to find one that can support Spotify, I'm looking specifically for Spotify for a couple reasons. First, I've been using it for years so I already have a premium account and multiple playlists made. Secondly, I have a Last fm account which tracks every time I listen to a song, and my Spotify account can be linked to my Last fm account. I bought a cheap used Kindle Fire thinking I could install Spotify, but found out quickly that I couldn't download Spotify on the Kindle store, and also I couldn't download a third party app to track songs through the Amazon music player.

I'm just thinking that there has to be an alternative to using something like a cheap iPod shuffle which can only listen to downloaded local songs, or using my Kindle which would compromise three years of listening data.

108,"Alright, so I've been thinking about this for a good month now, so here's a little of the backstory:

Basically, I've been friends with him for well over 6 years now. We were both weirdos and social outcasts so we didn't really interact with others and instead we just hanged out together. We'd watch movies and TV shows and be inseparable on the daily. So, this started out in high school. After high school though an incident happened. My parents told me I couldn't go to college that year cause of financial reasons. As a response to this my friend threw his papers away and decided to wait a year with me. 

So, the year passed and we finally got into college. We went to different ones obviously but we had planned to stay in the same apartment. Another problem arose though, when my parents already got me my own dorm room. They prepaid and had to pull a lot of strings for this to happen. I didn't get a say in the matter either so I couldn't fulfill my part. He was furious, so much so that his whole attitude changed that day. He started mocking me every day which wasn't too bad but he knew exactly which buttons to push to trigger me. In college I would ask him to hang out and go out almost on the daily and he'd refuse most of the time only to go out with his new classmates. That's when I started making my own friends and I stopped talking to him for a while. When he saw this he started asking me to go out again. We've been semi-friends for a while now, until of course a few months ago when I went abroad to work. When I went there I sent him a picture saying ""I  look so short in this pic"". Instead of laughing he immediately started picking on my insecurities again. I immediately just bursted and started calling him out for his insecurities too and before we knew it we were just arguing like crazy. He said something like ""you abandoned me when we were going for college"" and I kept mentioning how much of a dick he became for the past year. I ended it by saying ""I really tried being friends but I guess this just won't work out"". 

I've been feeling like absolute shit ever since. I cannot smile anymore, I cannot have fun. I feel about how much of a dick I've been and all I want is for us to hang out like we used to. We both used to be just the losers in the back until a year ago when we both kinda became the leaders of our groups so we became quite popular. Problem is I'm popular in the sense that I now hang out with my classmates a lot while he is popular in the ""handsome smooth guy that bullies the weirdos"" way. 

So I genuinely do not know what to do. Should I apologize or should I try to move on?",08Sep2019,2

I now understand why she did it, I’m 24 now but previously resented her for it.  I felt like a kid should always be put first and a mother should help or protect her kid no matter what.  Unfortunately my dad was raised in that kind of household and it carried on to me, which put her in a weird position.

I went from loving my job as a preschool teacher at a local daycare to absolutely hating it, to the point I’m near tears at work during certain points of the day. First, let me describe the owner she’s a very condescending lady, who talks to her employees like we’re two years old and if someone does something wrong she’ll mention it out loud to another person like “Did you see how dirty the two year old room looks today?” Clearly knowing that I’m right there and listening and talking about my room! 
Now, I, along with a couple coworkers seen her pull on kids, grab them by the shirt off the floor, scream in their faces, punish the wrong kid, make them cry, etc. [I’m calling DCFS Monday]

113,"Let me start off by saying my mom does not have a history with the law. She’s raised me pretty much by herself for 20 years and has done a hell of a job in doing so. However, she’s had a history of doing drugs in the past (not sure what her exact drug of choice was) and my family thinks she’s started up again.

About 3 1/2 years ago my mom started a relationship with a man (we’ll call him Dan) after coming out of an abusive 10 year relationship which drove her into bankruptcy. Before this relationship she was doing well for herself, slowly paying off the debt she accrued from her previous relationship and meeting up with old friends at bars and rebuilding her social life, which is where she met Dan.

Keep in mind, my mom has shielded me from drugs my entire life, but after a couple months into her relationship with Dan, she was openly smoking weed in our garage, even offering to pass a joint or two to me (I was smoking a lot of weed at this point in my life). This surprised me though; usually she is much more careful with who sees her doing things she probably shouldn’t be doing. 

Fast forward a couple years, and I’m basically moved into my boyfriend’s house. At this point in my life I’m visiting home about once a week, my mom is working two jobs (again, unusual - she always budgeted her money well) and things aren’t going well with Dan. They’ve broken up multiple times, my mom’s lost a ton of weight and all of a sudden she’s got cameras in every corner of the yard.

As of now, she’s skinnier and her face is sunken in, and she called the cops twice because she believes Dan is hiding in the attic and in between the walls, tapping into wires and hacking the cameras she installed. She barricaded my grandmother (who lives with my mom) in the house, putting every heavy item she can find in front of every entrance to the house. My family and I decided that she’s ticked off every sign of using drugs, so now we’re going to force her to get treatment.

As I’m writing this I just got a text from my cousin saying he picked her up from some place tweaked out and I’m on my way to her house now to meet them there.

I’ve never dealt with anything like this in my life. I don’t know what to do, how to help or what comes next. I’m scared and worried sick about my mom and I don’t know if she’ll ever be normal again.

When they ordered, the dad told me he was getting our most popular shrimp appetizer with chicken instead which we can do, and then he told me it was because he was allergic to seafood and asked what he should get. I showed him the non seafood items on our menu since we are a seafood restaurant we don’t have a lot of other options. He gets the appetizers and then I ring in the entree orders. When I ring his order in, I am looking for the chicken option and I couldn’t find it at first, and then I see right next to the shrimp dish it’s the same one but with the word chicken in it. What I didn’t realize was that I just rang in the chicken and shrimp option, which was a new button I had never seen or used before so I assumed it was just the new chicken button.

At one point a little over 10 years ago my father broke his back and although he recovered, he was out of work for a long time and eventually got a job across the state and saw us every other weekend.


 Throughout the year since, we have thankfully had enough money for necessities but not enough for many extra things. Although it is sometimes disappointing i have always shown and felt gratitude for my parents. my fathers salary is relatively good, but with 4 kids who grew up in private school, things have always been tight.


 Recently my father has been getting less and less patients (he works as a physical therapist  in peoples homes and schedules his patients himself) and has had to borrow thousands (10,000+ out of the retirement funds- leaving ny parents with less money when they retire ) of dollars to pay the bills. I would contribute, but i am a full time college student and although I have a great scholarship, i need to pay my tuition. It hurts me to see how much my patents are struggling as they are under a lot of stress. 


We also need a new car (the one we have is 10 years old and breaking down very often) and we can't afford it.

136,"My aunt passed a week and a half ago. I was one of her caregivers for 8 years and we were pretty close. 

I won’t go into details but she unexpectedly passed away shortly after I arrived for my shift. EMTs and police were already there, they did everything they could to revive her. But she died while I was in the room answering questions for the police and another EMT. I’m still hurting and scared from the situation. 

I rescheduled my orientation for my internship for next week. I was approved time off from my job because I keep having panic attacks and I just can’t take care of my other clients in this state. 

I emailed my professor that handles internships and explained the situation to him. I don’t want to drop out or lose my internship but I do not feel ready yet to start it.

Am I being reasonable asking if there’s any way I can just start my internship in a few weeks and get an extension until my hours are complete? I need to get my mental health in check so I can focus, I’ve already left messages for counseling services at the college and to get a med check from my doctor. 

Of course if my professor says he can’t help me then I will have to suck it up somehow and start my internship. I just don’t know what to do because I’ve never been in this situation before. Everyone keeps telling me to just suck it up and go.",08Sep2019,1

I couldn’t listen to non-Christian music. I rarely/couldn’t watch movies. I didn’t get to experience things like Disney channel and things till far too late. I couldn’t hang out with friends as much. 

My parents were fine and I was disciplined well. (Far better than my siblings). But I missed out on a lot. 

My dad isn’t in my life right now as my parents are divorced and he’s a master manipulator. He’s a big reason I never experienced much and I was scared to stray from those rules even a little.  He scared me a lot and all my life I walked on eggshells. 

Fact is it was hard to relate with other kids when I wasn’t allowed to do much/was too scared to do anything. Now I’m an awkward adult. I’ve gotten better and I challenge myself in order to grow. 

But I’m stupid and behind. Not academically so much as socially. Being fairly introverted and depressed has never helped my case either.

We were getting pretty close, and he would send obvious signs like sending hearts, constantly worrying about my safety and just other instances of flirting. I started liking him a lot, because he is super nice, looks nice, perfect style, just everything I’d ever wanted in a boyfriend. 
Anyways, this morning I woke up to a text that he had sent the previous night. Here is the text, but with a few grammatically altered sentences (just in case he sees this or something):
“i know this sounds really stupid and you might not believe me but it’s the truth and i feel like i should tell you now before it’s too late. i really liked you but the past few months i’ve had this problem where i’m not able to love anyone as more than friends i don’t know why but it just happens. i really liked our first hangout but i don’t want to lead you on and i hope we can stay friends. i’m sorry if this hurts you in any way but i don’t mean to i just don’t have the ability to love anymore”

I was friendzoned.
Of course I am sad, but I don’t even know if the “unable to love” thing is reality or just a nice way of friendzoning me. If it were to be the truth, I thought maybe being around him more and getting even closer would ease out the feelings?

I’m not sure. I’m just overall lost. Also, we previously made plans to hang out tomorrow, which I’m so nervous about because I fear it would be awkward.

148,"Okay... i dont know how to explain this all. About 2.5 hours ago my dad and his girlfriend went to a festival at a park nearby.

150,"I started boarding school only a month ago and this is already happening. I'm freaking out because all my roommates are telling me I'm the ass so I need to double check. (I've changed the names)

One day during the the first few weeks of living my roommates one of them called Na. She put on a dress and asked what I thought. My knee jerk reaction was to say ""A lot of cleavage and a bit too short."" I moved on with my day and forgot about it. Me and Na started to drift as she got closer with other kids and I made more friends.

After Na and me stopped hanging out as much I started taking more with Lou. I spent all my time with her and really enjoyed her company. One night Na brought up the dress thing and some other issues. I was caught off guard and apologised to her. I rambled and fucked up, throughout that night where Na was grilling me, I said a lot shit I did not mean. That was my fault I said I noticed she was mad, then that I didn't and a ton of other shit.

The next day everything was swirling. I talked with my friends on what happened, talking about the issues and the rambling. That night I noticed Lou was ignoring me but I thought it was about the fight. So that night I tried talked to Na and fix the issue. She said she didn't care. But instead Lou came in and started fighting with me.

The other night I had said while rambling I implied that I was only friends with Lou because Na was ignoring me. Lou for good reason took issue with that I tried to explain that I didn't mean it in that way and I didn't mean to hurt her. Na pointed out I hadn't even said sorry and then immediately did multiple times stating I was in the wrong.

The next night (Friday) I left them alone and gave them space. I talked to more kids in the boarding house. But the Saturday night they brought it up again. Complaining I hadn't come up to Lou in private and I had just moved on to another friend. That I just hopped from friend to friend without actually care about them. I rambled and contradicted myself so many times. When I tried to explain everything to them Na took me saying I didn't mind at the time if we were drifting as me not caring about her. They all hate me now.

As the title says, I become a fountain at any given little thing. Whether it be sadness, anger, or happiness; I can’t even start expressing myself before the tears come. I’ve been like this ever since I was a child, but it’s gotten 10x worse as I’ve gotten older. (Thanks to depression &amp; crippling anxiety) I’m 19 now if that means anything.

(Therapy has been unhelpful and also kind of exacerbated my problems. Though, I will try seeing a psychiatrist as a last ditch effort in a few days.)

Anyways, the issue; crying. I’ve never been able to express my feelings without breaking down.  I guess the whole issue is stemmed from not being taught how to express myself in any other manner than crying or running away? My mother would rather look at her phone than listen to anything I have to say, and when she does acknowledge me... there’s always some sarcastic comment/“joke”, or she’ll just take my problems as an insult to her parenting. My dad honestly tries, but he’s kind of a plain “You shouldn’t feel like that.” (Think: r/thanksimcured ) kind of advice guy.

154,"I think I'm very critical on people. I personally define myself as overly sensitive but this would not be so concerning of a trait if I didn't negatively inflict myself onto people. I think I often tend to make people involved in my life feel ""less"" or not ""good enough"" by frequently picking faults in them. 

This happens a lot. I'm not sure if this is because I hold people up to very high standards and expect to yield as much as I plow but this I've found is not a good thing to desire out of people since no one is or can be perfect.

I even broke up with my boyfriend over this. Although there were other things, I feel like this was the main reason why things started to plummet between him and I. I just want more and more. It's not that I want them to be perfect but it's as if I want them to meet my standards and I know rationally, this is not possible because people can't ever meet my standards accurately but it seems to bother me a lot.

157,"Reposting because this has impacted my life so significantly for the past three years.

I’m a 22-year-old guy who went to college for two years right out of high school, then took a couple years off, then transferred to a new school. 

I’ll say immediately that story that follows is not a plea for pity or a way to alleviate my guilt. I admit my fault, and I know I was wrong. I just want to know how to more permanently move past this in my life so that I can find happiness again.


Through my freshman year of college, I became close friends with a girl my age. We were both in the similar majors at a small-ish school, so we often had classes together without our choice, even. We really hit it off, and I felt for the first time in my life that I had found someone who related to me.  She told me all of her secrets, and I did the same. Even though she didn’t come out and say it, we were seemingly each other’s best friend. She wasn’t a love interest, but every now and then I’d develop a small attraction to her, but it faded every time. What connected us mostly was our similar philosophies on everything. Examples: We both agreed that we wouldn’t ever date anyone without thinking we would eventually marry them. We both were the quiet, observer-type of person. We both had very similarly complex tastes in music, appreciating nearly every genre in one way or another, both new and old. She eventually even called me a soulmate for being so connected with her way of thinking. Having her friendship made me so happy.

Through our sophomore year, we were very, very close friends, and we developed a friend group that spun around our school’s department. Beginning that school year, we were hanging out a lot together, and our friends would make fun of us for thinking that we were dating when we weren’t, but we always laughed it off. As our relationship got closer, she started to ask me about some sexual topics, and she expressed her interest in FWB quietly one night mid-conversation, and she also mentioned her realization that she might be bisexual, and she felt conflicted and embarrassed about it. The whole thing surprised me, but I assured her I loved her just the way she is.

A couple weeks later, she came over and made cookies with me, and then we sat in my room and talked for hours and hours until very late at night. Eventually, we were both laying down on my bed (my apartment bedroom was small, and there weren’t any chairs), and she rolled over on her back while our conversation was slowing down due to drowsiness. For whatever reason, I decided to give her a back massage, and she said I was really good at it. I kept going down her back and then stopped after a while, then she asked me to keep going, so I did, and I got a little aroused just from her being so into it. So as I kept going, I moved around and started massaging her ass a little bit, and she didn’t say anything. I figured that was fine, and I was getting more turned on, so I moved on to touching her tits a bit. She didn’t say anything, so I figured it was okay, but I knew it wasn’t going anywhere, so I eventually stopped, and we both passed out on my bed.

The next day, she texted me huge message and said that I was a really important friend to her, and she kindof liked what I did and would be open for more eventually. So a couple days later,  she texted me drunk telling me that I can come over if I want at 1 am since there’s a group of them together. I came over, and we all hang out on the couch and talk. Everyone was drinking except for me. At about 3 am, everyone had left or fallen asleep except for me and my best friend, so she pulls me into her room, and we sit on the bed and talk, and after a while she lays down like she did when I gave her a massage the other night, so I did the same thing. She seemed into it and fine, but she stopped talking while I massaged. Eventually I kept moving on to her ass and tits like before, and she didn’t say anything, but I started to get pretty horny. At this point, it was 4 in the morning, and she was like falling asleep, so she was only half-responsive. Finally, my horny self just pulled down her pants slowly and started slowly fingering her. She moaned softly, but she was still mostly quiet. I went on for maybe another 5 minutes, then quit, and she didn’t say much and we both said our good nights and I left.

The next morning, she sent me a long text explaining how she wasn’t okay with what happened and how even though she invited me over and into her room, she did not want that. I apologized profusely and asked if we could talk, but she refused. I waited a couple more days and asked again, but she wouldn’t reply to my messages. Two days later, she told half of our friends about me, and they all gave me death stares for the rest of the year. I felt and still feel awful. It was a bad decision to go to her room at that time of night, but as she had expressed before, I thought she had wanted it. I was wrong. Our friendship immediately imploded, and I spent most of the following nights that year alone in my apartment. I sent more apology texts, but after repeatedly not hearing back, I gave up. At the end of the school year, we both transferred to different universities, and I haven’t spoken to her since.

I know what I did was wrong, and I know I should’ve not assumed. I’ve tried to apologize to myself in order to move on, but time and time again, I find myself thinking about her and our lost friendship late into the night. I wonder if she’s thinking about me, and I just wish I could talk to her again even though I know I won’t. I haven’t had any sexual experiences with anyone since then, and I know if I did, I would be extremely careful in asking for verbal consent. 

I’m not suicidal, but I’ve struggled to find happiness even after talking to a therapist. I just want to find someone to relate to genuinely, like a soulmate. I fear that I may never find someone again.

158,"I've never known my grandpa from my father's side. I remember about 20 years ago my parents searched for his name and contacted someone via email but they never replied. I only know very few things about him, his name, I saw one photo once and that he lived in Milan at some point. A friend of my parents who is Iranian like him and comes from the same city (Teheran) and during one of his visits he found the house the family once lived in and talked to the janitor. According to him the family scattered all over the globe, some live in Germany, some in the USA. 

I've been thinking about who my dad's dad is from time to time, if he's still alive but never actually searched for him.

Now I just did a quick Google search with his name and the first thing that came up was a profile of a man with the same name living in New Zealand and judging from the profile photo, the age seems to fit. That's of course just a reach, there must be several people the same age with the same name. 

So I did a search for the family name on some family search website. And I found someone with the same family name living in Milan! I found his facebook profile and go through his friends...and the older man living in New Zealand with the same name as my grandpa is in his friends list.

Now I'm just baffled that I found this within 5 minutes and the coincidences are just too big to ignore at this point.

I really don't know what to do from this point. I don't want to just contact them and ask? Or tell my parents about this? It's 5:45 am and now I can't sleep, knowing I potentially just found my dad's dad that he's never really known.",08Sep2019,1

The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly.

167,"I apologize if this comes out as some jumbled mess, my mind is all over the place at the moment. 

Back when I was in high school (6-7 years ago), I dealt with depression/suicidal behavior. Clear as day, I was in a really bad spot. All I thought about was killing myself. Wake up, coast through the day like a zombie, come home, lock myself in my room, go to bed, and repeat. I eventually got to the point of dancing with suicide, and hatched this master plan to start taking large amounts of prescription meds before bed, increasing doses until I hit the lethal mark, and it would look like an OD fueled by addiction instead of suicide. Figured my family could deal with that easier than knowing their son simply hated himself and being alive. Long, unrelated story made short; my plans got put on hold by some family issues. 

After a little while of dealing with those issues, it dawned on me that I wasn't spending every waking moment wanting to kill myself anymore. But, I still felt numb to everything around me, and that's how it's been ever since. I don't feel any attachment to anything, I never feel any kind of emotional reaction to anything anymore, but it's been enough to get by, and I've been able to keep those darker thoughts at bay.....well have been trying to at least. 

The last couple of weeks, things have started getting worse though. I'm ""tired"" all the time, I don't feel any kind of motivation to do anything, and all those self-hate thoughts are starting to make their way back in. Now, if I'm basing this off historical data, I'd say I'm going right back to that place I was before, and that is where things are getting really confusing for me. 

On one end, I am thinking this exactly where I was before, I'm depressed, and soon going to be dealing with all those suicidal thoughts (kinda already am). On the other hand, part of me feels like this isn't as ""valid"" for some reason. Like, there are people out there who are actively trying to kill themselves, and that what I am going through isn't actually depression, it's just me being a bitch and feeling sorry for myself. 

I don't know if I was depressed, wasn't, and am now again. Maybe I've just been depressed this entire time. Maybe I've never been depressed and like I said, I'm just being a bitch. As dumb as this may sound, I'm confused about deciding on how I feel. And on top of everything, I can't even find the slightest bit of an urge to actually do anything about because I don't think I could cohesively put together thoughts (rereading what I've typed, I can't even figure out how to get this post sounding fluid). 

More or less just hoping to hear from anyone who might be able to pinpoint what the fuck is going on, or if they feel like this is something they've experienced.",08Sep2019,1

171,"We burried my 6 month old baby a year ago on monday. 

Last week the cemetary we burried him in shifted plot numbers 51-66 over by one, leaving an older couples headstone on my baby's plot. 

We've contacted the cemetary and they are adamant that my baby is burried next to where hes really burried. Even with pictures of the fresh dirt and newly layed grass that you can still see outlined. 

After some research, my mom actually found my baby is burried in the wrong plot. Hes supposed to be in 67, and is in 66. Which means the couple that is burried in 65 is really supposed to be in 66. By speculation, this could mean the whole row is off. 

I'm at a loss as to what we should do next. How do we get this corrected when the cemetary is so insistent I'm in the wrong?",08Sep2019,3

173,"For context purposes, I'm the type of person that ""chooses"" the people that are around me. If they are similar to me in tastes and brains usually I feel comfortable and relaxed around.

I have this group of friends that consists of 1 guy and 3 girls (one of them is my GF) that I usually go get some coffee with on a pretty much daily bases and as I pointed out they're the type of friends I consider smart and tasteful.

Yesterday we we're getting some coffee as usual but my GF was working so it was just 4 of us. One of my friends brought a girl along with her to join us and she was nice and could keep a conversation so no problem there.

Queue the pseudo-BF of this new girl into the coffee...
He bursts in, asks me and my friend to move so he could sit, no greetings no nothing, just straight up an ahole and none of us knew him but this girl.
This type of person I don't get along with, we were having a nice conversation and this guy just got his Chad on bragging about he could do this and he was making drifts with his car and what not.

I kinda froze for 5 min just listening to the crap he was spilling for no reason and I noticed that the girl wasn't in the best terms with this dude, but when I felt into myself I simply stood up and left the scene.

Of course I'm not the boss of nobody and when I was feeling uncomfortable I made the decision to not be there because I don't have to deal with these types of people barging in and Chading up the place. 

My friends were kinda confused as to why I was leaving, but I headed to other coffee place and texted them to come meet me and was shocked to see that one of them didn't respond, the other was going home and the other one responded 2 h later telling me that they were there and now heading home as well. 

Now this leads me to my doubts... I thought they were like me, and clearly they were kinda annoyed as well over this Chad, but yet they stayed there for another 2h listening to that. I don't think I misjudged them but they would rather be there then to come meet me other place? Was I in the wrong for leaving because the dude made me feel uncomfortable? I mean we all didn't knew him but just let him push us around and insert himself onto that conversation without consentment and just stand there? 


TL:DR - my social group is ""restrict"" because we like people similar to us (tastes and brains) and this Chad barges in the scene. I leave because I felt uncomfortable and went to another place. Texted friends to meet me and they didn't respond or responded 2h saying they stayed there anyway, and I'm beginning to doubt their descerniment",08Sep2019,1
174,"So, there’s kinda a lot of information to preface with here.
- I have really bad anxiety and have always had terrible experiences with roommates because of this
- My personal space and belongings being threatened or impeded upon is a place of great anxiety for me 
- I’m in college in a student apartment 
- My apartment is beautiful 
- Last year I lived in a tiny, disgusting shit hole full of dangerous housing code violations with 4 other people.
- My roommates were a nightmares both in the disgusting way they lived and their passive aggression and judgment towards me. They were the most passive aggressive shits I’ve ver met. 
- This year I live in a really nice updated 3b apartment that is randomly matched with roommates 
- One roommate, who seems fantastic, is coming from Europe and will not be here until about a month after class has stared. 
- The other girl will not be living with us and has been unsuccessful at trying to sublease her spot until two days ago
- This means I have been living in the apartment for three weeks alone
- I am a very clean person — think of the cleanest person you know, I can bet you I’m cleaner. You can swipe your finger over any surface in my apartment at any time and it will come back without a spec. I also like to keep my spaces pristine. Everything needs to be organized, straightened out, and put away. I do not leave things lying out that are not there for decorative purposes. I don’t expect roommates to keep the place absolutely perfect at all times and not even I can keep my places that perfect when I’m living in it. Life happens and when you’re living in a space there’s no way you can have it absolutely perfect at every moment, but if shit isn’t perfect the minute I get home, I clean the place until it is. 

You’re probably beginning the think the same thing I’ve been coming the realize he last few years. I think I might be OCD. Being clean is really important and everyone has their standards but this situation I’m in now is really starting to make me realize this. 
The new roommate the other girl found to fill her spot just moved in today. I let her know where to put some things and then headed out because being in the place while she was unpacking made me really anxious. The news that she was moving in was enough to send me into a full blown pan tic attack to being with because it was totally sprung on me without any prior knowledge or dialogue in the slightest. I felt like my space and way of life was being threatened.
Fast forward to tonight, I came home to grab a few things and head back out to my boyfriends because I was really shaken up about the whole day and needed to be away. 
She was all unpacked and moved in when I got there which is great. She wasn’t home so I decided to look around and inspect the place so see where she had put things (in communal areas) 
Like I said before, I keep my place pristine and I do not leave things out anywhere. 
Well.
She decided she needed her own personal shoe rack right as you walk in the door. You nearly hit it with the front door when you come in. It’s like a two foot tall thing that is completely full of just her own shoes. We have a front closet that I use for my shoes and I cleaned it out for her to put her stuff in there. I even told her that I had bought a shoe rack and was waiting for it to arrive and more or less told her to put that in her room but she’s still left it out. We have ample space under the sink in the bathroom and in cupboard in the kitchen but she decided she HAD to keep a whole bunch of stuff out on the counter. The counter in the bathroom is now completely covered with her stuff in addition to more of her stuff under the sink, she has a bag of potatoes in the middle of the kitchen and is keeping her silverware and cooking utensils in a little bi n in the corner of the counter. 
I know this shouldn’t be much of a problem. I know this. But it’s consuming my thoughts. This was two hours ago and I cannot think about anything else. I’m supposed to be drunk and having a good time right now but I’m tapping my leg and staring off into space obsessing over her stuff on the counter and how awful it’s going to be and how upset and anxious I’m going to feel if I  it stays there. 
I don’t know what to do.
I know this is silly,and she’s a really clean and neat person too, but for all intents and purposes, this is my apartment that she’s moved in to as I’ve had three weeks to make this my own personal space. I’m well aware that I cannot claim the whole place as my own since it is not, but it’s making me ITCH just thinking about her stuff being everywhere, all over my apartment. 
I know this is something I need to work out within my self to an extent, but at the same time I don’t even want to go home because walking around seeing her stuff out there makes me feel like I’m going to implode. I want to take to her about it so badly because I’m really not asking too much to have her keep her stuff just put away where it’s not being left out, but I don’t want to give her this laundry list of things and make me feel uncomfortable/unwelcome and imposing in her (now) own home. 
How do I make this better?

176," 

arch-conservative christian household here. i'm 24 years old and living with my parents because i can't afford to live on my own. in the privacy of my own room i crossdress. i always lock my room. recently she's been trying to get into my room way more than usual, which is really suspicious. she's entered it a few times while i wasnt home with the spare key under other pretexts, but she'll knock at my door and remand to see me for the smallest things at least three times a day.

she definitely suspects something, and i think today she found out what it was. she saw a strap under my shirt, i said it was a back brace kinda muffled, and ran off. she asked me if my back hurt, i said yes. she may have heard ""my back hurts"" in response to her question, and maybe i can play it off as i said my back hurts, and later say that it was a headphone cord under my shirt. she came in about 10 minutes later and i had put on a black shirt under my blue one that wasnt there before in a panic, but she didnt say anything and hopefully she didnt notice but if she already saw the strap then she'll obviously be looking at my clothes so she probably did see that i had two shirts on, for whatever reason, in this hellish heat. then i took the shirt off and thought about it for a little bit, and put a headphone cord through my shirt on the side of the shirt that she saw the strap, and laid down on my bed doing homework with the cord just visible eniough that if she was looking for it she would find it. but if she's at all smart then she'll know that i had plenty of time to take it off and prepare for her, so she'll see through my ploy, and now that i've tried two obvious things already, that will only confirm her suspicions. plus i don't even wear headphones inside my shirt, she'll know that's something new. it was a pretty thick and obvious strap and i grabbed a random shirt off the ground and it happened to be one of the few ones with a wide neck.

i'm thinking of making some kind of makeshift back brace and claiming stupidity, but she's probably too smart for that. i can't afford to buy a back brace at walmart as i legit have less than a dollar on my account, and my school financial aid will only come sometime next week, or even beyond. even if i did have the money it would show up on my account as a purchase and she'd know i bought something. i might have to steal it. i wouldnt know how to go about doing that but if its my last resort i'll do it. it's late right now so she probably went to sleep or is getting ready to, and i'm going to stay quiet here and if she sneaks a peek into my room i'll just pretend to be sleeping so that she can't question me further, then tomorrow i'll go to church extra early and steal the back brace and come back home wearing it, making sure to leave part of the brace exposed on my neck.

this is very time sensitive and i need an alternative plan to get out of this mess. coming out right now is absolutely not an option as i'd probably lose everything and be kicked out onto the streets. i dont even have my own car, just a beater with my parents insurance on it.

im having a panic attack right now and i dont think i will be able to sleep this feels awful, i need a plan please help

We got inside and stood by the stairs with our backs against them to watch the band for a minute. Meanwhile, a guy came down those stairs and put his both hands on my sister’ shoulders massaging them. I immediately reacted and grabbed my sister but it took him a few more seconds to take his hands off my sister. He looked intoxicated.

183,"Last night, I went to my good friends house (we’re both F18) and her little sister and her sisters friend (both F13) were there also.
I showed up with my new apple earphones ($55 AUD) that I just got with my new iPhone XR. 

When I entered the house, I placed them on the kitchen bench and my friend and I went about our night, just doing stuff.
As I was leaving later that night, I noticed I couldn’t find my earphones anywhere and searched the entire house and couldn’t find them. We asked the younger girls if they had seen them and they both said no.

I left with the promise that my friend would search her house for them the next day.
Today, my friend says she spotted my earphones in her little sisters room with her sisters friends things (I’m going to call her sisters friend SF). I know they’re mine because she only has an iPhone 5 and those earphones are brand new. Her older brother (M18) only owns an iPhone 6s as well so they’re not his. My friends parents weren’t home either so neither of them could have taken it.

SF has now left with the earphones after being very quiet when my friend asked the pair if they were their earphones. I’m positive they’re mine as there’s no where else they could have gone.

Now, SF goes to my school and so does her brother - he’s in my year and some of my classes. I’m not sure what to do or how to get them back because I don’t want to buy another brand new pair and just let this kid get away with taking my earphones. Should I confront her at school?

185,"Upon returning to my therapist for the first time since I was an adolescent, my therapist had me take a test to calculate some possible/highly probable personality problems. I answered the test with 100% honesty. When he and I went through the results, he explained them in a way that i would understand. What he described fot me perfectly.

He told me that, according to my test results, I have an anger problem (among other things but this is what we're focusing on). He basically said that I am introvert, I hide inside my shell, but I will occasionally have a sudden burst of anger before quickly retreating back to my shell. And he was right. Upon giving it more thought, I realized that it's true... And I never realized it before.

I feel like I just met another person inside me and I really don't like that person. This trigger-happy person that could be unpredictable and has a rage burning inside them that slowly builds up until it finally bursts, then goes back to normal like nothing happened. I hate it. And because I never really realized it, I have never given thiught on how to control it, so this is an almost completely uncontrolled part of myself I just discovered. 

I am a person that takes a lot of time to reflect on myself, over think about myself, and works to have some sense of control over my extremes in personality. I suffer from really bad depression and even worse anxiety, I always have and I have learned to function the best I can with these, and though it doesn't always work or even work most of the time, it's still something that I have realized, pointed out, and tried to work on. The anger went almost completely unnoticed because the depression and anxiety were/are more of a constant thing while the anger would be a random popup that I didn't give much thought to after the fact.

I know my therapist will work with me in the future and teach me tools to use when I feel a burst of anger coming on. But that's a little far down the road, we are still working on tools for my anxiety and this will be a long process. The past few weeks, though, I have started to notice a huge spike in anxiety whenever I start to feel angry and the anxiety gets so bad that it causes a physical reaction. I can't stop it. Whenever I get angry, I start trembling and sometimes a body part twitches or my head jerks or some other weird physical and noticable reaction.

I am a cashier and I have to see and interact with hundreds of people a day. These people as well as my coworkers very obviously notice my weird body movements and treat me differently because of it. Everybody thinks I'm weird and my customers talk to and treat me like I'm on drugs. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm tweaking whenever I'm in public which is nearly every day because of work. I don't go back to therapy for another week but this problem has gotten so extreme in the past 3 days that I feel like I need immediate help. Please give me advice on how to stop myself from easily getting angry, stop the anger from triggering an anxiety response, and stop the anxiety triggering physical reactions. It's honestly so embarrassing.",08Sep2019,1

195,"If you don’t know you are supposed to convert your factored form to general in order to use (socialize correctly) the quadratic formula, you are left stuck at the factored form and don’t know what the next step is or will use the wrong formula (which results in bad communication). That’s socializing for me.

If someone asks me how am I or they hope I have a good weekend, it confuses me. I memorized responses like “Good. How are you?” Or “Thank you. I hope you have a good weekend too.” With people who are closer to me or acquaintances getting to know the real me, I ask them “Why” to nearly everything. Like “Why are you asking me how I am?” It confuses me truly and I don’t want to pretend around people I like a lot.

I am pretty sure I am more “rigid” than other teenagers. I hate unexpected changes, am very picky with food and have meltdowns as a result with new restaurants, get angry over anything under a B+, need to know what is for dinner in the morning, side conversations while the teacher is speaking, etc.. People call me the teacher’s pet, smart (I am not), rigid, uptight, rule follower, and not taking risks at all. Rules and memorization are how I socialize and when there is an unwritten rule I get confused and anxious. I memorized conventional expressions and understand most, but most of the time I instinctively react and take it literally before remembering what it actually means.

I want to socialize yet don’t. I am more at ease texting someone IRL than meeting them in person. The effort in looking at their eyes sometimes, worrying about misinterpreting their facial expressions, and not understanding things like jokes or sarcasm make texting easier since they may use an emoji to hint something.

I have labels and a point system where I reward points for good behavior and vice versa. People say I shouldn’t categorize and I am not sure how not to.

Example: I took it as a compliment when a guy said if no girls were available to take for prom, he would go with me. I told my two school close acquaintances (I have a criteria for friend) and they told me he was being a jerk and they were going to kick his ass. I didn’t understand and still saw it as a compliment.

199,"Hey y’all. High school senior here. About a year and a half ago I met some guys at school slowly became friends with them. Fast forward a few months and I’m a regular dude in the friend group. Except I wasn’t. I sat with them at lunch and the few who were in my classes I sat with, but outside of school I didn’t see them. I was fine with that at the time, as I’ve never really had friends growing up and it was still early on in our friendships. Certainly there would be growth, I thought. Eventually I got invited to go out for a meal and to watch a movie, which, of course, I jumped at. I had a blast. These guys were the nicest guys I’d ever met. There were a few instances afterwards where a few of us would hang out, typically at the beach, but most of out interaction was at school or through video games. Now it’s theis past April. Finally, I’d been asked to go to a party. A real party! I was unbelievably excited. I showed up and met my boys there. We drank, we danced and we all had a blast. It was amazing. The host, who was a girl I’d been talking on and off to since I met her around Christmas time offered me some of her vegan cupcakes. I decided to try one and I was hooked. They were absolutely delicious. As I was chowing down and sipping my beverage, another girl, whom I’d seen before in my history class but never talked to, approached the counter I was at and also tried a cupcake. We started chatting and the conversation developed into getting to know each other. I loved talking to her. I felt a very good connection. For the remainder of this story I will refer to her as Water. The partying continued. Eventually, just about every party my group of friends was at, I was too. Then there was the bush party. My entire grade would be there. I showed up fairly late, and while most were beginning to settle down or pass out, I started to drink. Up until that point I had never been that intoxicated. I didn’t do anything to embarrassing, except cut my pinky and accidentally smear blood on my friends license plate. The bush party was a great time aswell. I talked to Water a fair amount. Things were good. By this time we were well into the second semester and all of our non-linear classes had changed. I now had a new class with Water. Eventually I started talking to via Instagram dms and we got a long fairly well. Some days we would skip class and go to the beach. And those days were the happiest days of my life. Never before had I gotten along so well with someone. The school year concluded with an even larger bush party. Not only would it involve my grade, but also the graduating class above us. Nothing too crazy happened, I mostly chilled with my boys and Water. I also met her two closest friends. We (Myself and Water) both passed out in the back of someone’s car. There’s a pretty cute picture of the two of us sleeping. At this point I started to develop feelings for her, which was a new feeling for me. I’d never been romantically interested in anybody before. At this point in time, things were going good. I felt close with a good portion of my friends, things seemed to be trucking along fine with Water, I’d been working out and the results made me so proud. I’ve been skinny for most of my life, so packing on muscle and having a decently defined chest made me very happy. Summer came my closest friend who I will refer to as Gas decided to throw a party. Water was not able to attend, as she was out of town. That bummed me out quite a bit honestly. It felt like it had been awhile since I had last spent time with her. So I’m there at the party, feeling kinda bummed and the party just ain’t all that great. I wasn’t having fun, not even because Water wasn’t there. I got very drunk and ended up saying some things about killing myself. Gas and another boy had to calm me down. The next day I was super embarrassed about what had happened. I still am. I feel like I ruined that night for those two guys, and now the rest of my friends were bound to find out. That day after Gas’ party was another one. We all went there and it blew. Nobody really had a good time. A week passes and another party happens. By this point I find out from Gas that the rest of the boys don’t want to invite me to party anymore because not only my suicidal talking at Gas’ party, but also saying that I was a downer at the second party. While the first point I couldn’t argue with, the second one felt like bullshit. This party I go to with Gas and the boy who had helped him me down. We didn’t know anybody there, but still had a pretty good time. We ended up going to Water’s house after the party and chilling there that night. A few days later, I find out from Gas that again, the rest of the boys are upset with me and chose to not invite me to go camping with them. This upset Gas and he stood up for me in a separate group chat that had been created without either of us. At this point I had lost most trust for most of the guys, except Gas and two others. I tried to keep making plans with Water, but something always came up. The best I was able to settle for was a facetime call every few days. Another bummer. I was really hoping to spend more time with her this summer. Regardless, partyin keeps happening nothing changes that much. Now I’ve told some people about my feelings for Water and the conclusion is that I should just tell her how I feel. At a party I tried to get her to come outside and talk for a little and she said that she didn’t want to leave her friends. I was okay with that. Now school is coming around. The night before the first day back is another bush party. Not many people show up, understandably. But Water is there. Finally, my opportunity to tell her. First time I try, I invite her to come get some chips from the car. A few people follow. No go on the telling. Second try, I tell her to come shotgun a beer with me. After we’re done, I tell her. She says she doesn’t want a relationship due to last year of high school, job stuff etc. We arrive at the shared sentiment that we’d both like to remain friends and that was that. I went and shed a few tears in the car, then fell asleep for awhile. I woke up and a few of my friends were also in there. Well I started downing the whiskey like it was water on a hot day and ended up outside the car. I chilled for a little bit before wandering into the forest. I began to feel real shitty. Not just about Water, but also the state of me within my friend group and some family things. My friend who had helped Gas previously came and told me to come back to the party. I said I’d rather just disappear into the forest and die. I felt real shitty and just kept repeating that I want to die in the forest. He stuck woth me though and I’ll never forget that he did. We walked back to the fire and fell asleep. Now it’s been a week at school. I have no friends in any of my classes, which not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly disappointing. It seems like Water avoids me. My snapchats are either left on read or met with a blank picture of her face which stinks because I’d still like to have conversations with her. The few times I’ve spotted her at school she hasn’t acknowledged me. Gas found out about my second little suicidal rant and says I shouldn’t party with the guys anymore. I feel so disappointed in myself. If I’d never have told Water, we’d still have a close friendship. I had promised Gas, myself and in a non verbal manner, the rest of my friends that I’d never get sad, suicidal drunk again. But here I am. Writing about how I went and fucked it up again. I don’t really know what to do. I want to reach out to someone I know, but I feel like my complaining will just reflect even more negatively on me. I feel so bad for what I’ve done. I feel that my friends no longer want me to be associated with them, that Water is creeped out by me wanting to talk to her, that I just don’t have a clue how to move forward. I feel like I have really fucked up my only friendships. I’m not some suicidal, depressed teen. I was just sad. And now that this all has happened, I’m feeling kind of anxious. I’ve never felt this emotional in my life. I’m sorry this is so long, but if you’ve read to this point I’d really appreciate some advice.",08Sep2019,0
200,"I met this guy and we started talking and got along really well. I swear I wasn't out patrolling the playground, I was at the fair and met this guy there and started talking. I thought he was 18 or 19 and my friend thought he was 25. A few days later, I find out he's two years younger than me. Would it be wrong for me to date him? He seems like a really nice guy and we have a lot in common. He knew that I was older l, because I was talking about taking my senior pictures. When I found out my age, he was sad that I said that we shouldn't date, so it's not one-sided.

204,"Okay, so this literally just happened, my hands are shaking as I type this, and I feel confused, angry, stupid, and guilty at the same time. So my friend (who we'll call S), came over to my house (he just left) and we hung out for a bit. Eventually he asks to borrow my phone. Being the overly generous person I am, I lend it to him. BIG MISTAKE. I notice him opening Snapchat and ask what he's doing. He tells me he's going to troll one of his friends (F), who is also friends with his girlfriend (GF) who hates my guts for some reason (remember that, it's going to be useful later). I stupidly let him continue thinking that what he's about to do is harmless. He also said that he'd reveal himself in the end. Regardless of all that, it all goes bad. He adds F and starts greeting her like she knew who I was. Needless to say, she was confused and weirded out. Eventually she started to get mad and ask how I got her account. I tell S that now is a good time to end all this. He doesn't listen. Eventually F texts GF and starts asking why some random dude is texting her. GF notices it's my account and starts texting S about why I'm texting F. Now you see, had S revealed himself at this point, things wouldn't have escalated to what they'd be later. However, S then proceeds to throw me under the bus saying that he didn't know how I got her snap code. At this point F is threatening to start drama and get someone to fight me. Now I get angry realizing what S just got me into and I try and convince him to say it was him doing all the texting, but he makes a big deal out of it saying that GF will chew him out. F still keeps on asking how I got her snap code and S still keeps on throwing me under the bus to save himself. Eventually he says that he might know a way to save the two of us and starts making some excuse of how I needed more followers so he gave me F's code thinking that it would work. It just made F even more mad at S that he would give his friends' snap codes away without their consent and lie to GF. So things backfired on S, and F just ignores me the rest f the time. GF then starts angrily texting S. I don't know what GF said exactly, but now GF and F are mad at me and S, F is still threatening to start drama, and GF might also break up with S. What could have been a harmless thing turned into chaos because S took things too far. Now I don't know what to do. I feel confused as to what will happen next. I feel angry at S and myself for letting S borrow my phone and starting all this. I feel stupid for letting S borrow my phone in the first place, and guilty for letting S ruin his relationship with GF. I have never been in this kind of a situation, and I don't know what to do about S or GF and F, so I'll leave it to you guys. Reddit, what do I do?",08Sep2019,1

207,"Basically what the title says. 

My moms having a baby in a few months, and got pregnant just because she wanted me to have a sibling I “can play with”. However, she also said that she’d never love anything more than me, and that basically told me that she would be more neglectful to my younger sibling. 

I don’t want my sibling to grow up with a selfish shithead for a mom that loves their older kid more than them, however if I tried and convinced her to take care of my sibling like a parent, this would still damage my sibling as my mom loves me more than them.

However, I also don’t want to screw the kid up because I’m a dumb teenager that makes alot of mistakes, and I am unsure if I can raise a child.

211,"(Throwaway Account)

Okay so some context. I'm 17 years old and in high school. My parents and my sister don't have a great relationship as of recently so because of that I've kind of had to step up and become the parent of everyone in the house. I've become the person everyone rants to, the person who has an influence in most decisions and the person who tries to calm fights (usually). The reason its become like this stems from a lot of stuff but I think its reached a point of horribleness as of recently because of my sister and her university admissions. My sister is doing nursing and is going to a local university that is one of the best in the country. This has been really horrible for my sister as when she first got all her acceptance letters, she didn't get one from this local university. Our whole family was kind of sad because of the news as she had to move away and it would be much harder. But in the midst of our prayers, she received a late offer for the local uni. We were all ecstatic besides my sister. See, what happened was that by this time she had already accepted moving away and from some online research and some comments from friends, she had realized that this was actually an amazing thing. So when that letter came she was felt that her university experience had been robbed while the rest of us were happy. That night when she got the letter my mom made her accept the offer immediately even though my sister quietly whispered how she felt she wanted to think about her decision still. My mom's persistence overthrew her doubts and she accepted the offer. Since that day everything has been horrible for the whole family. All my sister's friends never got an offer from this local uni so they all left to live far away while my sister has felt stuck here. But I feel like her staying here is actually a good thing. I feel like this because 1. I think shes very immature and would struggle to live by herself (but what can I say, I'm younger and it's not really my call to say whose mature and who isn't so kinda ignore this), 2. This is a better university, 3. My parents have recently gone into a new business venture and have been struggle with money currently 4. My brother has cerebral palsy and is basically a child. Okay so some more context for that last point, growing up (ages 10-16) my sister took care of my brother when my parents went to work. I was stupid and naive so I didn't pitch in to help much but I started to around age 15. Right now, I'd say I take care of him the most out of everyone in the family and try to be his main caretaker. The reason I think my sister should still stay here is that without her or anyone else helping to take care of him, when something pops up where I have to go somewhere and my parents are at work then it would very hard to find a caretaker for him (I used to be the caretaker in these situations when we growing up and my sister had to go places). 

Okay so what's happening now. My sister has been really quiet and seems very sad about staying here. Her friends who moved away tell her how they love it in the big city and living by themselves which makes my sister feel like her life has been ruined. When she tries to explain this to my parents, they yell back at her that this is one of the best universities in the country and how moving away is dangerous and how they need her to help here. My sister basically says how she doesn't want to take care of my brother a lot anymore that  she wants to live her own life in the big city. I try to mediate the fights but often side with my parents because I think that her switching universities at this point just because she wants an authentic university experience is stupid. I know most people are gonna think I am an asshole but its just how I feel. Today I've tried to calm the storm. after a huge argument about what's happening my parents and sister both stop talking to each other. I explain to my parents that her feeling are valid and moving away is an important part of growing up. I also try and explain how she needs to think about the financial risks they'd be taking and how'd her staying here is very helpful for the family. After we had this conversation, my mom went back to my sister and told her that she understands and spoke in a loving tone. She told her that she can transfer universities if she'd like after this semester but she should think long and hard about it. I was really confused when my mom said this but right after when we left her room my mom explained that shes not being serious and thinks that saying this will help her calm down for at least this semester and after my she thinks over the risks my parents are taking, she'll feel bad and just stay at this uni. I don't really think that'll happen. I really don't know what to do now. If we let her go then she will be going to a worst uni and we'd be in financial trouble. But if we make her stay then we stress her out and make her feel like shes lost out on her life. BTW we've talked about her moving out and paying her own bills but the rent cost is very high so we're not sure if she'd be able to do this by herself.",08Sep2019,1

219,"I’ve dated girl (I’m going to call her Angie) for 2 1/2 yrs if I’m right. We loved each other very much. We lost our V-cards to each other and have had a lot of fun moments when we used to date. We are VERY close friends though. Sometimes I feel a little spark between us again. But after we broke up , a few months later she dated a guy for about 3 months and THE DAY THEY BROKE UP, she tells me to come over because she needs somebody. We end up having sex for about 5 hours (Yes we took breaks in between) I thought it was weird and guilty but it felt good because I knew I was somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be after having to lie to my parents of my location. Me and Angie had a great time that day. So i become a monthly dick appointment. Throughout summer break, we go out sometimes like to Valleyfair, swimming pools, and movies. I get mixed signals from her like when we walk around, she stays close to me and hangs on to me as we walk like as if we were a couple.

So fast forward and she’s been giving me this mixed signal feeling still to this day. We always end sleeping on the phone together at night every day basically. So this year she met a guy , I’ll call him, Aden. So she met Aden after one of her other not so close friend tells her to meet them at the park right next to her house. She goes and meets Aden there and they start talking. (Im at home which is about 20 mins away from hers) She comes back home calling me and telling me all about this Aden dude and how he’s been through a lot. There’s a lot of backstory to our relationship like how every where we go people think we are still a couple which is conflicting with my head because lowkey, I still want to be a couple but I know she will say no, anyways. So these oat couple of days she’s been talking to this Aden guy more often than me (mind you i am a little bit of a jealous type) . I start to notice she lies about going somewhere when we are on call but she hangs up to call him instead. I dont know what to do. Sometimes she’ll facetime me and we’ll talk about these freaky sexual things and sometimes she’ll tell me to look and she’s in some sexy clothing or just showing her body to me. Then some days she’s dry texting and not really responding to my calls/texts. But whenever we call, she’s always talking about wanting “dick” and I dont know what to do. I still love this person very much but the mixed signals is getting a little too much for me.",08Sep2019,1

221,"Hey Reddit, this is the most personal I've ever been with complete strangers so i'm using a throwaway.

(Post note: I'm not trying to sound like an edgy teen, I'm being completely serious.)

Ever since I can remember my feeling of empathy has been kind of twisted. I'd see my friends fall and get hurt and I'd act concerned, but inside I felt nothing.  (I'm starting to think I have some sort of psychological condition that has gone undetected.) Even as an early teen I'd never crush on anyone or be attracted in the slightest. I spent a long time wondering what was wrong with me. I met this really nice girl playing video games and we bonded over similar interest. There was one situation where she attempted suicide/self harm and I'd felt scared like I never had for anyone before. I brushed it off. Year 1 1/2 of knowing her, Valentine's comes along and I came home content with stuffing my face full of chocolate. I was doing my daily rounds and talking with our mutuals and I learned that she had gotten together with a guy. This broke me and I realized I liked her. I cried about someone for the first time that day.

We got along really well and totally hit it off even around year 2 of knowing each other. But everything is different now. She got involved with some other people and through them she's totally changed. She'll take forever to message me back but I'll get server notifications from her constantly (not to me) and all she does all day is talk to them. I used to help her and always encourage her and always shield her from anyone I needed to. They've indirectly changed her completely into someone I don't know anymore and it fucking hurts me horribly. We went from messaging every hour to every two weeks.

223,"Hi first time poster and just like the title says I love someone who I shouldn’t love.

I always wondered why people cheated on other people like why not tell them you don’t want to be with them but now I get it why they did it. Im not saying I’ve cheated but I was pushed to the point where I wanted to because of the way he treated me and accused me of stuff. My ex and first boyfriend I ever had accused me of cheating every week if I ever hung out with my friends or if I went somewhere so I mainly just stayed home and played my Xbox but even still he thought I was elsewhere. I just dealt with it because when I was little I was bullied and called ugly and was laughed at and I felt like no one else would ever want me if We broke up but that was just because Of my self esteem. I’m not saying he called me ugly or anything he called me beautiful and he saw me whenever he could and loved me but his accusations and how he got mad easily bothered me. We had almost been together for a year until an argument that happened about a month or two ago. He called me things before but I never paid attention to them because I never did anything of that so I didn’t care but when he called me a waste of time it really struck my heart and made me lose feelings for him right there, I tried to love him again but i couldn’t do it it just made it worse. Eventually we did break up but he started yelling and saying it was my fault. We are friends right now but he keeps trying to get back together and saying stuff like I miss you and I love you but it just reminds me of what he said to me and I start to cry. I don’t know if I should give him another chance and try to see if I can love him again or not? I don’t know what to do.",08Sep2019,1

229,"So i have this small group of friends. Really just me, my cousin and our friend justin. A lot of times i feel as if im more of a friend of the group rather than actually being part of the group.   


Small things bother me that shouldnt. Bigger things, like canceling plans or missing a birthday, dont bother me. Hey, life happens. But small things REALLY dig into me.  


For example: We recently decided to watch the hobbit and the LOTR movies in order online. Some responsibilities came up and i had to miss out on the second hobbit movie. I let them know id watch it tomorrow and we could be back on track. Well come tomorrow, they dont want to wait for me and just continue watching. its pretty much impossible for me to have the time to catch up without them stopping.  


This drives me nuts. Is it really impossible to just wait a day so that i can watch with the group? Can i get shown a little loyalty? it seems petty, i know. But all i ask for is small loyalties. Even considerations, whatever. Just act like you care as a friend a little bit.  


Just typing this out i know it sounds like its a lot more deep seated issue. Maybe it is, i dont know. What do you guys think?",08Sep2019,1
230,"Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my post. A few years ago I had been talking with a female friend, we were both young teenagers and were playing around with our sexuality. A few times she pressured me into sending dick pics and I did. She would make jokes about sending them to her friends and it was very hard to get her to delete them off her phone. 

Anyway, we did a little dirty talk and played around with the idea of having sex if we saw met up (she lived an hour or two away.) After a couple years of talking I came over to her house and she started to grope me but I wasn’t into it. I told her to stop and she told me to stop being a baby and let her suck my dick. I would leave the room and try to play it off but she’d follow me and would keep on grabbing my dick and laugh as if it was a joke and would get annoyed when I said no as if I was overreacting. 

We spent the day together at an amusement park and the whole evening she was groping me. I got used to it but would continue to tell her to stop and not now or not here. 

Eventually by the end of the night she grabbed my dick in the back of her car and I liked it. This was the first time all day that I was genuinely considering it. But then I got dropped off and after that we fell out of touch. 

The experience made me feel dirty and used but I feel hesitant saying I was sexually assaulted and even guilty because I ended up liking it and I feel like I led her on by joking about having sex when I came over.
Was it sexual assault if I ended up enjoying it? When she initially groped me I was attracted to the idea of sex but not with her and not then.

231,"I am gay in Bulgaria. I am 24. I hate the person I am becoming- a bitter and angry person.
I just hate it when I look at other people's lives and see they have things I dream about but probably will never have .I envy girls. They get to be with handsome guys, guys do all the work, like they are the ones that engage the relations in most cases. Girls always get guy attention and a lot of it.


All of my friends had their normal life experiences when they were in highschool- their first kiss, first relationship, flirts, everything. I got none of that. Up to this day. Most of my friends are settling down, have long term relationships, some have kids and I am probably never going to although I really want to. 


I have missed SO MANY life experiences and I am missing even more every single day. I am probably gonna end up all alone. And why? Because I am gay. I feel so sad, so pathetic, I wish my life could start again, I wish I could bring back the time and make my country less homophobic so gay guys would have the chance to be happy. Some gay guys manage even now but I am not one of them. I really hate how I feel. The pain is unreal.",08Sep2019,0
233,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for a few years, and maybe this is part of that, but I don’t know. Here’s the deal: I can’t calm down. With a “normal” person, it seems like the progression is:

•bad thing happens
•they process it for a while
•the brick in their stomach melts
•they move on with their lives

With me, it’s more like: 

•bad thing happens
•I process it for a while
•I don’t sleep (even when taking two doses of sleeping pills instead of one)
•I don’t eat (or I vomit up every time I try to eat)
•I struggle to breathe
•My heart beats too fast
•I can’t focus
•And my body (somehow) sustains this for several weeks or even up to a month and a half at a time
•I shake like a leaf
•my voice breaks 

It’s like having a panic attack that doesn’t end for 53 days. I’ve lost jobs because of it, I’ve had to drop out of classes because of it, I’ve tried to end my life because of it. Because it’s fucking exhausting to get virtually zero sleep for weeks on end. It’s exhausting to lose weight (or gain it because my body entered starvation mode). It’s exhausting to feel like I’m fighting for every single breath over a trigger I know in my heart was not worth it. 

But I CAN’T calm down. My psychiatrist and I have tried several medicinal cocktails, but virtually nothing seems to touch it or stop the all-consuming rush of adrenaline. When I get this way, it’s like my whole existence becomes fight-or-flight for weeks on end. It’s horrible how it just keeps going and going. We’re running out of treatment options, and I’m scared. 

Normally, I’m stable. I did several years of therapy and really lessened a lot of my day-to-day symptoms. So, 95% of the time, this is not even an issue. But when it is, I don’t know what to do. None of the medications I have even take the edge off. And yes, I am afraid it is going to kill me.

I was born with a mild heart defect. One of the valves isn’t shaped quite right or something to that effect (sorry, I don’t know the actual medical terminology, I just remember it being a worry when I was growing up). And these prolonged panic attacks keep putting heavy strain on my heart. The damn thing beats like a hammer for days on end—all day, all night. And I fear I may someday have a heart attack from it.

I don’t know what to do, but I do know I can’t keep living like this.",08Sep2019,1

My first day (and only day) at therapy was fine. I made sure to not tell her anything personal about me because I can’t trust her enough. I was starting to feel like opening up until I heard her say: “if you feel like you want to hurt yourself or anyone else, then I would have to tell your parents.” 

Those words made me lose all interest in wanting her to talk with me. 

I do admit, I have a problem, and I’m not suicidal. I don’t want her to tell my parents about any of my habits because I still have things in life I want to do before they try to change it. 

I really do know that there is something wrong with my thinking process. I know that if I don’t talk to someone then I might end up hurting someone else more than I usually do. But, I can’t bring myself to tell my therapist anything. I don’t know if it’s because I don’t like her, or because she’s too old to understand. I really don’t know.

240,"To start off, my story is quit unique (at least I think so) as guilt makes me crumble. I’m almost sure I’m gay, possible bisexual though. I am 15 and a boy and I’m very scared of coming out as gay to my family. My dad uses the word “fag” sometimes to describe people he doesn’t like. More importantly though, when I was maybe 12 or 13 I watched gay porn out of curiosity and felt so guilty I told my mom. This wasn’t the first incident where I watched gay poem/porn in general and told my mom about it. So anyways we start talking about why I was doing it and at one point she asks “do you like boys?” And when I said “I don’t know I think I like both” she said “really?! You would want a boyfriend?!!” In a concerned and disgusted way. I don’t remember what I said or what happened after that, but I do remember crying in my pillow that night. I’m almost sure they know that I’m gay/bi but they have some sort of reality where they deny it. They are always asking me if I talk to any girls or if there’s any girl I like, and I always lie or tell them I like somebody I guess I’m attracted to.

Although this might take a slight turn from what you where just reading growing up I was abandoned by my whole fathers side, I was thrown on to the streets with my mom who was a immigrant w no High school diploma. As I grew up I was challenged in many areas, my mom herself tried to **abandon** me by leaving me in a foreign country too which I was beaten for months and starved eventually I was deported. My mom reluctant to take me back was forced by her family thus I started off life at a significant disadvantage, Enter High School and I didnt know anything, somehow I got through it by cheating through it all.  


Now I am a 20 yr old with no knowledge in life, no friends, no car, no drivers licence,no job, no prior experience, still have my V card in my wallet; fat and depressed af.  I have no idea what to do from here, its like I have been living life on autopilot only to wake up and see a wall iron clad and as far as I can see. It is so god damn hard to find a job with no prior experience, and its even worse when I know am living off my mothers very minor income. I just want to get out and live life (whatever that is).

This was a stupid fear progression as well!
Flu shot in like grade 2, I felt nothing, it wasn't bad. 
Got through my grade 6 shots no problem.
Grade 7, the nurses had to play with my ego to get me to get the shots, and I needed 2 teeth pulled, too which I had to see a different dentist who used drugs to calm me down after my normal dentist refused to give me the shot while I was screaming and crying.
Grade 8 shots, bailed on them and procrastinated getting them until last year, aka second year of college. 
Two months ago, bailed on dye injection for an MRI because they'd have to inject in the same area where they draw blood, and I wasn't prepared for that location. Risked having to redo it by not getting the dye as well!
Possible future, wisdom teeth getting pulled, cavity needs filling, and if I get accepted to be an exchange student, I'm gonna need shots. 

I'm not anti vax, nor was I raised by anti vax people, but the phobia stemmed from nothing! I don't even have my ears pierced, nor do I ever want them pierced. It's not even the needle that scares me, it's the permanent holes in my flesh. My mom ALWAYS says you can't feel it and makes me feel her pierced ears, and believe me, I CAN tell.

She also has no sympathy because of her own decision. She told me that she swore to herself that needles wouldn't scare her, so the fact that they're my biggest irrational phobia actually makes her mad to the point that she can't talk about it with me because I'm afraid of something she's so high and mighty about not being scared by them.

I tell her that I am willing to better myself, but she tells me that she doesn't want me to change myself. 
* Did she leave me because she met another man?  Do I have to believe her and see this as two separate things? 
* Is it wrong that she thought about ending the relationship during her holiday and when she came back, ended it completely without giving me the chance to fix the relationship? I really think she had to express her feelings to me when she didn't feel happy anymore, so I could be aware of it and make her happy or accept the fact that I was not able to make her happy and let her end the relationship. Ending the relationship immediately when we saw each other after her holiday feels like a slap in my face. I suspect that she has been influenced by that man and by the girlfriend with whom she went on holiday. When I ask her if she has been influenced by them, she denies it. 
* What am I supposed to do now? She wants to be friends, but I know that she is putting more and more interest in that other man and I feel very jealous about that. I feel betrayed by her and don't want a friend like that, but is it right to feel betrayed in this situation? I feel very helpless and powerless.",08Sep2019,3
259,"I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2 months, we’ve never met before however he is overseas on an internship for 6 months. (We are from the same city). 

When he gets drunk - he gets really drunk. So the other night he sent me this video of him drunkenly dancing with this girl whilst another girl is laughing behind the phone. He sent me this without context - I didn’t think anything of it. 

Two nights ago, he sent me a video of this girl in his apartment and captioned the video “this is your replacement”. Then proceeded to send videos of himself absolutely shit-faced. 

Why is he doing this??? What could be the most probable reason?",08Sep2019,1
260,"I’m living in an apartment on a college campus. There’s a balcony for every suite and my balcony is share with one other person- a guy who has a 4 month old pit bull/American bulldog mix.

Dog is sweet and kind and cute but a bit too chaotic at times. He has me babysit her every now and then while he’s away from his apartment. He’s out of his apartment a lot and most days the dog is alone for more than 12 hours and she’ll stand but the divider on the balcony and watch me and bark for me to pet her through the bars. 

Many times her nose has been dry. I’ve felt the difference. And she showed signs of being distressed and frustrated and anxious. I have had to give her bowls of water multiple times while the owner is gone. She always licks up the water desperately like a desert survivor. It’s sad. 

Every time I left to get more water she would bark at me to come back and I had to assure he I would return.

The dog also has not been fed for three days, going into four according to the owner. I have textual proof of him stating that he had no more dog food and he asked ME- a non-dog owner- if I had any dog food. He paid $10,000 for a dog that he won’t even care for. $10K.

The dog many times is chaotic and runs around like a maniac, bumping into things and trying to bite peoples feet. She doesn’t respond to anything and will become aggressive quickly. She doesn’t like to let go of objects and will lunge at you when you attempt to take them away from her. Discipline irritates her more. She has bitten me countless times. She bites a lot in general even lightly while your petting her as if she has ADHD. 

She stands still and stares a lot. Sniffs and investigates a lot- A LOT. I don’t know if this is normal for puppies... Some dog owner I know as friends have pointed that out so that’s why I mention it.

I’m wondering if I should take action and call...

TL;DR: In an apartment complex and neighbor’s dog has had dry nose and nothing to eat for days. Dog is constantly anxious and nervous and on edge and I’m concerned something is going on. I want to know if I should call 911 and report animal neglect...",08Sep2019,1
261,"(Crossposted from r/teenagers) 

My parents found messages I sent to a guy (who happens to be my best friend) before. Except this time they found my nudes too. How you may ask? My brother fucking opened my phone for them. I feel so fucking violated. My privacy, my body, and everhthing i have. Gone anf open. I dont need to show them or tell them everything. If they werent such helicopter parents, maybe i wouldnt have done such things. If they weren't abusive, I would've been more honest with them. They are Indian parents. Who are Hindu. From ISKON. Way too strict. 

I ran to the neighbors house and stayed there for a few hours. My parents demanded I come home. So now I'm home. My laptop is gone and so is my phone. Except, I found my old phone between my bed and my wall. I am so grateful I found it there. I thought they took it. I also found a stick on my bed. They were planning to beat me. Fun. They also removed the internet. Now, xfinity has these hotspots that you can pay for. I wrote down my credit card info a while ago(cosigned with a parent and they took the cards. It's to build my credit score). Using that, I bought internet for a day. 9 bucks. It's takes 2 days to process that to my bank account, so it's ok. For now. 

Anyways, this is the last time I bet I'll have internet connection and be able to talk to people. I don't know if I'll be able to talk to my best friend who I was able to get in contact with during this process. I love him to death. I love him so much I'll live for him.

I don't know what to do. I'm stuck in my room. My dad gets up and looks around if I go to the restroom. He thinks I'm trying to leave. I wish I can. I know it sounds weird for me to say this is the worst thing that could happen since peop e have gone through worse, but I have parents that makes my life hell. I hate it.",08Sep2019,3
263,"Throwaway due to my friends knowing my Reddit account

My friend, who I'll refer to as Z, is going through major ""college life crisis"". He is struggling to keep his grades up in college in an engineering program due to a lack of time since he has to work a large portion of the week in order to pay his bills, he moreover is completely ashamed of his body and his looks, has his father in the hospital scarred he's going to die, is depressed he hasn't met new people due to social anxiety, and to top it all off has feelings for a friend who lives hours away that doesn't like him. He has so much on his plate that he broke down on the way home from visiting that friend he likes a few hours away. He was crying the entire way home as I attempted to try to give advice and comfort him. He's extremely scared he's going to get kicked out of the engineering program, because if he does he vows to drop out of college and move back home. If that happenes he is also scared he won't know what to do without a college degree and he is worried he will disappoint his family. I want to help him, but he refuses to go to a counselor stating ""it doesn't work for me"". He refuses to study for calculus because last time it ""didn't work for him, he almost failed the class anyway"". I just want to help him, I already convinced him to tell the friend that he likes her so they could talk it out and he could attempt to move on. However, I'm not sure if that was good advice to give him so I am at a loss as to what to do for the rest of his problems. I already convinced him there are plenty of decent paying jobs that don't require degrees, but he's still worried about what he'll do outside of college. I can't help him financially either as I don't have a job and I am currently in the process of finding one. I just want to help him but I don't know what to do.

Every few weeks one of us is able takes off a few days off work to stay at other's home so we can together. 

It's working out ok but he lives in a tiny apt with his parents who don't seem to dislike me no matter how hard I try. They are highly educated, a little closed-minded and very difficult ppl.

He's really worried that this situation is becoming toxic will cause problems in our relationship due to the hell is parents give him over being with me. 

I am a serious introvert and very blunt. It takes a lot for me to start a conversation and they are like frozen fish sticks when we sit down for diner and one time I forgot to say thank you for dinner and they took it personally. I feel like they have unreasonable expectations of both me and my boyfriend and completely different definitions of pleasant, polite &amp; helpful.

So I recently just turned 19 years old and got my cat when I was around 11-12 years old, since then i’ve developed many problems such as asthma &amp; rashes. Many doctors didn’t know where these issues were coming from but long story short after many tests I was allergic to cats, dust, and roaches for some reason lmao. Sure the rashes and endless coughing nights were terrible but I didn’t really care, I still had him with me. I was given medication for my asthma and rashes and they seemed to help enough to the point where it’s bearable to actually breathe properly and not have many rashes. Years go on and I don’t really have any problems anymore until around the age of 17 I start having post nasal drip and nasal congestion, like I did with my asthma and rashes, I just try to ignore it and go on with my life. But this was probably the worse problem I’ve had and till this day I still do and just seems to be getting worse and worse. Everyday I wake up with my throat just filled with phlegm, my nose congested, and on top of that, dry mouth which according to my doctor are all caused because of my cat. I’m now in college, mornings are the worse for me as I spend an hour in the bathroom just clearing my nose and throat as much as possible before I head to class, of course I’m still always walking around with a good amount of congestion in my throat and nose which you can imagine lead to many other issues such as speaking etc. I recently went to sleep at my moms house for 2 days to see if the the symptoms go away (I live with my dad/cat, my parents got divorced when I was 13 or so) and to be fair the throat congestion was not as bad, the nose congestion and dry mouth were still bothering me though. I’m thinking about leaving my cat at my moms house and sleeping at my dads to see how it goes. If the symptoms seem to go away by doing so, do I have to get rid of my cat? Or what should I do

276,"I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. But even then, I have a lot to say, so please, bear with me.

When I was young, I was constantly pressured by my parents to have good grades. While I was an academically gifted student early on, I still experienced some fucked up stuff. My dad would compare me to other top students from our class and how x is better than me at x etc. My mom, on the other hand, used to be very hands-on with my studies and I would remember her getting mad at me when I got some stuff wrong. I like to think that these childhood experiences contributed to my feeling of ""never bring good enough"" that I continue to have up until this very day. My lack of self-esteem wasn't only limited to that stuff, however, as I was constantly teased with being such a small and skinny guy. So yeah, insecurity boxes are all checked.

Over the years, my parents' pressure on me became less and less apparent (don't get me wrong, it was still always there). At one point, I realized that most of the pressure that I was packing on came from myself, from my insecurities, from my upbringing. I constantly lived in fear of failing people's expectations so I always pushed myself way past my limit. My insecurities got so extreme that, I got scared/hated people who were superior than me in ways (richer, smarter, more charismatic, better looking). High school passed by and I turned into the monster that I am now.

Fast forward to the present, to college. My ambition was to be a pilot, but my parents couldn't afford that. My passion was in History and my skills lied in English, so I put Anthropology and Journalism as top course choices in the uni I was about to apply to. However, there were a lot of reasons why I demoted those courses in favor of Biology: 1) My parents were low-key pressuring me into med school by telling me how Anthropology wouldn't give me a secure job when I graduated, 2) I was a STEM graduate in HS so when I do take up Anthropology, I will be at a major disadvantage because almost all of my coursemates will be Humanities graduates, 3) I love writing but Journalism, where I have to write based on some topics where I know nothing about/am not interested in didn't quite stick with me.

So I took Biology and passed the top uni in my country. I remember praying to God, hoping that I don't pass Biology and end up with Anthropology instead. But yeah, I passed.

Last month, I started college, and going on what I felt will make this post so long so let me end this here. I got diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder. I got burnt out and lost all will and motivation to go to classes. I was having severe panic attacks daily to the point where I just wanted to die. I took a leave of absence for one semester because I sure as hell know that I wouldn't last a single day more at that hell. Everyone was just... too superior than me and my already zero self-esteem imploded even more.

Now, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I made the right decision, but I like to think I can so that I can fix my fucked up life. What do you guys  think? What should I do to fix myself? I will be taking therapy but I want to supplement that with something more. Thanks for bearing with me. This was fucked up.

I told her that I was shocked to see her in the bar as she cancelled on us. She got mad and asked me if I needed to know everything in her life. Who is in the wrong here? I was civil and didn’t  push the issue, but I’m irritated. I don’t need to know her business, but we had plans as friends, I told her that if she was able to get a sitter (which she did) it would have been nice to let us know as we love hanging out with her. She flipped the script and said we should have let her know that we were going out in town. Advice please.",08Sep2019,1

302,"So a couple months back a really close guy friend of mine admitted to having a crush on me. I currently have a boyfriend and I was honest with my friend and told him that I didn’t feel the same way but that I was happy he was honest with me.

I told him that I still want to hang out with him and that I still want to be friends and he seemed to agree.

It’s been awhile now and he doesn’t seem to want to hang out as often or talk as often as we used to. I figured it was because of his job but I’ve been seeing notifications from him playing games on Steam quite often so I know when he’s not at work.

I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid or not but recently my mom put it into my head that I really hurt his feelings and/or broke his heart and that he’s probably recovering from me rejecting him.

I don’t have feelings for him at all but I’m really scared that I hurt him by being honest with him and I’m scared that I ruined our friendship because I rejected him.

309,"I recently went to my school counsellor because I was having trouble with consistency, and he summarised my issues as ""having low self-discipline"". I've never really concerned myself with the issue of self-discipline before, because discipline is a very vague concept to me that does not really exist in my world. I seek novelty and interesting things a lot, and the way I achieve my goals is my setting soft limits or getting into the particular mindset for a few weeks rather than having self-discipline and structuring everything. I don't know if there is a difference between the two and whether I'd benefit from developing self-discipline or if it's just something that does not exist to me and would not work. Or if it would just crush any of my happiness and make life really dull for me.

What do you think about this and what should I do? If self-discipline really is the problem I need to look at, then I'd try to develop it further, but otherwise I don't see a point in targeting something that wouldn't help. I also need to see the counsellor again in a few weeks so I'd probably need to tell him something then, whether it's that my problem is something else or that I've been trying to do something about the issue.",08Sep2019,1

312,"My uncle got divorced and recently retired, my grandmother is in beginning of dementia and my mom and I needed help as we are living with her and still running the business of real estate that my grandfather left behind when he passed some years ago... we knew he had problems, for instance the house he was living in should be condemned and he has paranoia. We got him out of there and are having him live in one of the apartments we own and he helps with maintenance and my grandmother. However, he is incompetent in a lot of ways and hasn’t changed his habits as he is basically destroying the apartment because of the multiple pets he has (1 dog, 3 cats, 2 turtles.) He does not change litter boxes and the whole place reeks of urine, he often smells too. I’m sure he is depressed because of the divorce but my cousins tell me he has always been this way and do not know how to handle it. 

When he initially showed up with the animals, they had matted fur, smelt terribly and had fleas as well. We got him to take them all to the vet as we were especially concerned about the one cat whose face looked like he was stung by a bee it was so swollen and infected he could not open his eyes. This cat was a feral one he “rescued” but had kept locked in a room because he did not get along with other animals. The vet concluded it was an infection from a scratch and he has FIV so he was treated with antibiotics, all the others including him also had ear infections. 

He continues to isolate the cat, living a miserable existence locked in the basement. I have offered to help him bring the cat to a sanctuary that takes FIV positive cats and even rehomes them but he has refused. He has not kept up with the ear drops and says he is too embarrassed to go back to the vet as he has not resolved the ear infections. 

I am an animal lover and cannot standby as these cats are neglected, he spoils the dog but the cats stay living in their own filth. My mom tried to check in on them when he wasn’t home and found that he had changed the locks to the apartment. Whenever we stop by when he is home, we only see the one cat who is thin and suspected to have a thyroid condition that he has not followed up on treating. 

I told my mom to offer that I take them to the vet, or I am going to show up and insist on taking care of the situation by cleaning up the place and confront him about them needing to go to the vet if he refuses. To be honest I am tempted to report him or force entry to get the cats out of the situation but it may be met with hostility and it’s complicated because in my grandmas eyes he can do no wrong and will have the final say in what happens.

Another thing that is concerning me is that there has been a lot of cats gone missing in the area and I’m afraid he could be hoarding them. It is important that if I do anything that it is unannounced because he will relocate the animals because of his paranoia. My aunt is a paranoid schizophrenic and I wouldn’t be surprised if he is as well since a good portion of his life he has thought the mob is out to get him.

Well, I think I covered everything that i can think of at the moment. I appreciate any input. 😥

She came over to my house last night and we got a bit drunk. She calls her boyfriend and he just sits there and says nothing. Then goes on to call her things such as a dumbass fucking bitch. Here's a list of what happened during the call  


\-She told me he got drunk on his birthday and verbally abused her, yet promised not to do it again

\-He worries about her hanging out with other boys

\-Had gotten his mom to text her that she needs to go on a diet

\-He said""if you want the same life as i did, you should follow my footsteps in focusing on the positives rather than the negatives""

\-She claims its her fault that he treats her like this

\-Claims ""I have helped this girl go from hated and disliked to being loved and likeable""

\-She says ""i can't do anything"", then later says she loves him

\-He Claims she's horny for another friend, and that she would have sex with me that night (f) both of which were never said. (She did say we might fuck tonight, but she was shitfaced)

\-""im ashamed of her behavior tonight""

\-I asked if he ever makes her feel sad and useless, she said yes.

\-He defined the term abusive, and then said ""(friends name) however, doesn't feel like that very often. (yet she tells him how she feels)""

\-""what the hell did you do tonight, it's a simple fucking question""

\-He asked me to leave the room because he didn't want to talk to me, she said she was gonna get fucking yelled it

\-He said ""you need to get a grip"" then called her a dumbass when she couldn't figure out the lights in my room

\-""Look at me in the fucking eyes, do you realise what you've done tonight?""

\- ""Tomorrow morning you're going to have a fun little surprise""

\-""You're gonna feel the guilt and remorse of your actions tonight. You're gonna understand a whole new level of pain.""

\-""Why the fuck is she your friend?""

\-Friend: ' I love you' Him: 'i hate you' (im not making this up)

\-""You're always setting me up with your friends so they can hate me, thank you once again""

\-Her: ""why do you hate me so much?"" Him:""Because you're a dumb fucking cunt""

\-""You should be disgusted""

She doesn't want me to tell anyone. I have recordings of the conversation, I kept confronting him during the phone call and he just got silent and kept brining up how she lied about having no friends at the start of the school session. WHAT DO I DO.",08Sep2019,1

316,"This story starts way back when in my sophomore year when I met this boy. He was enthralled with me and I turned him down a fair amount of times. Throughout these years we have gone back and forth with talking to not talking for a year.

This year we started talking again in a friendly manner. However he and his girlfriend broke up and I was in the process of doing the same with my boyfriend at the time. Our relationship became a little flirtatious until I broke things off with my boyfriend. Then he and went on a date, I spent the night at his house three times, we had sex. I told him I liked him a lot but at this point I wasn't really ready for a relationship.

He did not respect that, he continued to get me to change my mind. At first it was charming that he wanted to be with me but it quickly turned worrisome. His ex girlfriend at the time was trying to get back together with him. He was humoring the idea while continuing to tell me that if we had a chance to be together he wouldn't rekindle their relationship. We kept seeing each other romantically and when the time came he told her he did not want to get back together with her.

She did not take it well and on top of it when she found out we were hanging out she tried to overdose on painkillers. I felt awful and sick and while he was at the hospital I said that we should probably stop talking. Because I said that he decided to get back together with her. I thought that was it.

I really did care about him so when he told me that his now girlfriend was fine with us being friends I was happy to try. It was not long until he decided that his feelings for me were stronger than the ones in his relationship. So again he broke things off with her. Things went back to how they were between us and it was nice. 

Then I get a text from his now ex girlfriend. She wanted clarity on my relationship with the boy. At first I was hesitant because I didn't want to add to the situation. We had talked before so it wasn't out of the blue and I knew her. Slowly my guilt got the best of me and I told her everything about the situation which exposed the boy as a liar. 

The more we talked the more we realized he lied to both of us. He told her that the sex was much better with her while he was telling me he wanted to be with me. He had sex with us in the same day without telling either of us. He lied to me about her feelings about us being friends. And he continued to lie once confronted.

Now at this point I am sick to my stomach. I feel worthless and stupid for not respecting myself more but then I get hit with another shock. His now ex girlfriend reveals to me that he is also a pedofile. He had been hinting that he had a large secret that he didn't want to tell me when we were together and I talked to her about because I knew she had already been told. He was turned on when he found out about her being molested and got off to pictures of her when she was 13. When She explained it to me she was very choked up.

At this point knowing all that I know I can't sleep, eat, look at myself. I feel awful. I hate myself so much and I don't know how to go about getting better. I have explained the situation to the only two people I trust and they were sympathetic but didn't offer much advice as to where to go from here. I feel like nothing I do can make me forget that. I don't know if I should try to find closure by losing it on him (he is blocked right now) or just try to move past it on my own. I just cannot deal with this",08Sep2019,1

329,"I’ve live in America a few years now but come from a very non-confrontational culture. Growing up a family or friend would tell me something was wrong and then mostly walk away. I would be left to contemplate what was said and think about what could be done to fix it. You never really talked much to the person who was making the complaint. You listened until they felt everything had been said then left you to fix it as best you could. They would thank you if you changed or speak to you again if something was still not fixed. It’s hard to explain but this was almost never confrontational. Almost always it was phrased in a “everyone makes mistakes and here is the mistake you have made. I trust that knowing you have hurt me will make you change your behavior.”

Since moving to America this has changed. People just outright say how they feel. Sometimes I go to the store and hear people casually talking about how Muslims/blacks:immigrants are ruining the country. People who I consider to be friends will tell me about mistakes and demand an immediate answer. If I don’t have one they assume I don’t care. Little things are called to attention as if they are giant slights to the person. For instance, I am often interrupted but it doesn’t bother me. I assume the person either mistakenly  thought I was done, jumped in to clarify something or just got over excited. Rarely do I think it’s malicious. But if you interrupt someone down here they get so mad. Even if this ‘interruption’ is because they were distracted for several moments and haven’t said anything.

Context:

I knew this girl for a few years and we were really close friends. I had crushes on her on and off for that time. 

It was my senior prom, around May (she graduated the year before me), and I asked her to go with me as my date. She said yes and it was an amazing night. We kissed and became a thing that night. Things were good until I said something stupid that I don’t remember what it was. She stopped talking to me all together. If I tried talking to her about it or just to her in general she would either not say anything at all or just tell me she didn’t want to talk because she was either getting high or drunk with her friends.

I made a mistake. Asking her friend to get her to pretty please talk to me. Turns out, this girl didn’t even like me at all. She would make fun of me to her friends and she thought I was weird and creepy. She lied to my face that she liked me and thought I was attractive. I was then blocked on all social media by the girl.

I want to reach out to her (I still have her number) and talk to her about this and get things sorted out. I have no interest in her romantically any more, she kinda fucked me up.

347,"So as title sais, I'm meeting obstacles in my social life. Been in a rough period since a break up a couple of years ago, and the friends that I had before that disappeared together with it. 

The firends I got during the intermittent time have been mainly romantically involved, and as I haven't been able to dedicate myself truly to them they have also gone. 

And since I'm studying (old student here) I have gotten one good friend in class; but he didn't pass to continue and will move away; which means that in my life there's no friends anymore. 

During the nights I'm sleepless due to anxious feelings and reluctant to go outside and hide my face as much as possible for other people. 

I'm not a bad person, or unlikable, but mood sways make it harder to keep friendships and it makes me quite picky as who I am open and honest with. Feelings about my life which makes me sad is nothing I talk to people about in general, but the general ambiguity surely affects who I am to other people. 

I know most of this will pass, but if there's any mature wise person out there who has had some kind of similiar experience and gotten out of it. 

*this is how I approach this scenario so far:* 
I know most of you will think ""therapy"" and sure, that is one thing I'm already looking into. 
Also, I keep in mind to exercise, to try not to escape my feelings but be with them.
Also, I try to keep gratitude and loving kindness in my life, and avoid stimulants as they make my feelings worse. 
I know trying to get out there and meeting people is good - even if I haven't slept. 
Being without food intermittently helps my stomach and bodily sensations. 
I promise I try to sleep and eat regularly. 
And also I love helping others out, but social anxiety has curbed my outward goingness. 
And general laxity / laziness easily creeps into my life when I'm sad and tired. 


So tl;dr - seeking advice from more mature person in order to deal with challenges of life",08Sep2019,1
348,"I went there trying to meet girls. Most of them were at my eye level or taller, but the guys were mostly a head taller than me if not head and shoulders. Walking around I would see groups that had one tall guy, then four girls. I just felt like a kid walking around in a group of college students mingling with the opposite sex. Like I wasn’t apart of it. I don’t feel like I look like a man either, I feel like my body should be bigger and wider, and just more of what a man is. It’s extremely frustrating because when I talk to girls, there would sometimes be a guy who would walk in between us and I would be looking at his shoulder blades, then me and the girl would resume talking down in the world of small people, if that makes sense. 

I don’t even know what advice I could possibly get with a problem like this, but it’s worth a shot.",08Sep2019,1
350,"Someone I care about has been extremely depressed for a very long time, but only in maybe the past six months has it got particularly bad. They cope with drugs and alcohol and are rarely sober. They talk about killing themselves quite often, usually in a jokey manner but it’s not completely a joke. 
When they are feeling extremely vulnerable they send messages like ‘I can’t take this anymore’ without any context and don’t reply for hours and I get extremely worried. 
You can’t talk to them in a serious and firm way because they take it as a sign that we don’t love them and that they are a burden for causing us to be mad or annoyed or sad, and then say that we should forget about them because they are going to kill themselves soon. 
They recently started taking a lot more drugs and smoking all the time which I keep saying to them to be careful or to stop but nothing goes in.
It almost feels like they have tunnel vision and don’t see another way, and they also don’t see the amount of pain they are causing to the people who love and care about them as we watch them slowly die. 
A couple of months ago they ended up in hospital for an overdose, mixture of too many drugs and a fuck ton of alcohol. 
This still doesn’t seem to have given them a reality check even though they could’ve died. They refuse professional help because they say it won’t work. 
I am so tired of telling them that I love them and would be lost without them, as all of us who care about them would, I am so mad at them for not trying and for being so stupid in their destructive behaviour even though it feels so wrong to be mad at someone who is so mentally ill.
I am tired of worrying about them when they send a red flag message in the middle of the night and losing sleep because I’m waiting for a phone call that they’ve hurt themselves. 
I don’t know what to say to them anymore, I don’t even know how to talk to them anymore. If anyone has had any experiences like this with a loved one I would appreciate any type of advice about this whole situation, because I have no idea what to do anymore, or what to say anymore. How many times can you tell someone you love them, to get help, to actually try living before they actually listen. What is it going to take.",08Sep2019,1

352,"So I’d like to clarify that I am 18 years old but I believe that this person I’m going to talk about is also attracted to minors as well. I’ve been talking to a person on Instagram and he has been telling me to do a lot of very inappropriate things. Idk how to get out of it if I’m honest, but it’s been making me feel so uncomfortable and scared. I haven’t even been going out with friends or anything just staying home.

I met this guy in a chat room and he asked for my Instagram and I gave it to him, but he told me to do many things. I won’t go into detail, but it’s very disturbing. I’m the type of person that can’t say no because that’s just how I grew up. I’ve been in many similar situations like this for so long. It started when I was 7 years old and I’m just so lost because I thought it was going to finally stop but now I’m stuck with this new guy who’s manipulating me and making me do things that I don’t want to. He won’t stop begging me to send pictures and to do more with my body.

He’s in another country thank god but should I report him? I just need any kind of advice right now. I haven’t been in the best mental state recently, and this isn’t helping. I would’ve done something right away if I knew what to do but men have put so much fear into me.",08Sep2019,1

354,"My bf (27M) and I (26F) moved into our current condo in Feb ‘19 (1yr lease) and we didn’t discover how noisy our upstairs neighbors are until after signing the lease and moving in. 

Our upstairs neighbors are this old retired couple who have what looks like an English bulldog. Almost every single day, we hear noise that sounds like something is being dropped on and dragged across a tile floor. I think it could be the dog playing with a toy but I’m not sure. 

Thing is, the noise really isn’t that bad/loud, but it is loud enough to wake me (a fairly heavy sleeper) and my bf (a light sleeper) from our sleep and has done so on too many occasions (I unfortunately get extremely grumpy and get into a bad mood if I don’t get enough sleep so I try to avoid disruptions as much as possible). We usually hear the noise being made for a few minutes or so at a time and then it stops. It sounds like a wooden block being dropped and dragged across a tile floor. For example, just now we were woken up ~ 5:50am and haven’t heard a thing since ~ 6:05am, but now I’m wide awake and am super annoyed I’m going to be tired during our activities we have planned for later today. 

I have brought up to my bf several times that I want to say something to them (saying what exactly, I haven’t actually figured out yet) but my bf seems extremely hesitant to do anything other than to just deal with it and find another place for when this lease ends. This baffles me for a couple of reasons - he’s a lighter sleeper than me and has more trouble falling back asleep after being woken up, and he works from home and has to deal with more noise during the day (loud snoring that can be felt from our condo). 

I want to say something to them more than he does, but I won’t talk to them without his agreement. My bf has suggested turning on a fan to drown out some of the noise - the sounds that we hear are more of sharp noises (like a wooden block being dropped/dragged on tile floor) that cut through a low fan sound; I would just hear both our neighbors noise and a fan being on for no reason. 

Also, I don’t think we would be able to try to get out of our current lease. We have until November to let the landlord know whether we’ll be renewing the lease or not. Most likely not. 

Does anyone have advice on what we can do? If we talk to the neighbor, what exactly should we say? Are there any downfalls to bringing it up? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

P.S. I’m sure I’ve missed details as I’m typing this while annoyed and still waking up - if there are any questions, please ask away.",08Sep2019,5

I feel that she is definitely the one. All ex girl friends do not compare nor will future ones if there are any. I have not cheated or want to. It's not just women....The thing is..... I love shemale porn and have hooked up with a few of them too in the past. I am not sure if I'm straight bi or what ever you call it now a days. It feels right, but so does wanting to be married to her. 

I'll occasionally look at grindr just to see who's in the area without doing anything, and I know for sure I love this girl but not sure how to go about everything. I'm not positive if I chose the bi, gay, shemale, q, whatever path I wouldn't want a relationship like that. It's more physical.

We've been together for 2 years, she has a daughter that I love with all my heart too.

I dont want to let her down like 10 years down the road if these urges overcome me. I feel like if I bring this up it will end us. It's only a physical thing that I can say why I like shemales or anal I guess?

I'm drunk rn, hope this makes sense. If I was sober this post would not be here. I'd just appreciate some feedback if anyone is in the same boat or has good advice/ experience with this situation!

It’s really loud in my room, even louder in my bathroom and kitchen. It’s pretty loud out in the hallway and not loud, but audible, in the lobby. I couldn’t find any sort of specific alarm that was going off. Ran into a random girl in the lobby who said she could hear it too but that wasn’t why she was down there. None of my roommates have woken up and the hallways, elevators and lobby were completely empty besides that one person. 

Here’s were i think i’m going crazy. Everywhere in my room, it’s pretty loud, it woke me up and there no way i could sleep with it. But when I lay down on my pillow in a certain spot it goes away completely. Like it is silent and I move my head 6in in any direction and it becomes super loud again. I’ve never experienced anything like this and it’s kinda scaring me. It definitely sounds like some sort of alarm but there’s literally no one else that’s woken up and I goes away entirely if my head is on my pillow in a certain spot.

A good example is mother calling us both to do a task. Sometimes i'm busy and don't instantly stand up (litterally 1-3 seconds) and then he tries to sound all ""leader-ish"" or something, saying in a wannabe deep voice ""Come. Right now."" I say that i'm coming, ""I don't see that you are. Go now"". He's just so desperate of asserting dominance that he'll ruin my life for it.

He also reads all this ""phychology"" and shit to make him look smart. He's rude, dominates, manipulates and i'm in a hellhole. I wish i could just show him what big of a idiot and fool he is, but i can't see/remember anything about him that i can use against him. And he always backs up his arguments and likes to fuck me up.

He's also the reason i'm always mad. In public, at home, everywhere i'm constantly mad. For the first time that felt like years. On vacation, i cheered up, i felt happy god damn it.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

373,"( this is an anonymous throw away account to maintain privacy. genders will also remain neutral as well as specifics ) 

I have a friend that I’m rather close to. (For anyone who understands or is Borderline, they are my FP). Throughout their relationship with their partner, who we will call [A] and my friend [B], I and multiple other people have seen red flags and obvious signs of abusive behavior. Being a psychology student and a victim of abuse myself, I am very aware of the warning signs and evidence that I see. 

[A] practically refuses to clean up after themselves. They do the dishes here and there and maybe pick up once in a blue moon, but they leave the disasters after parties and hang outs for [B] to clean. They know it causes B anxiety, but A just constantly plays it off as “a freakout” or “being anal” about how their home looks. B has constantly had to hide and lie to A that B wants to come hang out with me. If B ever does want to hang out, A has to always be with them. However, this rule doesn’t apply to themselves. A is allowed to go wherever with whomever they like. I’ve witnessed A calling B over and over again for ten minutes straight because they weren’t answering their texts. I’ve been on the phone with B only to hear A screaming at them over the phone. (They did later apologize for this, but followed up with excuses that they were tired and had a rough day.) A also always makes B put the phone on speaker. A always listens in on our phone conversations. A constantly avoids the consequences of their behaviors by making excuses. À refuses to get a job, saying that school is already too much for them. But the go out of town on vacations and spend all of their money on amazon no problem. They have been living together and B has no idea what bills and any kind of income A is making. When asked, A just says “bills” or that their parents give them money. Parents pay A’s part of the rent, and have threatened to stop multiple times. B is having a hard time keeping the fridge stocked, paying their own bills, and forking over almost 2000$+ a month to keep them both in this apartment. 

They get into fights all of the time, A has crossed B’s boundaries multiple times and A just laughs it off or makes excuses again. Kissing other people without permission, making sexually charged comments about other people. B called A put on this and A simply replied, “oh it’s just a joke. it’s funny.” It took me calling A out and saying “It’s really not funny” for them to quit. 

A constantly low-key bullies and gaslights B. Trivializing their feelings and making them feel like their concerns are just being anal. B also feels unhappy with their sex life, which has led B to doing things with other people without telling A.  This is starting to go both ways and it’s making me start to pull away from them both. It is becoming detrimental for my mental health to be between their fights constantly. 

I have tried to talk to B multiple times about the obvious signs of abuse. I have flat out told B many times that they are. I always tell them they have my support and if they ever need anything they have a support group of friends to help. I know from experience leaving an abusive relationship is easier said than done, but it seems like every time I stick my neck out for B and put my foot down and try to help I get thrown under the bus for being “nosy”. I only get involved when they directly come to me and MAKE me get involved. My patience is starting to wear thin, but I am still concerned for my friend’s mental health and well being. I’ve offered my home, my financial support, everything I can think of and more. I am at a loss. I don’t want to give up and give up on my friend, but I can’t keep pushing myself like this. 

Thank you in advance for any advice. I’ll try to answer any questions you might have.",08Sep2019,1
374,"So I’m sure I’m not the only one who struggles with this, so I hope people who come across this can relate, and hopefully some people respond with some good solutions and answers.

I am currently 21 years old and am at a stage in my life where I’m really just ready to completely change who I am. Growing up, I have developed some pretty bad habits. There are many so please bare with me as a quickly explain each.

- early on in high school, I wanna say sophomore year, I became addicted to porn. I would watch and masterbate to it anywhere from 1-3 times a day, every single day. It didn’t become a problem until senior year when I began developing erectile dysfunction. Ever since then I have had this on and off cycle where I’ll stop using porn for like a couple weeks, and then all of a sudden just fall HEAVILY back into it. 

- I started smoking weed in 8th grade and since then, I have NOT been able to stop for more than a month and a half. It’s the same deal. I’ll stop for a cool minute, and once that phase is over I over indulge myself in it all over again, as if I never quit to begin with.

I have many others, but for time sake I’ll just skip to the real reason for posting this.
I just feel like I can never really go through with change. I feel so stuck and attached to who I’ve been these past like 10 years. I can’t let go of bad habits for long periods of time no matter how hard I try. I will have days where I feel SUPER MOTIVATED and I tell myself “Ok THIS is the day, this is the day where I let go of all my bad habits and change.” And I will be on this kind of dopamine high from it for a couple weeks, maybe even a little over a month, and then all of a sudden, I’ll relapse back into my old ways, INTENSELY. And each time I relapse I feel like I just loose a little more motivation and respect for myself. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve kind of developed this belief that I really can’t change. And that scares me because I know the only thing that stops you from evolving is yourself. And I don’t want that belief.

I want to let go of my childish and immature habits and grow up. I want to let go of my past self and evolve into a man. I want to be consistent and create lasting change. Not just a phase. But I just don’t know how. I feel like it’s a psychological thing, that has to do with how I was raised as a child or just events that happened in my childhood. I feel like that plays a big part as to why I mentally refuse to evolve and revert back to my old ways. 
I have so many dreams and so many goals, but I just feel so lazy because I’m stuck in my old ways, and it makes me feel depressed and unmotivated. 

This lack of motivation and action has spread to all aspects of my life. I don’t focus on school, I’m not consistent with gym, I procrastinate all the time... 

I also have this really bad negative self talk in my head. For instance, I have a small YouTube channel with a little over 300 subs, and it’s been growing slowly over the year I’ve been working on it, maybe like 10-20 subs every month. YouTube is something I actually really wanna do, but when I start working on videos and try coming up with new ideas, out of nowhere I get these negative thoughts like “ Why are you even trying? You’ll never be as good as these other people?” “How have you been working at this for over a year and only have 300+ subs?” “People don’t actually like your videos, they just feel bad for you.” And then I just get super unmotivated to work on videos like I should be. 

What makes me even more devastated is I’m very in my head all the time...
My parents have worked so hard their entire lives for me and my siblings. My mother has worked so hard and had so much stress that she’s developed Multiple Sclerosis. She’s still working hard to make a name and money for herself. My dad is an immigrant who has been working every day of his life for the past 30 years to make sure me and my siblings have a life with opportunities that he never had. 
And the fact that I can’t do anything , just makes me feel so ashamed. Out of my 2 other siblings, ever since I was little, I was always the one with drive, goals and motivation. So it wouldn’t be wrong to say that my parents always viewed me as having a lot of potential. And now I just feel like a half ass. I love my family so much, and we’ve struggled really bad for the past 12 years, and I feel like it’s my responsibility to really pick up the slack and bring an abundance of money so I can take care of my parents who have worked their entire life for us. 

But I just can’t seem to let go of my old habits, and I’m getting really really desperate. Please someone help me and give me advice.",08Sep2019,1

383,"My whole life I’ve had many bumps. My life was really wonderful until my parents divorced when I was 10. My parents both got remarried in a year. I lived with. T dad until I was 15, then I started having major issues with my step mom. I was kicked out of my dads house when I was 15 then kicked out of my moms house when I was 16. I was never a really bad kid, I never drank or did drugs (I occasionally smoked weed for a year in grade 10 that was it). I never snuck out or brought a bunch of guys over. I never swore at them. I lied once in awhile to my parents about school or other things, I didn’t clean up after myself, and I was sometimes disrespectful. My parents didn’t think I appreciated what they did for me. I was a very depressed kid. I felt emotionally deprived in a way. I never had a relationship or my first kiss until I was 15. Not many boys liked me cause I was weird. I got kicked out of my dads house and lived with my mom for a year. When I was with my mom we butted heads a lot cause she is an intense clean freak and well... I’m kinda SUPER messy. She was upset with me because she didn’t think I was mature enough for my age cause I wouldn’t clean up after myself, I’d skip school (because I was bullied a lot), I wouldn’t spend a lot of time with her, I’d be in my room a lot. We got into a couple super bad fights and suddenly she just had enough. She called the cops on me randomly and told them she didn’t want me in the house anymore. So I packed a bag and they took me to a shelter which I stayed at for 2 months. I was so scared. I was from the country and my parents were higher middle class people. I was never introduced to drugs or anything of that sort. After being in a scary shelter for 2 months, no friends nothing. CFS got involved and got me an apartment of my own and left me to my own devices. I struggled going back to school and dropped out a lot. I struggled taking care of myself and my surroundings on my own with no friends or anyone. I started sleeping with a bunch of people because I felt so alone. I didn’t do it because I wanted to have sex I just wanted to feel wanted. I slowly built a relationship with my parents again but they never let me move back in with them. I tried too many times. Over the years I’ve been through many people, jobs, and schools. I’ve failed to get through them each time from my mental health issues. I was diagnosed with BPD when I was 20. I’m 22 now. Things have changed a lot. I found my boyfriend, I have pets and an apartment. I have signed up for school again and I’m starting on Monday. Problem is, I’m still feeling stuck and emotionally overwhelmed. I feel depressed and sad. I live in a bad area in a bad city. I want to move really badly but I can’t in my current situation. I’m on disability I don’t work because working and going to school at the same time is near impossible for me. I am still struggling with being lazy, forgetful, and feeling over emotional a lot. I overthink many things and I’m scared of a lot of things. I want to go to therapy but I don’t have a way to get there as my only transportation right now is walking. I can’t afford a bus pass right now. I just walk to and from school. I feel lost.",08Sep2019,1

387,"I met my gf when I was 16. At the time she was 21. It started as a small crush but quickly became a friendship. One where we were inseparable. Like I had the keys to her house. 

At 18 I began to develop feelings. During this time she had a bf. So I just listened to her talk about him

Well they were having problems so she started seeing a fwb. I would listen to how they slept together and even read their sexts. She then left the fwb. went back to the bf. Then left him and went to the fwb. 

Then she showed interest in me. I was super insecure. And like a dumbass I made up a past. I even used to mention how girls really liked me or would eye me. 

Didn’t get worse when she was close to her exes family. And they were still around. 

I was also easily controlled. I blocked a female friend for her, I took calls around her, I comforted her dreams about me cheating. 

It was love that blinded me. 

But I couldn’t communicate well. I always resorted to shouting in fighting or saying hurtful things. 

She eventually left and within the month was sleeping with her friend. Who I was suspicious about. I only knew cause she rubbed it in my face how she’s sleeping with him.

I went back up to my floor and went inside. I heard the elevators open in the hallway and police were knocking on all the doors asking if they had something fall out their window. My bf has a bong near the window so I went to grab it and hide it. I heard a lot of commotion outside so when I looked down I saw a bunch of police standing there. I looked a little farther and I saw a woman, with blood surrounding her. She was in a really awful position. I stumbled back I was so mortified. I called my bf immediately crying. He was going to try to get off work as soon as he could. Not even 2 minutes from being on the phone with him the police knocked on my neighbours door. They opened, I pushed my ear to the door because I recognized the woman who was dead on the ground outside she was my neighbours daughter. (She jumped around 40 feet into the parkade that juts out). My neighbours have a history of being drug addicts and just cause problems all around. I’ve had to call the police a few times on them. The police said to them that someone jumped out the window and 10 seconds went by (I’m assuming they went to the window). And suddenly there was just awful awful awful screaming. It was horrific. I felt so sick I wanted to throw up. Idk how to process this. I feel like moving out. I can’t stop thinking of her mangled body laying there. And the blood. I feel scared.

392,"So...long story short. Best friends since we were 17, 34 now. Her (we will call her C) and I (D) were part of a very close knit group of 6 girls that I always viewed as the type of friendship that I was oh so lucky to have. Fast forward from 16...to 30. Still so very close, despite many things. I stood as a bridesmaid at her first wedding, sat as teens dreaming of what our lives would be, celebrated her victories, mourned the loss of so many things with her and tried as best I could to be there for her through her divorce. 

My life went into turmoil about 3 years ago when my father became life changeingly sick. Almost died, in and out of ICU. And I sat there alone. A few calls, texts, but alone. 

And then I hermit crabbed. I withdrew from social events like christmas parties, and girls nights out. Not 100% MIA, but very much dealing with shit - rather poorly.

Cut to the chase, she remarried 2 years agoand did not invite me to the wedding. It was a small event. I was shocked. 

I understand I withdrew and I have been making efforts to re establish the friendship. But I am so overwhelmed w anxiety about today. We've hung out many times since, but I dont say anything about how I feel and we have never discussed my lack of invite to the wedding. To me, and I am a sensitive one, it's an ugly elephant and today burns me for some reason.

I am invited to your baby shower, but wasnt to the wedding. I have resentment that I felt abandoned when I needed her (and our other friends) the most.

I guess I have to suck up my own feelings, bc not showing would be the final blow to our friendship. How do I let go, and smile when I feel nothing but weird about showing up? Am i wrong for feeling like....that maybe their absence needs to be something to be accountable for? Or should I just show up and apologize for my shortcomings in maintaining relationships as my world fell apart?

Obviously I am not trying to cause a scene, ruffle feathers or anything of the sort today. Just conflicted on how I should feel.",08Sep2019,1

And I've noticed this behavior since they came into a relationship (I'm not being possessive over here or not crying because I have to share my friends). 
They never used to pay when we decided to hang out and eat somewhere. Whenever they needed me I always used to be there for them. And help them out in all of their problems. And whenever I make any plans they just lie that they don't have time or are really busy or xyz shit...and at that very instance I used to see her(talking about one of them over here) hanging out with her boyfriend and his friends.
I get their texts only when they need me otherwise they won't even check up on me.
I have been someone who has always considered my friends to be everything. And we've been together all our lives, in school, college, tuitions, basically everywhere. And if they see me out with a mutual friend they will freak out. But whenever I see them I always no it's fine I can't be a clingy friend and even they should hang out with others whenever and wherever they want to.
We had this group in college and now they just hangout without me and do not invite me. One of them told me I told xyz (one of my best friends) to call you when we met, and this news was never received by me. I was never told that even I was invited. So I'm guessing I am just being used in this so called friendship. Because they always remember me in times of crisis and when they want to gossip about their so called gang( our mutual friends).

Hey to whoever reading, i never really post on reddit so excuse me if theres something wrong with the article or anything like that.

Anyway, yesterday i got jumped and robbed by two guys, lost my wallet and got some wounds. but it was not just an ordinary “robbery”.
I am almost 100% certain it was an organized action.
You see, two days ago there was a big fight in my moms side of the family, not going into details because even for me its not quite clear what happend, and she got threatened with a baseball bat by “family” members. I stopped having contact with those family members because they are nuts in the head, but this made me very mad.  I contacted my aunt, who is behind this all, and told her in a polite message that im more than done with them and that they will pay for everything. this is not something that happend only once but more times, thats why i draw a line here.  Because of this all i refuse to accept it was a coincidence two guys knew where i lived and attacked me exactly the day after the big fight. i told friends, family but for some reason everyone is either blaming me, or ignoring me and telling to back out of the situation and sit back. it feels afwul, not being supported by the ones whom i always support. i went to the police to press charges but they are not really of any use either. 
But im almost certain my “aunt” got those guys to attack and rob me.

She has nothing against me watching porn and masturbating, she does it too. So she isn't trying to blame me or guilt me or anything. The thing is that one of the search terms was ""busty"" and that really upset her. She has a great body but is self conscious about her breasts, and she now thinks that if I'm looking at busty girls, then that means that she isn't good enough for me. I tried convincing her otherwise, but I don't know exactly what else I can do in this situation.",08Sep2019,1
413,"Okay, so some background. My boyfriend kboth of us middle aged, despite the title lol) as had lots of heart ache in the past. Was very hesitant to commit to me because of this. Also because of the fact that I'm bipolar (stable... mostly) and has had a lot of women in his past blame their mental instability on him, starting with his mother. As stated, I'm bipolar (type 1 with *minor* psychotic features... that I haven't had in years thanks to lithium), and be is the best support I've had in years. We've been together for 5 years,  officially for 6 months. I talked to him the other day and told him it felt like I felt more for him than he did for me. He told me that's true,  he feels for me like a 8/10 and I'm like an 11/10 towards him. Is it just my bipolar emotionality casing the difference, or am I in trouble?",08Sep2019,1

Hey to whoever reading, i never really post on reddit so excuse me if theres something wrong with the article or anything like that.

Anyway, yesterday i got jumped and robbed by two guys, lost my wallet and got some wounds. but it was not just an ordinary “robbery”.
I am almost 100% certain it was an organized action.
You see, two days ago there was a big fight in my moms side of the family, not going into details because even for me its not quite clear what happend, and she got threatened with a baseball bat by “family” members. I stopped having contact with those family members because they are nuts in the head, but this made me very mad.  I contacted my aunt, who is behind this all, and told her in a polite message that im more than done with them and that they will pay for everything. this is not something that happend only once but more times, thats why i draw a line here.  Because of this all i refuse to accept it was a coincidence two guys knew where i lived and attacked me exactly the day after the big fight. i told friends, family but for some reason everyone is either blaming me, or ignoring me and telling to back out of the situation and sit back. it feels afwul, not being supported by the ones whom i always support. i went to the police to press charges but they are not really of any use either. 
But im almost certain my “aunt” got those guys to attack and rob me.

417,"Me and him have always been really close, even after I broke up with him the first time. 4 days ago I told him I might be willing to give him a second chance because I knew that's what he wanted me to say. That, of course, is now the greatest regret I've ever had. I've tried so hard to have feelings for him but the truth is, we really dont have anything in common. Our personalities are totally different and we dont like any of the same things. Whenever we talk it always ends up in awkward silence or him talking about tractors (which he is obsessed with). So yesterday I tried to explain to him that we never have anything to talk about but he just didnt get it. He figured he could just fix it by being a better bf, but if we've known each other for so long (8 years) it should be natural to talk to each other, we shouldnt have to force it. He is madly in love with me and eventually I just gave up trying to explain that it wasnt something he could fix and.... I told him we could date. I know if I break up with him he is going to be heartbroken and I would be liar cause I told him I would give him another chance.  The truth is that it's not about a second chance it's about us being incompatible. If I break up with him he would be mad because I already told him yes and then no and then yes again in one week, and I would feel terrible and like a whore for the rest of my life. I can tough it out for now and either eventually work up the courage to tell him the truth (that I dont like him) or maybe I might even start liking him again (I doubt it) or maybe I'll just never work up the courage and end up marrying him. I should mention that no matter what happens I'm going to have to be in close contact with him a lot. Also...i really like his best friend. Please help me",08Sep2019,0
418,"I am a 23 yo guy from Italy. I have never had close friends, I don't know what's wrong with me but I don't like going out and staying out for too long, I don't like parties and loud places with a lot of people. I like quiet activities like playing instruments and listening to music and I think a lot before telling or doing something to be sure that the things I do will go well. In the last year I started some kind of ""transformation"": it all started when a coworker began talking all day about his personal life: funny holidays and deep relationships with girls. I realised that my life is empty, I have never had a girlfriend or friends and now I don't know how to start. Until now I spent my days playing videogames or doing homework but now I work and I don't enjoy games anymore. So I started exercising at home and I started to see improvements in my look. When I go out people look at me like I'm an alien because I don't enjoy going out with male friends (it seems to me that everyone keeps talking about useless things without thinking before doing something), but I really like when there is a girl in the group so I can talk to her and in these moments I feel really good. At the same time I dont like to stay outside too much. But at the moment I am every day alone and I don't know how to go away from this situation. I'm afraid to join groups because I'm sure I will only find people who like to party, so I will feel very uncomfortable (i already tried this).

419,"I’m a sixteen-year-old girl and I took my first voice/singing lesson yesterday and met my teacher for the first time ever. She was an older woman, probably with grandchildren and she’s also a voice therapist for stroke patients. 

Ten minutes after we met and I had barely said anything to her, she’s teaching me how to breathe properly. She put her hands on my waist and told me to take a deep breath. I did, then she moved her hands to my chest and told me not to fill up there. She then had me take a few breaths with her hands on my chest, waist, and stomach. 

I did my best, but I hated it so much. I’m not exaggerating when I say I felt like I was going to burst into tears any second. She kept doing it throughout the hour-long lesson and made me touch her in the same places as well as hold my hands so I would stop fiddling with my bracelet. 

I felt like my throat was closing up, my chest was starting to hurt, and I felt tears in my eyes. I have no idea why it bothered me so much. I’ve never been touched inappropriately, I’ve never even held hands with someone who wasn’t a family member or a close friend.

I just felt so upset, but I was too shy, I guess, to say anything. I told my mom and she just said that’s how they do it and that my teacher probably didn’t think anything of it. She told me to try a few more lessons before I decide to stop. 

I love singing, but any time I do it, I just think of that, and I feel horrible. I don’t want to go back, ever, but I know I have to. Is there anything I can do to help myself not feel so uncomfortable when she touches me or a way to indirectly tell her to stop?",08Sep2019,3
421,"I'm a 29 y/o female that works in a male dominated field as a sheet metal worker. I used to work the day shift, but a year ago I had switched to working nights due to how I was being treated by the lead hand at the time. 

A couple days ago this same lead hand reeked of alcohol (not the first time I've smelled it on him), and when I had to ask a work related question in front of both my supervisor and him, he immediately told me, ""Shut the fuck up."" My supervisor began laughing, and so did the lead hand. I didn't address how inappropriate he was being at the time because I didn't want to create a scene as he seemed to be heavily intoxicated.

I'm also struggling because I thought both me and my supervisor were getting along and had a good bond with each other... but recently he has talked down at me, by telling me that I'm insecure when I'm not, and also telling me I lack confidence when I don't.

I did bring bring my discomfort of the lead hands behaviour to my supervisors attention later on that afternoon. But I feel I cannot trust him and his word anymore. He is also close with the lead hand, so this adds to my speculation as to whether I could ever trust him or not now.

My supervisor tried to justify the lead hands behaviour at first by telling me that he was just joking. And saying how I apparently can't take the joke. That isn't a joke, and is actually a form of harassment in my opinion. It wasn't called for whatsoever.

I'm thinking about looking for a different job, putting my two weeks in, and reporting this incident to both HR and the labour board. I'm really sad that this happened because I wanted to stay with the company for a very long time and continue to do the type of work that I love.

So my fiancé and I, both 24, pulled into a random parking lot (Looked like a company or something) on the weekend in the middle of the afternoon. There were no “Do not enter” or “Trespassing” signs - just a regular business parking lot empty for the weekend.

We stopped in the corner and proceeded to makeout - nothing overtly sexual - some under clothes touching and playing without any clothes coming off. 

We were there for about 10 minutes when a security car (Small white car with the green lights) drives past us from behind. We stop instantly and I act like I’m on the phone to steer off any huge suspicions. They then turns slowly and stops about 6-7 parking spots away facing us (But doesn’t get into a parking spot parallel to us). 

They do not park next to us and don’t even speak to us.

I pull out slowly and drive away even slower just in case they wanted us to stop but they didn’t. They then proceed to take up like 3 parking spots parking over them but don’t follow us and we get out.

However over summer I’ve gone out and drank a lot less frequently but I’ve noticed something the past two times I’ve gone out and drank.

429,"Please read everything before commenting.

Two weekends ago, a coworker (who is a breeder) asked me if I wanted to take one of her older dogs who is now too old to breed. I was really excited at first (I’ve always wanted a dog), but I wanted to wait a little longer so I could think about such a big decision. I asked her if I could have until the end of September to think about it, prepare, ask the landlords, all that stuff. However, the very next day (it was a Friday) she came into our meeting and said “I’m bringing the dog over today. It’s a long weekend so you will have more time to bond with the dog rather than at the end of the month.” I told her I still wasn’t sure but she basically had decided for me and told me this was a decision I just had to “make”. She kept assuring me I could just see how things went over the weekend and then make the final decision. 

That night, she did indeed show up to my apartment with the dog and dropped her off with a ziploc of food and two bowls. At that point, that was all I had for her. Also, my landlords had yet to respond to my question about the dog. However, that same night, I started to notice some inconsistencies with what she told me vs. what the dog actually was. She told me the dog just turned 8 but when I looked at the birth certificate she is going to turn 10 in two weeks. Her rabies shots have expired. She’s not spayed yet. And she’s not potty trained. 

I used the weekend almost as a “test weekend” to see if having a dog right now was the best decision. I quickly realized it was not the time. Financially, I’m not stable enough right now to handle any unanticipated medical expenses (I’m on a first year teacher salary). I also really don’t have the time to give her all the attention she needs. And my landlords... they texted back and told us absolutely no dogs (even though they advertised our apartment as pet friendly, but that’s a different story).

When I went back to work I told my coworker my concerns and how I’m not ready for the dog but she told me she won’t take her back under any circumstance. Now I’m in a panic. I have asked everyone under the sun if they would want to add this little dog to their family and everyone is saying no. I have thought about surrendering her to an animal shelter but I can’t bring myself to do it, I feel so guilty. I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to push too much with this coworker because she’s the one who even got me this job in the first place. 

I have had people in my life telling me that this is my fault and I’m the one with the bad attitude and I need to change my perspective. I just feel like this was all done without any preparation and now I don’t have the opportunity to give her back and fix it. She’s the sweetest little dog in the entire world. She’s had a hard life. I don’t want to make her life any harder, but I don’t think I can give her the life she needs right now. She deserves so much more than what I have.

What do I do? I am in such a bind here it is driving me insane. I cry for hours everyday. I know it’s my fault but I can’t think of anyway to fix this.

Please be a little nice to me in the comments. I have beat myself up about this so much already.

431,"So here's the story. My mother has BPD. It is severe and I only just recently realized how much emotional abuse I have endured as a child, that I still endure to this day. My spouse and I have been together for 4 years, got engaged a year ago and have been long distance for a year and half because of my training for my job. I have been receiving so much back lash from all my family and pressure because all we wanted to do was elope. We wanted to go to Scotland and elope just us two. But I have been getting all this pressure from all my sides of the family (I say that because in my family everyone exiles eachother and doesn't talk to one another) and I couldn't make a decision. And even when we got engaged it was ruined for us because my sister took a hissy fit because she too was engaged and she thought I was going to steal her thunder. Now I brought up to my now boyfriend that I wanted to cancel it all, I'd give him the ring back because I don't feel like we're ready. I emotionally am not capable of planning anything right now especially with the recent discovery that I was abused my entire life. I need to figure out my emotions and cope before anything. And I told him that, when I told him, he acted pretty okay about it. Didn't say much about it at all except that if we're going to do this we have to just be with eachother, no outside influences which is fair. Fast forward to now and he's doesn't want to even speak to me and said he didn't bring it up when I said something because he didn't want to fight but now he wants space, not breaking up, he just wants to be alone. Which my training is supposed to be done in 4 weeks and I'm supposed to be living at home again. He said that now I'm putting pressure on him and he's worried that I'll end up like my mother, he thinks all I do is worry about outside influences which may be true but I'm trying to work on it.

444,"(17M) As a kid I’ve been through a lot, I was introduced to this world by two drug addicts and my dad left me at the age of three, also went to foster care because my mom was an heavy alcoholic and drug user, I’ve been to two foster homes because the first one didn’t bathe me and my sister for a year, (and other horrendous things) my mom got out of jail and got us back by the age of five/six, I haven’t seen my dad since, and my mom used to beat us, but stopped a few years ago, due to “Jesus” (still yells, threatens and has to take heavy medication)

Everything is alright and my mom apologized and said she cries herself to sleep a lot because of what she did to us. I still can’t forgive her for what she did to us, whenever I look at her I remember crying in my room, alone in the dark and thinking she killed my sister, I heard my sister yell “Call 911”, but I couldn’t because I was young, had no phone, and was too scared to do anything. After my sister yells all I heard was her gasping for air, which eventually died out, and  heard nothing except my mom grunting. This happened maybe 3 years ago and I try not to think about it but it’s hard not to. She’s made me bleed and bruised me multiple times, it’s hard to get over it, I doubt I ever will. There were countless night like this. 

I’ve had depression on and off since the age of fourteen, and recently took on anxiety. The depression affects my life and I’m tired of it, I’ve given up on things like school and so many jobs because of it, or I randomly lose motivation and I don’t know why. 

 My sister (19) has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and add, she used to cope with it by taking hard drugs and alcohol, I’m very mild mannered and have never done drugs or alcohol despite my friends and family doing them and pressuring me to do so, I’m scared I’ll turn out like my mom and beat my kids, I haven’t had any violent outbreaks though and I think I’m normal in that sense but I don’t know what to do, I’m fine at the moment but I’m afraid that I’ll quit out on school again because of the chronic depression or something.

Also, my sisters dad is still in her life and talks to her regularly, my dad doesn’t even send me Christmas wishes or acknowledges my birthday, his now-wife asked me to move in with them a while back and I think it had nothing to do with that douchebag father of mine, I envy children that play with their amazing dads and it affects me a lot. Even when passing happy families in the mall, etc I feel all this and I hate it, I wish it could all go away.

I feel extremely alone in all of this, my entire family besides me and my sister has had good parents, and a great childhood, my friends and everyone I know have amazing parents and grew up normally, even my sister has a good dad in her life but mine doesn’t even acknowledge that I’m alive, I’ve tried reaching out to him before and he doesn’t seem interested in talking to me, I wish someone could understand the stuff I’m going through and give me advice on bettering myself.

I love my mom but I can’t help but feel hatred for her, although its mostly died out, I don’t know if it’s justified or not. Hating your mother is never a good thing, but after over a decade of watching my mom beat my sister and me, it’s hard to forget that.

I’ve been wanting to go there since I was in high school, (I really wanted to study abroad in Korea and that seemed like the perfect school). I’m now attending the school as an Multidisciplinary major (Art, theater and Sociology) and I absolutely hate being here. I don’t like the campus, I hate that I’m only taking 1 art class and sitting in lectures for classes I’m not going to learn anything from is torture. It feels like being here is a waste of time and money. I’m thinking of dropping out. If I do it now, I’ll still be able to salvage some of my financial aid and not suffer a penalty (I hope). I don’t know why I thought choosing a Stem focused school when I’m an art major was the way to go. 

My mom told me to just tough it out and get my degree but that’s about 4 semesters from now and I don’t even think I can make it through this one without becoming depressed again. 

It’s not like I don’t want to go to school, I just don’t want to go to THIS school anymore, not to mention I dorm, and have no idea how I’m going to pay for the rest of my dorming here. 
If someone could offer advice I would be so grateful, I feel so lost. 


TLDR: Attending a Stem school as an art major and hating everything about it. Wants to drop out 3 weeks into semester.",08Sep2019,1

I have to get this off my chest so buckle up.
Let me just say that i was a weird, perverted child.
And one of the things i liked doing was ""playing a certain game"" this game involved me and a friend dry-humping. As a girl myself this was always another girl. This happend when i was 7-11 yrs old and didnt know anybetter. My ex bff got mad at me for unrelated reasons and started talking shit about me behind my back. And a friend started talking about that. That friend said that i forced her to do that and she stopped coming to my house(complete bs, she has been to my house multible times after that incedent in the 2. Grade). Than another friend lied about me touching her thigh just last year, this was a girl that ordered me to moun when we where doing that. She told EVERYONE in our group chat. I was completely alone, no one belived me. I have grown as a person since then, i was a child and didnt know what i was doing and i REALLY regret doing that. I cried when that was made public and i started thinking of ways to kill myself. Im going to school tomorrow. How do i cope with this? Am i a terrible person?",08Sep2019,2

I know because I make a habit of walking down stairs/across campus to my car to grab something, and then realizing I forgot my keys in the apartment/in my backpack and having to go back for them. So idk how they could have gotten into my car, but anyway this morning at like 4 am when I was getting ready to go to work I walked down to my car to find that someone had rifled through my glove box, and left it open as well as my center console, and thrown the stuff I had in my center console everywhere. They left my deodorant on my driver side floor etc. I guess I should have called the police but I'd rather be at work than deal with the police, who really probably couldn't do anything for me anyway, at 4 am so I just put my stuff back where it belonged went to work like normal. 

My mom said to make sure my registration was still there, and it was, which prompted me to look through and see what else was missing and as far as I can tell nothing is. They didn't take anything I would take if I were a thief, for example my knife that I keep in the center console was still there as well as my spare change in the ashtray, and so was my current registration as well as my expired registration that I forgot to remove. They even left a credit card (one that is expired that I put in my glove box months ago because I meant to take it home and cut it up, but forgot about). 

My address is wrong on all of the documents in my car anyway because I recently moved (although I guess they could guess based on the fact that I was parked in a numbered spot). Anyway, how worried should I be? Do they have some like nefarious plan to steal more of my stuff? I'm probably going to go freeze my credit for now just to be safe but should I go file a police report? Should I even be worried?

452,"I posted here a few days ago about how I suddenly had anxiety about hanging out with my friend, her new boyfriend, and their other guy friend that I’d never met before. I pushed past the anxious feeling I had, and went out with them. 


I ended up hanging out with the three of them again the next day (Saturday) and when I was alone with her and her boyfriend, they told me about how they teased their guy friend that they were “setting him up on a blind date”. They said he dressed nicer than he usually does, and he was more nervous and shy than usual. I understand they probably didn’t want him to feel like a third wheel, but I was *not* told this would be anything like that, and I just thought I’d be hanging out with friends. I was told about the teasing at the beginning of the day on Saturday, and ended up being super uncomfortable the entire day because I wasn’t sure if their friend was thinking if this was supposed to be a date. Maybe I’m just overly anxious and paranoid, but I ended up trying to avoid getting physically close to him and talked very little with him because I didn’t want him to get the wrong idea. 

I kinda feel like I should’ve been told that they were even implying something like that to their friend, so I could’ve either a.) got out of going or b.) figured out a way to kindly say that it was definitely *not* a date. 

He says he wants all of us to hang out again soon, but I really just don’t want to.

I'm in a LDR (though I'm about to be moving in with him in a couple weeks). Currently I'm oceans away while he's had to work on an all-weekend job.

He basically worked all of yesterday until 1AM and woke up super early today to go back and continue the job. He's exhausted but I'm really proud of how hard he's working.

I want to send him something that he can come home to that will make him smile and hopefully cheer him up... But what can I send that will get there rather immediately?

I know he doesn't want flowers because he's not good at taking care of them.

He's an avid Gamer, loves League of Legends. He's a Foodie. And he has roommates that I can reach out to if needed.

463,"I’m 17 years old and my dad (46) left us when I was 9 years old. I never really saw him before that as he used to be away for work all week and be back for the weekends. When he was home, he would get angry all the time and yell at us to the point where I was terrified of him. I didn’t have any contact with him after he left and my mum has been bringing up me and my two older brothers single handedly for 8 years. She’s struggled to get him to pay his Child Services money, which is a sum of money he gives to her monthly in order to help support us, for years now. Not only did he often not pay it, he also took her to court trying to have us taken away from her, allowed his new wife to call her an unfit mother and a psychopath and just generally made the past few years not good for her. My oldest brother is 20 years old and a university student so my dad no longer needs to pay for him, my other brother is 18 and has just left full time education so dad won’t be paying for him anymore either. I’ve got about 8 months left before I also leave full time education and all CS money will stop. 

A little while ago, I started speaking to my dad again. We meet up occasionally for coffee or dinner and I’ve been to his house a few times but I wouldn’t say we have an entirely close relationship and I feel like he’s trying to speed things up before I’m ready, but that’s not really the point. A couple of days ago, my mum received a call from the Child Services Agency saying that my dad has informed them that I “stay round his house one day every week”. Which, if it were true, would lead to a reduction in the amount of money he would need to pay for me monthly. This has made me quite upset because it feels like he’s using our new relationship to avoid paying for me. Both my dad and his wife have access to his account so either one could have told the CSA this false information, meaning I don’t know who to trust as both have a history of lying about this sort of thing. It also almost lead to an argument between me and my mum because she thought I had been staying over at his house and going behind her back this whole time (as she stays at my stepdad’s every weekend, she thought that I had been staying over at my dads when she wasn’t home and lying to her about it). 

I know that he’s very much been an asshole before but should I confront my dad about this situation and tell him that I want him to sort it out before I speak to him again? I want him to know how upset this has made me but I know that he will deny it was him, or protect his wife if it was her who told the CSA that information. I don’t want to end the relationship between us because he’s still my dad but I also don’t know if I can trust him now. I just think that if he’s willing to lie to an official organisation to avoid paying for me then maybe he’s always going to be that way. But at the same time, he might not know anything about it because his wife has gone behind his back and used his CSA account to spread misinformation without him knowing in the past. I’m really upset because I thought things would be better now and that he had changed but now I’m not so sure. On the other hand, I can’t decide whether I’m just over reacting and I’m only upset because of things that happened in the past and not this actual situation.

466,"So, there are two of them. I will explain the situation with both and try to explain my stance on them. However, day to day interaction is becoming increasingly difficult.

#1 I have a co-worker who is in his 50+ years and he is very adamant about a few things:

- he's writing a book that he's been writing for no short of 5-6 years and made 0 progress on. Yet he talks about it non-stop.

- he's in a comedy stage group with his wife and constantly tells the same 4-5 stories everyday to co-workers, customers, and myself.

- he constantly is talking about politics, however only the Politics he wants to talk about. If anyone has a different opinion from his own suddenly he doesn't talk politics and gets very angry. He has yelled at customers before over this topic.

- (my personal pet peeve) he changes his story/opinion on different events purely because of the person he is talking to at the moment. Essentially, he's a kiss-ass to everyone in the room even if it means he is obviously lying to cater someone's beliefs.

- He also takes every opportunity to backhand shame younger co-workers for having more aspirations in life than his own. He has been in our industry for 20+ years now. He's never made an attempt to do anything else at all. He never will as long as he doesn't get fired and we all know that including himself. 


#2 The other co-worker is a 30+ mother who has a lot of very annoying childish behaviors:

- She still considers liking Nirvana and Linkin Park to be a personality.

- She constantly talks about her 3 kids with every single customer. Especially when she gets to show pride in how she disciplines them. She loves getting to talk about that.

- She takes pride in continuously informing everyone about how young she looks and how ""people think she's like only 15 everyday"".

- She is an anti-vaccination mom (not going into my stance on that) but she shames other parents for it openly, she also doesn't believe in medication and shames customers for their beliefs on taking medicine because ""the government tracks us through our pills""

- Probably worst of all she is very open about shaming younger female customers who are prettier than her because their ""Looks aren't everything"" and someday they will ""wish they could look like her when they have 3 kids"". We work near a Victoria Secret, one day she told a young newlywed customer that if she ""needed to buy that stuff to look pretty for her new husband, he didn't actually like her."" That poor woman looked crushed by that comment.

- She also fake laughs at EVERYTHING and it's a very loud hyena sounding fake laugh. It's worse than Fallon's fake laugh. 

- She also constantly takes it upon herself at every opportunity to talk about how shit men are in everyday life. Openly. To her male co-workers faces. She baits other females at work into her opinions on men purely to get them to admit to hating men as much as she does.

469," 

This has been bothering me since I found out and I need  help deciding the best course of action so they I do not hurt anyone any  more than they already have been. Sorry if the format is wonky.

I’m changing names for obvious reasons. 

So  I’ve worked at a restaurant for about 6 years and everyone who works there is extremely close and closer to me than my family.

 My  friend Dante worked there when I first started and everyone has always loved him dearly. He was 15 when I met him and I’ve watched him grow into an adult. About 2 years ago Bethany started working at our place and her an I instantly became best friends. She is a very strong woman. She doesn't put up with anybodies shit. About a year ago Bethany and Dante started dating. They hated each other at first and now they are super in love and the most cute together. She lost her virginity to him. They waited and took things slow. I have found it very refreshing to have a friend who has a healthy view of sex. Most women I know have been abused or assaulted, and Bethany has not dealt with any of that. 

So Dante and Bethany have lived together for the last 4-5 months. Things are going great and they are starting to plan a life together. My boyfriend and I go on double dates with them a lot. We are all very close. 

About a year ago my friend Cassie got a job at the restaurant. I have known her for much longer than that, and many others working at our place have known her so she got the job without an interview or anything. She is loved by  everyone. About 6 months ago she came into work crying and shaking and completely distraught. She confessed that she had been raped that night.  She was not okay at all. Everyone was very supportive and nobody was pushing her to say who it was or anything she wasn’t comfortable with. We let her have as much time off as she needed. She put her 2 weeks in shortly after and got another job. It was weird because she was so happy working at the restaurant, but she makes more money at the other place so I didn’t think anything of it. I haven’t seen her for a while and she has a lot of kids and I’m in school so we haven’t talked much. 

I just  found out a week ago that it was Dante that raped her. The details are not good. I am super he might blame alcohol or something, but I know that doesn't matter regardless. He also knew about the rape as well because we all (him Bethany and I) talked about it. Which is extra fucking disturbing because that means he knows Cassie considers it a rape for sure. He and Bethany were together at the time it happened. He raped my friend Cassie and cheated on my best friend. I am pretty shook up.

My dear friend Megan was the one who told me. She grew up with Cassie and  is much closer to her. Cassie is very upset still and has been debating on telling Bethany about the rape. Megan assumed I knew and then told me that Cassie would be upset if we told anyone else so I have to keep this a secret. I don’t think I can. 

We all work together, I hangout with Dante and Bethany at least twice a  week. These people are basically family. There is no way I can watch Bethany plan a life with someone who has done this to her. They just bought tickets to Europe together and a bunch of other things. They are planning on what’s gonna happen with them when she is done with school.  They have talked about kids eventually. If I didn’t know about the rape I would say they are the perfect couple, super healthy and open with each other about everything. 

What would you do? I have thought about confronting Dante directly and  telling him the usual “if you don’t tell Bethany I will”. It’s also weird because I don’t want to breech Megan’s trust or cause Cassie any more turmoil than she has already been through. 

 I have thought about telling Megan I can’t keep it to myself and seeing what she thinks.

I have only told one other person and they even thought about never telling Bethany, since they are so happy together, but I am completely against that. If the situation were reversed I would want to know.

I’m just not sure what the best course of action is. I want to be respectful of everyone that deserves it. I also want this to be over with fast because I cannot watch Bethany be with him anymore. I have been faking it for the last  week and as a rape survivor myself, this has been mentally exhausting and awful.

Thank you for reading this, sorry it was long. ",08Sep2019,2
470,"I'm only into older guys who're 20-35. I don't know why. I wish I found guys my age attractive, it would be a lot easier to find a boyfriend but I just find other teens to be as annoying as I am. Anyhow.. I've been talking to this older guy on grindr. I lied about my age and used faceapp to make my face in photos appear a bit older (how i'll look similar to in the future once I grow some facial hair). It seems to work great to attract guys to message me on apps and give me much needed attention. 

I really want to be honest with this guy I've been talking to but I know he'll be scared by my age and possibly how young I look still. He'll most likely just block me. I really hate how age of consent laws keep everyone in perpetual fear and don't do anything to address those like me who have old souls in younger bodies or prefer dating adults. I understand why they exist (to protect innocent children) but as for me I'm fully capable of consent at 16 and I'm tired of these outdated laws preventing me from living and learning from my mistakes or even going on a non-sexual date with a older guy as if that would be such a crime.

I can't wait to turn 18 at this point. Does anyone get where I'm coming from or am I the only one who feels this way? Was anyone else only attracted to adults as a teen? I've tried discussing this topic on lgbt-friendly boards but they all get removed/deleted. Lame.",08Sep2019,0

They always talk about how much they hate their exes (friends and other relationships) where they talk about going to their house, fighting them, and has even mentioned extremes of cutting brakes or slashing tires. I havent told them much about myself luckily and this is definitely including where I live. The thing is, theyre extremely judgmental and overall disrespectful to nearly anyone. They make fun of peoples weight, hair, and overall looks. I mentioned my boyfriend once and got a response of ""Why are you dating someone like that"" when I talked about a light hearted joke. I never want to bring him around now or even talk about him because I dont want him to be judged whether it be to his face or not.

I dont know if Im right for feeling wary or overall just afraid of how shed react to me ending the friendship whether it be any time soon or later down the road.

473,"I have been friends with this guy for 4 years now. We met in 6th grade and now we’re both sophomores in high school. We ride the same we talk to each on the bus, and no we don’t have classes or lunch together. And this started last year. He stares at me on the bus. He stop is before mine so when I getting on the bus he is already staring at me. Last year he would do the same thing but he would sit in the seat next to mine seat (not next to me). But this year he started sitting in the seat behind mine. I have in that same seat since last year and he knows that. And it’s not like he had to move or when he gets on the bus he immediately sits there, and I know this because I caught him switching seats on Friday from the seat he sat in last year to the seat behind me. I usually I’m one of the last people to get on the bus, but this time I was one of the first so I saw him. And now that he sits behind me he continues to stare. And one time I had to sit next to him because the bus got crowed (I usually get a seat to my self) and he just kept looking at me. He pretended to be on his phone but when I looked at him, because you know that feeling when someones looking at you I got that feeling, he was looking at me and as soon as I looked at him he immediately looked at his phone. And what usually happens when I look at him he stares for like a second or two more and then looks away. Now me being a clueless girl, just it was weird. It doesn’t really make me uncomfortable it just confuses me and kinda pisses me off. I hate when people stare at me I don’t know I’m weird. But I was ranting to my friends (who don’t know him) they started saying stuff like “I think that he likes you”. And was just saying that no he doesn’t because again, clueless. So then I talked to my best friend to see if he can observe on the bus (we all ride the same bus) and he said (after we got off the bus)“yeah he stares at you a lot and when made jokes he kept looking at you” and then I asked what does that mean and he said “he might like you” and mind you that I’m not really that pretty or have the best personality so I’m still in denial. And back when Fornite was still relevant he would ALWAYS talk about how many kills he got how won all the time he only stop doing that when I said “I’m really sorry but I don’t care”(this was last year) and the next day he was saying how Fortnite is garbage and all that, it really confused me, but once again clueless.

I dated a couple of guys here and there but it never worked out because I would tense up whenever they would touch me and I never felt comfortable explaining to them why. I started attending counseling on campus and it helped but the scars where still there.

Then I met my now ex boyfriend. I met him at work and we hit it off right away. We would joke around with each other and I actually felt safe around him instead of afraid. I was even able to explain my past to him and he was very understanding and patient with me. Eventually we became official and then he told me he loved me and I lost my V card to him. After sometime, I realized i loved him too and I told him so.

It wasn't long before he started talking about marriage and asking how many kids I would want and what names. This weirded me out a bit because it seemed like too much too soon but he was so in love with me. We talked about moving in together, we met each other's parents, hung out with each other's friends. We never fought once, it seemed so perfect. 

A while into the relationship, he started withdrawing from me and when I asked him what was wrong he would just say that he was tired. He finally told me that he did want to talk and he told me a lot of things that were bothering him. He was I wasn't showing enough emotion, he said he's never seen me cry and that I'm not affectionate enough, that I never wear the clothes he got me, that I talk about my problems too much.

I told him that I really didn't want to lose him and that I would do my best to change. That was about 2 months ago and now he's broken up with me and I don't understand why. I thought he was happy and the reasons he gave were so weird. He said he likes to go dancing all the time but he never asked me to go, I would've said yes! He said that we aren't compatible and that we aren't into the same things. We both cried and at the end he didn't even want to say goodbye so we said, ""see you around."" 

I'm so confused. If he can't even stand to say goodbye to me then why break up with me? I don't know he how could be so in love with me and then fall out of love so quickly. just 2 weeks ago we celebrated my birthday and everything seemed fine. I slept over 2 nights in a row and I thought he still loved me then. I wish he would've told me what the problems were so we could at least try to fix them instead. I wish I had suggested to him that we try taking a break instead of just quitting. This is the longest relationship either of us have ever been in. I though I would spend the rest of my life with him and now I'll probably never see him again. I can't cope with him being a stranger to me.

I've barley been eating or sleeping. It's only been 2 nights since this happened. I've taken sleeping pills to help me both nights but I have dreams about him and when I wake up I'm crying again. I keep checking his social media and the morning after he broke up with me he posted stuff on twitter about football, it's like he doesn't even care. This hurts so much, I don't know what to do. I just want him back.

TLDR: My first love broke up with me and I can't imagine my life without him. All my future plans revolved around him and I feel like I'm never going to connect with someone in that way ever again. It hurts so much to think that he doesn't love me anymore, that never seemed possible before.",08Sep2019,7
477,"So 2 days ago, I met up with a guy I met on Tinder. (I know, not the best place to meet someone but we’ll roll with it.) He’s 21 and I’m 18, and we both go to the same college. When he first saw me, he hugged me. He happens to know my brother; they’re both in bands and happened to play together one time. We got some lunch on campus and talked for about an hour. We had a lot to chat about, and he seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say, and thought I was quite funny. He gave lots of eye contact and I’m pretty sure he glanced at my lips a few times. At the end of the casual date, he told me “it was nice getting to know you Julia, just let me know if you want to get together again!” And me, being the awkward person I can be in these situations, said “yeah, thanks again!” And turned around to walk in the opposite direction. He probably would’ve hugged me, or had more of a proper goodbye, but I freaked in the moment. I think maybe I didn’t convey my emotions well enough, so he doesn’t think I’m interested. Or, he’s not interested? I haven’t texted him since then and neither has he. What should I do? Do I wait for him to text me, or is the ball in my court? He did say that the next few days were going to be extremely busy for him; he has a gig and is making a music video. I just never know how this whole dating thing works, and I’m tired of making the wrong moves",08Sep2019,1
478,"Hey reddit! I need some advice on a bad roommate. I've tried talking to him, but either won't listen or doesn't care. So, a little context. I live in a college owned apartment with 4 beds 2 baths and a single living space. Place is like a mirror image. So, I moved in awhile ago and he just moved in like 3 weeks ago.
Well once he moved in he brought this aweful smell to our side of the place. I've asked the other roommates if they smell it as well and they did. After this he started pissing all over the toilet and floor. It bothers me but I can tolerate it. He hasn't showered at all since he has been here. Today is the first time he has done any laundry. 
So I'm asking what should I do? I was thinking of going to the building manager with a petition to have him removed from our place, but that would displace someone else. I don't know.

479,So I need some advice. I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now we got together in July 2018 but I don't know if I still like him. I really care for him and I love him but I don't know if it's in a relationship type way like I wouldn't see us getting married or moving in together or anything like that. I sometimes think about ending things but I know he still really likes me and I don't want to hurt him. Our relationship isn't new or exciting anymore like we've been together for a year and we haven't done anything intimate together as he says we aren't ready for it. I recently have had to move away from him because of my family and I've wenr back to visit him but I don't think he'd ever visit me. I like it when we are together because he makes me feel comfortable and makes me laugh but I don't know if that's because I just like him as a friend or as my boyfriend. Can someone please tell me what they think?? Thanks,08Sep2019,3
481,"Just as the title says, I am asking if I should continue my tenure in the AFROTC.

Here is some background and context:

For those of you who don't know, the AFROTC stands for: Air Force Reserve Officer's Training Corps. In short, it is a program that I am taking while pursuing my college degree that trains me in preparation to be a second lieutenant in the Air Force upon graduation. I am on what's called a Type 7 scholarship, which is pretty competitive and covers my tuition. I go to a top 10 school which has given me no financial aid. In addition to this, the private scholarships I have received are seemingly menial in comparison to my large tuition fees, so the AFROTC scholarship is extremely helpful.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

I'm in my third week of college at the moment (I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Biology), and, at this point, am considering dropping from the AFROTC program. In short, the main reasons I am considering dropping the program are as follows:

\-the time commitment is detracting from other aspects of my life (not much time to join clubs, socializing with friends, schoolwork to some extent, etc.)

\-I seem to have a lot of anxiety associated with the ROTC

\-In my heart I don't know if I can say that it is the right fit for me

\-It seems to be adding a fair amount of stress on my already stressful situation

\-I feel as if I joined up for the wrong reasons (if I didn't receive the scholarship, I don't know if I would participate in the ROTC)

My parents are coming down to visit me on campus next weekend, I'm planning on discussing this with them at that time. The tuition assistance from my ROTC scholarship is huge for us, and having to tell my parents that I am considering throwing that away breaks my heart (the benefits from being an officer in the military is also a big plus in their eyes). Everyone back home is also expecting me to become an Airman out of college, and letting them down breaks my heart as well. I know it is illogical for me to have a true understanding of the program with so little time invested in it, but I have been going to all the optional meetings and I have tried getting involved, and I still struggle seeing myself continuing on with the program. Any and all advice and input is greatly appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read through my problem.",08Sep2019,2

483,"title is the tldr:

Ok small background: my wife's father was given an ultimatum by my wife's step sister long before we had a child ""choose me and my children, or choose her"" (her being my wife/his biological daughter).

He basically choose her, my wife's step mother apparently threatened divorce when he tried to maintain separate but equal relationships and since it's been he calls her like twice a year. 

We've since had a child who (she's now 4) and he has minimal relationship with her. 

After months of silence towards us and lack of response when we asked him if he wanted to see his grand daughter we basically came the the conclusion that this behavior is not healthy. Every Christmas he has awkwardly shown up with WAY too many expensive gifts that clearly had no thought other than dollar value for our daughter who we have been very careful to try to raise to be happy without materialistic things (she has toys but we try  curb the ""I  wants"" and keep things simple.

Well he texted my wife the other day after months of him not responding to phone calls and texts asking when our daughter's birthday party was. She didn't respond hoping he would take the hint. We decided to give him one last chance after Christmas last year to make an effort to see her (like he promised her to her fave) or it was over. He made zero attempt. So we decided he wasn't going to get an invite to the birthday party for his yearly attempt to absolve himself of guilt for literally being a shitty father and grandfather. 

He then reached out to my wife's mom and asked when the party was since my wife didn't respond. She knows the situation but  due a stroke it left her with a mental capacity of a 12 year old and so she didn't see an issue with telling him when it was.

My question for advice is how do we tell him not to show up?

Letting him show up is not an option. He needs to be told not to show up and my wife is so stressed out by the whole situation she asked me to deal with it. 

How/what do I say? I'm ok if he blames me. I have thick skin and I'm ok if he blames the ""evil"" son-in-law rather than be introspective if it keeps his manipulation and just general toxic behavior away as every interaction he's had with my wife and daughter the past few years has not left either of them in good spirits.

484,"Hey Reddit,

I need some advice to deal with my landlord. I moved a few months back into a really nice room in a shared flat and have generally been very pleased with the neighborhood and flat since then. The landlord seemed nice at first, though he had a few quirks: he wants the rent to be paid in cash (I presume to cheat on his taxes, though that's not my problem), and he is the only one who can control the heating in the flat through an app on his phone. Both of those things were not disclosed prior to my signing the lease. The rent includes the electricity and water bills on a fixed rate. 

He receives letters at the flat and the rent is paid by putting it in a safe in the flat (through a slit in the safe, it's super sketchy). That means he has access to the flat and come at least once a month, which I didn't really mind. I have 4 flatmates so there is always some coming and going. 

However in the last few weeks the landlord spontaneously decided to do some home ""improvements"". He put the lights in the bathroom and kitchen on a timer and they work on a movement sensor basis. I've always hated these things and would have considered it a huge downside if they'd been in place when moving into the flat. Now, the light turns off if I sit down too long on the toilet, or am in the shower hidden by the curtain. I fucking hate it.

I complained to the landlord and asked if he could please ask for our opinion before doing further changes since we are the ones living there. He ignored that text.

Today he was back to install similar lights in the hallway. Once again, he did it stupidly. They don't turn in when you come into the flat, you have to walk half way down to my room. It's super annoying and inconvenient. Forget sitting down to put shoes on or do anything that requires not moving for a bit as the lights will turn off.

Seeing him this morning I asked to be informed in advance if he was going to do further work in the flat since it""s a huge inconvenience (for example today he kept turning the electricity on and off for two hours). He was surprised by this (???) but said ok. 

Anyway, legally I know where I stand. I could probably hire an electrician to take the sensors off if I wanted to and be legally ok, but that'd be open war for sure. I need advice on how to handle this diplomatically and/or thwart the light sensors. I am considering buying a lamp for the bathroom because I am that annoyed, but I hate having to spend money for something that used to be there !!! 

I am seriously considering moving out over this. However the flat is absolutely perfect, I've never been so happy in a rented flat before. I'd be really heartbroken to leave over this.",08Sep2019,9

These days I actually only ever see this friend on her birthday so it's kinda like we missed our annual catch-up, and I feel really bad having not contacted her about it for so long.

This is what I sent her:

&gt; Hey man, this is really out of no where but I just wanted to say sorry for not responding to your birthday invite this year. I was kinda going through some shit and I've really just been avoiding social media for a while. So I was going through Facebook notes today and saw the invite and yeah, wanted to tell you that I still appreciated it and I'm sorry I didn't tell you at the time.

I sent that yesterday and she hasn't replied (and hey, I can't talk). I know she struggles with anxiety too so it could just be that, but I wanted to get a second opinion. How would you feel if you received this text from a friend? Is it weird? Is it a bad apology?

Now I'm on my second year of film, tv and multimedia university.

Lets be honest, I'm a dreamer.. and I really love my profession... but still, I contemplate about everything in my life, this too. As a student... filming weddings for additional earnings is not bad. Yeah.. I make great money for one day of work.. the only problem is - I really hate to do it. The day after filming the weeding I'm feeling just like an used whore.

I worked on short films, tv shows, promotional, event videos and so on. That's something what I want to do. Especially as a part of film production crew. Ultimately that's why I'm going to the university and why I'm in this profession. The problem is they are not offered on regular basis and often enough.

The easiest and the fastest way to get money is with weddings. The problem is - my general outlook on the world is that everyone (regular people) is stupid and that I want to punch most people in head because of it. I have my pride and I'm sick of stupid ideas, primitive weddings customs and partys, moronic ""wannabe wedding photographers"" (the ones doing it as a secondary job and are in belief they have knowledge about profession but in reality they are just stupid idiots without basic culture and mental standards.

I got an offer to work another wedding next week but I'm feeling really bad about it. Still, as student from not really rich family... I need money and it's ""the easy way"" to get it... definitely easier than working as bartender or something like that.

So.. Reddit, help, what should I do? My idea is - if I don't want to work on that particular wedding next week and I refuse - that move is going to be more than just that. It means for me that then I'll refuse every wedding in the future. In the end maybe that's the point? Maybe I don't need to work on weddings and I should remove that distraction from my life and dedicate myself to something what suits me better? Thanks! ;)",08Sep2019,3
498,"Warning: Long af but please read. 

Timeline for reference. Met her in December, told her I had feelings in February and rejected, remained friends until June. This all happened this year so its all recent. 

Some back story, I met this girl in school, we got to talking and I eventually developed a crush on her. I eventually told her and she rejected me because she was depressed and wanted to fix herself before getting into a relationship which I accepted and moved on. We remained friends and she remained depressed and I was always there for her in her dark days to provide a person she could talk to. This was all over text and she seemed very grateful for it as she would always end the talk with ""I love and appreciate you"". She would tell me all her dark secrets of her past and its all very personal, which makes me wonder why she blocked me and cut me off if she really did consider me a friend. Besides being her go to for emotional support, we were still good friends in my opinion. We would have random conversations, she would send me pictures of herself of the places she visited (She went on a trip to San Francisco and sent me pictures she took of herself while there, and of other places she's been to before), we would also hang out once in a while. This all seems like the characteristic of real person. If someone was being truly fake, I personally feel like they wouldn't have to do anything besides hang out and talk, but we did more than that, and the talking I feel like was on another level because of the dark confessions and random pictures she would send. I would also send her songs and motivational messages to her, but she never acknowledged them. I also would buy her food when we hung out and also got her gifts for special occasions, which she never said thank you for, which to me seems selfish and ungrateful on her part. I called her manipulative in the title because I feel like inside she knew I still had feelings for her and she knew she could use me to her own advantage because I liked her, and she did. I feel used and betrayed now because I thought we were good friends and I thought she was real, but real people don't leave. She had no reason to leave. Right before she left, I was in the process of cutting her off temporarily, just so I could get over her. But I was gonna come back, and I was gonna tell her that before she decided to leave. I was in the process by letting my feelings pour out. I told her how I felt like she would ignore me purposefully by taking long to reply even after being active, and how I am always thinking of her, and overthinking. Anyone that has ever had a crush on someone knows what I mean and how it feels to have a crush on someone and to overthink things. Those were just the start I told her and I told her I wanted to tell her more in person. All she said in response was that she was hurt and needed time to think (hurt over what? think about what? I ask myself now). I said fine and let her be. I always checked up on her the day after we would talk about her darkness, and so I decided to check up on her after this too. She never gave me a response on how she was feeling. A few days passed and I woke up to discover I was blocked everywhere. I decided to text her a bit more of what I have been feeling during our time together, but I'm not sure if she read it or even got the message. I didn't think anything of it at first, but now, after having talked to other people about it and having so much time passed, I realize she had no reason to leave and to be hurt, and that she just used me for her own selfish manipulative gain. I was the one who was hurt, but she didn't care, she just played victim and said I hurt her. We had music class together which is where I met her, and now that school has started again, I found out she decided to return. We made 0 contact that day, no hello, no eye contact, no nothing. I may or may not, I'm not sure, have spotted her staring at me for a bit a few times from the corner of my eye. I never turned to look at her directly, only when she got up to introduce herself to the class. I left before her that day, and that was that. I feel like she was being half fake, and half real during our time together, but honestly I'm not sure what to make of all this at all. I felt really sad initially after being blocked and for a good while afterwards too. After a few months passed, I started to feel really good about myself, but there are still times where I start to think and get really sad.  Writing this I feel fine, seeing her I felt fine, but the next few days after, I felt really sad. I told people I want to confront her and have hopefully an honest talk with her about why she left and why she did all this stuff to me and everything else I didn't have the opportunity to tell her, but they tell me its better off to leave things be and to just ignore her, but a part of me feels like it would be easier to move on if I confront her. Its her birthday next week, and I have an unused bday card. I have a short ""speech"", not sure what to call it written on my phone and I plan on writing it along with happy bday on the card and giving it to her. On it I wrote I want to talk to her in person, and if she accepts then to find me during class so we can talk, or if she doesn't want to, to just unblock me for 5 seconds on instagram saying just ""no"", and I will understand and move and and never talk to her again. I have that planned out for her. But should I really do it, should I confront her? I feel fine sometimes, but sometimes I get really sad and start to wonder why it all happened.",08Sep2019,0

It can also be questions like ""How are women viewed in society today?""

502,"I (M) just met a pair of friends, a girl and a guy, and the girl suggested to go for dinner between the three of us. I figured it would be a nice way to hang out and get to know new friends, so I said yes.

So we (me and the girl) texted about schedules and decided that we're both free on Wed/Fri, and I asked her to check with her friend which day he would prefer.

She responds back saying he told her he's busy and just us should go. 

I'm not really comfortable with hanging out with her one on one and she has previously casually mentioned that I could crash at her dorm if it's too late. I'm getting the hint that she might be interested in something more than a friend but I'm not and she technically hasn't formally stated anything.

So I responded back saying if the guy's busy I don't mind waiting till next week, and she responds back and said that the guy told her that just us should go.

I don't know if I'm reading too much into this but I can't figure out a way to politely turn her down without making the assumption that she is hitting on me. Is there a good way to politely let her know that I don't want to go if it's just us? I""m definitely interested to being friends but nothing more.",08Sep2019,3
503,"Two years ago I began dating this girl - this was not only my first same-sex relationship, but my first relationship in general - she turned out to be very emotionally abusive and a compulsive liar. I was still young, and so was she. 
A year later we broke up in a terrible way and I hit rock bottom because of what she had done - I had also done some bad things, but the people who helped (aka. Therapist, and wellbeing services) agreed that what she did was still unsolicited - yet she went on with life seemingly fine. She refused to admit what she had done, and wrote an “apology” that in affect blamed me and others for what she did.
Fast forwards to now, I still can’t get over it. I can’t trust people, and still feel like it’s what I deserved. Whilst she has moved on and is doing relatively fine (I know I can’t know what happens behind closed doors but she is still an active part of society, whilst I struggle to be). I must add that I don’t hold it against her, and I don’t wish her any harm. I am very happy for her and glad she has potentially changed. 
Is it okay for me to contact her asking why she did it, in order to gain closure and finally move on with my life?",08Sep2019,1

506,"So things got very complicated with a girl,
We went out a couple months ago, I found out she had a boyfriend so I said ""cool, let's enjoy it while it lasts and not take this too seriously"", maybe a month later she breaks up with him, we start spending a lot of time together but also started growing apart very rapidly, and then I found out she was going out with like 3 guys, got very mad at the time but I friend of mine put it best, ""why do you care if a single girl is seeing other people?"", And tbh she's right, mostly because we had a big fight at the time and I projected myself pretty hard (I used to be basically a fuccboi and hated it, after arguing with her for a solid hour I realized I was actually trying to fight some part of me rather than her) and damaged my ego at the same time, I fell into a really bad spot and started going to therapy, 
I'm in a way better place now, I sorted some stuff that was bugging me since like my teens and I'm trying to get my life back on track full speed, but this girl is trying to come back into my life, 
Back we she broke up with her bf she started to demand a ton of affection and emotional support from me, that's why I originally thought she wanted to take things seriously, and now she's back with her shenanigans, from what I was able to piece together her life is in shambles now, and she only has her best friend and her boyfriend as close friends, everybody else left, and she messages me or tries to get in touch with me a couple times a day and tell me how shit she feels, it's basically the same deal as it was before, she comes into my life, demands a ton of me emotionally and then vanishes again, she said she wanted us to be friends but she only remembers me when she's feeling down, which I wouldn't mind coming from anyone else, if anyone tries to tell me they're in a bad spot of course I'm all ears, it's horrible being there and feeling alone, but to be honest I still kind of resent her, I've denied my friendship to toxic people before but I still think she's a great person and would hate to see someone like her have this kind of issues, 
I'm basically an adult (25) and I have a gf that tags me on everything funny she sees, so I'm doing pretty well and have enough stability of my own to be able spare some for people that might need it, i've helped people try to get emotionally back on their feet before, I love providing support and caring for people, but if I'm honest with myself I don't want to help her, but I would also feel pretty bad if I left her like roadkill on the side of the road,

507,"I recently found out that the reason my parents split was because my mother was the victim of domestic abuse when I was a child.

She remarried and changed her surname to my step-dads  surname, who for all intents and purposes carried out the father role in my life more so than my biological father. I however kept the surname of my biological father.

It hasn’t bothered be before carrying a different surname to my immediate family but due to recent revelations around the domestic abuse it has got me thinking I might like to change it to my mother and step-dads. More so for when I marry and have kids of my own, I wouldn’t want my family to carry my biological fathers name.

The reasons why to do this are obvious, it makes me feel sick to the stomach when I think about it, when I think about him even more so. However the cons are what is making me hesitate: 

1) I am close to my grandmother on my biological fathers side. She knew about the domestic abuse but doesn’t know that I now know about it. I would rather keep it this way and I can’t see how I could change my name without hurting her.

2) how much hassle is it for a name change? I could and should probably google this but I imagine it is a bit of a faff changing accounts and passports etc.

509,"My brother will drive off places on the weekend without telling anyone in my family where he’s going. Sometimes he’ll dress up, other times he’ll dress casual. He’s been doing this on and off for a few years. He’ll be gone for hours; anywhere from 3-8 hours at a time.

He’s 31, single, has never had a girlfriend and does not date. He also has very few friends and doesn’t go out much. We don’t have the best relationship and have rarely ever got along because.

I don’t think he’s living a double life so thats out of the question but he’s extremely secretive and it’s so weird for him not to tell his family where he’s going EVER. If we ask him where he’s going, he either doesn’t respond or he says “I’m going out”, seeing things very vague. He had this small friend group a few years ago. We never met them (still haven’t) and it took YEARS before he ever told us their names.

510,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months (not that long) and I know he has always been a flirt. I mean we met at a bar ourselves and live in a young area near the beach with a lot of beautiful people. He has always assured me that he just flirts with bartenders here and there for drinks. And I trust him. I mean is you don’t have trust in a relationship, what is the point. 

I’m currently in Italy for work for 3 weeks. The last week he is coming out to travel around with me and I’m so excited. Then today I receive a message from a women on Facebook. She sends me screen shots of her conversations with my boyfriend over the last few months. She tells me they met 5 years ago and haven’t talked in years but she reached out a few months ago when her boyfriend and her broke up after he cheated on her. She didn’t know he was dating anyone. He never made it public on Facebook he had a girlfriend and I didn’t really care about making a big deal about posting I had a boyfriend either. 

She sent me screen shots of him saying things like “I think a NSA fuck with be great with you” and “would be so hot if you just threw me down and mounted my face as soon as we got there” and him sending nudes to her. She was the original one who reached out to him but didn’t seem super into his responses. She said she never ended up meeting up to hook up. 

I had posted a cute pic of us on Facebook a week ago and that’s how she found me. She saw we were dating and was super confused which prompted her to contact me. 

I asked her to try and ask him if has had a girlfriend. She messaged him and asked about who the girl was in the cute photo he was tagged in. He said “it’s just a photo”. She responds “ohh cause it looks like a gf kinda photo” to which he responds “don’t overthink things” 

I’ve been cheated on before. The last time with someone I was with for 5 years. Someone I really loved and trusted.  

I was getting to the point of really whole heartedly loving and trusting this guy. 

I met his entire family (even extended) on a trip 3 weeks ago. We are so good together. He was joking with his friends that he was going to propose to me on our trip!! 

But I’ve always hated that he is always on his phone. Always. I never creeped or asked. Because I feel like if you don’t have trust in a relationship what’s the point. 

But now my heart is broken yet again....

I feel stupid...

Is this the only girl or is there more? Probably more. 

And he is supposed to fly here to Italy in one week. Everything we booked is non refundable. He used his credit card miles to book the flight.

512,"I live in a five bedroom duplex. We pay a lump sum of rent to our landlord every month. Currently living in the house are myself, my (now-ex) boyfriend, and another male.  We are all on the lease. We have two empty rooms which we still are financially responsible for (like I said, we pay lump sum). This past Sept. 1st, we split the rent three ways between us. Well, my boyfriend and I then broke up. Not even a week later, I noticed lights and TV sounds on in one of the supposedly empty rooms. I asked my other male roommate if he knew anything, he told me that my ex was telling him recently about letting a female friend move in. I guess that happened yesterday. She is not on the lease, I’m guessing. 

Short of contacting our landlord to get this chick legally kicked out for living here unauthorized, I would at least like some of my money back that I paid for September. The three of us essentially paid for this girl’s room and she paid nothing.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

528,"Posting this because I'm not sure how to appropriately address the situation.. 

My boyfriend recently put a $200 deposit down for a tattoo and then paid another $300 for the first tattoo session (he has not actually been tattooed yet). I don't know if the artist asked for the $300 or if my boyfriend volunteered to pay beforehand, but bottom line my boyfriend has invested $500 in this tattoo so far with a well known and seemingly well regarded tattoo artist.

His appointment was supposed to be a week ago, but the artist texted him that morning and asked to reschedule and my boyfriend said OK. The rescheduled appointment was for today. The artist texted him yesterday and pushed the appointment back an hour, and now texted him again today - an hour before the re-rescheduled appointment and asked to push the time back again. 

He also told my boyfriend he would send some of his ideas for the tattoo (based on an in person consultation) but he never sent any. 

My boyfriend is fed up and it's safe to say the professionalism of the tattoo artist is lacking, especially be it that he has been paid $500 for work he has not even done yet. 
In my personal experience with my tattoo artist, I have never been canceled on or asked to reschedule and always paid after the appointment except for an initial deposit when he first tattooed me.  And after I consulted with my artist he sent me two digital renderings of his idea and plan almost two weeks before our appointment so I could offer feedback and he could make any changes. That is what I would expect from a tattoo artist, especially one I have already paid. 

I am encouraging my boyfriend to ask for a refund and find a different artist because this one is not reliable. He doesn't want to find a different artist cause he really likes this artist's style and work but he doesn't just want to be canceled on and left hanging all the time because there are few times when knows his work schedule and can guarantee he will have off. He is basically always on call. 

Is it reasonable to just cancel business with the artist abruptly and ask for a refund? The only concern is not getting the full $500 back. 
No contract or anything like that was signed for either payment but I'm not sure if there are any ways the artist can basically not give the money back. I'm sure the $300 can easily be refunded but I'm a little concerned about the $200 deposit because I know sometimes those are nonrefundable. 

How should my boyfriend approach this with the artist? Should he talk to the artist before just canceling all business? 

Thanks!",08Sep2019,2
529,"Some background: my sister has always had a very difficult personality—very hot and cold and big mood swings. She has suffered from depression, anxiety, and has been diagnosed as bipolar. She has a prescription for lithium, but doesn’t always take her meds, and she continues to drink frequently, use her adderall prescription recreationally, do cocaine sometimes, etc. She also doesn’t routinely see a therapist, even though she could really benefit from it. She has had a couple of past suicide attempts (pills) and been in intensive inpatient mental health programs afterwards as a result. 

She never applied herself in high school, but in college something clicked and she set a goal of going to pharmacy school. She started working and studying really hard, and decided that she wanted to go to pharmacy school in the city where I lived (we were both several states away from home, but in opposite directions at this point).  She applied early decision and got in, and it’s a great school! I never asked her to plan this around me, but I was excited to live near her again. 

Fast forward a few months, and me and my husband were getting miserable at our jobs. We both traveled 50-75% of the time for work, and we have a 2 year old who we were basically trading off single parenting every week. We were only together as a family on weekends, and it was taking a toll on us and a huge toll on our son. We realized we needed to make a change for the sake of our marriage and our child. We looked for other jobs in the area, but there weren’t any opportunities that were a fit from a travel/skill set/interest/salary perspective. We ended up both finding jobs in a new state and decided to make the move. I was really scared to tell my sister because I knew she would be upset, but we really needed to make this change for our family. 

When I finally did tell her, she freaked out and claimed she wanted to drop out of pharmacy school because she was going to be so lonely and not know anyone, and claimed that I was the only reason she applied to that school (even though it’s a top program, and I NEVER asked her to apply there). After a lot of tears and silent treatment and arguments, she finally decided to give it a go, and she started school there a few weeks ago. 

Fast forward to last night—my sister FaceTimed me sobbing about how she had a panic attack and can’t go back to pharmacy school and how she has no friends yet and wanted to apply for a job instead, and we talked for an hour and I told her that only she could make the decision about what was right for her, and I would support her, and that also it was still early and she would make friends. She seemed to be calming down a bit and in a better place, but then started spiraling again about not being able to go back. I told her I was sorry and that I had nothing else I could say than what I had already said and that I loved her, and she abruptly hung up. Then, I reached out to her asking why she hung up and that I was just saying I had no more advice, but I love her and I was sorry and I would support whatever decision she made. In return, she texted that everyone would be better off if she died. 

I told her that was absolutely untrue, and told my mom (who is on vacation out of the country) to call my sister. My sister didn’t answer, but instead texted my mom alluding to taking a bunch of ibuprofen trying to kill herself. My mom called 911 and they sent and ambulance and took her to the hospital. She is in detox now, but it looks like she was quite possibly lying about taking any pills and just had alcohol in her system. 

It’s really complicated to know how to feel in this situation. Her emotional well-being is such a vicious cycle, and it feels like constant eggshells around her. I want her to be happy, but at the same time, she needs to step up and be responsible for her emotional well being at some point and take her medication and meet with a therapist regularly. She’s 22. We can’t all manage her happiness for her. I don’t blame her for having depression/bipolar/anxiety, but like any chronic condition, she needs to take the steps to manage it with the tools she has available. I just see how much my parents are hurting in this situation too. It’s such a fine balance in my heart between compassion and anger, and then guilt for feeling angry. 

I don’t feel like I have the emotional capacity to handle this any more after spending my entire childhood dealing with this and always being second fiddle to my younger sister’s outbursts and needs. My parents always drop everything for her and indulge her and cater to her every whim, and I’ve basically been the forgotten child my whole life. It’s made me strong and independent, but has ruined so many moments of my life that should be happy. My mom almost left my wedding because of something my sister did at the reception, and it ruined a good portion of what should have been one of the happiest days of my life. I’m just so tired of being embroiled in this, but then I feel so guilty for feeling that way because she is my sister and she is struggling and I do love her. 

How do I help? How do I balance her well being and mine at the same time?

Tl;dr: sister has struggled with mental health her entire life and I’m reaching a breaking point of trying to make/keep her happy and feel lost and guilty about what to do.",08Sep2019,1

534,"Our wedding photographer was someone whom we had shot our engagement photos with. Our engagement photos were absolutely beyond she was fun to work with. Got our photos back to us fast and everything was perfect.

Fast forward to the wedding in June. She sent us two photos as a tease two weeks later. 6 weeks after the wedding (when my invoice says I’ll have my photos) she still hasn’t sent me anything. Contacted her and didn’t hear back. She finally texted me back she was still working on them and I would have them in about a week. Two more weeks went by and nothing. So I texted her again and finally got them 10 weeks after my wedding.

And they SUCK. Like bad. We paid extra money for 2 photographers and it looks like there was only one. All photos are from the same angles with no variety. So our entire ceremony and reception all look like one photographer stood in one spot the entire time. We paid extra money for her to come earlier and take getting ready photos, there are 0 of the boys even though they spent over an hour there. She had the shot list in advance and still missed important family photos that we asked for. There are about 3 decent photos of my husband and I alone. None of them look natural or happy just awkward. Everything is edited yellow. The group photos with the wedding party are mediocre. The reception photos are edited terrible so all the girl’s faces are white from the flash. Lots of photos are crooked at are not straight. Lots of random photos that look like she took them just to have photos. We also took her aside to a special spot in the reception hall for extra couple photos and all of those are not include either. The list goes on and on.  

I politely messed her back we were not happy with them and she responding apologizing and asking why. I explained they were nothing like the quality of our engagement photos, as well as pointed out that many moments were missing such as the boys getting ready and the reception hall spot.

She never texted me back, again. Our package included the online gallery (which we received), as well a flash drive, 50 prints 5x7 prints, and 3 bigger prints of various prices, amongst other things. 

How do I handle this?

I would have been fine if she just gave me the rest of the photos and maybe offered to re-edit some. Unfortunately we can’t exactly go back in time and repose or recreate all the moments she missed. But now I can’t even get her to respond? And I don’t have the rest of the items I paid for?

Advice please.",08Sep2019,1

Hi all... 

first, this is a throwaway account because I am and my school are linked to my main. 

Last night, my roomate had a party in our apartment/dorm. I'm 18, female, and just starting college in the U.S (for context) 

Anyways, I was up doing homework until around 10pm or so and just wanted a drink to get to sleep easier. I'm trying to recall all the details because this is important. So i went out of my room (We have private rooms, there are 4 people in this dorm/apartment. Inside is a small kitchen and living room, everything on the first level so I was honestly 10 feet away from the party in my room. These are dorms on campus but are styled as mini apartments. Important to note since it's a school dorm, we don't have locks on our own private rooms.) 

When I went out I was handed a drink by someone there, I never saw his face. The drink came over my shoulder and I remember downing it in less than a minute. It was only a beer. There was a ton of people, maybe 60 in the living room, almost all guys. I don't know why I thought it was safe, just maybe felt secure because it's my own apartment. 

I didn't talk to anyone. I went into my room to just watch youtube until I fell asleep, usually takes me like an hour. Around 20 minutes I felt so weird like I'm a lightweight so I was probably just drunk but it felt like a different drunk.. I felt like I was just on top of it all (if that makes sense) My entire body felt like it was just floating. Then I guess I just fell asleep. I have no memory of anything.

I just now woke up. This was friday night and it's sunday at NOON. Wtf?? 

I don't know why I slept so long, I wasn't THAT tired. Most i've ever slept is maybe 14 hours when I was sick. 

When I woke up, I wasn't wearing clothes. Which is weird because I always wear clothes to sleep (shorts/tank top) On the floor next to my bed were my shorts and tank top and my tank top had been ripped, like TORN apart. 

I have marks on my stomach, almost like fingernails. I have them on my back too. For a side note, my ""area"" hurts. Like it really hurt to pee when I woke up and I'm having a hard time walking. 

I'm a virgin, I haven't had sex or anything yet. 

I don't remember if I did anything or if there's another explanation for what happened...

Could I have been sexually assaulted? I'm so mad, I really don't remember anything and I'm trying to rack my brain. How would I not remember anything, was I that drunk?? 

I asked my roomate if she saw someone hand me a drink, and she didn't even realize I went out there. I asked also if she knows everyone who went and she said she knows a couple people but that they invited a ton of others and random people just started showing up, there wasn't any way to keep track of who was there. 

I don't want to go up a crazy rabbit hole here. I don't remember anything happening. But i have marks on my body I can't explain and I feel like something did. I don't know what to do, if I should really just leave it alone (because I don't remember it) and give myself peace of mind, forget everything, or if I should try to do more digging. 

Could there be another or ANY explanation for this situation? Any advice is appreciated here. I don't know what to do...",08Sep2019,16
536,"  I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

I am currently in a really depressed state and idk if it’s the school. 

i have the option to move to a government s chool that’s A LOT closer to where i live which means i can wake up later in the morning but the school doesn’t have  such a history but still doesn’t have a bad history. the work is a lot easier and but i don’t have the option to take Spanish and i can’t do that IEB system thing whatever. a lot of my primary school friends (i’m still very good friends with them now) are going there. they say i’ll be one of the “popular” kids if i go there but i don’t really care about that tbh. the school is wayyyy bigger and so are the classes. i’m wondering if it will be better for my mental health to change(i’m medically diagnosed with depression).

540,"Hello all, just want to say thanks in advance for any replies/advice . Will try to make this shorter but no promises :)

My issue I need help with is getting my life going in the direction I want . I’m 26 years old CT resident, living at home, &amp; I have no real career path set in stone . Once I finished high school , I started community college with no real idea on what I wanted to do or why I was even there , other than my mother telling me I NEEDED to sign up in order to do well in life . Made it thru 2 years but by the end of the second , I’d done my basic courses &amp; kind of slid by with barely passing grades .


I quit after the second year as I was no longer invested &amp; just wasting money . So bad in fact , that my last few courses I took that were online basically failed me for lack of participation online, even tho I did all the coursework &amp; graded well . With the fails on my record, I now owe money to college, which I can’t really afford to pay back .

I’ve been working in retail pharmacy for 6 years , pretty much where I went after I stopped college . The issue with this is there is no room for growth &amp; the yearly raises along with the terrible staffing I’ve dealt with had turned me away from the field . I decided to take a “leap” this year after a brief work break from January to March &amp; started working for a Medical Marijuana Dispensary. The pay was better but the commute, with no car &amp; using ride share apps basically negates the raise &amp; I’m basically bringing home less than I was before &amp; the staff &amp; customer nade are just a bunch of pot heads , not looking for any real medical help . Some patients are amazing &amp; really there for the medical benefits but 90% of customers just want to get high &amp; I feel like I’m doing nothing all day . Sorry for ranting, I promised I’d try to shorten this but I don’t share with many &amp; I want to make sure I don’t miss anything .

I want to quit but my mother &amp; family are telling me to stick it out . My mother, who I live with always gives “advice” but if I don’t take it , loves to rub it in your face . While I’ve grown used to it, it’s still hard for me to go against &amp; I don’t know why . For happiness’ sake, I want to quit but I don’t have a set “job” in place . 

The reason for the quotations is because I ventured into a side project once &amp; had moderate success ! I started an online community via YouTube &amp; in a few short months, went from zero subs/low viewers to over 4000 &amp; over 1.5m channel views ! While it’s not A LOT , it was a ton to gain in just 3/4 months time . My new uploads were gaining traction right upon upload &amp; my community recognized me on other platforms ! But my computer was dated &amp; couldn’t handle it . I would like to buy a new one but I’ve either had low pay &amp; high bills/“helping at home” ($500 a month to live at home= $300 for rent, $200 for food help/house items) or decent pay like my current job, but it’s minimum $25 a day for transportation. 

This wasn’t well written out but my point of all this is, should I focus on happiness of myself &amp; quit this current dead end job ? Or should I keep on with this &amp; hope for a light at the end of the tunnel ? I know I need a computer to continue towards my goal but I don’t see how I can honestly do it if I have no money to save . I feel like I’ve wasted years helping my family &amp; now that I’m older , my family keeps on throwing in my face how I live at home , yet none know I pay rent &amp; I don’t want to embarrass my mother by telling them this .

Any advice would be appreciated , just trying to figure out where to go next 😪",08Sep2019,2

I love my dad so much as well, but it's just not the same. So, I was really upset, and I told my dad, ""I wish it would have been you and not her"".

Additionally, I'm involved in a lot of extra curricular activities. Most of these meet for an hour or so a month and are nothing too much time commitment wise, but I'm also a member of a pre-law professional fraternity and my school's debate team, both of which eat up a sizable chunk of time each (approximately 5hrs/week for the frat and 10hrs/week for debate normally, plus travel for tournaments thusrday-Monday once a month).

Well come tomorrow, they dont want to wait for me and just continue watching. its pretty much impossible for me to have the time to catch up without them stopping.

This drives me nuts. Is it really impossible to just wait a day so that i can watch with the group? Can i get shown a little loyalty? it seems petty, i know. But all i ask for is small loyalties. Even considerations, whatever. Just act like you care as a friend a little bit.

558,"I like time to my self and I like a bit of peace and quite, just like most people, however, most of the time I feel starved of social interactions. I’ve just finished college (about to start university) and I have a healthy number of friends who I see most days but nearly every single time I am on my own I feel very unsatisfied and almost painfully bored. I have a few hobbies that I do to try and occupy myself when I’m alone like running and painting, and I watch a fair bit of TV too but I always end up wanting to be with other people. It’s not so much a feeling of loneliness just without other people I’m almost always bored out of my mind. I know most other people have this feeling too but I feel as if this happens a lot more frequently with me than it does with others. I’d like some advice on how to be happier just by myself, how i can comfortably be on my own and not be constantly thinking about being with other people.

For reasons I don’t want to go into, the father would not be around to support me if I have a child. I’m terrified of the idea of being a single mother, especially at my age, I don’t know if I’m strong or capable enough. But to choose not to at my age will likely mean I never have children and that decision will be with me forever. Either way it feels like too big a decision to even begin to take because the consequences are so huge. I’m so sad and frightened and I don’t know what to do.",08Sep2019,7
560,"TLDR:
Best friend has a lot of problems, and usually only comes to talk to me when she needs advice or to vent. I always check in on her, see if she’s okay, and ask how her days been. I feel like I’m putting more into the relationship than she wants to, despite saying that I’m her best friend.  



Okay, this might sound immature, but it’s taking a toll on my mental health. So, my best friend (F18) and I (18M) have been best friends since Sophomore year of high school. After I graduated, I moved across the US with my family. We still talk every day, but it’s starting to take a toll on me. Mostly because I’m her outlet to vent, and she’s had two breakups since I moved and she’s unfortunately been involved in drama in both cases. Don’t get me wrong, I want nothing more than for her to be happy so I’m glad to be the one who gives her advice, but it’s just stressful. I struggle  with my own mental health, and sometimes it just becomes too much when I have to deal with how much she has on her plate as well. She’s the type that will say “Ima focus on myself, so I’m gonna be single for a while” and then the next day be with another guy. I don’t know why she feels the need to be in a relationship all the time. Recently... things have changed. I feel like this is a one-sided friendship now. When she was with her boyfriends, it was almost like we never had anything to talk about. I’d always check in on her and see how she’s doing, or try to start conversation, but she doesn’t ever do the same. It’s like she doesn’t have any interest in me unless she needs advice or to vent. And I know that she doesn’t, she calls me and we talk and just chill out, but recently it’s just like she doesn’t care much about me. She only comes to me when she’s having a problem, of which she has a lot. Almost every day. I don’t know how I should say that I wish she would just check in on how I’m doing. I had a mental breakdown while I was on the phone the other day with her, and she comforted me then, but never even asked if I was okay after that. When she has one and comes to me, I see if she’s okay for days afterwards. I feel like I’m putting in more than I’m getting.",08Sep2019,17

571,"I can sit down for hours and explain this situation, but let me give you this quick back story:

My siblings and I were neglected by our parents for all our lives. The younger two were born when I was 8 years old in Ohio and until a couple months after my 16th birthday, I parented them while our mother dealt with depression, going out, yadda yadda. Around this time, I gave up and went to live with my grandparents in Texas. Time passed, I moved to another state to live my life.

Around April of last year, my loving mother made the choice to pack everything she owned, including the twins, and went to bother my retired Grandparents. More yaddaing and this lady ends up in a prison in Ohio for reasons that have nothing to do with what I need advice on.

Well imagine how these two twins grew up. They were kids basically raised by a kid. In the 3 years of time that we were separated, my mother had them fending for themselves. No education, no rules either. Maybe the twins thought they lived in paradise? They're 11 now and have progressed in life dramatically since they lived with my grandparents.  *Retired* grandparents. Imagine how two 60+ year olds had to adjust to these super twins with energy that could power New York City in the event of an emergency and still have some to spare?

Then, with a cherry on top, they're in this Autistic Spectral thing that I never really cared about. You might wonder why, so just imagine how a kid would feel if half his life was taken from him to watch his mother's children? Well that kid grew up and he wants to do the best he can to help these twins.

If you're wondering about the school, the twins basically had a bad day at school like any other child would. I think? The problem with this private christian school, is that it's a private, christian, school. Other kids told their parents, parents complained, then the twins got the boot. That smells like a money situation, which we (my grandparents and I) do not blame the twins for.

I need advice on what can I do to get these guys the education they deserve. They need special one on one type teaching, I don't have any resources for Texas, neither do my grandparents. It's literally my grandparents taking care of them while I'm on the sidelines giving moral support and school supplies. 

Should I go back to Texas and physically be there for them? What can I do to help my brothers?",08Sep2019,1

576,"I'm very worried and was really hoping to get some advice. My (f22) boyfriend (m24) quit his job a couple months ago and has been looking for a new job since. He was a manager at his old job, but only managed for maybe 8 months. Before then he was a cashier, stocker, team lead, etc. He quit because the working conditions were really awful. He wants to go back to school and finish up his degree (he'll be getting his associate's), but he hasn't gotten it yet. So he has been hoping to get another kind of manager job for now. I thought that it was unlikely he would be able to get a decent manager job with only a high school diploma and less than a year of manager experience, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be rude or intrusive or anything and have just tried to be supportive and assuring for him. 

He has an interview for a really decent non-manager job in like a couple weeks. To me it's a really great position considering his experience and education (the place is hiring so many people that he has a good chance of getting in I think and the pay is very decent). It's a really legit job because the place is extremely reputable, and he was looking forward to the interview. Recently though, he got hired by this tiny store as a manager, with the additional responsibility of ""consultant"". He's supposed to start this week. Basically, the owner got all his money buying and selling things in a different industry, and has recently (within the past year) opened a store. He has never run a store before. So in the interview, he told my boyfriend that he was going to hire him for absurdly high pay so that my boyfriend can manage and also tell him how to run his store. He said they will do a trial month and see how it goes, and that if it doesn't work out, the guy might keep him on for like 3 hours a week just to come in and do stuff (I don't know what).

All of this sounded fishy to me from the start. I was actually worried my boyfriend was getting scammed or something. Especially after I heard how much he's being paid. But I haven't said anything, because he can be sensitive about the job stuff sometimes and I also didn't want to rush to conclusions and say something I would regret later. So yesterday when he was all nervous about it I just said that he would be fine, he's always nervous about new jobs (he is) and this one's no different, and that he would be ok. In the moment I felt like it was the right thing to say because it calmed him down and comforted him, and I was starting to get used to the idea of his new job and was successfully worrying less about him being scammed or screwed over. Now I think I should have probably said something else, but what that something else would be, I don't know.

Anyway, so today I was talking with my mom and she stopped me at one point in our conversation. She said that she wanted to inform me that my boyfriend was lying to me. She said she looked up how much a manager job at the store my boyfriend will be working for pays and that it is not at all as much as he said. She said she looked it up after my dad mentioned to her that he didn't believe my boyfriend got a job for that much money. She said she didn't know why my boyfriend would lie to me, but that she wanted to tell me that he is so that I would know.

I don't know what to do now. I feel like I should broach the topic with him, but I have no idea how. I don't know what is true. Is he gonna get screwed by this place? Is he lying to me? I don't want to accuse him of anything and I also don't want to tell him what to do, so I don't know how to ask about either possibility. Should I leave it alone and let him be? There is a pit in my stomach about all of this. I love him very much, and have been with him for a year and a half. I wanted to eventually move in with him. I also love my mom and trust her to have my very best interests at heart. I just don't know what to do now. I have never been great at social stuff, and when it gets all complicated like this I have no idea where to even begin with it. I'm seeing him in a couple of hours, and I do want to bring up some of my concerns in a way that is healthy and respectful and kind. How do I communicate with him on this? What would you do in this situation?",08Sep2019,1

My problem is that I have never had a relationship, so I don't know anything about love signals and what not. And I'm really insecure when it comes to females cause of this
A little information about her, she have 3kids from earlier relationships, I don't mind it at all. Not entirely sure if she is in the process of a breakup with on of the kids father.
She have alot of friends and a caring family which she is close with. 

Onto us 
She is very friendly and pay attention to small details when we talk and can bring it up a few weeks later, always smile when we make eye contact and such. 
She invited me over to a party that I went for a month and a half ago, had a good time and I made some new friends, talked to one of them and heard  in the background that she said ""I like x"" assuming I did not hear I would guess? 
Messaged her the day after and thanked for the invitation and the good time. Also opend myself up to her and said that I don't have alot of friends and that I'm depressed so it meant alot to me. She told me that she was depressed aswell cause of her ex relationships, he was a real asshole apparently (dont know any details). I said if she ever wanted to talk I'm all ears.

Time moves on and we talk on the job as before, I start to text her on messenger and get replies and what not, likes stuff I post to my Facebook page. Giving me compliments and such.

Until two weeks ago everything felt great.
Then suddenly she stopped replying to my messages and barely talk on the job.
I asked her if she wanted to go take a cup of coffee someday, no reply she acts if she never read it. Super cold towards me in general.
This week we talked about going out a couple of job colleges and drink some beer and eat, she asked me first out of everyone and I said yes obviously. 
The day comes (yesterday) and it was the worst evening in a long time, we sat next to each other and she did not speak to me for more then 5minutes until she turned to the one on her other side and spoke to him for 2hours straight. Then he announced that he's leaving soon and I got my hopes up, only to come crashing down on me. She had to leave early aswell (they both said it wasent with each other)and I understand that she might have to leave early as she have kids and such. I sit there for 5minutes finishing my beer and decide I'm not wasting anymore time on this, don't know the other people to well and walk to the bar to pay my note. I say goodbye and have a good evening to everyone.
I walk home disappointed and really really sad, shed some tears as I approach my apartment and sit in the shower crying for 30minutes and go to bed (clock is about 21:30). I fall asleep immediately, I wake up at 23:30ish to piss and check my phone, there's a picture there with a beer and a text saying ""x I'm not leaving anyway"" (As if she realized why I left?)(she sent that 1hour after I feel asleep)  It really hurt seeing this and I could not go back to bed cause of it. 
So I have been debating with myself wether or not to text her but I decided to do and I asked how she was doing, I sort of regret it typing it here now since I have not had a reply (3hours have passed since she saw it).

590,"I know that this isn't an insanely serious issue, but no one around me takes me seriously when I ask for help or opinions so this is the only place I can think of to turn to.

(Next paragraph is just some basic background about why this issue developed, skip it if you want to)

I'm a 21 year old college student, and I've had on-and-off issues with myself since the age of 10. I was ostracized starting from elementary school for reasons not entirely known to me, though judging from the teasing and such I received I gathered it was because of my face and my hair color. I'm a redhead (not exactly a carrot top, more like a dull orange), and I'm extremely pale for obvious reasons. I also had a bit of an RBF develop from the teasing I had to endure from when I was young, because if I didn't have one then I would have often been crying during class. I didn't have many friends in middle school either, despite being one of the top players on a sports team. I was too awkward and scared to talk to people in fear of being made fun of or bullied. This continued through high school. In my first high school I did play sports, but some things happened in freshman year (I don't want to give too much detail for privacy reasons), and I ended up being cut from the team my sophomore year. This made my confidence drop even lower, since sports were the only thing I was confident in. I couldn't even speak above a whisper tone to many people, and  I developed depression and social anxiety, or at least something similar to those. I haven't been clinically diagnosed since I never went to any psychologist. Anyway, after my parents saw how bad I got and once I finally confessed to them about what happened in my freshman year, they pulled me out and I transferred to another high school for my last two years. The first year was still a bit rough. I wasn't comfortable in new places with new people for the aforementioned reasons, and I only made one friend. My senior year was better; I played multiple varsity sports, I tried to be outgoing and friendly, and I was actually really proud of myself. Then, someone from one of my teams spread a rumor about me that made over half of the team hate me, and since they were popular, that carried over into other kids from school as well. A lot of my newfound confidence disappeared after that. 

(Okay, this next part is more recent. The old stuff doesn't bother me anymore since it was years ago, I just wanted to give you an idea of why these issues started.)

In my freshman year and for half of my sophomore year of college, I had no luck in making any friends or even acquaintances. There were a few reasons. One, I was still unconfident and quiet, and obviously didn't feel good about myself. Two, I'm a scholarship student at a private school, and many of the people in my classes pay full tuition. They live a very different lifestyle and have very different outlooks on life, so we often didn't relate well. Many students in my major complained because they didn't want to work since ""Teaching kids is supposed to be easy! That's why I chose to do this!"" Also, for a long time, I really thought I was ugly because boys never approached me or tried to talk to me (super dumb, I know, but I was a teenager. You know how it is). I decided I was sick of this, and went to study abroad for my second half of sophomore year. It was the best decision of my life. I met new people, I was alone, and I was forced to be independent. I ended up finding a job opportunity and stayed in the country for an extra year, working and living on my own and meeting people. I became more confident in myself, and I loved being able to approach new people without shaking or feeling like I was going to cry. I returned home a very different person. However, I'm still not having much luck with interacting with my classmates. In fact, I'm a bit frustrated. I'm trying to be friendly, especially since I'm now one of the older students, and I am participating in classes now, which I never was able to do before. Most of my major is filled with girls. Many of them avoid me or still look at me like I'm a piece of dirt, which I'm not really sure about the reason for that. I put effort into my appearance now, so I always make sure to be wearing nice(ish) clothes and smile and be polite. I had much less problems while I was abroad, so I'm not sure what the problem is here. I try asking my friends and family, and they all just say things like ""You're tall and pretty, so when you're not smiling, they're intimidated"" or ""I'm sure you're just imagining it! Maybe they're just jealous?"", but how can that be the issue considering this has been happening my whole life? I've been confused about all of this for a while now.

To summarize: I finally developed confidence and believe that I'm a decent person, but I can't seem to get along with people in my area and I'm worried that it will start to affect my self-esteem again and my social anxiety might rear its head full force. Any advice on how to overcome this? It's nice having friends abroad, but I'm lonely at home and it would be nice to have friends I can actually meet up with easily. There's not many clubs at my college since it's small, and the city my college is in isn't very safe so I can't just go out alone and meet people easily. Sorry, I know this isn't a huge serious problem, but I really do need advice.",08Sep2019,1

593,"I really don’t understand why people cheat, why don’t you just break up with the person before you decide to go and cheat. Are you too much of a coward? 

My boyfriend has a friend we’ll call him (John), I’ve known John for over a year and we got a long well enough, he recently got into a relationship with a girl (Hannah). 

They’ve been together for about a month or maybe a bit less I’m not exactly sure.. and he has decided to cheat on her. When my boyfriend told me about this I don’t know why but I was so angry, as if I was the one that was getting cheated on. I couldn’t understand how stupid John was acting and how he could want to cheat on his girlfriend. I’ve met johns girlfriend twice and she’s such a lovely and funny girl. I’m not very close with her but, if I were in her position I would definitely want someone to tell me. I feel torn between telling her and not telling her. 

The girl John is cheating with does not know he has a girlfriend. He and his girlfriend had made plans today, but he decided to go out with the girl he’s cheating with instead. 

I don’t think it’s fair on Hannah at all, it’s disgusting. John is the most inconsiderate human being and he feels no remorse what so ever.",08Sep2019,0
594,So a friend of mine is a complete asshole and always makes fun of everybody to the point where everyone gets annoyed by it. He makes fun of me a lot especially in front of others which leads to the others losing respect for me as well and eventually they start making fun of me. Just for the sake of making fun of me he even lets out some things I tell him as a bro (example a girl that I like).  A few days back he was making fun of me and blamed some other guy and I ended up angry towards the other guy as well (I realised he was kidding after I cooled down). He is also very prideful and thinks he is top shit. When I had first met him I really enjoyed his company and thought of him as a good friend but now it's getting too annoying. At this point I am too annoyed of not doing anything because I respect myself too much. What should I do ? Should I still remain friends with him and ask him to reduce his bullshit or should I reduce my interaction with him and eventually finish my friendship ?,08Sep2019,0

596,"So im in Highschool. A freshman. And Im not playing any sports and havent been for the past 5-6 years. Almost all of my family is sort of pressuring me into sports. Such as my grandma who wants me to take every sports oppurtunity I can. And my cousins who have all played baseball, basketball, and football (one played all 3). They always talk about sports whenever im in the room or at the table. But I doubt my abilities to actually make it. Im going to shoot for soccer, but heres the thing where I live its considered a girl sport. And my relatives want me to be manly and play football which would apparently make me less prone to damage. And I think it would consider me not manly. And I want to be manly, not this 140 pound guy I am.

So what should I do. Just persevere and play football, play soccer, or just dont play anysports.

The players are about my age,(early to late 20s) all of them are well built and loaded with cash and all of them had beautiful girlfriends. I've never seen so many beautiful women in one place and it was overwhelming as hell. It  made me incredibly sad that you have to be a rich athlete to have a chance with a beautiful woman. 

This whole experience was a hit to the face, it sucked because I could not enjoy the party. All I was thinking about how inferior I am to these people.  I wanted to fucking leave and just bury myself alive. I never realized I had such insecurities hidden inside of me. I just did not feel like myself.

I have always been moving forward with my life, but I just could not help but compare myself to these guys and think how fucking inferior I am and how much I would give to get to experience their lives, even for a short while.

I am happy that these guys get to live such exciting lives, travelling the world with their beautiful partners and  rich friends. But holy shit, I am so jealous.

614,"Two days ago my boyfriend and I were in my hometown. We went out with my stepmother and had a few drinks. We decided not to go back to my parents house because their AC had just went out. So we got a hotel room. 

We went back to the hotel room for a little, then went out to grab some food before we went to sleep. We were waiting in line and this guy behind us started being obnoxious about our food taking too long. 

Well, we don’t work there, so it’s not our fault that our food is taking too long. I handed my card over to the cashier and then my boyfriend was attacked by this guy. 

Immediately everyone on the street started to beat up my boyfriend. I left my card with the cashier and then tried to pull my boyfriend off the ground and away from these people. 

Everyone was recording. Everyone. It was disgusting. I think it’s fucking stupid for anyone to be recording a fucking senseless act of violence, so needless to say I knocked this guys phone out of his hand. 

Then I was grabbed and cornered by four males as they told me how it ‘wasn’t okay that I tossed his phone.’ In my head I was thinking well it’s not really okay that you all just assaulted both me and my boyfriend at this point....... 

Anyway. I was frozen in fear. My boyfriend somehow came to get me and then of course got pissed that they had me cornered. Somehow we managed to run after that. The area we were in is known for gang activity and we didn’t want to get shot. On top of that I was so scared I coulda shit myself. 

Well, I locked my card thinking that I could just receive it from the McDonalds in the morning. 

Turns out, it wasn’t there. 

Turns out, the card was declined for ~11 charges, from Venmo to Travelocity. 

I think that this was a robbery now at this point and that the restaurants employees are involved. Because how would my card get in the hands of someone other than the employees AND my boyfriend get attacked at the exact moment we were paying. 

I wasn’t going to report it at first, because it was clear the guy was just looking for a fight and we happened to be the people in his was at the time. But now I think this may happen to more than just us. 


I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and I have barely been able to breathe since this happened. I spent the majority of that night hyperventilating on the phone with my mother. I’m worried if I file a police report that I’m just going to have to continually live it. I just want it to go away. I have never been so afraid for my life after being cornered like that. 

My boyfriend is very nonchalant and understands that what happened was just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But I have been living in fear just being in my house for the past 12 hours. I don’t ever want to go back to my hometown. And every second I see their faces looking down on me about how fucked up I am for shoving their phone. I shouldn’t have done that obviously, but I was just so angry that he was being attacked. They shouldn’t have been recording for fucking world star. Like how fucked up is this fucking world that they would stand around and laugh while my boyfriend is being beat up???? 

Anyway. I’m just wondering what I should do. I have a corporate career that I love and I’m scared that an unprofessional video of me pulling my boyfriend away from the attackers will hurt it. I’m also worried that filing a police report is just gonna keep the trauma fresh in my mind and I’m not gonna be able to get over it any time soon. And if this was a robbery, how do I make sure more people don’t get hurt from this type of shit?",08Sep2019,4

I should start by saying I don't really like the school I'm going to very much right now, it's pretty heavy on Greek life and partying and there's not much else to do because it's such a small town. I've felt really lonely these past few weeks despite being around people just because everyone is so cliquey here that it's hard to make new friends. To try and wrap this up I've been thinking about moving to Montreal or Vancouver for the past few months and I'm wondering if it's worth it/the best way to go about doing it.

But as the night goes on we played some beer pong and then we went and sat down. So like it might sound like everything’s going smoothly like that’s what I thought and that’s what all my friends thought, but while we were sitting down she was ranting about how she came to this city and how she doesn’t know anyone, and then she asked me if I wanted to be her best friend, you know what I did?

So I'm a 16y/o guy and I'm really bad at talking to girls or anyone in general idk i feel dumb if i start a convo with someone new so i just wait till they talk to me first wich might never happen.

And currently i've decided to take equitation classes and out of nowhere i see this girl i've only talked to once when i met her where we had the same class together in like a university event and it went well, she was alone so was i so i asked if she wanted to sit next to me and she did and we exchanged a small convo i made her laugh a bit then we followed each other on istagram and never talked again after that. So back to the important part: i saw that this girl is in equitation club so i decided that this was my chance to talk to her and ask her for her opinion on that club and if i should join it.

But the thing is like i said i'm really bad at starting convos and I'm afraid that if i ask her about that club and she answers me we might never talk again afterward cause I don't know how to keep a convo going or how to talk to her again after i've asked her.

619,"A few months ago I heard from a friend that their ex boyfriend admitted they have an addiction to CP. I've been sitting on this information for a few months, I've been trying to convince her to report him but she's scared to report him because she fears retaliation from him. She feels that he's 'rich enough to never go to jail over it so what's the point' and so he'd come after her. I've been trying to convince her to report it, but she's just too scared. I don't want to go over her head and report the abuse because she'd likely get in trouble for not reporting suspected abuse and possibly have her daughter taken away, which I definitely don't want for her. She's a great mom, but she's just too scared of this guy to do the right thing.

From the second I met him (even before I knew who he was) he gave me the creeps. At my job I regularly interact with people who are accused of sexual abuse (especially towards minors) so I feel that I am pretty good at picking up on creepy vibes. That being said, I have NEVER felt more uncomfortable than I am when I'm around him. He's likely a textbook sociopath, at the very least an incredibly manipulative creep. 

I've seen the way he interacts with my friend's daughter (and his daughter which is the same age), there's something definitely off about it. Recently her daughter mentioned something about her and him taking a shower with his younger daughter. I know that over the course of their relationship he's been left alone with her daughter, and has partial custody of his daughter so there would be plenty of opportunities for him to abuse them. More recently my friend mentioned that his ex wife said accused him of abusing their daughter but she relies on him financially so she didn't report him. Upon hearing this piece of information I again urged her to report him, but she's still too scared. The way I see it, he's manipulated these women into compliance, but I want to do the right thing. I don't have anything to lose or gain. I just want to protect these children since they can't protect themselves. Especially after hearing about his addiction to CP, I feel he's probably very likely to be or become a 'hands on' abuser.

620,"I’m normally a motivated, hard-working guy given the right circumstances but recently, I’ve been under a lot of financial stress. Growing up, I was raised in a well-off Asian family with helicopter parents. Having to face this challenge of being an independent adult alone for the first time is something that’s completely new to me.

It’s been so stressful too that it’s been slowly messing up my sleeping habits, killing my motivation, and leading me to becoming a shut-in. I quit my first job out of college after one year a couple of months ago because the stress was too much. Now I’m just bumming around at home, making half my salary before but with no real structure or direction in my life. Part of me just wants to stay in this state of relative but flimsy comfort for as long as I can. I just never had to take responsibility for myself before, and it’s something I’m ashamed of.

Normally, people would blame their parents for not exposing them enough to stress as a kid. I don’t want to fall into this mindset forever. For the first time, I want to take full agency over my own life. I want to stop myself from this downward path I currently see myself stuck in before I spiral out of control.

636,"So I got a job interview (this isn't a situation where I desperately need the work though) and they posted me the information for it -it mostly looked pretty normal  - except for one thing....they have sent me something they call a 'shield exercise' which is a picture of a shield (like a knight would carry) but blank and I am supposed to draw/write in the areas of the shield things that important to me (like hobbies etc) and then bring it along and talk about it at the interview. 

I'm not into this. I don't like expressing myself visually. I don't like companies that communicate like this. I don't feel like they're taking me seriously, taking the job seriously - or they've been focus grouped into doing this shit and are going to be up their asses and a pain to work with. 

So I'm going to cancel the interview. I'm going to email them on Monday and give them a 'thanks but no thanks' buuttttt should I tell them WHY I'm cancelling? Should I tell them that this 'shield' shit is putting me off? 

Also willing to hear from people who think I'm over -reacting. Has anyone got any insight into using these methods? Why do you think requiring a qualified adult with excellent references to do a child's art project from a shitty after school therapist's office is a good recruitment tool?

638,"So the thing is that since we were in high school, around 2015 the three of us started to connect and get along really well. Me (M), the other dude, let's call him John, and the girl, from now on, Liz.

In 2017 we entered college, and all of us got into the same major, so we spent all day long together. John always had a crush on Liz, and he finally ask her out that same year. She said yes and became a couple. I was super happy for them, as they are my best friends. 

Since then, we always hang around together and I am almost part of the relationship due to our closeness, it was never awkward. Sometimes we considered ourselves as a trio (kinda as a joke), but everything was going just fine.

The juicy part starts know. Recently I've been spending a lot of time with Liz (e.g,  courses in which John didn't enroll), so as a result of that much interaction I'm starting to fall for her. I feel like we have so much in common, and every interaction is a golden experience to me. 

Now, I obviously don't wanna be her boyfriend, and ruin their relationship. I  really appreciate their friendship, and don't want to mess things up. What should I do to forget her romantic style? 

Also, take some distance would be weird, because everyone knows we are super close, so is out of the table. Another things is that I doesn't really have a lot of interaction with other women, so this affects me even more, I think. Thanks",08Sep2019,1

643,"my boyfriend (19m) and I (20m) both rushed the same business fraternity on campus. We were both originally in a social fraternity but it got kicked off campus while we were pledging for hazing... that aside I was looking for something new to give my time to and the business frat is all about making world connections and becoming a better interviewer. 

My boyfriend, while extremely qualified, turned in a half asses application because he was confident the people he met liked him enough and he did not care too much about the paper applications. His application was denied and he was denied an interview while my application was accepted and I was scheduled an interview. 

He did not even tell me he was proud of me or even a simple congratulations, he just got sad. I was looking for his name really hard on the interview sheet and I read a name of someone who also used to be in our old fraternity and he got upset. “Anish got an interview but I f*cking didn’t?” 

He then stormed out of my house and went to go hang out with his other gay friend (to which makes me uncomfortable but that’s a whole other story) and he told me he did not want to talk to me for a little while. 

The next day (today) I had my interview and I purposefully bombed it and seems uninterested because I felt guilty. I am honestly still hoping I get invited back to the closed events even though I purposefully tried to get denied because I feel like my boyfriend is over reacting. 

Like I understand being sad because you got denied from something that your boyfriend got and our relationship has a little competitive energy to it to keep us both very driven but I feel like he is over reacting and i’m looking for any advice I can get to calm down or see it differently.

644,"I have a three year old child who was born with male genitalia. Because of the young age, xe hasn’t had an opportunity to decide which gender (if any) to adopt, so we’ve made a point of keeping gender biased pronouns out of the house. 

While that’s been easy (and appropriate) we’ve encountered a problem at daycare. Unfortunately, teachers have repeatedly referred to our child as “he” and “him”. We’ve had this happened in our presence.  

We spoke with the owner about our concerns, but found her to be dismissive. Importantly, this is the most progressive daycare in our area - organic meals, a strong focus on environmental stewardship, and extremely diverse.

We’d like to keep these pronouns out of our house, and away from our child’s developing mind. Unfortunately, my partner and I both work - so daycare is a necessary evil. This can’t be an abnormal complaint...

669,"These little shits are going around my mother's town fucken up everyone's property. They smashed in her pvc vinyl fence along with about 3 other neighbors 6 weeks ago. She filed a report with the cops, that did absolutely nothing. 

She has home security cameras already, covering the entire property, they even have the little red recording light you can see from the street to let you know you're being watched. She has the stickers and signs placed over windows and doorways with the brand name of the cameras alerting people they're there, as well as ""beware of dog"" signs on her gates. 

We caught these little shits on camera when they first hit her fence, theyre in the 12-16 age range, on bikes. They even went as far as setting up lighting on their phones and used a professional camera to record themselves jumping into the fence and crashing through. Which tells me this is a big premeditated plan, not some spur of the moment dare.

 Her cameras are good quality but it is hard to make out much detail between it being dark (2 am) and the fence and trees in the area etc. And since these are just kids on bikes, not in cars with license plates,  what the hell would we even do if we could clearly make out their faces? Cops aren't going to canvass my moms neighborhood going door to door searching for these shits, so what do i do?

It happened again recently, right after she finally got it repaired. My mom has dogs and i don't want them escaping or getting hurt in any way. 

Upon speaking with some neighbors, i found out that they also shattered another's fence,  and took some lights off others property to smash them in driveways. 

If we do anything directly, we'll just be making ourselves a target and they'll probably step up their game and start keying cars or something worse.


Is it true you can be sued or get in trouble if someone injures themselves on your property, even if they were there to commit a crime ? 
Because if not I'd really like to make sure all the rusty old wheelbarrows, rakes and other tools from my moms shed are strategically lined up in her backyard behind my fence so they'll break an arm or something on their way in next time.

It happens the same day and time typically so if all else fails I'm going to be strolling her neighborhood with a paintball gun through out the night.

671,"So we had 2 cats (both female) for a while and they got along pretty well, and importantly didn't pee everywhere. When we got a third cat (female), it was clear the two didn't get along with the new cat. Cat 3 would always pick fights and traumatize the other cats, but still nobody peed on the floor, even when we moved houses, they adjusted pretty well to that. Then we got a dog. We went with a golden retriever because the oldest cat was best friends with our old golden. But our new dog just scared them off and chased them. We put gates up to block him from getting downstairs to the litter boxes and upstairs to where the cats mainly stayed. They started peeing upstairs on bathroom rugs, the carpet, and on the beds. We tried moving a litter box upstairs, but they still peed on the rugs, carpet, and beds. 

Now this has been going on for about a year and the cats are starting to pee on the main floor where the dog is. Our whole house smells like pee and it was depressing my mom. She broke down yesterday and told me how much its bothering her and felt bad about getting a dog. She told me she can't live like this anymore, she can't afford to get the carpets cleaned or replaced. We need help figuring out what to do. We can't figure out how to get them to stop peeing everywhere, but we don't want to get rid of the cats since they pee everywhere, so I can't imagine anyone would adopt them. I have no clue what to do and we need to do something soon because my mom can't take it anymore.

677,"So I am in the process of tapering off my antidepressant after being on it for about 14 months before the taper. The reason I am tapering off it is because it is making me feel numb, and my energy levels are low. My psychiatric physician's assistant is tapering me off the medication slowly and its a difficult wait. I was on 60 mg of fluoxetine and now I am on 20 mg for about two months. She wants to lower the dose to 15 mg in three months rather than one due to concerns about relapsing. I understand that she has to taper me off the medicine, but this numbness is unpleasant.

I talked to my therapist about this and he told me to try to feel the carpet in my home with my feet to see if that helps. I tried that. I felt the carpet physically, but no emotion. His advice wasn't working. 

This is a really tough situation to be in. My PA can't discontinue the medication cold turkey, but this long taper is really prolonging the problem. I had to resign from work due to not feeling capable. I think that nobody really cares about my numbness but me, which is why my primary care doctor and psychiatric physician assistant aren't helping as much as they should. Honestly, this low energy and numbness is serious if it led to me resigning from work and if its causing me to complain for months. Also I would like to add that if the medication is making me feel so numb that it is affecting my ability to perform at work, then that warrants discontinuation. If I didn't resign, I could be terminated (fired) and finding another job would be difficult since many potential employers ask why you left your previous job as a means of weeding out applicants.

680,"I am currently 17 and will be 18 in a week. Recently, SAT scores came out and mine was not satisfactory to me or my parents. The first day, I cried and dealt with it. The next day, my mother shouted at me, calling me vulgar names, calling me dishonorable, calling me an embarrassment, hit me on the head with her fists and threatened to kick me out once I turn 18. She placed a camera in my room and calls me through it when I am not studying. 

This morning, she woke me up at 7am on a Sunday and made me take an SAT test. After, I was done, I prepared for 2 tests and 1 quiz that I have to take tomorrow. (I am a senior at high school taking 6 AP classes.) She demanded I take another test and I explained that I couldn’t because I had to study for my other tests. She, then, replied that I shouldn’t sleep then. 

Honestly, I feel like a prisoner in her house. I am not allowed to go anywhere or do anything. In this environment, I feel like I will most likely take my life if this continues. I want to go to friend’s house and run away. Any ideas on what I should do? This isn’t the first time she has done something like this and have resorted to physical violence in the past.",08Sep2019,1

682,"Hello reddit! It think this may be a longish post with not the best spelling and formatting since im typing this on my phone so its cool if you dont read it or anything. But everytime I think about this even that happened a couple of weeks ago I start crying for no reason which is very annoying since I rarely cry and I hope at least typing it out into the void might help.


So for a bit of context, I am an 18 year old uni student studying about a 10 hour bus ride away from home. At the end of the summer, I decided to visit home for a bit since I was working on campus my whole vacation, meaning I would have to live with my mom back at her place. Things were going pretty well for most of the week I was there, my mom was happy to see me, she got me some presents like clothes and korean food I could find on campus, until this one event that kinda fucked me up.

So I was driving home with my mom from the mall after buying some spa stuff because we were going to the bathhouse the next day. I deicded to ask her what it was like when she was my age going to America to the first time and seeing other ethicites for the first time, since she was from Korea (a very ethincally homogeneous country when she was growing up) and eventually married a middle eastern guy (my dad). On hindsight, this was a pretty insensitive question and hella stupid, and she basically got really pissed at me for asking it, and yelled at me a lil. This is also because shes relatively new at driving and was on edge cause shes not that confident. After that I shut up, I stared eating a pack of sugar snap peas, which once more in hindsight made lound crunching noises which pissed her off further and she kinda yelled at me to stop making so much noise, which I did. Idk why, but this really put me in my fucking feels and I teared up a lil. (Im not usually like this, its not like I was on my period or something so I dont know why I was so goddam emotional.) Right before I was about to compose myself, she noticed my eyes tearing up and asked me if I was crying. For some reason that set me the fuck off and I started tearing up more. She kinda like, bark laughed at that point and asked me if I was crying over sugar peas, except I couldnt explain that wasnt it and that set off full on tears. We were near home at this point, and then she asked me again why I was crying, this time yelling, and that made me loose my shit. I couldnt control my breathing, it was really fast, I was crying real hard and I was shaking a lil. She parked the car and slammed the door and left me there for like five minutes -I was still freaking out- before she came back in the car and parked it closer to home to bring back the stuff we bought. When she came back in she yelled at me again, asking why I was crying, but I didnt know and all I could say was please leave me alone. So she left me in the car and I started freaking out even more and couldnt calm down.


 Eventually I called a friend and asked if I could stay over and she said yeah, so I went in the house to grab some stuff like clothes and my wallet to take the metro. I was still breathing uncontrollably and crying, but I could like walk around and stuff now. When i went in my mom had locked herself in her room so I was undisturbed in packing until I left the building and she ran out yelling at me to get back in and that I was being crazy. I told her no, and went to the bus. She didnt follow until like 20 minutes later when she kept on calling. The first phone call told me to come home now, and I said no. On the second phone call she yelled at me saying that I was trying to kill her by doing this or something, which really pissed me off so I yelled at her for the first time in my life saying this wasnt about her. It wasnt until three phone calls she finally convinced me to go home because it was already like 1am, I was tired and my friend lived three hours away. I could have went to my dad only an hour and a half away, but he never picks up his phone and I dont like him or his girlfriend very much. When I went back home I stayed in my room crying all night, but at least she didnt come into my room all night. 

The next morning, I did something once more I never did before. I think its cause Im financially independent now and could just go back home or something if she kicked me out. But I kinda just yelled at her for half an hour while crying about all the shit she did to me when I was growing up. Like when she used to tell me she was gonna kill herself or my dad (she said its all just her joking, but my dad also has a restraining order on her that she says is bullshit) or when she kicked a hole in the bathroom wall when I was 16 when I locked myself in there because I had another freaking out episode. (She said it was because I wouldnt open the door and she just wanted to give me a yoga mat to sleep on). Or when she yelled at me for getting rejected by all the good colleges even though she never once helped me with the application process or read my essays or anything. But what I was most pissed off about was the fact that for most of my life whenever I would cry, she would either laugh or yell at me. (Both of which she denies, but im pretty sure this is what happened. She said she never laughed at me in the car but im convinced she did) My whole life I really just wanted someone to hug me and tell me everything was gonna be all right when I was sad. Thats what I had to do for her when I was in middle school and she was getting divorced and was an emotional mess and kept on freaking out about money and my dad. She never did that for me. I also did say that she low key made my life a living hell, as all throughout high school she would always come home from work really tense and I would try my best to be happy and cheerful for her so it wouldnt set her off even when I was sad. I guess it was an exaggeration though, so that was kinda shitty of me. 

She eventually said that she didnt know any of this, and always thought that I was happy with her and that I was her life, which made me feel like a major douchebag and maybe I was over exaggerating everything. Then she acted really nice the last two days I stayed with her and bought me my favorite food and stuff. She didnt hug me or anything, but that was nice. Then she told me to go see a therapist when I went back to school. (Im not, theres a whole day wait to see one and theyre fucking useless) 


Anyway, I really dont know what to think. Everythings back to normal, she seems happy when she facetimes me and asks me how Im doing and talks about buying me new things. Shes also thinking about visiting me this thanksgiving. But why am I so goddam emotional over this? I just start like crying randomly sometimes, even tho Im able to talk to her normally. Im just confused.

683,"I got in a relationship with her father before she was born (another story) so I’ve been in her life since day one. When she was a baby up til her toddler days she would be excited to see me, would cry when I would leave, would want to be with me more than her dad. She is 7 now and doesn’t say hi or bye  to me unless her dad tells her to. There was this one time that we bumped into her and her mom at the grocery store. She ran to her dad and greeted him and I thought she would then say hi to me but instead walked back to her moms side and didn’t even look in my direction when I tried to say hi. The last time we picked her up from her moms i got out of the car to open her door (so she could get in) and to hug her and greet her but she didn’t even look in my direction until her father told her to say hi to me. I feel like she’s become cold with me but I don’t know why. She lives with her mom and step father and the relationship she has with her step father is way different. When we drop her off at home she runs to him and hugs him. I understand that she sees him on a daily bases unlike me but I’m hurting when ever I see that because I wish our relationship was like that. I feel like an outsider :(

I never did anything to her for her to change towards me. When I think back, the only thing I can think of is me leaving for 7 months when she was about 4 going on 5. Could she have forgotten about the bond we had? Also, my schedule has changed in the past year where I don’t always have off on the weekends we have her so I only see her for about a couple hours before she has to go home. I 

It hurts me to think that she doesn’t respect me as a person or like me. I love that little girl. 

She doesn’t come to me for help unless her father is not present. When he’s around at the house and she’s over, it’s like i don’t even exist. Like she only talks to me when I’m the only one there that she can talk to. She doesn’t listen to me when I ask her to help clean up the mess she has done. She looks at her dad as if he needs to approve my “orders”. I don’t know if this all makes sense since I’m just rambling at this point. 

I’ve read online that the relationship between a stepmother and stepdaughter is different than one with a stepfather and I think it may be that but I don’t know. I just want help understanding what is going on and if it’s my fault? Like am i not doing enough for her or if I’m overstepping my boundaries? I don’t know. Please help me understand.",08Sep2019,3

687,"To start off i(16m) met this girl(16f) in 8th grade and se were friends for the entire year but she would always act a little flirty around me, being extra touchy(friendly punches, arm grabs, etc) for no reason at all in class and the hallways. Around the middle of the year I was in class minding my own business and doing my work when i heard her talking to a couple of people. When a guy asked her why she would hang out w me in class almost all the time she said loud enough to where i could hear that I meant alot to her and stuff about how i was funny and fun to be around etc. Eventually we stopped talking towards the end of the year and i cut off contact in the summer since she didnt seem to even want to be my friend anymore. 

In the middle of the summer we reconnected and there was never a discussion on why she stopped talking. When school started up she resumed her flirty behavior even ramping it up a bit. When my birthday arrived in september i planned a party w my group of friends and as soon as she heard about it she asked for an invite and seemed overenthusiastic on going. The party was fun and after we started talking and texting more. I planned to ask her to homecoming as friends since i didnt want to be a 9th wheel in my group but she was asked by another guy. I was bummed out but wasnt going to sweat it until a mutual friend(A) showed me screenshots of a conversation with her saying she would have loved to go with me. Homecoming came and went and i soon got the news about a week later she apparently had feelings for me. At this point i had feelings too and being too nervous i didnt admit feelings at all. About 4 months passed and she started to act flirtier and grew closer with me until I finally got the gut to tell her how i felt.

When i spoke my feelings on the whole thing she told me sorry but she didnt feel the same way. Being embarassed and confused I accepted it and decided for myself that i was played. When i told some of my closer friends what happened it was mutually agreed she treated me wrong so I decided to ghost her for the time being. Around 2 weeks later during spring break i got a paragraph from her insulting me for thinking she ever had feelings and for ghosting her and supposedly spreading rumors. When i brought up all the flirty things she did she told me she was being nice and denied any feelings. At that point i decided i was ghosting for good. I apologized for my actions and told her none of it was going to happen again.

For around 4 weeks I totally avoided and ignored anything from her and it seemed for a time she was doing the same. After those 4 weeks I heard she was talking about me to other people about how she missed the friendship and started staring at me in the hallways either with a look of sadness or anger. She re added me on snapchat and I ignored it until I felt guilty and decided to talk about it. I asked her why she added me and she told me she missed me a lot and she just wanted the friendship back. At first i told her i didnt know but after her persistence i broke and decided to give the friendship a shot. For about 3 days everything was okay and we talked at school for the first time in 6 weeks. When i got home from school though i recieved several texts from 3 different people that she was talking terribly about me and insulted me about having feelings, ever thinking i had a chance etc and showed me evidence through screenshots. My immediate reponse was to ghost again since this was the third time i had my feelings hurt by her. Up until the end of the year i ignored and avoided her again and it seemed like i had finally gotten away for good since nothing happened for 2 months.

During the summer of 2019 I didnt worry about her and after having lots of fun and general self improvement in every aspect of my life I came to conclude shes just a waste of time. Around July 4th she added me again through username search and messaged me asking about why i was angry. When i told her about the things people told me she claimed ignorance and we argued back in forth for a while. Eventually i left her on open but didnt unadd her and went about my business. As soon as school started the staring thing in the hallway resumed and at an assembly she smiled and waved at me and i ignored her. I realized she was upset again and after thinking about it i decided to end the fight for good. I texted her i didnt want to fight regardless of what happened and that i was finished being angry to which she responded she still didnt know about any of what i was talking about and she didnt know why i hated her. When i told her the exact things i had heard she denied it and said i didnt have to believe her since she didnt care to which i responded ok and she started arguing again asking why i wouldnt believe her. I told her i was done and i didnt hate her and i was finished being mad about it and she told me she loved me and wanted a friendship if i was up for it. I gave it a shot again and since then nothing bad has happened. She has talked to me almost everyday since then and everything has seemed okay and she wants to be close again.

My question is did i do the right thing or am i getting played and what did she want from me? Am i wronging myself for letting it go or is it better for me and should i trust her? The fact that she supposedly loves me as a friend or otherwise is somehow a red flag in my gut because of how long we fought. I have gotten over my feelings for her but this situation has left me conflicted.",08Sep2019,1
688,"I m23 have been in what had been a very good relationship with a woman who’s also 23.

We have been together for 8 months and at the beginning of the relationship it was discussed that she had issues with previous ex's leaving unannounced without closure, as well as her father leaving her and her mother at a young age. I assured her I wasn't planning on doing such a thing. 

Last month, she wanted to talk about how she was feeling a bit vulnerable. We were walking and she squeezed my hand tighter and said she needed to say something. I could feel she was not herself so I assured her I was there to listen if she wanted to talk what was on her mind.

She discussed how at around this time in prior relationships, this was when people would up and leave her without saying a word, I again reassured her that I wouldn't do that and that we were 'on the same page' so to speak.

Come to last Saturday , she asked if she could come around and I said sure, not realising anything was on her mind/nor had she said anything at this stage.

When she arrived I could tell something was not right, so I asked if everything was alright and we sat down to talk.

For one week apparently she has felt like we were drifting towards a friendship and seemed to have developed feelings for someone else. 

I feel rather betrayed and hurt. I said I was disappointed but thanked her for telling me.. I reiterated how I felt and it seemed to get through to her, as she then became a bit upset/that it effected her. I told her I loved her and cared about her more than she knew. She looked up and asked almost with confusion if I had just said I loved her.

Sunday was fathers day, I haven't asked if the feelings of wanting to abandon someone before she gets more attached was there however I can't seem to shake it. Nor do I find it easy to be angry at someone for expressing that they have feelings for another but she has not acted on them. 

I'm very sad by it. I feel I did my best to show I wanted to work through things.. however at the drop of a hat it has seemed to change…

This situation has thrown me out of the blue. Part of me feels confused as someone who didn’t feel something wouldn’t have broken down so much after I expressed how I felt / wouldn’t have then hugged and not wanted to let go. Let alone just two weeks or so ago say she was feeling vulnerable of me leaving her.  

I gave her a week of space and tried reaching out however she's been cold and distant.

I will give her time but I can’t shake the feeling that someone in such a situation may want someone to really show they loved them? I hadn’t told her I loved her before and purposefully went a bit slower in revealing my feelings.

She does see a psychologist for anxiety. I would presume she would discuss her other fears of partners leaving too.",08Sep2019,1

About 2 weeks ago I saw her get into the car with him after school, I didn’t say anything to the mom and I didn’t really think much of it other than they were just friends and the mom was being overprotective.

She doesn't like mashed potatoes but still) because she told me to make my own portion. BTW, I'm not too good at remembering things so she uses this to her advantage. I list off everything she told me except the ""make your own portion"" stuff. Because she never said that, but the entire thing was ""still my fault"". Often she threatens me with physical violence over hypocritical stuff like interrupting her when she speaks, sometimes she threatens me with objects, sometimes she does hit me. She also cut off all my contact with my dad (non-related) and acts like the victim all the damn time, often crying her eyes out in front of me but when my sister comes in she acts all cool and collected. My sister is older than me by almost 10 years and she constantly sides with my mom over everything. And never comes to my aid whatsoever. This caused me to be suicidal for a period of 4-5 months last year, when I told my mom, she told me to consider how she felt knowing her son would kill himself without making an attempt to console me over this.

I hate being at home and constantly feel at edge and anxious around my mom and my sister. I have bad mental health issues and that only makes everything worse. I feel like I’m just a target for their rage and angst. I’m definitely not making it any better but I can’t bring myself to do anything because I literally can’t bring myself to do anything. I can’t talk about my mental problems with anyone because my friends understandably stopped talking to me after my problems made it next to impossible to become at all close to me. I can’t address the issues with a therapist because if I do then my mom just uses therapy as a weapon against me when she gets mad at me. I can’t bring up my issues with my mom and actually ask for help because then she just gets mad at me and focuses the conversation towards herself.

701,"Hi guys.   

Basically, I'm a senior at my university, but I really screwed up and lost my financial aid due to my GPA. I can't, therefore, figure out a way to get a loan without a cosigner, and I have no one that could reasonably cosign anything.

So I'm thinking of quitting for awhile, but I have no clue what I'd want to do. I'm an English major, and I love the idea of helping kids, so I planned on becoming a teacher, but that plan is starting to seem distant. I have no income, no job, no driver license. I've never worked outside of work-study positions, and I honestly can't tolerate doing most jobs; petty, I'm aware, but I just can't take doing anything I'm dispassionate about that often; I'm depressive enough as it stands. I also have a court date coming up from an altercation that happened for reasons related to the school fuck uppery, but that shouldn't result in anything too serious. Point is, I'm stressed about this stuff. 

I have skills. I'm a reasonable musician and have written a number of songs and plan to write more. I'm pretty good at drawing and have practiced a great deal. I'm a really good writer, and I honestly think that's my best skill, but I'm not sure how to market any of this for freelance work. I seriously only need around 500 dollars a month to get by, so I wouldn't even need to make much. I've even considered voice acting, as I can nearly speak Spanish and can do a bunch of different convincing accents in masculine and feminine ranges. I've managed to sell one painting, and people seem to like my work well enough. 

Basically, I know that I'm worth something, but I'm not sure how to prove that. I don't think school is working out, so I'm needing other options. What should I do? Should I try the freelance thing? Any loan ideas? Thanks.",08Sep2019,3
702,"Hello everyone , I created this account just today just now, I’m a 16 year old girl, I’m deeply inlove with this guy I’ve been with for a long time, in fact, he is my first love .
he attends army and we have no way of communication for weeks, and everytime he’s gone, I start to think too much

Recently I logged into his snapchat account checked his scan history to scan a funny filter he uses all the time, so I can use it myself and make him laugh when he’s back. 
I scrolled down and found out he scanned several girls accounts, and one of them he scanned just after our date, just the day after second our date... and it broke me. Why would he add girls snapchat accounts when he has me? Did he possibly cheat on our first few months of dating? Is that why he blocked all the girls on his social media ? If he cheated on our first few months should I leave him now? How am I sure he cheated ?


We are dating and officially boyfriend / girlfriend for about 7 months now . He once noticed how bothered I got when several girls texted him and   blocked all the girls out of his social media, but that’s not what I wanted, but he insisted on doing so. But it just made me Feel like a protective monster.

I’m the jealous type and I like to be his and only his, I don’t like having other girls around him. And it’s killing me, slowly, please someone just tell me how to get over this jealousy I have going inside me constantly , everything he does I doubt him . I don’t trust him.
I always think he’s gonna leave me for someone else, or is gonna slowly drift away from me and I’m not ready for that, I’d rather end our relationship rather than having the thought that he’s gonna leave me. 

He’s going to college soon and I’m still in high school, just two year difference between us. He’s growing up and he has a whole life ahead of him, and I’m just a jealous little bitch who’s always up his ass. I’ve suggested breaking up because because he’s growing and he has to focus on other things .but he says he wants me and only me, and wants to propose asoon as I start college. 

I don’t know if I can wait anymore, with this anger and jealousy inside me all the time. I don’t know if I can do it. He’s gone for army now and he comes back everyweek or two.  What should I do?

It would be amazing if any of u could give a 16 yo girl advice , this is my first time falling inlove.

703,Heya! I need some genuine advice as I’m in a bit of a tricky situation. I have these two friends who were best friends and are my flat mate. Person #1 starting getting super moody where she wasn’t the nicest to be around in general. Person #2 got really sick of it as if was affecting her mentally and also they’re doing the same degree so they’re together almost every day. Person #1 is now getting really upset because #2 isn’t acting the way she used to. #2 told me that the friendship was never going back to the way it used to be. #1 is constantly hoping that they will go back to being best friends and now always gets upset when #2 doesn’t treat her like a best friend anymore. #1 always comes to me telling me how it makes her feel like crap and I don’t know what to do???? How am I supposed to help this situation 😩,08Sep2019,1
704,"Context: I am a 15 yo Male, My family is strictly catholic with my dad being obsessed with it the most. They love it as much as they can, but I have been falling out of it for the past 4 years. Contradictions and their ignorance to my mental defects has made me question the existence of an all-merciful god. I don't want to be a catholic, they don't know my feeling about it yet. but my nuclear and extended family have been openly and subtly pressuring me to stay faithful.(examples include my parents yelling at me about why i'm not ""joyful"" when i go to church)

721,"In highschool my senior year (2012-2013) I fell for a guy from the next town over from me. He was tall, athletic and had such a pretty smile. Somehow he had gotten my number from a friend of mine and we began texting every every day. I would drag my friends to go to his basketball games with me because he was one of their best players on the team and I loved watching him play. I was two years older than him, and so after his mom caught wind of it she wasn't too excited that we were talking. I would drive to go see him but he could never go out and come see me. I just chalked it up as him not being as serious liking me back and so I let it go and told him not to text me or lead me on anymore. Even when my friends said his mom was super strict. 

He would text me later in college and I'd ignore him, even though it was hard. I was six hours away from home but he was literally every where it seemed like ( social media, hanging out with a few friends of mine that were his too. ) Especially with his senior year of high School , they had made it to state basketball that was hosted 20 minutes away from my college campus. All of my old high school friends drug me to go see him and his team play. I'll never forget the look he gave me when he spotted me from the stands. I wanted to leave so bad but I stayed. 

Year passed and he had moved to play for a college team up further north and I kinda forgot about him as it seemed like he did. During my college days I had gotten depressed and tried committing suicide. I'll save you the details but I drove 6 hours home and my mom rushed me to the doctor who ended up being his mom, and woman who helped save my life. 

She'd mention him later on during follow up visits and I'd sit there and nod pretending like I didn't have any history with him. Life moves on and he'd check up on me here or there and I'd continue to kinda blow him off even though I had feelings for him. I stopped replying when I saw he had gotten a girlfriend and then later proposed after he announced he was going into the army.  Something he's wanted to do since highschool. 

Deciding that I wanted to be closer to my brother who lives 10 hours south west, I moved down. It wasn't more than two weeks there that I had received a message from him. Asking me what I was doing there, to which I replied I had moved and he had replied he was getting sent there on a mission. 

We texted that whole day he was on the trip to his new base. Each text I sent I worried about his wife. So when he had finally got there and settled in. We went to lunch and talked for hours. Catching up. About everything. He looked so much taller and muscular than high school, you could see the sunglasses tan on his face, and little scratches here and there on his hands from training. I finally had courage to ask about his wife. More of how is your wife? To which he had told me it wasn't good and they had separated for a few months. Showed me the texts (because I didn't believe him) and heard them fighting on the phone one day . which she said she wanted to live her own life and not one that was based around the army so she left him for good. 

A few weeks later we hooked up. Which felt like a freaking movie. How weird is it that we end up together 6 years later in a city we never even knew of before. It was passionate, something I've never really felt when I've had sex. Even with my exes it was always just sex. No connection. Maybe it was 6 years of long lost feelings. After he looked like a blank canvas . I asked him if he was okay, and I began to become self conscious. He told me about having a condition called alexithymia, a condition that makes it hard to feel anytime of feelings. To which he explained everything to me as a I sat on the edge of the bed looking at him. Feeling like my prince charming I liked for 6 years wasn't able to express emotions unless he forced it. Making everything I had just felt during sex a lie but at the same time no.

I don't know what to do or say or suggest to him to get help that he clearly needs.  He's frustrated that his mom won't help him even though she's a doctor now and was tired of the things his ex wife tried to do for him. Which I think was the main cause of them separating. I want to help him but I don't know how because he thinks there's nothing for him. Especially since he's going to be deployed in the next year. I just want to make sure he's safe and okay before he leaves. I don't care what happens to us as long as he's okay...

At the same time to save my feelings I know I shouldn't pursue this because it's hard to be in an emotional and physical relationship with someone who doesn't express emotions at all.

I just don't know what to do",08Sep2019,0
722,"So I am in the process of tapering off my antidepressant after being on it for about 14 months before the taper. The reason I am tapering off it is because it is making me feel numb, and my energy levels are low. My psychiatric physician's assistant is tapering me off the medication slowly and its a difficult wait. I was on 60 mg of fluoxetine and now I am on 20 mg for about two months. She wants to lower the dose to 15 mg in three months rather than one due to concerns about relapsing. I understand that she has to taper me off the medicine, but this numbness is unpleasant.

I talked to my therapist about this and he told me to try to feel the carpet in my home with my feet to see if that helps. I tried that. I felt the carpet physically, but no emotion. His advice wasn't working. 

This is a really tough situation to be in. My PA can't discontinue the medication cold turkey, but this long taper is really prolonging the problem. I had to resign from work due to not feeling capable. I think that nobody really cares about my numbness but me, which is why my primary care doctor and psychiatric physician assistant aren't helping as much as they should. Honestly, this low energy and numbness is serious if it led to me resigning from work and if its causing me to complain for months. Also I would like to add that if the medication is making me feel so numb that it is affecting my ability to perform at work, then that warrants discontinuation. If I didn't resign, I could be terminated (fired) and finding another job would be difficult since many potential employers ask why you left your previous job as a means of weeding out applicants.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point but wait. It's like my body is fine but my brain is cryogenically frozen and is slowly thawing. The therapist's suggestions aren't working, and the PA is going to slow with this taper.",08Sep2019,3

725,"I’m not sure what exactly I’m asking for by posting this, I just feel really upset and pissed off and I want perspectives from people who didn’t go to my high school. 
When I was a sophomore in high school (15) I met a senior guy who was 19. I was obviously super flattered and love struck, I had never even held hands with a boy. At first things went okay, he was my first kiss and stuff. One day at my house he asked me if I was comfortable progressing sexually. I was so conflicted. I told him I was okay with rubbing, but not with fingering or anything further. He started rubbing me and as it got more intense he started fingering me. I tried pushing his hands away and said “wait” but he kept going and my entire body froze up. I just fucking laid there. I had never even seen a penis before in my life and he pulled his out of his pants and pushed my head up and down on him. I remember I almost started crying when he came, I was absolutely terrified and had no idea what was happening. But I was in love. And so, so fucking stupid. 
I thought that now that I’d passed that point, there was no going back. I was no longer someone who hadn’t done those things, If that makes sense. We eventually had sex, same kind of situation. I told him no and he did anyway, and my dumb ass just froze up. After, i wasn’t a virgin anymore so what was the point? I let him continue to have sex with me regularly. He mentally abused me and used me for sex. One time we were hanging out and when he found out I was on my period, he dropped me off and left. Eventually my parents found out and obviously it was statutory rape, him being 19 and me being 15. It was reported and I went through almost 2 years of trial. He ended up getting 90 non consecutive days in jail, didn’t have to register, nothing. A few weeks later he was found with another naked underage girl in his backseat, just another 10 days in jail. This man was well known in the community, and fairly popular. I lost all of my friends and was bullied severely. My severe anxiety prevented me from being able to even leave my house. I feel like he stole my life from me. My freshman year of high school was great, my life since then has been absolute hell. I hate myself for everything I put my parents through, I initially blamed them when they turned it in and was in a hospital for a week following a failed suicide attempt. I just can’t come to terms with what has happened and I feel this intense rage for everyone who bullied me. I was told I was asking for it and I ruined his life and I was a whore despite him being my first kiss. How can people say that about a rape victim? I cry almost constantly because of everything. I take counseling but nothing seems to help. I don’t want this to define me, but it’s so hard not to let it.",08Sep2019,2

Asked this dude when he was free, and he said tonight. I've had a pretty eventful and emotional coupla weeks, and was hoping to get sloshed with a good mate, talk through everything and generally have the good time while I forget the things that are bothering me for a bit.

Got a message from him saying that someone else was coming, which was fine, I know this person and I can still offload. But then she wanted to go round to see his housemate and now our drinks with just two of us has become a thing with around 4 other people at theirs.

How should I politely back out? Or as I have had a pretty miserable few weeks, should I throw in the towel and have a good time (I really feel uncomfortable around large groups, and I'm feeling a little emotionally raw rn.) And how should I phrase the thing of ""actually, hoped I could just have a chat with you."" I want to phrase it differently, as we had a ""will they, won't they"" thing a few months ago that I absolutely, 200% do not want to reignite, and I don't want it to come off that I am interested again.

729,"Hi reddit, I'll try to keep this relatively brief. 

My father (66) and mother divorced in 2018 after 25 years of marriage, leaving my dad severely depressed. He came out of that depression by renovating their old house before it was put on the market. He began to use dating sites and was scammed 3 times during the renovation. Once the house sold, he received roughly $10,000 from the sale, all of which was lost in *another* romance scam toward the end of June. He had planned to move to Europe to live with the woman he was talking to (who ended up being the $10,000 scammer), and thus sold or gave away everything other than his clothes and his car. He then started staying at a friend's place in California to rebuild his credit. Our family lives in Arizona, and I (21) am completely financially independent of him and my mother, other than being on my mom's health insurance. 

While he was staying in California, he became severely depressed again. He received a bipolar disorder diagnosis in 2017 but did not accept it. He only admits to being depressed and thus is on anti-depressants instead of mood stabilizers. While in California he ran out of his anti-depressants and did not get a refill, due to him being broke. He's on medicare AB but I'm unsure of the prescription benefits involved in that plan. The family he was staying with did not have the ability to help him in regards to his mental illness, and he was asked to leave. He drove back here to Phoenix and arrived 5 days ago. Today he told me he is staying in a motel about 20 minutes from where I live and ""will be homeless by Tuesday"". He is in severe credit card debt and would not be able to secure a place to stay if they ran a credit check. He receives about $3,000/month from social security and from a pension from a union he was in in the past. I encouraged him to look through craigslist to try and find a room to rent, but he has had no luck. 

There are several factors in this situation that make this difficult to navigate. What options does he have, financially and in respect to his mental health? I called a behavioral health center to see if he could be admitted into an inpatient program for bipolar disorder, but they said most places wouldn't accept patients into such a program unless they were suicidal, homicidal, or experiencing a psychotic episode. I have asked him about suicidality to which he said he is not experiencing suicidal thoughts. Thus, he doesn't qualify for admission. He has limited people who are able to help him. The only people in Phoenix he has are me and my sister. He's cut all of his brothers and sisters off, and the friends in California were unable to help him in the way he needs. He has a daughter in California as well however I don't believe she's aware of the severity of his mental condition. Any advice on how to handle this situation? Anything is appreciated.

I need advice on how to navigate my company's car allowance policy - I live in England btw.
 Long story short: my company offers to have a company car or take a monthly cash allowance instead.
I chose the cash allowance and use to pay for my daily commute on public transport (National Rail so quite expensive as one can imagine) .

Of course I will check the company car policy but I have one question about the law: does anyone know whether it's mandatory in the UK to hold a driver's licence in order to be the recipient of a company's cash car allowance, even though it is used to fund commute by public transport and not car?

732,"I've always had an issue with talking to people about money/prices. I've babysat since I was 11 and it hasn't gotten any easier. I raised my price from 5 an hour to 7, only after a year in another city at high school, so i wouldn't change my price out of the blue. (I babysat often and it was weird to think about babysitting one day for 5 dollars and the next day saying I raised my prices.) All throughout high school I kept my price of 7 an hour until 11th and 12th where I was full time for a family for 6 an hour (its too hard to explain why, but they can definitely afford more and took advantage of me and my time/prices bc im a pushover) 


I was away at a gap year program the last year so I decided with friends who understood the situation that i would raise my prices to no less than 12 an hour when I got back.


when I babysit (for the same family i babysat in 11th and 12th grade) i was asked what my prices were and i stumbled and said ""around 10-12 dollars, i haven't decided a price"" and she payed me 10.


 She is the main person I babysit for so until now i havent babysat for anyone else.  just a minute ago i was asked to babysit for a different family (in an hour or so) and I don't want to keep my price at 10 and hour for everyone so i want to charge at least 12. the only problem is that its a tight knit community and I cant charge different prices for different families bc she would find out. how do I tell the first family that my prices raised especially because its so random and the fact that 2 months ago (when i got back from the gap year program) i raised my prices. should I say bc I'm in college i need to raise my prices? and how do I bring up with the family im babysitting tonight what my rate is. what if i stumble again? (ik this family won't take advantage tho)


reading this now I know its really hard to understand so I'll sum it up here: i charge 10 an hour for family #1 and wanted to charge more but stumbled on my words. family #2 I'm babysitting tonight but i want to charge at least 12. how do i tell family #1 that I'm changing my prices (I can say since i started college I realized i need more money) since I am telling them randomly? how much should I even charge?

733," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'eh that lads just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she stared at me and quickly grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

I can’t commit to habits that would improve my life (eating healthier, exercising more, remembering to wear my retainer every night, etc). I can’t focus on homework for more than half an hour before giving up for the rest of the day (for and example: I can’t even put in the effort to read a textbook for a class that’s an elective).

I guess I can at least do stuff that’s easy. But if a lot piles up, or more challenging things are added on to my plate, then everything falls down and I end up getting nothing done!

I guess I just need advice on not feeling like a lazy piece of shit all the time. And how to actually motivate myself. Do I need medication to focus on responsibilities (how do I know if I have a genuine problem with focusing, etc.)? Or have I just let myself fall into a terrible habit of neglecting and hating responsibility (a habit of not doing responsibilities and then just facing the harsh consequences)?

All I know is that something has to change before I go off to college!",08Sep2019,1

737,"Last week, he sent me a text saying that he felt like I liked him a lot more than he liked me and that he wasn’t sure he reciprocated my feelings. He ended up calling me, sobbing, because he was so confused about how he felt. He kept bringing up little things (like “what if we don’t want the same thing?”) and each time I was able to reassure him, he would work himself up about some other minor issue. When I told him I wasn’t just in it for the physical part and really could see a future with him, he broke down even more because no one had ever told him that.

Eventually, I told him to just take a while to himself to calm down and call me back once he was feeling better. An hour later, he told me he was sure he wanted to keep dating.

I asked him if he was truly sure, and then he began to question himself again. More tears came, so I advised him to speak with his friends and family for advice and then call me back.

4 hours later, he called and said that he thought we should break up. This was 6 days ago

I haven’t heard from him since, and he’s since unmatched me from tinder. He doesn’t have any social media, so I can’t check in on what’s going on with him.

I want to text him and ask if he thought he made the right decision. I want to hear him say he made a mistake, but it would hurt so much more if he felt confident in our breakup.

738,"Hello Reddit.
My situation began quite a few months ago, and has seemed to be recurring. The first incident happened when I fell for one of my coworkers. We're both super shy, so I went out of my way to make my feelings for him obvious. I gave him my number, messaged him quite a bit even though I'm socially retarded. When we did talk, he seemed to be enjoying it; he would engage in conversations, ask questions, laugh with me, etc. So one day I ask him if he'd like to go see a movie with me, to which he replies ""That sounds really fun! I'll definitely let you know when I'm free."" Fast forward a few weeks. No word from him. On my birthday he messaged me to wish me a happy day, but that was all. A bit later, he messages me asking about my work schedule. I was super excited, thinking he was finally bringing up our movie plans, but no. He only wanted to know if I could work a shift for him, because he was throwing a party (which I was not invited to) and would be ""too hungover to work"" the next day. After that I realized he had probably only liked the attention, perhaps even led me on a bit. It hurt, but I stopped initiating contact; going out of my way socially &amp; inducing anxiety upon myself just to make him comfortable. And when I stopped trying, I quickly realized that he never was. We don't talk anymore. 
Heartbroken and attempting to move on, I accepted guy #2's offer to start up a little fling. It started off purely sexual, but soon we both admitted beginning to catch feelings. We got along so well and had the same sense of humor. However, a month or two into this, I find out he had a girlfriend the whole time. He had knowingly used me and led me on. 
Yet again left in the dirt, I decided to wait. If I was meant to have someone, he would find me. So I waited, and that's when I met guy #3, the one I'm currently involved with. He seemed absolutely perfect at first, but now I'm definitely beginning to have my doubts. He talks about his ex a lot. Plus he's a songwriter, and all his lyrics are about missing her. If that wasn't already a huge red flag, there's more. He told me he loved me, and now he barely messages me. He told me he really cares for me and sees a future with me, yet hardly speaks to me in person when I see him either. What kind of games are these? Whenever I ask why we haven't made our relationship official, it's always a different excuse. I just don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, if I'm just unlovable, I don't know...
Why do I only seem to attract guys who want to use me or lead me on? My self esteem has taken a huge tumble, to the point where I'm worried about myself, and my depression  (which I previously hadn't had issues with for years) is definitely beginning to show itself again. I'm at a loss here. Any advice would be very much appreciated!!!",08Sep2019,1

740,"ALRIGHT YOU LOVELY MOTHERFUCKERS, I have a question...

First, the situation: 

I'm in the pool with my sister and her friend just swimming around taking it easy. I'm a 20yo guy, and they're both in 7th grade. Well, as it always seems to go with kids, they seem to think I'm a jungle gym and like to jump on my back, try to sink me, all kinds of silly stuff. I don't mind, it's fun in its own way.

So, I have her friend on my back, she's freaking clinging to me like no other, and as I'm leaning forward (I'm standing in waist high water), my sister has the bright idea to jump and grab right behind my head to try to pull my down. 

Well, yours truly had water in his eyes from all the splashing and didn't see it coming, so when I felt hands on the back of my head pulling down, I tensed up.

Bad fucking idea.

103lbs. of little sis pulling down on my head, plus me tensing up, I heard and felt something pop in my neck, and now it hurts to look hard any direction (though I *can* do it), and aches when I'm just sitting down. Bending over to grab something, sometimes I feel it move down into my spine. When I went to bed last night, I went down sideways using my arm as a support, and as I was about at a 30° angle in relation to the bed, I could almost feel it in my chest, but it was ""deeper inside"". Just a dull feeling, but I know it isn't normal.

I don't feel weak or numb in my arms or legs or anything, but this stuff is enough to be concerning. Broke my hand a couple years ago and didn't think I did, so I'm wanting to play it relatively safe here.

Thanks in advance guys. It's much appreciated.",08Sep2019,0

743,"I’ve been living with my partner for 5 years now and things aren’t changing. He is really messy.  I can’t clean up without him dirtying up the place the same day. He helps around the house only when he feels like it which is not often. We both work a full time job and are both tired after a long day but I still manage to try and clean up a little. He works and goes straight to playing video games or the gym.  He is the type of person that can live with a mess for weeks and be un bothered by it...but I can’t. I’m not perfect and admit to being the problem (especially over the weekends) too. The difference tho is that I’ll clean up after myself in a day or two.. if I don’t pick up his clothes from the floor it won’t be picked up until who knows when. If he leaves dirty plates on the table they’ll be there until he can’t find a clean plate. If he takes off his shoes after work they’ll be there until he wants to wear them again... we have a shoe rack for a reason. There was a time when he literally had 4 pairs of shoes scattered throughout the living room area. He doesn’t put things back into the fridge when he uses them (milk, butter, etc). He will move things and not put them back ever... I don’t know how to tell him that it’s becoming a problem without him telling me to stop complaining and cutting me off. It’s gotten to me so much that I’ve considered moving out and living apart. Maybe living apart will teach him how to be clean or at least understand my point of view. I feel like i got him used to being cleaned up after when I wasn’t working full time.  I would appreciate it if he helped me clean up and do chores around the house without me asking him to more than once. I can’t keep on living in a messy place every day.

748,"In July of this year I felt just this extreme loneliness that wouldn't quit no matter what I did, being with friends, family none of it helped me.  

I saw how close my mother was with her dog who she's had for 8 years and that dog is all she has. So I began thinking about getting a dog myself and very stupidly I went off half cocked and decided to get him. Come early August I'd confirmed that this is what I want. I figured it'd force me to change my own lifestyle from a depressed pathetic human being to one a bit more productive as well as give me a companion who will love me unconditionally. So we went through the process and my mother helped me adopt it cause I'm not old enough to adopt a dog (19m). The process was over in early August and in late August we got the dog after weeks of build up and lot of money spent to get him and all that stuff. He is a damaged dog to say the least. 6 years old and a dump dog who seems to have been previously abused based on what I've seen from him so far. 

Just over a week has gone by since I got him and I am absolutely and completely miserable and confused. I love him very much and Im not sure I'd be able to live with myself if I got rid of him. If Im pretty sure it'd take me a very long time to get over it because I'm his whole world. I know it sounds big headed but he's become hyper attached to me and has separation anxiety when I leave home. But I feel trapped, like I'm imprisoned by this dog, and my mother doesn't help with that because whenever I'm not home she sends me pictures of him and tells me he misses me and got extremely angry and berated me when I asked her to stop calling me his ""dad"". I feel imprisoned by this dog, I now can't leave my house, my room, where I'm sitting, or my own bedroom without him also getting up and following me within an inch of my leg or being reminded that he's waiting for me (I tried teaching him stay but he refuses to listen to me no matter what I do, and trust me I've tried it all besides pro training). Im beginning to resent him and dread coming home. I do not have the energy to walk him, I really dont. My body says ""go do it"" but my mind will not physically allow me to because it just feels so exhausting that even thinking about it makes me want to take a nap. It's very frustrating. My mother has no empathy for this so she just constantly bitches at me that I need to take him for a walk or whatever, I'm just so sick of hearing it cause she didn't walk her dog at all until I got this one and now that's the new thing she pesters and pesters me about. I cannot stress how exhausted I am 24/7 every single day no matter what I do. I'm at a dead end because I really don't think I appreciated the other dog enough or the situation I had back when I didn't have him and was searching for something to change my situation for me instead of finding the will power to do it myself and now I've dragged an innocent dog who just wants to be loved into it and I am just at a loss. All the money and shit I've spent so far. I just don't know. 

Any advice?",08Sep2019,1

I work an overnight job, and so I sleep in the day, but that's become difficult because I have an above the-door air vent, which makes me able to hear  E V E R Y T H I N G  happening in the house and it's constantly waking me up. I hear the family talking, I hear the washer and dryer making noise, I can practically hear the fridge opening and closing. Naturally, I can't just keep the family from doing daily life stuff they're supposed to, and it's not like they're any louder than the other house, but dear god it's this vent and it's driving me insane already.

I read online that completely blocking it off will make the room insufferably hot, I do have another vent but I don't think it would work as well without the return vent or whatever.

760,"So this is probably not the right place to post this but I don't know where is.

So we've (me and my roommates)had this washing machine for about 1.5 years. And since 2 weeks it is making our clothing smell like rotten eggs. But only like certain parts of our clothes...
What I've noticed is that if the clothes are dry they don't smell but if they're wet they do. It's really weird... what makes it even weirder is that towels, sheets etc. don't come out smelly

I've talked to our landlord about this since it's his machine but he doesn't take us seriously. I've thought of so many different possibilities but I just can't figure out what exactly is causing this. It could be something wrong with the pipes cause sometimes this foul odour comes from our sink. It could be that there is some sort of bacteria that mixes with the bacteria of our skin ( sweat etc) to make this smell (is this even possible idk). It could be that the washing machine is just no good, but why would only our clothes be smelly...

I'm just really confused and don't know what to do. We clean the machine weekly and once every 4 weeks we even use some special cleaning stuff to rinse out the machine. But it hasn't helped so far.

I'm a teacher and I can't be smelling like rotten eggs in front of my students. Please has anyone got any idea what this could be? And how we can fix this?

Since then we've been hanging out at school and after school but we aren't technically official or anything. We have fooled around a bit but haven't had sex yet. 

So this past weekend we were snapchatting and she was in her room and I could see some dude in the back of a snap she sent so I asked her what was up. She said he was just a friend but after talking some more about it I kinda got upset and she confessed it was a guy that she has been having sex with.

Apparently he's a college student a few hours away who is from here, they met at her summer job at a restaurant where he worked too. They started having sex but she made clear they are not dating or anything and that he just came home for the weekend and they hooked up again so I guess just friend with benefits.

She says I shouldn't be mad because we haven't become official yet and we never talked about being exclusive. 

I'm also worried because I think it's weird for a college guy (I think he's 20) to be sleeping with a high school girl even though the age of sex in my state is 17

776,"Hi everyone, 

My family’s dog is now 14 years old. We had our floors replaced with wood years ago and it is slippery, which I think is the cause of the hip problems she has now. We have rugs all over our house because she has trouble walking and standing up. Sometimes she falls with her legs all spread out and needs help getting back up. She can’t hold her pee very well and sometimes wees a little in her sleep. Her pee smells weird which I’ve heard can be because of a UTI. My mom says she can’t get comfortable at night and has to go outside more than several times. Her legs are all bent inward when she stands and she shakes. 

My dad thinks that because she eats well that she is fine and doesn’t need to put down, but my mom does. My mom is worried that she is being hasty but doesn’t want the dog to be in any pain. She can go for short walks before she gets tired and she does eat very well. She likes to be loved and even though she is deaf she will get up for snacks no matter what. 

What do you guys think? It is a very hard decision because this dog has been in my family since I was in first grade and I truly don’t want her to be in pain, but I don’t want to put her down if she has more living to do.",08Sep2019,1

778,"I’ve loved learning and driving cars for 5 years now and always wanted to know how to work on them. I’ve known an ASE mechanic for 5 years as well and asked him if I could work/learn from him and he agreed.

So I’ve spent about 10 hours each week for the past two months at his garage working on cars but realized that I don’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would...? I’m trying to figure out the reason why. 

Maybe I just want to work on certain types of cars like Honda’s and Toyota’s but my mechanic gets all types of cars in his garage. 
I’m getting paid hourly until I get good enough to work on commission. 
Maybe part of it that it is very hot outside?

Or perhaps the thought of working on cars was more appealing/infatuated in my head and now that I am working on cars, it is actually work and not a “hobby type feel?”

I told my mechanic about how I feel and he is not offended by it but I need advice on how to go on further. 

I would probably just be sitting in my home on my phone if I wasn’t working for my mechanic. Why not get paid and get knowledge along the way? Is there something wrong with my thinking? I feel that I should be grateful I have his part-time job and experience.

780," I (17M) started  my first job about two weeks ago at a family owned restaurant. I'm supposed to be paid an hourly rate and tips.

Today I got my paycheck, as I looked at it I noticed that they recorded me as having received $17 more in tips then I actually received (i get tips in cash).

With the amount of tips they ""recorded""  me to have received, it just barely pushes my paycheck to Minium wage ($1 over). This makes me think that maybe they are purposely making it seem as if I've received more tips so that they don't have to compensate up to minimum wage. 

This is really annoying me right now because I've already had numerous problems since I've worked there. (Getting scheduled twice on days I said I couldn't work). (Then they were out of disposable gloves for a whole week so cleaning the bathrooms was kinda gross.)

They also have a written record from me with all the tips I've received, so it's not like they didn't know how much I actually got. Good thing I've been keeping my own record of tips at my house or else i might not have noticed.

So what should I do? Should I deposit this check anyway and then talk to them, or wait? I don't work for another 5 days so its gonna be awhile.",08Sep2019,1
781,"So two months ago I messaged this female coworker, she's close in age (mid 20's) and we work in different depts so I went for it..

She's an ESFP, i'm an INFP and the conversation went surprisingly well, we related in unique ways and even planned to talk on break at work!

For a few weeks, things went pretty well..

Then I began over-sharing, sending long msgs encouraging her etc and she slowly backed away..

Then soon after I had a major breakthrough and epiphany, and my eyes were just opened to how wrong my actions were..

I told her this and sincerely apologized, and got no response from her..

A week or so past and I asked if everything okay, and again received no response.

I never bring anything up at work and act as normal as always, am very respectful..

It just hurts that I've sincerely apologized, probably even more
than I should... 

I was so selfless and poured genuine encouragement into this person and she won't at least tell me what's going on..

It hurts seeing her at work and as an INFP i really dislike when people hide from me and can't just be real with me and let me know what's going on.

783,"I know you guys aren't fit to diagnose, neither am I. I'm working on going to a therapist, but I'm trying to pinpoint whether I have regular anxiety or if this is something like OCD, or a mix between the two. 

For a really long time, I've gotten anxious over small stuff that seems like it wouldn't matter. Like, when it comes to rules. 

I went to a religious school as a kid, and I accidentally got the message that ""following the rules makes you a good person"" rather than, ""The choices you make, make you a good person."" Which is something I believe to be true now. 

However, as a kid I would constantly check, re-check, and check again that I wasn't breaking any rules. I always did my best in school, and I was the kind of kid who would cry over not being able to get an answer right. I remember I felt like if I got an answer wrong, everyone would be mad at me for not trying hard enough. Which is obviously irrational. In highschool, I thought if I showed interest in other people they would think I was weird or that I was creepy. I knew this was irrational, but still felt compelled to never, ever, make eye contact with people.

And now that I'm 18, out of school, and have a job, I find myself doing things like this, to this day. I constantly have to re-count the money at least three times, even in small amounts. I have to ask questions  even if I know the answer because I want to know 100% that I'm not doing anything to get myself in trouble. It's gotten to the point where I get visibly upset and my managers ask me if I'm ok. 

And what's really weird is, it isn't at all consistent! Every situation I'm faced with, it's like my brain picks out one thing, and I get plagued by thoughts of ""What if this happens? I need to check!"" And then as soon as I ""check"", whatever that may be, I start thinking, ""Maybe that person was wrong. Or maybe I was wrong. Maybe I should check again, just in case. But why wouldn't they know? I don't know, just ask one more time."" 

And it just absolutely fucking spirals from there. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. I could see a glass on a table, imagine it falling, and feel like I have to move it because if I don't someone will come a long and bump into it, making it fall. 

And it seems to manifest in so many different ways for me, instead of just having one consistent tendency. I have a fear of abandonment, for instance, because of family background. Both biological parents are substance abusers, and I was taken by grandparents. I have a boyfriend, who I love so much, and often times I feel like if I don't text him within the time span of at least three days, he'll forget about me, even though I know that isn't the case. 

Worst part is, I can't explain this to anyone irl. Every time I try, it seems like such a simple thing to not get worried about. But I can't help it. I always have to do things ""Just in case."" And it's so fucking annoying",08Sep2019,1

788,"So we had all gone on a night out, no one drank that much and I remember the whole night being a chill fun night. Me and some friends were supposed to be staying at his house. Me and him walked home. I thought my other friends would be staying but once I got here I realised they weren’t there. 

Me and him talked for a bit and then went to sleep. We slept in the same bed as friends which we have done before. We compete on the same college sports team and regularly have to share rooms and beds when away. He has never tried to make a move or anything like that as we have been friends for years he even dated one of close girlfriends for a long time  and knows I my boyfriend really well. 

In the morning I wake up and realise he has his hands inside me and his other under my shirt. I just froze with my eyes shut I couldn’t believe what was happening I moved to signal I was waking up and he stopped. I got up and suggested we go and find everyone else as I didn’t want to be near him. I didn’t know what to do or say so I didn’t say anything... he acted like nothing has happened because he didn’t realise he got caught. 

I have no idea how to deal with this as I have agreed to live with him and a couple of friends at college next year but can’t imagine having to see him again. I don’t want to ruin his life or end his career at college. I hate the idea of everyone we know hating him as he was my friend, I just want to know how I discuss this with him
 So he learns from it and it never happens to anyone else or if I should report him and get him kicked out. Is he just a sick person? Or did he make a mistake? I feel so hurt by what he’s done. But I also don’t feel like just because he’s Ruined my life I really have the right to do the same to him? I can get through this without hurting him but any advice I would appreciate.",08Sep2019,7
789,"TLDR at the end.
I'm a 19 year old boy and still in college. Before I proceed any further I must say, I cannot say enough good things about her. She's my classmate from college, I've known her for two years, and she has helped me a lot. Due to me being a fail at all things in general, I was an extremely negative person, and her presence and friendship were such an incredible blast of positivity in my life. She's been incredibly nice and more importantly honest with me, whenever I've turned to her for help and advice. As the days went by I got a massive crush on her, and told her about it, and she said she totally understood and was fine with it. We were cool. Things were going great, I thought. I thought that we were slowly developing a relationship, I thought she was beginning to see me as something more than a good friend. Then one day she tells me she is in a relationship with another guy. They are deeply in love and very happy. When I asked her about, well, ""us"", she most coldly said that I'm a good friend but we're too different as people for her to think of me as anything more, and that's just that. Took me a while to accept but I understand. We still talk, a lot, like good friends, but it absolutely kills me every time I see her because I know she's with this other guy, and I just can't stop having unrequited, damn painful feelings for her because she just was and still is quite easily the best person I've met outside my own family. I understand I must respect her decision and move on, but so far have been unable to.
TLDR: She is nice. I liked her. She likes someone else. Gets into relationship with someone else. Is still nice to me. How to move on now?.",08Sep2019,1
790,"So, my roommate, raised on rock like White Stripes and the Beatles and Nirvana says that I don't appreciate rock the same way he does because there is something I don't understand about it and that I would if I learn to play guitar.

I like rock, I don't love it. I love electronic music like Bogtrotter, Bassnectar, and Charlie Zane. He doesn't particularly like that music, couldn't I say the same thing back to him? ""Well, if you knew your way around a synthesizer, you'd get it.""

But I don't think that. It sounds like bullshit. I simply just have a different taste in music than him. I agree that musical tastes can be cultivated and I'm not against doing so, I would prefer to expand my horizons in music. I'm so glad I can enjoy Dark Side of the Moon as much as I do now. But most anything else rock related I'm like ""this is nice, but it's still just rock.""

791,"So the past couple days at my grandfather's house has been *tense* really tense since my dad found out Im pressing charges against him. This tension really only happens when I go to the basement level which is near his room (because im scared he'll hear me and come out and start berating me and guilt tripping) or when he comes upstairs and we both happen to be in the same room together. I don't see this letting up for quite awhile and my pap keeps extending how long he's allowing my dad to stay with him. First it was my dad wasn't even allowed to stay the night, then it was he can only stay for 1-2 nights, then stay until he went to rehab but afterwards he had to be out, then after rehab he could stay for a month, and now it's extended till April for him to find a job. Seven months! I'm sure there will be an upcoming court date soon for this but until then its been really tense in the house. I stay up in my room most of the time or I'm out of the house just to avoid accidentally bumping into my dad. 

Now I was mentioning what was going on Friday when I was out with a couple of friends. A new girl from college joined our friend group and she seems really nice, she offered me to live with her as her roommate, she's renting off her brother for $250 a month which would be split between me,her and another friend that Ive known since I was 15. Rent doesn't include utilities though although the agreement was we'd split bills evenly besides our phone, car insurance, gas, and groceries, and personal items. Tonight after work I'll be checking out the condition/updates her brother is making to it and it'll be ready after Christmas. I checked the outside and it looks stable and decent and it's in a nice quiet neighborhood. I feel like this could be a really good start at me to gain my independence but I told my grandmother and godmother and they gave me a whole bunch of gloom and doom scenarios (which to be fair could happen but we all get along with one another) and said it wouldn't be a good idea and think that all they'll do is drink and party which, my friend doesn't even do (he'd prefer videogaming) and the girl is very shy and quiet and when we hung out together it took her quite a bit to come out of her shell. My godmother instantly said ""People change especially when they get some independence."" But I feel like this could teach me to have some responsibility because I'll end up having to do this type of stuff eventually except its gonna be on my own and not with two other people. I have until December to think about it but I need some insight",08Sep2019,1
792,"
i have a family member about my age that i live with half of the time. let's call her pam. pam and i text pretty often, but it's usually her spamming me with fandom-related things i'm uninterested in. we are generally close but i don't want to be because being around her puts me in a super intense bad mood. she has no sense of personal space and is quite literally obsessed with me. plenty of people i know notice this, so it's not just me being overdramatic. in any conversation imaginable she will make it about me. she will also stare at me lovingly after i ask her to stop multiple times. she tries to touch me all the time and hug me. she just won't leave me alone and make up annoying conversations that have no purpose so that i'll talk.
pam is also very overdramatic. she is a big attention-seeker, can't do anything for herself (relies on others to do everything for her. for example, she can't study alone, she often needs help with homework, she can't do her own laundry, she doesn't pack her own bags when going places, etc.) and spends 99% of her time on her phone. she is one of those people who brags about having depression/anxiety/other mental illness (even when she is undiagnosed). any time i get annoyed with her because she won't leave me alone, she will take it personally, turn it around on me, and make me feel guilty for wanting to be alone.

i could ramble on and on about this but i'll get to the point. why is she literally a human depression for me? why is it that my mood is completely ruined every time i see her? is there any way i can fix this so that i'm not miserable every day that i am with her? i literally can't avoid her because she is a family member.

also, is there any way i can get her to stop? telling her multiple times to stop never works, lashing out at her after she purposefully keeps annoying me only makes her cry or make fun of me, and of course i can't just tell her that being around her is a guaranteed way to ruin my day. she is spoiled and pampered by her parents, who back her up often and are in denial about how rude she is to people.

thanks in advance to anyone that can help. if i get some responses, i might delete this comment soon out of fear that pam will see it.",08Sep2019,1

        Basically my ex girlfriend hit me up a few months ago asking to be “friends”. She’s had a new boyfriend for about a year and I thought they were doing good until she finally told me about their relationship. Apparently her boyfriend is very distant nowadays, and never really wants to see her anymore. They had a phase in January where he straight up told her that he didn’t love her anymore, but I guess they stayed together? Her boyfriend is graduated and out of highschool, so she always tries to come and talk to me at school. 
       Recently, we were coming home from school and stopped in front of my house. It was a weird moment but basically we hugged like we usually do, and had a small make out session ( this was the first time we’ve kissed since we dated) and it just completely felt wrong to both of us.  When I got home she sent me a text saying how guilty she felt and how she wanted to cry for cheating on her depressed boyfriend.
    What should I do about this? Her boyfriend is graduated and was a star player on the football team last year before he graduated. He also is not mentally the strongest, and has anger issues. I’m just really worried she’s going to tell him, and I’m really not trying to have a person way bigger than me try to fight me.
   She promised him that she wouldn’t tell but I know how she is, I honestly just feel like a total dick right now. Any advice is appreciated.

807,"Ok so I just transferred to a new town for college and I am living in a student apartment off campus. On my roommate application form I specifically put no pets (not bc I don’t like pets but just bc it’s hassle to have them in college and I’m allergic) but apparently the management in my neighborhood is terrible and I was placed with someone who has a pet but since it’s registered as a service animal it is not considered a pet in the system. Then, I spoke to management and they relocated me to a different apartment that apparently said there were no animals, but unfortunately when I was moving in I saw the people had a cat and like 5 snakes. There are other things I dislike about living here about the pets are my main concern. I want to go ask the  manager if there is any way they could cancel my one year contract since I had originally put no animals in my roommate application form, but I am worried the girls don’t have these animals registered in the system as service pets and I don’t want to snitch on them by mistake lol.

813,"Hey Reddit. Where to begin... a few weeks ago my mom essentially broke my PC. It won’t boot, all data is corrupted and I’ve gone through the process of uninstalling windows, installing Linux, reinstalling Windows (which didn’t work) etc. and finally giving up after trying every possible solution I know plus many more. My mom is for some reason still convinced it can be fixed and has been trying to rewrite code herself and keep going even though it’s clearly a lost cause. I am a semi professional gamer (a few hundred euros earnings from various games) and my pc has been a secondary source of income for a few months now. I also work for my parents doing housework and cleaning etc. because they are the reason I can no longer use my pc, I asked for an advance on my pay to build a new one. This raised a number of problems. One, my parents are super environmentally friendly and all so I got lectured on how bad of parts are for the environment... etc. second of all, I was running a fairly old pc anyway which was barely holding together, so I was planning on buying a new one anyway, but when I said it was due to my frame rate, my mom was convinced that the issue was server based not hardware based. Anyone who has a single shred of knowledge about gaming and PCs knows that FPS are hardware based, not server based. My mom is convinced otherwise. I am stuck with a mom who is in denial about the PC she is trying to fix (probably and ego thing) and I can’t build a new pc for months because I can’t get an advance. Two questions. AITA, and what can I do?",08Sep2019,1

My question is, what should I do? People are expecting me to go to college but, trust me, I’m not exactly what you’d call “college material”.

818,"I'm always on top of things. I run my entire household and am a student studying computer engineering (which is very difficult) and I have a bunch of other things on top of that. I am a very busy person.

So my parents used to be hoarders and last year I spent an entire MONTH cleaning the garage. For almost 20 years the garage was a huge mess with piles everywhere and I spent a whole month going through everything to make it pretty. Last year during the summer I asked my mother to list some old clothes on Craigslist so we can sell it. It's been sitting in the garage for an effing YEAR and my mother STILL can't get it done. She can't take 5 minutes to list it online, and I spent a whole month in the garage cleaning. It makes me incredibly angry.

My mother is always finding something ELSE to do. Like going on vacation for a week (since her boyfriend is a pilot and takes her on free vacations), going to her boyfriends house etc. The only thing she does in this house is pay the bills, nothing else. She claims her job as an elementary school teacher is exhausting and when there's something to do in the house she's too tired to do it. I have been asking her for a YEAR to sell the clothes and she still hasn't done it. I told her I'm sick and tired of it and am gonna throw them away, and she blackmailed me by telling me she will throw away my things in my room if I do that.

Furthermore, she has had this Apple Watch sitting in her room for the past 3 years. I am a half marathon runner and want her watch because it's just sitting there collecting dust and I would actually use it. But she refuses, saying ""I'm going to use it one day."" And it's been 3 effing years and she still hasn't used it.

I asked my mom why she doesn't get anything done and her answer is ""I could die tomorrow so I want to have fun.""

It's very frustrating dealing with her. I want to hit her. One time I almost went to jail because I threatened to harm her. How can I deal with my mother who just CAN'T EVVVVVEEERRR get things done?!",08Sep2019,1
819,"x-posted just fyi.

my mom cries every day, multiple times a day. she is in therapy weekly, she is on medication, she is seeing a psychiatrist as well as her family doctor, she journals, she colours, she uses the Calm app. but she cries always. every day. for ""no"" reason. i know it's not actually for no reason and it's because she's depressed but nothing happens at all, she's just suddenly crying. sobbing. bawling.

today she was crying and we did a mindfulness exercise together and she felt better. we went to the dollar store and got some things and came home. five minutes later sobbing. nothing happened, just sobbing. always crying. i am so uncomfortable always because i don't know what to do with the idea that nothing happened and there's nothing i can do and yet she's sobbing. i'm very like, solution focused i guess. like ""what is the reason for this"" and then mitigate the reason. but in this case there is no reason. i empathize and sympathize but my brain is just like ""NOTHING HAPPENED. what are you crying for?! what made you cry?"" and i never have and never would say that to her but i don't know what to do.

i can't spend all my free time sitting with her rubbing her back while she cries, and then i feel evil for thinking that. and i've heard ""just be there for her, be with her"" but if i do literally all my time not at work would be being there for her while she cries. i can't exist like that. but i want to help. i want to support. i want to do SOMETHING. 

but are some people just....... never going to get better? a person's whole existence just destined for always depressed? she's doing all the right things and nothing is getting better. i don't know what to do or say anymore.

821,"I have two specific circumstances I'm trying to troubleshoot.

\#1 - The interns at work. I'm senior staff (not a supervisor) that started at my organization as an intern 20 years ago. We currently have an excellent team of interns that work very hard for us. The nature of the work makes it very easy for each intern to remain isolated. Once or twice per year I have a very intentional gathering that I call the ""intern appreciation party"" where we all go out for a meal and I pick up the tab. I tell them about how I started as an intern and I know first-hand how hard they work and appreciate what they do for us. These gatherings are always well received and allow the interns to get to know each other, discuss projects, exchange ideas, and open up opportunities for my colleagues and I to mentor them. Not only is this good for morale it is good for our projects. Towards the end of these gatherings the interns always make comments about how great it was and state that they would like to get together more often. I take this opportunity to suggest that the interns themselves send out e-mails to each other along the lines of, ""Let's meet for lunch on Thursday at the cafe across the street."" The interns respond positively to the suggestion. But, it never comes to fruition. We never get together outside of work unless I make it happen.

\#2 - My group on [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) \- I created a singles group through MeetUp several years ago. (Note: If you don't know about [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) I strongly recommend you check out the groups in your area. It's a social site, not a dating site, I just happened to create a group for singles). I'm nearing 1,500 members in my group and much like the interns at work I cannot seem to get any momentum with group members stepping-forward and creating events themselves. The group only has an event if I schedule it. It is unfortunate because the group would be so much more fun if, for example, 1% of the group (15 people) each posted and hosted an event once per month. This would give the group frequent opportunities to get together that would cover a variety of interests. There is not any one person that could achieve that level of activity for a group of 1,500. Also, like with the interns, at the end of events I get compliments on how much fun they had and that they'd like to see more events. Unlike the interns they recoil at the suggestion of posted an event and tell me they aren't ""outgoing enough"" to post an event or that they like to watch the RSVP list and only go if the people already going look interesting. I smile and let it go because I know pushing it won't help. But, why don't they see that they are talking out of insecurity and circular logic?

Please help and I'm stumped. Any advice would be appreciated.",08Sep2019,1

So for the last 3 years once a year I slept with this guy. He messaged me 2 years prior to this and I always said no. *Side note I buy weed from him occasionally* 
It's weird we would argue over silly things like a snap chat post and he would delete me then we would be cool. I tried to get weed once and he replied he was with him girl. So when I saw him I was like Uno I don't fancy u right I never have it's nuts sex took my weed and left. I feel like the power dynamic changed that Day. We never spoke daily that he would just pick things. I saw him once out and he was drunk and came all over me meaning I had to explain to my friends lol I'm quite secretive.Cut a long story short the second time we slept together I discovered he had self harmed alot. Ok didn't bother me I just tried to pretend I didn't notice but it was obvious. Jump forward he deleted me over something silly and then messages me later that week about weed. 
We hooked up he came to mine and from the jump I could tell it was different he was being really cool and coy. He always is but it was differeng. The sex was different way more passionate. After we talked jokingly he says I'm rude and I say he's dead. He goes a few days later I shout him and he says nah u said I was dead. Ok a week later he pops up and basically grills me he said I hurt what little feelings he had and that I'm still cool he still likes me, I didnt know if he meant friends or because we're kinda neither and that it's always him that comes back and that I just wanted head And that we should just keep it as weed. 
The thing is I feel like I'm missing something. It all came out of the blue and he's not really someone I can ask because he will either not reply or downplay it. It's like he had verbal vomit and couldn't help but say this. 
I know it sounds big headed but his reaction is indicating that he liked me? I know it's kinda been long -3 years but it was just sex right? And him saying I used him for head is the equivalent of him wanting to have sex with me right?
Ps I saw him today and he was smiley and he was like ' ah I look like a wasteman(British slang) and I was like no u look fine. And it made me think.

I'm 26 and he is 25 so that's another reason we are too old not to just be open right?

I am 28 years old. I have a masters and a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from a university in Kansas. I currently live in Toronto, ON, Canada. After I graduated, I went back to Dubai, where I am originally from to stay there and find a good job in electrical engineering. I never was able to find one as I did not have any experience. I was just chilling at my dads friend’s office every day and it was a food distribution company dealing in plates, knives, etc. They did not give me any work or pay I just used to go to pretend in the society that I am busy. I did learn a little about meeting with suppliers as they sent me to China to meet with people.

I was depressed. I wanted to leave that place. So luckily I came to Canada to begin my new life. I applied to tons of jobs here but I hardly got any responses. I got only a few interviews and I did terribly in all of them. I am talking about entry level positions. I got a pathetic job and that company kicked every employee out within two months. So last year I decided to use my knowledge of supply chain from what I had learned in the distribution company and decided to start a company. I registered a sole proprietorship business and started importing food product in my own private label brand. The response has been good online but it’s been very hard to convince the stores to buy my product. I haven’t made a minimum wage ever since I started this. Somehow I am surviving.

I'm in an interesting/difficult situation at work. 

Without giving too many details, I work for an international company what keeps growing.  Now, at the one in my country, we have a situation. Everyone from the higher positions are leaving at the same time. I'm also in a leading position, but not that high.

My issue: Basically almost all of my team, my boyfriend, my ex boyfriend, they expect that I step up and take the highest position, as it would be the logical choice. 

Now, I could use some new challenge, true. Probably I also wouldn't be very bad at it. I love my team.

 But.. 1.  Half of the people who leave, they do because of a mental burn out. 

2. The salary is not much higher as my recent one.

3. Right now I have 3 free days per week and 7 weeks holiday/year. If I take the position I will have 1-2 free days/week and max 4 weeks holiday, what I could never take out in once. Travelling is my biggest passion, loosing so much free time it means I couldn't go anymore on long travels, especially as far as I used to.

4. I would also need some extra training for the new position, but given that everyone would be new.. who would train who? The first few months will be a total chaos, I see that already.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

844,"Hi all, 

Just a quick thank you in advance to anybody who chooses to read/interact with this post. I can assure you it will be immensely appreciated. 

I (20M), am extremely lost in life and as the title suggests, my life is a complete and utter mess. For starters, I am morbidly obese, weighing in at around 380 pounds. I failed my exams in high school before I graduated, meaning on paper, I have no education. I have completed 1 year of a software development course in a ‘further education’ institute and a plan on furthering that by doing another year in that same institute and then going and doing another 4 years to get my full degree in a University. That is unfortunately the route I have to take because I failed my high school exams. The problem is however, I don’t want to do that with my life really, I don’t quite know what I want from life but I have a pretty good feeling it’s not that. I am doing it to keep my parents off my back (I still live at home) and I suppose I’m doing it so I can not feel like a complete and utter waste of space. I have spent my entire summer, laying around in bed all day, being uninspired, unmotivated to do anything. I can’t bring myself to do the simplest tasks. If the task isn’t lay in bed and browse on my phone, then in it feels like a mountain has to be climbed and 99 times out of 100, it doesn’t get done. I’ve never had a job, meaning that I am constantly broke and my dad has been sick this passed year and he couldn’t work either. Even then, I couldn’t suck it up and go and be a man and bring some money into the house. That is probably what gets me the most. 

Aside from that, I am also extremely lonely and have a huge desire for human interaction. Anytime I do have interaction with other people, I am extremely socially awkward and I get the feeling that people aren’t rushing to engage with me all that quickly again afterwards. I have one best friend who lives near me which is honestly a saving grace in this entire situation, but even then, our relationship is fairly limited to a dog walk on the beach or maybe watching some Netflix together. I have so many major problems in my life and I really don’t know how I start to go about fixing them. I don’t like to use this word loosely, but I feel I may be depressed. I want to make it clear however, that in no way am I suicidal. I feel like I should be but for some reason, I have an enormous amount of hope for my life. The problem is, I have been exactly like this, in the same position since I was 16. Since then, I’ve always said to myself and hoped that things would get better one day and that I would achieve something. The problem is, it’s been 4 years and I haven’t progressed in the slightest. 

I have been to a couple of therapists over the last few years and I haven’t really found it useful. In fact, with every therapist, I have felt so bland and just stuck to my bed that I’ve ended up cancelling appointments and eventually not scheduling any more. I don’t know if it’s relevant or not, but I’m going to note that I have quite bad anxiety, to the point where I won’t sleep the night before and/or have really bad ‘butterflies’ in my tummy over the simplest thing. 

I do apologize if this has came across as me venting or something like that and again, I really really appreciate anybody who has read this far. I’m just lost and I’m desperate for things to get better. 

Thanks everyone &lt;3",08Sep2019,1
845,"Tomorrow I will start my final year of high school (12th grade/senior year). And I have to find out what I should do after i finish it.

My problem is that I enjoy a lot of things: drawing, music, writing, photography, and speaking in public lmao, while for 4 years in school I've been studying computer science &amp; mathematics &amp; physics. I've detailed my skills in the following paragraphs, y'all can read them, or just assume that I'm a creative person, and skip to the last paragraph.

*Drawing*: I've only taken a few drawing lessons, some essentials about perspective &amp; body proportions, and most of the time I'm drawing comics (cause I'm bored, and I enjoy it a lot). I worked for someone I met on reddit and did some logos, got a bit comfortable with using a graphic tablet, and I work pretty good in Adobe Illustrator.

*Music*: I've loved music since I was a child, but I didn't take any lessons except flute for like 2 years, so my only skill in this area is decent musical hearing. I've been playing guitar since I was 14, but I'm still mediocre, because I never had a teacher. But recently I've fell in love with playing, and getting lost in the music. I've also started taking singing lessons less than half a year ago, but I suck. I've dreamed of singing on stage since I was 6, but I've only had the courage to go to courses now. And I was an absolutely terrible singer when I started, but now I'm just a terrible singer. I can also do death metal growls pretty good lmao. 

*Photography:* I was part of a non governmental organisation in my town, and for two years I have been taking photos at various events. I've learned from mistakes, from other photographers, from the internet, but since I have the same kit lenses, my pictures are nothing remarkable. But I've progressed a lot anyway, and I can also work in Lightroom

*Writing:* I seldom write, sadly. Yet last year a pretty reputable newspaper in my country organised a writing contest, and out of 400 contestants, I was one of the 25 finalists. That was so unexpected, given that I didn't practice, and neither have an artificial, ultra pompous style of writing (which, at least here, is appreciated at most contests). I've once written an article for the school magazine and apparently some teachers thought it was good, and got to a national english contest by writing a great narration on a subject I liked.

*Public speaking*: I've only had one occasion to hold a discourse, at a contest in my school. I've practiced my discourse a few times, and got first place. Amen.

Nooow, the problem is, those hobbies of mine don't offer yknow, some stable &amp; well paid jobs. Or at least I've never been told of such possibilities. Although I could go for programming or some science thing, I don't want to do it. Ew. I've had enough, I want to make a living out of something that I love. Any advice, please?",08Sep2019,0

848,"I’m really sorry this is long. At this point I don’t know what to do.

I know where my problems roots are. The problem with this, is that I sometimes have panic attacks when I’m alone in public. It’s very rare for me to be alone but I’m starting a new job soon. I’m extremely anxious because normally I have someone glued to my hip, it’s the only thing that helps me feel safe. With my new job though I’ll be alone. 

We will be in a classroom for a week but I won’t feel safe. I never do when I’m alone. It feels like someone will attack me or start stalking me. Things that I’ve had to deal with in the past and it terrifies me. I try to tell myself, “No one will do that”, “We’re in an open space”, “They aren’t that stupid”. Except there’s a part of me reminding me of the times those things did happen. Even when there were other people around.

One of my biggest fears is I will relive one of my high school horrors. The school was tiny, literally only had 150 students all from freshmen to Seniors. A guy was stalking me for months apparently. Then one day after school he trapped me in the girls bathroom. I screamed and cried for someone to help me but no one did. They all ignored me, the reason I knew this is because there were people outside the bathroom. It was a tiny and very open building that when quiet, loud noises would echo throughout. The person who found us was my mom. She came to pick me up and said she could hear me screaming as soon as she got out of the office. The only form of defense I had that day was a stall door. He was 3x my size and I had just gotten over battling some weight loss issues.

I don’t think everyone is like this. I want to believe people can be good, not everyone. There are bad people everywhere but I hate feeling like I can’t go anywhere because I don’t know what someone might do to me. What can I do? How do I stop being scared?",08Sep2019,1
849,"Alright, where to start? Me and my mom moved to the U.S on January and have been living with my aunt's family ever since. My mom is an alcoholic (not really the point of this story), my aunt is addicted to gambling and my cousin has anger issues. 

The first couple weeks were normal, my mom went to work, came home and had a couple beers, cooked, cleaned and went to sleep. She has done this since we moved and has never asked for any compensation, since she think she's paying off our stay in their house that way.

A couple of months ago my mom started having quarrels with my cousin, since my cousin didn't wash her dishes and just kept having a mess of a room. Eventually, this stopped happening.

Then, my mom started having quarrels with my aunt, my aunt owes money to a lot of people, and is often on the phone talking to her friend about lottery numbers.

Today my mom and my aunts had several quarrels, I don't quite get why they were having them, but it ended in my aunt insulting my mom and telling her to piss off. My mom is currently doing the laundry, so I took this time to post this here.

My question is, what can I do to stop their arguing?",08Sep2019,1
850,"Hey, i don't know where to begin with, sorry for my bad english, i'm brazillian and today is my birthday (21), and i'm having issues that i haven't had before, and this is frightening me,  i can't let this become some kinda of addiction.  


At this friday, i just went to a luxurious and expensive adult entertainment house, with my co-workers, it was supposed to be fun, and it was fun, it was SUPER FUN.  


I was a virgin, my birthday was close, our salary just went through our bank account, so we thought, why not? We went to our houses, took a shower, and met at the club.  


We arrived at 10:30 PM (22:30) and we left at 05:00 AM (05:00). We had alot of fun, and that's where the trouble begins. I enjoyed my co-workers company, while girls where coming and sitting next to me, seducting me, teasing me, bitting my ear, sitting on my lap, striptease show, and hell that was good, that was very good, after some hours we went upstairs with 3 girls and i won't tell the details, BUT, after we were done, when we left the club, and got the girls number(talked to her to see which day she works there), i felt the necessity of going back, have a second round, don't care if i will get short on money, don't care about my current problems, i just wanna feel happy again, feel that moment.  


My parents don't know nothing, and i've never gone into parties, never did something that crazy, like grabbing an uber, going out of town, getting into that club and doing crazy things with girls, I FELT FREE FOR THE FIRST TIME.. And next month we are coming back to that place..  


But i just can't stop thinking: I can't live without the feeling i had that day, all the girls, all the seduction, all the adrenaline, i just disappeared and had fun, ignored my mom text messages and said ""I'm okay, you can go sleep, i'll be back at morning""... But since that day i can't sleep really well, this weekend i just slept like, 5 hours total, and i can't stop thinking about that day, I JUST WANT ANOTHER ROUND.  


My friend said it is psychological, and that it is good, because i can listen to advices and i can control it and this feeling should be temporary..  


i'm afraid of this addiction, i'm afraid of living a life that i don't and at the same time i want to more than ever...  


I'm looking for help, what i can do to stop all this thing, i got work, got exams at college, got a project to finish by the end of the year and i can't stop thinking of going back to that house again and have some fun..",08Sep2019,1
851,"Brother-in-law and Sister have been married for 10+ years and have 2 kids together. Sister can be naive and trusting so I do not think she knows. He has always been strange and different, now in retrospect, it makes more sense.

I question on whether I should say anything to her.  She appears happy and this would be life-changing.

I also question who else in the family deserves to know, if not everyone. I say this because of his odd behavior around some of my other nieces. 

His conviction was for statutory rape when he was in his mid-30’s (victim was 16F).  He spent some time in prison and looking at the timeline was still on probation when he first met my sister. They married fairly quickly. 

You may wonder how I can think my sister wouldn’t know, if he is registered. However, outside of being naive and letting him handle all money/bills.  He is registered to a completely different address than where they actually live.  The address is an apartment in a nearby city. Which makes it more strange that he has a separate apartment he pays for each month (he makes enough to afford it). It’s like a separate life. Every 3 months he goes and checks in, with this alternate address, and takes a new photo. 

I have some nieces who don’t have an active father in their lives. Brother-in-law gives them a lot of attention which they crave. At family events, nieces and brother-in-law are often sitting very close on the couch. Other family members have noticed and made comments about how inappropriate it is. Some family members find him weird and keep distance, but others, who have their own daughters don’t really see it. They believe he is just being nice. Part of me feels like they should know so they can keep their guard up and not be as trusting as they have been (like letting their daughter spend the night at his house - to be with his daughter, their cousin).

Looking for recommendations? Should I tell his wife (my sister)? If so, how would you go about that? Whether or not I tell his wife, shouldn’t other siblings with young daughters know?  Would you want to know if this was you?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -  Discovered brother-in-law is sex offender. No one in the family knows. He has secret apartment he uses for registration. Do I tell my sister (wife) and family?",08Sep2019,4
852,"
So about a week ago my older sister (she's a year and a half older, I'm 17 she's 18)  (I will refer to her as E from now on) got her septum pierced. She had expressed interest in getting this done multiple times before but finally went and did it and I personally think it looks great. The problem here is my mother. She has said in the past that she doesn't want E (or myself for that matter) to get one as she doesn't like facial or body piercings (ears are fine) and I get that, she has her own opinions, but I think she crossed a line on the way she reacted when E told her about it. 

For a little background info, where I live you can go and get piercings without parental permission from the age of 16 and I mean when you're 18 you can basically do whatever since you're legally an adult. Also here's what happened before E told our mother; she had messaged me last week with a picture asking how bad I think our parents would react and I replied with:
""Maybe a 6/10? There's not much they can do about it now I mean, it's just a piercing. It'd be a waste of money to just take it out and let it heal over"" 
And boy was I wrong. 


So she came to find me about an hour ago and showed me the text that she had received from our mother. I can't fully remember the details since I just read through it briefly but the line I can mostly remember is ""if you want to be an independent adult so much then I'm sure you will do fine without our financial help"". 
So keep in mind that both me and E are still students so neither of us could afford to pay for essentially living alone since we both work pretty cr*p jobs. E goes to college a couple towns over (about a 30 minute drive) and has to go in 4 days a week so its actually cheaper to drive in then get the college bus or just a regular public bus for those 4 days a week. She also has to drive 15 minutes to get to her job so she can't really afford to pay that much on petrol at the moment without the help of our parents since they wouldn't be willing to drive her everywhere and I'm still learning and have my own education to worry about. 
As you can probably guess there is a lot more problems that this causes her which I won't go into completely because of privacy but you get the jist of it. 
It kills me that I can hear her crying in her room next door because I know what it's like having to try and silently cry so that nobody will hear you when there's a room full of people in the next room and I don't want her to feel like that too (Don't worry about me, I am currently in the process of getting help). 
It just makes me so mad that they can just cut off their first child like that for getting a piercing?? I mean she got a piercing for god's sake, it's not like she's Satan. 

I want to help her but I'm not sure how I can since I cant afford to help her financially. Any advice?

854,"Just for a backstory, my parents relationship has been rocky ever since my mom has slept over her coworker’s house (lets call him John) . She claims theyre best friends but Ive read their messages and it seems as if theyre more than friends. I doubt theyve done anything but  John has talked about how my mom is his last chance at love and he loves her. And my mom said she loves him back. 

Now building up to hours before the sleepover, through text he asked if she wanted to sleep over and promised its not an invite to sex, but he just needed someone to sleep in his bed and it ll help him fall asleep. My mom left around 9pm and stayed overnight and came home around 6am. My Dad was sleeping in the same bed at the time she left.  Dad claimed that she cheated on him but we honestly dont know if she did anything with John. But in my eyes, why would you go to a guys house to sleep when you a have perfectly good bed at home with your husband. 

Sidenote: I’ve had my moms location on find my iphone and she would go to John’s house in the morning when she thought I was sleeping. She would never pick up when shes at his house until she got out

Now for my dad. Every saturday night, around 9pm he leaves the house and claims hes going to a work meeting in New Jersey. I have my dad’s location on find my friends and every time I check he’s actually on a bus nearby to his coworkers house (I know the address because he brought me there before.) I’m pretty sure theyre f*cking btw. 

I don’t think my mom knows about his affair, but whenever they fight, my dad would bring up the sleepover claiming she cheated on him. 

Whenever I ask my mom about the sleepover, she will always say  nothing happened and it was innocent 

I dont know what I should do. Should I tell my mom about my dads affair? Stay out of it? Im completely lost",08Sep2019,6

858,"This may come up like me trying to praise myself, but is really not.

Every person I date or befriend has problems. All my best friends had a lot of mental issues like depression, anxiety, eating disorders and low self-esteem, I helped in every way I could and after they were in a better state, they all walked away from my life, mostly in nice terms. The same with most of my less close friends, everyone came into my life with some kind of problem and left in a better shape.

The same with all of my partners. My last 4 partners all had depression, low self-esteem, eating disorders and insomnia. I helped them all throughout the difficult times, made sure they slept, they ate, they went to the doctor, they got in a better state and then we parted ways. They're all now living a better life, most of them in healthy relationship and seemingly in a better mental state.

And of course I'm happy for them and I don't think of myself as some kind of cure they found, but I know how much I worked to make sure all of the people I loved lived well.

The thing is, I myself have a lot of issues, and sometimes I get tired of helping everyone. I wish I could find someone with a healthy mind who didn't need me to help them work out their issues. Not to work on me, but just to not have to spend all my time worrying about someone else's problems.

I know I can say no, but everytime I see someone in pain, I can't help myself, I feel the urge to help them in any way possible. This is a nice thing but only until a certain point, when I stop eating to make sure other people are eating, when I stop taking my meds so someone else can take them, when I stop sleeping so I can make sure to be awake when the other person has a bad dream, it stops being nice and starts being a problem.

Is there anything I can do to stop this trend? Or should I just keep doing what I do?",08Sep2019,1

870,"Hello,

About a year ago I graduated college with a bachelor's in a field that I really enjoy. Last October I got a job related to my field, it wasn't full time and I didn't enjoy it all that much. Then this past January my dad had a heart attack (he didn't die) and so I decided to move home and help out my parents with things while he recovers, I'm 24 years old for reference. I eventually got a job in my hometown, and it's pretty awful. Not related to my degree and we have to work 50 hour weeks, from 5am-3:30pm. I need to get a new job, but I lack experience in my field and I know it's not a great idea to quit my job and move somewhere without a new job lined up. I've thought about going back to school, but I'm not sure if that is just me trying to get out of my current job. I used to suffer from depression and my current job is causing me to fall back in, I really don't know what to do and could use any type of advice. Thank you!",08Sep2019,1

We continued rest of the day like normal both 18 btw.
Idk if this was accident and I wouldn’t mind taking it further. But next time I hung out with her we were next each other on the bed and she spoke to me but 0 physical. I got close to her she normally leans her head on me but not even that. Talking is the same.",08Sep2019,2

I asked my friend what I should do and she said that I'm too young and I don't know what I want, etc. But that's not true. I know I'm young but I'm not immature. I know what's best for me and my future and I never make rash or irrational decisions like a lot of kids do.

Everyday I wake up cry for 5-30 mins, sometimes I curl up in a ball and hide under my duvet, start shaking, for no reason; other times it's because I feel stressed. But it can stop within a few seconds of me thinking something random I doze off crying. I know I'm just some cringey 11 year old but am I just stupid?

People doing certain things can also trigger me to cry.

It's like I can feel their eyes burning though my head judging me when they're not. My mum gets really disappointed in me.

Usually I spend my days in bed just drawing, reading webcomics, reading, playing with cats, doing maths. I love all those, I really do but I can't help but feel lonley.

Honestly I have a really good life, my mum loves me, I get to do what I want. So why do I feel so shit all the time?

879,"A little of context before anything. I used two have two groups of friends (You know boys and girls who would hang out together once or twice a week) but most of the boys have turned into total assholes leaving me with only one left (Who I consider my best friend) and  the girls have started to act weird.
My group of friends isn't having their best moment (We're going to be freshmen in 1 year)  as I said everyone has changed  a lot and it wouldn't be that bad if they hadn't forgotten me in the way.
I mean, I think all started the last week with me having a kind of a big argument with one really close friend Ney (M 16) and I'll admit it, it was all my fault and It hurt me a lot and I'm planning to talk with him about that when the things improve. And in the other hand there is my other group of friends (Girls) they literally did not noticed my existence until they needed help with some math stuff.
The days passed and for some reason they literally just stopped talking to me and instead they started to talk more with another dude . He's actually a new student from Chile (And I'm not saying that he's an asshole or something. I love my boy Ronnie, I'm good friends with him) but shit started to get weird when they started treating him just like me and they even started to push things between this guy and a girl they know I have a crush on. I don't think I'm just feeling jealous, but it's just a weird feeling.
I recently talked with him (Ronnie) about the way I'm feeling. He told me he also noticed it and it would probably be because of my mood change, but here's the thing. My mood changed because of they acting like I'm just somebody that they used to know (Savage Gotye reference appears).",08Sep2019,0
880,"When I was in high school, I don't think I was the ""weird"" kid, but I was definitely not popular. I had friends in every social clique, and I often jumped from group to group when I hung out with people. I tried dating in high school, but I got rejected the whole time. I don't think I really made a single best friend while I was in high school. I mostly spent time with a young science teacher who happen to actually listen to what I had to say.

I don't feel like I figured out how to make friends in college, and as a result, the transition from high school to college hasn't changed my situation at all. I joined a fraternity, and while it is nice to have a large group of friends that I can hang out with frequently, I don't feel like I am in a strong social circle, I'm still hopping from group to group trying to find a group of people that want to include me in their daily lives. I don't get offered to go do things with people, I'm always asking to come along and it really hurts me now that this is neccesary everytime I want to do something social. 

Social media was something I really wanted to get involved with in high school. I wanted the large following that most kids had in the days. 1000+ followers on instagram etc. I could only get a around a quarter of those numbers then, and it hasn't gone up much since then. I know that social media is one of the worst things to judge yourself based on, but I really want / wanted to have a larger social media following just so that I would have access to meet more people, and just become a familiar face in college / hs. 

I am trying to date in college but I don't think I have the social skills to actually be successful. Many of the people I am around have so many connections to women through sororities, clubs, etc, but I have no connections to any of those things.

Honestly, while in high school those issues weren't a big deal to me, because I figured things would change in college and maybe I'd have a larger social status than I used to. Now, these issues are really messing with my life. I started becoming depressed my spring sem of freshman year, and now I am still depressed. I go to the school funded therapy and try to explain my issue, and all they ever say is ""well maybe you just haven't found the right group of people"". Ya, no shit. Doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.

I don't know what to do. I'm beginning to live a very miserable life, and while I love my major, even if I got my dream job, I'd still be miserable if my social situation doesn't change. I don't know if transferring to a new school will even help because I feel as though there's a life lesson I missed that I needed to learn that I never did, so I feel like no matter what I do, nothing is going to change. Every day I try to socialize with my fraternity brothers and the people that come to the house, but I always just end up coming back to my room and smoking by myself.

I feel very hopeless, and I have become a much more pessimistic person on the inside. Everyday I do my best to be a better person, but I still get nowhere, and it makes me hate myself. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.",08Sep2019,1
881,"I (m24) met her (F21) last year. We worked together last summer. She instantly became a light in my life. I didn't realize it at first, but after a few weeks I knew I def had a thing for her. 

To this day I still don't know if she felt the same way as I did/do, but when her last day of work came last August, she was getting in her uber and said, ""If anyone has anything they want to tell me, now's the time"". I have a lot of trouble expressing emotions, especially around people. All of our coworkers were there watching her, and watching me, and I got so anxious that I couldn't say anything. She drove off and I haven't seen her since.

At first I was angry at myself for letting myself let yet another potential relationship slip through my hands (a running issue for me to be sure, something I'm now working on). But then I eventually just came to the mentality that it just wasn't meant to be or this or that or the other. I figured I'd move on with time. 

Well the quick rundown of this year is: apparently I'm attractive now and I haven't moved on. As the year went on, more and more people started flirting with me, some single and some in relationships. At first I thought I was looking too far into things, but then I had to accept that there was just too many people and I guess they like me. That was new for me. Yet with all this attention, I didn't really want it. I didn't do anything with any of them, and I don't regret it. They just weren't anywhere near good enough. She was/is.

I still feel feelings for this girl as strongly, if not stronger, as I did before. I've recently accepted that I'm either in love with her or like somethings wrong with me, so that is something to consider. But it does just seem simpler for it to be love. 

Today I very nearly sent a text, just something simple to finally ask her out. But I didn't. I know the advice is gonna be something like ""Just send it!!!!"" but there's a few things holding me back. 

1. I'm really worried she doesn't have my number saved anymore. Not that she'd delete it spitefully, but like she's someone who doesn't like clutter, and a former coworker's number is something I could see her deem as ""clutter"".

2. Her birthday is in a week. At the very least I think that, if I do send it, it should be a bit after her birthday, right? Sending it right before her birthday just seems selfish to me idk

3. I know she hates being asked out over text, and she very likely is aware that I chickened out a year ago. Why would she bother giving me a second chance?

I just don't know what to do. Like what if she says no? I've been trying to put away these feelings for a year now and I can't, and then she says no and then what? They don't go away for another few years, if then?

I don't date much (or like at all) so I'm sorry if this sounds whiny and pathetic but like I just don't like when I don't already know/cant predict the outcome of things. Dating is always an unpredictable toss-up so it's always scared me. So yea what do",08Sep2019,1
882,"I'm three final exams away from getting my degree. Last year my mom died and ever since then my grandma has been telling me that I have to get my degree before she dies. I've always been a good student, i've always given my all to my education and I never got a bad degree because I pressure myself way more that I should, so her telling me that kind of stuff didn't really help my mental state at all.

I obviously felt more pressured to finish my college education, but I kept going at my own pace because it was okay and because I was trying to take care of my mental health.

Now the thing is that we are waiting to find out if my grandma has breast cancer, plus she now needs insulin injections because she's diabetic.

I feel way more pressured now to get my degree but I honestly don't feel good. I'm not in a good mental state right now. I'm anxious all the time, I can't sleep, I barely see my friends anymore and I just can't focus when I'm studying.

I really don't know what to do. I know I should make her happy but my mental health is extremely fragile right now.

883,"I've always loved academia; I love to nerd out and research historical material thoroughly and craft a proper essay and engage in discourse. I completed my A-Levels and got a very good grade in history and good grades across the board. I applied to a competitive university to study Law, as their law programme guarantees admission into a Law School provided that your GPA is high enough but I didn't get in. 

My family has a strong history in the legal profession and it's what myself and my cousins were all expected (and pushed) to pursue, so we did. I was happy and excited to study law (until I didn't get in...) I'm currently doing a one-year certificate course that the University recommended I do to make myself a 'more competitive applicant' (everyone I knew that did this certificate got into Law, but I didn't know about it until it was too late for me to apply.) It's a certificate in business management with business and commercial law, but I'm not that excited for it...

I was content with my decision until yesterday when I checked my email and received an offer to study history at the same university that rejected me for Law, the issue is I'm already enrolled in the certificate programme now and a pretty sizeable registration fee was paid... (My family is quite poor.) The offer made me seriously reconsider the certificate programme, but as soon as I told my mother about it she was not enthusiastic about the idea at all, she just said ""We'll have to write up a letter politely declining the offer tomorrow."" There was no discussion, I told her I would've done it if they sent it sooner and she said ""You just have to think about what you want to do in the long run"". I... think I want to accept the offer to study history. 

I don't know what to do or what to tell her, but I know she and the rest of my family will be totally unsupportive of me studying anything other than Law. (Studying history and going to law school after is not a plausible option since there is only one law school in my country  that can grant me a practicing certificate instead of a bachelors in law and it's *incredibly* competitive to get into)

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I applied to a university to study law, highly encouraged by the rest of my immediate family who are all involved in some way in law, but didn't get in. I'm doing a certificate now for a year to make myself a more 'competitive student', but received an offer to study history at the university that rejected me for law, and I want to do it, but my family will not let me or support the decision (I need them to fund the 25% of my education that the Government will not pay for.)

884,"Hello!

So my bf and I are planning to move out together by the end of this year. I am currently renting a house with my aunt (single mom) who has two young adult daughters. Her kids are are in college and one is working.  My aunt makes an okay amount and generally provides for her daughters. I pay almost 1/3 of the rent and am generally not home so they basically provide for internet etc. In addition, I have an uncle that is living in our living room and using our utilities despite him having his own room at his mom’s house (my grandmother). He does not help us pay for anything. 

First of all, my room is super tiny. If I were to move out, I don’t know who would want to pay for this room.

Secondly, once I move out, my aunt will have trouble paying for the entire rent herself. There is only so much her daughter can contribute since she doesn’t make much herself. They also have other bills to pay.

My uncle refuses to take over my rent and claiming that he will be moving out around the same time I am. Yet, he still continues to live off of us....and we can’t even relax in our own living room majority of the time. 

My mom and grandma tells me to stay with my aunt to help her out:; however, I have my own life too. I don’t want to feel stuck and I guess I should’ve thought about this before moving in with my aunt. 
I even offered to pay an extra month of rent to help her out; however, there still won’t be anyone to take over my rent. In addition, this will probably require her to move to another place. We have lived in this house for about a year and half. 

Am I being selfish? Am I in the right to want to move out? Is there a better way to go around this? Any advice would be appreciated!",08Sep2019,1

889,"So a little context here. I moved to a new city in 2015 and met a girl at church. We instantly connected and became best friends.

We hung out once or twice a week and texted each other everyday. The only times we didn't talk as much was during finals and midterms so we could focus on studying so that was always okay.

Fast forward and I graduated from college and nothing changed between us. But when she graduated from college the next semester, she became extremely distant. She never wanted to hang out, she stopped answering my texts, and if I saw her at church she wouldn't say much and just leave. In the past year, she's only offered to hang out with me twice, and both of those times was when someone guilted her into doing it (I have depression and have expressed a desire to end my life on multiple occasions).

And I want to ask her if there was something I did to make her not like me anymore, but I'm afraid of coming out sounding clingy, or she'll think I'm annoying (and if I were to try asking her over text if I did something wrong, there's the chance that she won't even answer me, which makes me even more nervous).

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.
