0,"I think I’m slowly falling into depression. Actually, I won’t diagnos it as depression rn because maybe its not. I’m very lost in life rn because I don’t know what career I want, and the more unsure I am then the more money and time I waste. I feel useless because I have no passion in any field of work. I am so confused on what to do, I have already failed a university class and might fail another one (still waiting on grades). I constantly have the need to isolate myself from my friends and I just want to run away. I wouldn’t label myself as suicidal, but I definitely wouldn’t be alive if I knew it wouldn’t bring my family and friends sadness. I just see no purpose to this life, just doing my time till I can go. Sorry if the format is weird, I’m not on desktop.",25Apr2019,1
1,"I’m sorry about my post being unintelligible or hard to read. This is all just a sorry excuse but I am on mobile and I’m not the best at typing/ terrible at English. (Bad excuse, English is my only language) but here goes my story and why I am here typing. I always feel like I’m messing everything up. I’m never comfortable with who I am. I’m always wanting to do better and in the end feel like I fucked up or am a fuck up. I joke about how bad I am at almost everything. I laugh about how even my death will be funny. I don’t understand why I do these things. I think it’s hilarious that I’m all screwed up. But it hurts all my relationships. Family, boy-friend, friends, coworkers, etc....
I want to change the way I think. I used to be very depressed. Got on meds that helped me cope. I don’t do stupid shit anymore that got me hurt. 

I know there’s so much more I could add to help anyone reading to better understand the situation/ how I feel but this is what I have for the time being.

2,"So I don't want to bore you to death with random details, basically I was with some guy friends (we are all in our 20s) and somehow in the conversation I brought up how we all fantasize about being girls sometimes, I got a bunch of weird looks from them and realized I was probably the only one who does this. I ended up playing it off as a joke but it is something I fantasize about on a daily basis and I just always assumed that every guy did. Now I'm just really confused about all this and I wouldn't mind some advice or even someone to talk to. Thanks",25Apr2019,2
3,"Well, I am friends with this girl since last year and this year we are now in separate classes and she made new friends from this new class, but they hate me and I don't know why.

I have never been a mean or annoying person to them but I believe they hate me becauses she comes with me when I go over them, and they pull her back and try to keep her with them using physical force. 

They kicked me and made an acrostic (that's what I think it is called) with my name calling me things and more. And they already threw a piece of bread at her and the butter got all over her hair.

Now I don't know what to do. I want they to stop hating me but my friend already told me she is done and wants to get new friends, and I am afraid that they will start spreading fake news calling me a ""W@nker"", but specially about her.
I am lost and I need advice on how to deal with this situation.

 What should I do? How I would make they not to hate me? Should I bother with some threats I recieved? I am lost.",25Apr2019,1
4,"I am a very calm person for the most part, and the only time where I am ever afraid is when my flashbacks occur. When something triggers a flashback, I go from a calm and collected person to an absolute shaky, terrified, unresponsive mess. 

I didn't want to seek help until something happened to me recently. I never want to be sad or frightened around my loved ones, but a few days ago I had a severe panic attack in front of my boyfriend. He is aware that I have PTSD, but this was the first time he has ever seen how bad it can get. 

He was a total sweetheart. He helped me through it and he stayed with me until I had to go back home. After that happened, I've decided that I never wanted to see him so frightened or worried about me ever again. I love him way too much to make him that frightened again, and I never want to make him cry.

On top of that, I have learned how to mask my emotions well. In order to prevent my dad from being angry with me for breaking down, I shut off my emotions instantly. I went from having the worst panic attack of my life to believably acting as if nothing was wrong at all. It makes me feel like a liar, and I am disappointed that I know how to do it even though it keeps me safe.

I have lost friends because of my PTSD. My family and loved ones look at me like I am some kind of monster, and I don't know how to fix my reputation.

I’m in a better place now as far as not wanting to harm myself and being optimistic about the future, but I can no longer get myself to take pills of any kind. I turned to smoking weed instead of taking painkillers when needed, and I avoid performing oral on males at all costs. I’m having a surgery next month and was told that I’m going to have to take antibiotics as well as painkillers before and after the surgery, but I can’t see myself swallowing any pills. I tried hard today to relax and practice on a small supplement, but I threw up before getting it into my mouth.

12," Help. Im 18 and living at home. I recently got laid off from my paid internship in the same week that my parents found out I was smoking weed. I realized that smoking weed was not going to work out for me considering my long term goals and the fact that I need to cooperate with my parents so I quit. However my parents still arent happy. They are very strong Christians and will not let me hang out with anyone that doesnt share the same worldview. Up until Junior year of high school I was homeschooled but due to repeated disobedience and sneaking around to look at porn or play video games they decided to put me in public school as they decided they could not handle schooling me in the same way any longer. Now, even after I quit smoking weed, they are forcing me to stop seeing the friends that I was forced to make when I went to public school and make new friends of their same value system. This is not something I want to do, but they keep saying that if I disobey them they will call the school and tell them that my friends smoke weed and also tell the parents of my friends. That is the last thing that I want however they say that it is their duty toward the familes of those people (who are all also 18). They do not trust a single word that I say and do not think I am capable of making decisions for myself. If I don't agree with what they say they will not financially support me at all. I need a mentor with good advice that I can talk to during these rough times. I have never let my grades slip and I have always been a highly motivated person but all they care about is how christian I am.

13,"So a couple days ago, one of my closest friends(and roommate) told me that a close friend of his from school just died. We don’t go to school together, but I have met the guy he was talking about a couple times. 

My roommate said that he don’t know what happened, only that he was found dead in his home. My first thought was suicide, which I imagine makes the pain even worse for my roommate.

I have told him I am very sorry for his loss, and if he ever needs someone to talk about it with, then I’m there for him. 

The truth is, I do not know what I should do next. The problem is, I don’t think he talks to anyone about it, and as far as I know, I’m the only one he has told about this out of his friends that didn’t know the guy that died. That includes the 3 other people I live with, his family etc. 

I don’t think I can understand the pain he is feeling, and I don’t know how he wants to cope with it. What do I do? Do I let him grieve in his own way, or do I try to get him to talk about it?",25Apr2019,1
14,"I graduated college last spring and moved straight home to start work and save money before moving into my own place. I told myself I would stay for a year and then move out, but now that a year has gone by I find myself struggling to decide what to do. My parents are fine with me staying and we get along very well. I have reconnected with my younger siblings again and really feel apart of the family again, after being away at college for 4 years. I did my research and found the best place for my price range\\location, it is move in ready starting May 1st. No one in my family is pressuring me to leave but my parents are planning on moving by the end of this year and I feel like since I found the perfect place and have saved up the money that I should move out. 

My only inhibition is that I've looked so long to find this place and even though I work full time, I am an entry level employee so my income isn't really high. I am worried that I am rushing myself to move out when I could stay a few more months and save even more money, which would help me more in the long run. On the other hand, I feel like this place is perfect and I struggled to find something of this quality and space for such a good price, in the neighborhood I wanted. There truly isn't anything like it in my price range anywhere else. I also feel like moving out at the beginning of the American summer time is better than moving out in fall/winter. **Any insights you guys can give me? The place I found will work with my budget now, but its more of a matter of me feeling like I should take advantage of living at home as long as possible since it helps me save my money.

19,"Not sure if this is the right sub, if you know somewhere this fits better please tell me. 

TLDR at end. 

This is the story that my mom told me. I wasn’t there but I tried to ask her for as many details as possible and will try to include them all. 

So my mom was walking down the street today and a man walked up to her and stopped her insisting she was “blessed”. He said he was psychic and could read the minds of about 1/5 people. He said that he got a very good feeling from her and could tell she was a very good kind person. He went on to say a little bit about her, just kind of generic stuff which might be broadly applied to many people, like she is kind but angers too quickly, over-shares her feelings (both true, but could be a lucky guess). Then he asked whether he could write something down for her and she said ok. He takes out a pen and paper and writes something that she cannot see. He then balls up the paper, passes it to her, tells her not to open it but to put it in her pocket. She puts it in her coat pocket herself, the man did not touch the paper again after this point. She said that for the next few minutes her hand was in her pocket most of the time holding the paper because she wanted to make sure not to lose it. However it is possible that her hand left her pocket sometimes. He then proceeds to ask her some questions. “What’s your favourite colour, number” she answers him and he says he is writing it down although she cannot see what he is writing. He then asks if she could wish for anything in the world what would it be? She said she wishes well for her daughter (me) and the man says ok I will write AWFMD which stands for “a wish for my daughter”.  He then asks for daughters age and name. Writes the age and the first letter of the name on the paper. (At this point in the story I am cringing because it sounds to me like this man wants to guess my moms passwords... but anyhow story continues). So then he says ok check the paper in your pocket. My mom pulls it out of her pocket herself and unfolds it (the man doesn’t ever touch it). It reads everything they just discussed, the colour, number, “AWFMD”, my age and the first letter of my name. She says that none of this came up before the prediction. He never asked her any of these things until she already had the note in her pocket. He didn’t come close enough to slip his hand in her pocket and switch the notes while they were talking and there was nobody else on the street that could have done it, besides, her own hand was in her pocket most of the time holding onto the note. He said “now you believe you are blessed and that I can really see it!”. She asked if she could keep the note but he said no that he must burn the notes. He gave her a charm that looks like a little wooden ridged ball on a string and that I should wear it for good luck. That was the end of the interaction. 

Has anybody heard of a similar trick? How could he have made those predictions appear in her pocket? She is convinced that he is psychic even though she doesn’t normally believe in that type of stuff. I do not believe he is psychic but I can’t think of how it was done. The fact that she couldn’t keep the note afterwards and also the fact that he only wrote the first letter of my name and the acronym of the wish rather than the whole thing seems suspicious.
If you know how this was done please let me know!!

TLDR: a man convinced my mom he was psychic by writing a prediction on a slip of paper which she kept in her pocket. He then asked her very specific questions about herself, and when she removed the paper from her pocket it said exactly the info she had told the man. How is this trick done?",25Apr2019,1

21,"Long story short she got mad because I exposed her for cheating and she went to the police crying and lying around saying I beat her, threatened to kill her and her kids in a house fire and damaged her property.

They would tell her if she can give them any proof of even aggression they could work with it but she had nothing because I did nothing. After 6/7 months of strict probation and fighting the court they realised she was lying and caught her in it and dropped the charges. Yet she didn’t get in trouble for missing court after being subpoenaed or for perjury. 

I’m afraid she is going to start this again as she tries to add my family back on fb (they told me) I have her blocked. She added my family last time right before she started the lying.

Also posted this on r/relationship_advice but thought id try here too

When I was in kindergarten I met this extremely shy boy who wouldn't speak to ANYONE but his immediate family. To the point where people figured he was mute. I felt very drawn to him and wanted to be his friend so bad. We became best friends.

We would not leave each other's side during school even though he never spoke to me. So all day I would be talking to his head and he wouldn't say anything but he was pretty much my only and first real friend. We lived in a small neighborhood with a small school so the teachers had all been aware of our lil dynamic and each new school year we automatically sat next to each other because I was the only one that ""understood"" him.

Until I moved cities in the middle of third grade. His mom had told mine that he was devastated and upset, around our middle school years later I would have kids from our school message me on facebook telling me he never really changed and wouldn't really want friendships but I'm not completely sure how true that was.

Then around our high school years I heard he was doing better and was stepping out his shell more.

He never stopped crossing my mind throughout the years. My family had gone to his house for his family events but he would never leave his due to the his anxiety so I never got to interact with him after I moved.

Now, im not sure why but he's been in my thoughts a lot lately. Mostly just curious wondering about how his life was like, how it's like now, just overall wanting to reconnect and have a conversation. I didn't mention that ive been thinking about him but my mom brought up that he might not be doing as good as he was before.

I did some snooping trying to find any trace of him on social media and just as I suspected, I found no pages of his. I found his brother and I'm debating messaging his brother to ask for his contact information but im afraid it would be too creepy? would that be overstepping? We were best friends when we were children and I don't know if he would even want anything with me now. Would the anxiety of me reaching out be too much for him? Also, if he were to have wanted to find me I have a kind of unique name that he would of found if he did want to find me.

Here’s a short back story: our cheer team has about 20 recent state champion titles and a long history of success. My coach has only had seniors as captains for a long time. This year my best friend and I are seniors

We’ve been best friends since grade school and have done everything together, family vacations, etc. she’s one of the only people I could always go to and feel comfortable. We can always joke around and be “real” with each other. 

Ever since the roster with captains was announced she has been avoiding emotional conversations with me and she keeps conversations about cheerleading VERY short. I feel like I can’t joke around with her and it seems like everything I say hurts her feelings, even though I don’t brag about being captain. I would never want to rub it in her face in anyway. 

We had our first practice tonight and she kept referring to herself to me as “lower class” ?? and that “her opinion doesn’t matter” ?? My job as a captain is to listen to her opinion and make it happen

We used to sit in my car after practice and rant about other people and talk for hours. Tonight after practice she got in another girl’s car, I can only imagine what she was saying without me in the car. 

I’ve tried going to her about it but I always chicken out because I don’t know what to say 

I can’t simply drop her because we have school together and hours of cheer practice everyday and we work together

37,"Theo Von describes how he’s always felt uncomfortable - that it’s just a natural state and I relate to that so much. 

I’m an 18 year old girl and I always knew I was kindddd of weird and just not like anyone else I knew.  I’ve always dressed “like a tomboy” even though I fucking hate that phrase, I know I could own it but I don’t want to be boxed in to some ‘type’ or category of style/person, I don’t know, just because I don’t wear particularly “girly” clothes or act in the same way that girls I’ve known my whole life do. Social norms have really done a number on me, but I’m realising just how much now. 

My relationships with guys, even friendships, are so skewed by my constant paranoia that 1. guys only want to fuck you, 2. I should want to be fucked by them, 3. no one’s gonna fuck me bc I’m not trying to be attractive 

I just don’t try to look gorgeous all the time, I’m happy with how I look and I’d hope that any guy or girl who really got me wouldn’t expect me to be a certain way, and they probably don’t. 

I guess, I need advice on how to stop putting pressures on myself and unlearn the societal norms that have me feeling so unhappy with myself? 


And an added question for people struggling or who have struggled with their sexual identity...growing up, just because of how the world is, even in the back of my mind I thought guys and girls are meant to be and even though I’ve been in two relationships with girls, I still feel that kind of “ick” in the back of my head like, guilt? Shame? For a while I attributed this to me maybe just fooling myself and that I was actually straight but now I’m starting to really get confused and think I’m actually only into girls. I don’t know? I’m not too bothered, I can experiment with guys and girls and mainly it’s just personality I’m attracted to but damn, how the hell do you just get comfortable with yourself?

38,"Throw away for a few reasons, I apologize about the length.

I’m currently a senior in high school but a little over a year  ago I had a great friend-I’ll refer to her as Amy- but things didn’t end very well between us, to sum it up she began acting really toxic and telling my to stop hanging out with some of my friends, and when I ended or friendships she didn’t take it too well. Ironically my current close friends began talking to her and are now really great friends with Amy.

Recently however my best friend is having a really important get together, kind of like a celebration before we graduate since she won’t be staying in the same area for too long, and of course Amy was invited.

I haven’t said anything since they’re great friends and they’re allowed to be friends with whoever they want to, but I don’t think I can stand being in the same room as her.
Should I just ride it out and have to deal with some petty ness or try saying something? I should probably clarify that I’ve tried telling my close friends about how toxic she was but they got really defensive and shut me down before I could finish. I don’t want to miss her event and I don’t want to end our 3 year friendship over someone who I won’t even hear from again in a few months. I know it’s not a very big deal but it’s been in my mind for a while.",25Apr2019,1
39,"There’s a lot of backstory to this so it’s gonna be really long, just bare with me.
This school year has been a roller coaster so far. I’m in 10th grade, so of course there’s a bunch of drama. Last year I was looking for that cliche high school experience (partying, drinking, etc.) and my friends from middle school (a group of abt 9 kids) didn’t really want to do that stuff. I made a couple of friends who were down to do all that stuff (I’ll call them Liam and Robert for this story). Around the start of 10th grade, I had made a bunch of friends and I ended up cutting off (or at least trying to) my middle school friends because I thought I had finally found my clique. 

Couple months later, a bunch of shit happened. Long story short, I ended up cutting Liam off. I ended up being really depressed and hating myself for the holiday season. During that time, there were 2 kids who helped me through it more than everyone else. One was Robert, the other was Lauren (not her real name). Lauren was one of my friends I made in middle school, but she moved out of area over last summer (we are still really close friends and she comes back to visit all of her friends every once in a while). At this point, I had to start talking to my middle school friends again, although with me cutting them off and Lauren moving away, the group had kinda fallen apart, although they are all still friends.

Robert and I were really close friends over the winter, doing lots of dumb shit together. However around the beginning of February he started to get really egotistical and annoying.

Also, around this time, I started dating a girl named autumn (not her real name).

Since February, Robert is just an asshole to me no matter what, but will still invite me to hang out sometimes. I think that Robert is insecure about being weak (possibly jealous of me too because he got rejected by autumn earlier this year, but I’m not sure), and that’s why he’s always acting hard. He is open to autumn about his feelings, but doesn’t have any feelings when I’m around.

This is how it started;
Around the end of February, my school had a winter dance (I asked autumn to the dance and that’s how we started dating). The DJ sucked, and the dance was lame. There was another kid hosting a party on the same night. I went to the dance with a group of friends that was mostly girls (Robert, Lauren, and Autumn were all there). About 20 minutes after we got to the dance, Robert wanted to leave to go to the other kids party, because everyone else decided the dance was lame. I couldn’t find a way to get there and back with the rest of my friends. Robert was pissed. He told me to stop changing myself for the girls and go get drunk. First of all, Autumn would have gotten in a lot of trouble for going to a crazy party like that. Second, I wasn’t ditching my date and a bunch of other friends to get drunk with him. I even made plans to go to the party later that night with a couple other friends, but he still called me a pussy for not going. 

The party got busted by the cops while I was on the way with the few friends that decided to go (Lauren was among those friends). We still had to pick up Robert from the party and take him home. He was drunk as shit when we got there, as expected. He was rly making Lauren uncomfortable the whole way home (he had his hand on her shoulder and kept touching her legs) which annoyed me too. 

The next day in school, I asked him if he remembered all the things he did, and he actually seemed pissed at me for asking. It’s not that hard to answer and it’s not a stupid question; Robert and I had gotten shitfaced earlier that year and remembered literally nothing.

He’s continued to call me a pussy, a bitch, beta male etc. for the past couple of months.

Recently, Robert and I got in an argument in a Snapchat group chat because I sent a picture of the hockey game I was watching, and he complained that I was always talking about hockey (which is partially true, I’m a die hard capitals fan). However this was a single picture of a hockey game. I told him to stop being egotistical but he just mocked me for it, didn’t even listen to what I said, for the entire argument. Now it seems like every conversation I have with him is like this.

After this argument, I made a new group chat with the same people minus him. I announced that I was cutting him off for good and we weren’t friends anymore. 

But after that, autumn told me that Robert was having a tough time recently, and that a lot of his close friends were cutting him off. I second guessed my decision. I know what it’s like to feel isolated from everyone else, and i don’t wanna make it hard for him. But I just can’t find a way to talk to him without him trying to humiliate me. He’s impossible. I don’t even care that he tries to make fun of me, all of my friends do it and I do it to them, but with Robert it’s all he does. I can’t even have a conversation with him anymore because he just tries to be an asshole every sentence. 

This isn’t an easy choice for me. That’s why I’m here. But I’ve asked everyone that I feel comfortable enough talking abt this for advice and nothing really helped.",25Apr2019,1
40,"So I’m going to start off by saying that I’ve been friends with this girl for about 4 years now, we met through my friend which is her ex. So anyway I started seeing her a lot, we go out to dinner, hang out at her house, and just stuff friends normally do. Sometimes she would invite me to her family parties, like birthday parties and what not. She has also invited me to go on vacation with her which I happily accepted. So I soon started have feelings for her and being the person I am, I told her about the feelings I have for her. We’ve talked about it and I found out she had feelings for me too.

After we had a long talk about our feelings for each other, she basically told me to we should just be friends, so I got bummed out because I really care about her, she means the world to me and she has been there for me when I was going through tough times. I wanted to be something more than friends with her, I’ve tried to forget the feelings I have for her but it’s just tough and when I did it was only for a short while, when we would hang out again those feelings would come back and I would start thinking about her again. I would tell her and she would keeping telling me to lose them. In all I don’t know what to do. My mind is telling me one way and my heart is telling me another. 

I don’t know if I should keep trying to pursue her or just drop her altogether. We’ve been through so much and have so much in common. I think about her everyday and it’s painful because I want to be with her and I can’t.",25Apr2019,1
41,"Ok for some context: I have a big Geometry Test tomorrow and each Test is worth about 100 points. We only get three tests each making period and it is crucial that I get a good grade on it. Right now we are learning Chapter 2 - Reasoning and Proof (and EVERYONE hates going through the discipline to learn the Chapter). I have to know all of the things below, but I'm not sure how to go by doing it. The test will not say direct definitions of each Postulate, Theorem, Property and Term, but instead it would say something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

If Segment BD bisects &lt;ABC, then &lt;ABC ≅ &lt;DBC : 

ANSWER = Definition of a Bisector

If 7(x-3) = 35, then 35 = 7(x-3): Answer:

ANSWER = **Symmetric Property of Equality**

If 2x + 19 = 27, then 2x = 8: Answer:

ANSWER = Subtraction Property of Equality

&amp;#x200B;

Below is all the Postulates, Theorems, Properties, and Terms I have to know. My question is if you had one night to get all this information in your head and you know the problems would be like the ones above me then how would you study it?

&amp;#x200B;

Postulates:

* Segment Addition Postulate =  If **A**, **B**, and **C**, are collinear, then point **B** is between **A** and **C** if and only if **AB** \+ **BC** = **AC**
* Angle Addition Postulate  = D is in the interior of &lt;ABC  if and only if m&lt;ABD  + m&lt;DBC  = m&lt;ABC\_

&amp;#x200B;

Theorems:

* **Reflexive Property of Congruence = (Segment) AB** ≅ **(Segment) AB**
* **Symmetric Property of Congruence = (Segment) AB** ≅ **(Segment) CD, then (Segment)**

 **CD ≅ (Segment) AB** 

* **Transitive Property of Congruence  = (Segment) AB** ≅ **(Segment) CD, &amp; (Segment) CD** ≅ **(Segment) EF then (Segment) AB** ≅ **(Segment) EF**
* Supplement Theorem = If two angles form a linear pair, then they are \*\*supplementary angles\*\*
* Complement Theorem = If the non common sides of two adjacent angles form a right angle, then the angles are \*\*complementary angles\*\*
* Congruent Supplements Theorem =  Angles \*\*supplementary\*\* to the\*\* same angle\*\* or to \*\*congruent angles\*\* are \*\*congruent\*\* 
* Congruent Complements Theorem =  Angles \*\*complementary\*\* to the\*\* same angle\*\* or to \*\*congruent angles\*\* are \*\*congruent \*\*
* Vertical Angles Theorem = If \*\*two angles\*\* are \*\*vertical angles\*\*, then they are \*\*congruent\*\*
* Perpendicular Lines Intersect to Form Right Angles Theorem = Perpendicular lines intersect to form four right angles  
* All Right Angles are Congruent Theorem = All right angles are congruent
* Perpendicular Lines form Adjacent Angles Theorem = Perpendicular lines from congruent adjacent angles
* If two angles are Congruent &amp; Supplementary then each Angle is a Right Angle Theorem = If two angles are congruent and supplementary, then each angle is a right angle
* If two Congruent Angles form a linear pair, then they are 90 Theorem =  If two congruent angles form a linear pair, then they are right angles 

&amp;#x200B;

Properties:

* Addition Property of Equality = If **A** = **B,** then **A** \+ **C** = **B** \+ **C**
* Subtraction Property of Equality = If **A** = **B**, then **A** \- **C** = **B** \- **C**
* Multiplication Property of Equality = If **A** = **B**, then **A** \* **C** = **B** \* **C**
* Division Property of Equality = If **A** = **B** and **C** !=, then, **A/C** = **B/C**
* **Reflexive Property of Equality = A = A**
* **Symmetric Property of Equality =  If A = B, then B = A**
* **Transitive Property of Equality = If A = B, and B = C, then A = C**
* Substitution Property of Equality = If **A** = **B**, (then A may be replaced by B in any equation or expression)
* Distributive  Property of Equality = **A**(B + C) = AB + AC

Definitions:

* Definition - Midpoint = If AB has endpoints at x1 and x2 on a number line, then the midpoint M of AB has a coordinate ::x1+x2/2::
* Definition - Supplementary = Two angles who’s sum is 180
* Definition - Right Angles = 90 degrees
* Definition - Bisectors  = -A ray that divides an angle into two congruent coplanar angles",25Apr2019,1

47,"1. **Take Shelter.** Lock yourself in a secure room, padded walls are ideal. Do this not only for your safety but for the safety of those around you. Breaking up can heighten your emotions to levels that may qualify for rehabilitation. Being in the open can prompt brash decision making, thus making you a clear suspect for any crimes you commit. You need time to gather yourself. 
2. **Consider Homicide.** Take your time coordinating a plan, there's nothing worse than a clumsy execution. Be sure to leave no evidence, find an adequate alibi, and a proper place to dispose of the body. Leave no witnesses. 
3. **Burn the Evidence.** This may range from photographs, notes, gifts, the outfit you wore on the first date, the building or location said ""date"" took place. And anything else that serves as a reminder. 
4. **Scrub yourself clean.** This may require a scrub brush and some bleach to fully cleanse away the memories of coming into viewing distance of that swine. Watch as your hands slowly become raw and clear of tribulation.

Hello redditers,

First time poster long time listener here.

I have a work dilemma and could use some guidance. I will try to keep it concise.

\-I'm young(ish) 24f working as a manager at a start-up medical laboratory.I started as a technician and three months in I just became a manager..and It's been alot considering I've never been a manager or worked in a clinical laboratory (I have alot of other science background though). It's also a start-up and there is no structure so I have created and implemented alot of things and it's been a fun but very frustrating/challenging experience and I have gained many skills and knowledge.

\-The laboratory is going through a very rough patch and they brought in new people to help bring everything up to speed to prepare for new account/rebuild. By rough patch I mean my pay checks have been delayed, sometimes we reduce hours, etc... pretty rough. A new girl came in and right away I could tell she was very interested in my job as she has way more experience than I. The new changes have been nice and I am glad they are there to help, but it brings me to the problem.

\- I am overworked and stressed since I started but I genuinely enjoyed my job so I have dealt with it and do everything I can. The new girl started to take over some little bits of my work responsibilities which had me on guard, but I appreciated the help. Although yesterday the new people made it quite apparent that I can do better etc.. and have taken it to the higher ups. In the past-now I constantly seek feedback and they always tell me I am doing well... Yesterday we all had a meeting and they kindly/gently told me that they are having her oversee my work such as following up on things that I do to make sure we get the information, that I'm doing my job etc...

\- I became very upset and addressed the concerns with my boss since I am the head of the department and he reassured me I am ""doing a great job"" etc.... even though it is quite apparent that they think otherwise.

Question:

\-I should resign right?

I work overtime everyday, not being paid for over a month and a half (i will definitely be paid though), and I feel disrespect.

\-or should i suck it up and keep at it?",25Apr2019,1

57,"So me (23) and my partner (24) have recently had a small argument, regarding where to spend the weekends.

Summary (To omit any possible bias I will refer to us as person A and B) : person A is working as a student and finishing a masters degree, currently living at home. A's father is working in another country and returns for the weekends.

person B is living with B's grandmother, while the parents live a significant distance away. B is studying at another city, and returns home for the weekends. Getting a place together is not yet an option, since both A's and B's income is currently too low.

B wants to spend the weekends visiting the parents, as well as rest at home. Person A wants to spend the weekends at home too, especially as there is plenty of work around the house. Both want to spend the time with each other, so they have to decide where they will stay for the weekend.

This is the point of conflict. Person A argues, that it would be most fair to divide the weekend days equally, so that they spend half of the days at A's place, with A's family, and half at either B's parents or B's grandmother. B argues that since B's family are at two different locations, B should get twice as many days.

Again, it was a minor argument, and we know it is ridiculous, but now we're really curious about the general opinion on this dilemma. Think of it as settling a bet. We would appreciate your votes:

I have mild ADHD, not bad enough to take meds for but noticeable, so it is hard for me to focus on multiple things at once and I've been focusing on the job thing so my parents will get off my back.

She has a status all right but not a good one.Our school is small with only 120 people in my grade so everyone kind of know everyone. For the most people don’t like her because she is annoying which really isn’t my issue, and wouldn’t affect me. But I am just trying to make a point on how annoying she can be. She has said many rude things behind me and my friends backs like for example cussing us out. She has started rumors that are not true about me and all this other stuff. Bringing me into drama I do not want to be apart of. Before you give me advice here are some things I have attempted. I have tried distancing myself, but she knows literally my whole schedule and I didn’t tell her. She invites herself to sit at lunch with me and my friends. One time at a school dance we were having me and my friend wanted to go out to eat before. So I kid you not we decided 3 hours before that we were going there, and this crazy person showed up. We didn’t post about we didn’t tell anyone beside out parents. It was me and my 3 really close friends. Like how in the hell did she know we decided 3 hours ago we were going to eat and this crazy girl showed up. I honestly do not know how. I have finally told her recently that we should go are separate ways and that this is not working out between us. You are just a toxic person in my life right now and don’t need it. She left me alone one week and then came back like nothing happened. I really hate being mean to people and don’t like hurting people’s feeling, but I am so over it at this point that I need help.

66,"My wife's friend moved into our house just before Christmas. She came to us telling us that her husband is beating her youngest child out of her three and she wanted to get her away from that and left with a bag of clothes to show up at our door. She left her oldest children with her husband even though allegedly he was being abusive to everyone. A few weeks later her husband drops off their oldest daughter and drives off and disappears in to the sunset.

After hearing many stories about how evil, and disrespectful the oldest child is from the mother we feel obligated to let her stay too. And so far, the oldest child is the one who is respectful and kind and helpful, and the youngest daughter is a nightmare. She will break things for fun, lie to you, steal, and be hateful for no reason other that that she can. And in the last week we have noticed my wife's friend is acting strange and has secretly been packing her and her youngest child's stuff, and moving it out of the house, and not the oldest daughters stuff. ( We had the oldest share a room with our daughter).

What I'm afraid of, is if she is able to abandon her child the first time and want nothing to do with her and living about her child, is she going to try to abandon her with us?

68,"Hi guys, I'm (23) at the point in my college career where I'm majorly regretting the path I've been following and considering a huge change with the job I've been at for several years, to something completely different. Trust me, it's not quite as easy as it seems (at least for me). I've gotten advice from family and those who love me, but I'd like to hear from people who don't personally know me.

Straight out of college I went to the local community college to get my general courses done to eventually transfer to a university. I was bouncing between careers with no clue what I wanted to do. I was approached about an internship at a company that had some family and family friends work/ed there and play a MAJOR role at the place. Now this internship came with major perks like a fully paid scholarship to the nearby university, and I got to eventually decide which department I liked best. How could anyone turn that down?? Of course I took the opportunity and have gotten a ton of experience. I shortly chose a department and was steadily gaining experience while going to school part time.
During this time I've gotten to see what exactly what my future was if I stayed. I was fine with it, I liked it enough at first and had a good team. That team changed and so did the little motivation I had left, and I'm just so not happy. I've been mistreated too long and just realized that it isn't where I want to be working in 5 years. 

I could potentially get a new position in a field that I would be crazy about, doing things I'd really enjoy. But now I'd have some to worry about paying for a year left of school without the scholarship. I was already wanting and wishing I could take fewer classes, extending that year, because college is so difficult for me and I'd rather take less classes and focus on one or two classes to raise my GPA. In the long run I see myself being so much happier in this position, but I have a ton of guilt on leaving the place I've been at. 

Personally having a year of college to pay for is worth it to be doing something I'd be happier in. My parents are about the only ones who feel I should stick it out, but I don't want to continue taking advantage of situation that I am no longer happy in.

69,"Yesterday my kid (4F) came home from daycare and told me that an older boy (one of the daycare ladies kids in elementary school) tried to stick his hands in her pants. 

She was able to tell me the entire story, which lead me to believing that she isn't telling a ""tall tale"". Apparently he tried to put his hand in her pants, she said no, and then he stuck his hand in his own pants and said ""check this out"".

My daughter is my best little friend and I will ALWAYS listen to her and take her seriously. I called the daycare lady to inform her of the situation and advised that my daughter will not be returning to daycare. She (daycare lady) said she doesn't think that could even happen because she is ""constantly"" watching. Yeah, well shit can happen in the blink of an eye, and again - I will ALWAYS have my kids back. 

So today my kiddo stayed home with me (luckily I work from home), and she will continue to stay home with me until we find a daycare facility with cameras. After I got off work today we took a stroll to the grocery store. Upon checking out, the cashier said ""hi little girl, did you have a good day today?"" And my daughter replies ""a boy put his hand in my pants"". 

Now, I'm ALL for my daughter telling Mommy &amp; Daddy EVERYTHING. But it puts me in a very strange spot when she says things like this to strangers. On one hand I'm like ""tell me everything, you never need to hide anything"" and on the next hand I'm like ""okay so you can't say that to other people baby""... Which ultimately is very confusing to a young child.

I'm not sure how exactly to approach this, and how many people I should allow her to openly tell, or how to explain (to where it makes sense) that she can't tell everyone that. Any thoughts? 

TL;DR Another kid at daycare apparently tried to touch my child. I pulled her from daycare. And now she wants to tell every random stranger what happened. I need advice on how to explain that she can't just go around saying that to EVERYONE.",25Apr2019,53
70,"Might seem a little dumb to worry about it but here goes;

Around 30 kids from my school went on a field trip to a college. My friend and I were bored af so we were just talking during a presentation or some shit and teacher kept telling us to be quiet and being a bitch. So when she wasn't looking I took a pic, captioned it ""she was a bitch today"" and posted it, not thinking much about it. It has been about 2 months and my friend was using his phone at lunch (even though he was not supposed to.) Principal snatched his phone and started taking pics of his feed and friends post, mine of course being on of them. Afterwards, it got around to the teacher and a few other staff members.  My friend told me about it so all I did was change my name, profile pic, bio, and go private. I figured that ought to do it. Until today. My friends were grilled and interrogated about the post, luckily not snitching on me. Word got around school and I overheard a staff member say, ""Whoever gets caught, this will affect them getting into \[redatcted\] high school."" (which I had applied and been accepted into.) I deleted my Instagram, started a new one, and spread the word that I had ""just started Instagram"", using a really nooby bio, and using different grammar and whatnot.

71,"Hey all,

So I'm at a stage where I'm interested in getting to know different types of people and seeing if I can expand my social life a bit.

I've had a good group of friends over the past ten years. It's small, but loyal, and we've had some epic times.

Still though, with everyone getting older and drifting further apart, I've been wanting to broaden my horizons a bit. Not saying I rely on other people to be happy and have entertainment, but it would be fun to maybe add to my circle without trying too hard.

Any thoughts, tips, ideas for adding new friends and getting to know new people? I'm not afraid of trying new things, but everyone fears rejection, ridicule and humiliation. Don't want to try too hard, but at the same time want to try just a little bit.

74,"So this is a long story but I'll try shorten as much as I can.

Pretty much my BF and I both have our own dogs that we had before we met eachother. Both are 4y/o. We have been together for 1.5 years. 
We raised them in a way that doesn't suit living together. As in, we raised them as equals to ourselves during our single lives. Which is wrong when it comes to groups because dogs require hierarchy. And as it stands, when we moved in together in Dec 2018, our dogs were both extremely dominant and fought a lot. It got pretty bad. The smaller of the two ended up in the vet with a bunch of stitches. And when I say smaller I don't mean some kind of chihuahua, hes a strong as hell bull terrier. My dog is just a larger mix breed. And there was no proof of who kept starting the fights. Anyway fast forward, we needed to fix this problem so neither one had to give up a dog. 
So we employed the help of a behaviouralist. She came in and examined the situation and the dogs body language and pretty much told us that they were both acting in a highly anxious way and neither of them was being over confident which tells us that neither is a bully. They are just both very confused as to where they stand. So our homework was to teach them that we (the humans) are the top dog and they are not. This meant not letting them have full range of the house whenever they want, instead only letting them on the couch and bed when we told them they could. (Previously they were allowed to do whatever whenever). So that they knew that neither of them had to fight for the role of top dog. Encouraging them to be equals within the pack. 
With this knowledge and some tools for training we spent the next couple months teaching them we are boss. We also bought a big crate for in the house so we could have them off the lead in the house which helped us relax and taught them to sniff eachother without being defensive. 
This went great. They sometimes touch noses and give eachother kisses through the cage. And outside the house during walks they had no beef between them whatsoever. 
Now to the problem that has arisen a couple times now.
When my BFs dog is in the crate (the bull terrier) and my dog is out, without planning or anything sometimes I play with my dog and wrestle with her. The crate being in the same room. My dog growls and barks when she wrestles because we play a little rough (i do this so i can train her to jump from rough to gentle in an instance) and shes big, shes rough without trying. She never looks at my BFs dog or physically tries to intimidate him. And he doesnt wimper or cower. Yet everytime Im playing with my dog, my boyfriend tells me to stop because its making his dog scared and shake. Now, I never actually see him shake but I could be wrong. Maybe he does. And maybe he is scared. But it just really annoys me because i don't want to plan my play wrestles around who's where and in what room. It ruins the fun. And we were taught to desensitise both dogs to everything. If my BFs dog is safe in the crate, is it not smart to get him used to the idea that my dog can play and growl and bark without being a threat to him? Or should we keep encouraging them to be afraid of eachother? 
My boyfriend and I were told to stop treating our dogs like humans wrapped in bubble wrap so I've loosened my loving grip on my dog (which sucked to do), but it seems like he hasn't stopped being over protective of his even when hes safe. 
I can recognise that his dog is the one that got hurt in the fights but he also faught in the fights. He never got attacked by my dog alone. He just didnt have as much reach as her unfortunately. 
That aside, the only way we can move forward is by teaching them to not be anxious. And i just dont think hes helping. I could be wrong though. Let me know your thoughts pleeeaaase! 

Tldr - BF is encouraging his dog to be anxious around mine and wont let me playfight with my dog. (All while his dog is safe in a crate)",25Apr2019,0
75,"I rented a car using Expedia, but Enterprise fulfilled it. I booked Expedia's collision protection, however the lady at Enterprise told me that apparently Expedia collision protection wasn't as good as Enterprise's. I thought she was just trying to screw me for more, and since I already paid on Expedia for their collision protection decided to decline Enterprise's collision protection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today- was reversing into my garage and I scraped up the rear-side panel. A few kind of deep scratches around 5"" long. Not super bad but definately noticable, and the car was otherwise pristine when I rented it. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are my 3 proposed courses of action:

1. Cost $ 250: Do nothing, return it, wait for them to notice and charge me then try to claim with Expedia and pay a 250 dollar deductible. Except I've heard expedia try to fuck you over and its difficult to get them to cough up. 
2. Cost: Potentially less than $250: Take it to any shitty touch up/body shop place ask them to do the bare minimum to get rid of the damage without doing a respray, so long as they can't tell. Then return the car to the garage and hope for the best. If it costs more than $250, then maybe its not worth it?
3. Try to repair the damage myself using materials I buy from the store. Probably won't choose this one. 

So a few things I would like to know:

1. Has anybody tried to use Expedia's collision protection insurance? 250 sucks but its better than a few thousand, which I've heard that Enterprise may try to claim it costs since you didn't use their protection. 
2. Do these car rental places employ like blue-light to check car bodies for damage, or do they just do visual checks? If they use special methods then there is no point in getting the car repaired myself. 
3. Has anybody been in a similar situation, what did you do? What was the damage?

76,"I'm  newish to reddit so not sure if this is the right subreddit for this.

So, a bit about me, I am a Christian (F, 33) and recently divorced. I am in a really good relationship, my boyfriend and I live together and have been together for a year and a half. It's the best relationship I've ever had.

Lately I've been thinking about doing like, web cam type stuff, I'd like for him to do it with me. However I'm very conflicted.

I am against porn for many reasons...contrition to the sex trafficking industry, desensitization of fantasies, addictions, ruinung relationships, my Christian beliefs, etc. But for some reason I am really turned on by the idea of being watched. I want my boyfriend and I maybe to do it on a cam site together, or make videos and post them or something. I just find it a huge turn on, but I'm having a moral dillema.

I also try to stay away from porn personally,  because I am afraid of getting addicted to it (I've come close to having a porn addiction in the past). I'm also afraid that I might get addicted to making porn and that that might affect me. For the past few things it's all I can think about, at home, at work, I fantasize about how we'd do it, coming up with different ideas, etc. I even started researching sites and how to submit videos and stuff.

I also don't know how to bring it up with my boyfriend. I am pretty sure he'd be okay with it, he's pretty open minded, I'm just very shy and not sure how to bring it up.

I'm not sure what to do...if I should go to counseling...if this is an okay thing to do...if I should talk to my bf about it.  If I should wait a bit first...etc.

She always wants to keep an open dialogue but the minute she doesn’t like what she hears she automatically makes assumptions and turns into a dictator. 

Tonight I began to tell her I began talking to someone and was going to grab dinner tomorrow night. She found out he lives 45 minutes away (in philly) and it immediately turned into jumping down my throat about how I’m not going to philly for dinner (which I never said I was going to philly), I’m an idiot, I’m a “stupid dater” and etc. I have my own vehicle in my name that I pay for. I’ve never been in any kind of trouble with legal issues or even simply needing a bail out from her or from anyone in that matter. She then goes on to attack the person I’m now talking to.

In the past I’ve flat out not told her what I’m doing, where I am, or who I’m with. This turns out just as bad.

At first he was really great and I made it clear before we started dating that I don’t like clingy guys at all and trust and honesty is very important to me. I also made it clear I’m not on my phone that often. He was very understanding about all of this too. 

However, once I started dating him of course this all changed. I caught him looking through my texts from a longgg time ago, twice. I also found out by close friends that he was asking if I did any drugs or anything sexual with my guy friends because he didn’t believe me when I said I didn’t. He told me when I didn’t answer his texts for awhile he would check my Instagram and Snapchat to see if I was on my phone. 

When I needed a ride to school one day, I asked my guy friend (btw my ex and I go to different schools) and he was obviously mad, but then convinced me he wasn’t mad. Later he told me, “I wanted you to know I was mad, but I didn’t want to talk about it,” and he started bragging because he’s so convincing. 

Then when I didn’t answer him as much during a week because I was sick, so he asked me to FaceTime and I said yeah and then he said “nvm” “just cause” “cause I’m not in the mood.” And he posted on his snap story that no body should text him and I flipped out. I told him he needed to stop acting like a child and communicate and if he doesn’t want to talk about it to just say it instead of being petty. Also during the week I was sick and didn’t answer as much he was sending pictures to my best friend with a knife to his head!!!!

After I broke up with him, he lied about everything he did and tried to justify it with things that were 100 percent not true. He tried to tell me that I just “gave up on our relationship and he just not the person that would do that.” And that I left on the “first sign of trouble.” The first time I tried to break up with him he convinced me to stay.

90," 

Two weeks ago I was walking to my car to go to work and I was stopped by a guy who lives in our apartment complex. At 11 AM on a Thursday, he was drunk and high walking his dog. He approached me and said that his wife had just left him, that he needs to go to detox/rehab, is feeling suicidal, and needs someone to take care of his dog for a few days until he can figure out what to do. At the time, he also asked if we could try and find the dog a home. We currently have a 1.5 year old Golden Retriever and his dog is incredibly sweet with people but is grumpy with other dogs. We introduced the two dogs and my wife and I decided we could take care of his dog for a few days. Another neighbor agreed to drive him to a detox clinic. He gave me the keys to his apartment so if our dogs didn't get along we could have a place to keep his dog and take her out/feed her.

The dogs have been getting along but his dog, Elsa isn't crate trained and our dog, Lyla is. Lyla won't go to sleep at night if Elsa is not crated, Elsa won't go to sleep while crated so now every night Elsa stays in her owner's apartment and I get her first thing in the morning and bring her back over. A week goes by with no word from him because he doesn't have access to his phone. He gets out of detox on Thursday but is immediately transferred to a rehab facility where he also has intermittent phone access. On Monday, I was picking up the dog from their apartment and found his wife packing some of her stuff up. I tell her we can't keep taking care of this dog because we can't leave her alone with Lyla without supervision. She's very thankful that we've taken care of the dog so far, promises that she'll find a home for the dog within a few days, and gives me her number. I read back this number three times to her and she confirms it. Later that day I try and text her/call her to keep working on a new home for this dog and it's the wrong number. I also finally talk to the husband from rehab and he gives me the wife's number (she had seemingly intentionally switched a 6 for a 9 in her phone number).

I finally text her and get nothing but 4-5 word responses and haven't gotten anything useful in response other than her basically saying ""we can't take Elsa and none of my family can either.""

The husband won't get out of rehab until at least the end of May. Apparently, they are moving out of that apartment at the beginning of May so our ability to take care of Elsa will completely go away then. We want the owners to take responsibility for Elsa but as of now, I'm not able to get any response from the wife and the husband doesn't have any kind of regular phone access.

Other details:

\- Elsa is a 9-year-old terrier mix of some kind.

\- We're in San Diego, CA (just moved from FL less than two months ago)

\-Elsa is microchipped but the chip isn't registered to anyone.

\- The husband and the wife both agree they can't continue to keep the dog and don't want it anymore but seem completely unwilling to help care for Elsa or take any action to find her a foster, or a rescue, or a shelter.

\- If we could keep Elsa and adopt her, we would but it's not possible.

\- Initially, we'd agreed to watch Elsa for a few days until the husband could figure out plans for Elsa, when we realized that he wasn't, we decided to keep Elsa until he got out of detox because we didn't want him to sober up and realize his dog was gone. Now it's been two weeks and neither of them seem to want to do anything.

Questions:

1. What resources can we use to try and find Elsa a home. She's incredibly sweet and we love her and want her to have a good home - she's just not great with other dogs which is the main reason we can't keep her.
2. What legal recourse do we have to try and make the owners take responsibility for Elsa.
3. Animal abandonment statutes seem to indicate that after 14 days, an animal has been abandoned and the owner is guilty of a crime. Is there any way to use this to get the owners to take responsibility?
4. Animal shelters or rescues around here seem to allow the surrender of your own animal or surrender of a found animal who you don't know the owner of. If worst comes to worse and we can't keep taking care of Elsa and the owners haven't gotten back to us or won't help, how would we go about surrendering \*someone else's\* dog who they've abandoned with us.

91,"So I am in college, and there is a conference at my university that 6 teammates and I are presenting our senior project at on Friday. It is an event that lasts from 8:00am - 9:00pm and we are expected to be there the whole time. 
However, there is a support group for LGBT students here at my school that I have been attending for 2 years and on Friday we have our last meeting where we say goodbye, which is something extremely important to me. 
The group meeting does not overlap with our presenting time, and I think I could leave for an hour without the director noticing, but I am not sure of what reason to give my teammates for leaving that would seem important enough to leave. I don't feel like I can tell them about the group meeting because I am not out to them.",25Apr2019,1
92,"To cut it short because it's a very long story that I might post later but I don't think I can bring myself to yet. 4 months ago, I met my very good female friends mom to pick up money for a job I did helping them out, I'm 17 and the mom is maybe 55, I got in the car to pick up the money and she did things to me, I'm no longer confident sexually and can't even stand it now and get anxiety because of it, I don't know what to do, I still hangout with this friend and I see the mom regular because of it I have no idea what to do, I haven't told anyone this.",25Apr2019,1
93,"Before you start spamming me, no I did NOT engage it, and no I'm NOT a pedophile.

My brother has a young friend [let's call him Oscar] who has always been really weird. I'm pretty sure he has Asperger's syndrome, and he likes having me around because I can draw. I dont like going with them, but my brother practically BEGS me to go with them to his house, and even after I decline, they hover around me constantly.

Now, there was a moment where Oscar asked if I knew what a handjob was. Felt uncomfortable, so I said ""no"". He then told me he knew what it was and then added he gave one to a friend of his.

Okay, that's disgusting.

This discussion is dropped for a bit before he attempts to ask me if I could give him a handjob.

Of course, I say hell no. 

I would've gone off on him, but my brother walked back into the room, and I didnt want to lose my cool around him.

I've seriously wanted to tell his mom [or his grandmother, idk what relation he has to the lady who watches after him] about this situation, but I'm afraid that she is going to turn this on me in a severely negative way.

On top of that, the idea of me being a pedophile has worked it's way into my overactive head. I have heard a few friends joke about me being one, even though I don't enjoy being around kids in that kind of way. 

I tend to have a motherly instinct and have never EVER been sexually suggestive towards a child in all my life, but they have seen my instinct as something explicit.

And I hated it, but have never said anything.

This whole thing was basically triggered by the fact that I was eluding to the fact that I like older men [early/mid 20s] to my parents this evening, but my parents took it the wrong way and started joking about me being a pedo.

It hurt a lot.

I want to say something, just to get it off my back and get some reassurance that I'm not who people joke about me being. I just dont know what to say or how to say it without my parents or anyone else overreacting.

I feel like I'm about to have a breakdown. Please, any advice is appreciated.",25Apr2019,1
94,"We have a cavoodle, he is 5 and a half in human years and he is overweight. I'm the only one that walks him, and with my busy life I can only get to walk him a couple of times a week. When I do, the walks are long though. If everybody else chipped in, it could be more. 
You don't need a vet tell you, you can see it just by looking at him, he is obese. He struggles to walk after only 20 minutes of our walks. I even had a conversation with someone while walking and they said he was very fat.
I know how he can lose weight, but I wish my parents could see it. It makes me so angry. I was obese and unhealthy when I was younger, but I'm very fit now that I can have more control over my health and what I can eat. Every time I bring it up to them, they say he's not fat.

97,"I live in a decently large American middle-class family (8 living in a four bedroom home) and I’m the only one who seems to try and live a consciously sustainable lifestyle. I’m only going to be living at home for another year, but my parents have to still sustain themselves and my kid siblings, the youngest being in preschool. We feed a lot of people, so we have to shop twice a week, and we produce at least six trash bags a week. We have three cars and my parents sleep with ACs on. My little brothers are hardcore carnivores while my mother is vegetarian and I’ve limited myself to poultry and seafood only. My mom doesn’t make improvements because she thinks it’s difficult and expensive, my brother is an angsty 14 yo who could give less of a shit about the planet, and my dad is a conservative far-right republican (the rest of my family is democratic) who doesn’t believe the US emits any greenhouse gases. The only changes I’ve managed to make for my family is buying reusable and biodegradable straws, swapping plastic bags for reusable shopping bags, thrifting clothes, and just giving a new perspective to my family on the climate change issue. I myself am working towards becoming zero-waste, but it’s taking a bit of adjustment. Are there any tips for my personal lifestyle changes or in helping push my family out of their throw-away habits? Also, I live in a desolate town nearly an hour away from the nearest Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods (which of course aren’t the ideal, but the closest thing we have out here).

Later, other one (also white) called me n**** after i had accidentally pushed wrong button in Kahoot! And it shocked me. The mexican friend was like wtf. I was speechless because it was only second time that someone ever uttered an n word directed at me. Even worse, it was someone white. How to handle this next time it happens?

99,"This has been on my mind a lot lately and I really don't know what to make of it anymore. This happened a while ago when I was around 8ish years old. I went to my female doctor with my mom and 6 year old sister for a regular check up. As i was laying down on the table the doctor just lifted up my shirt without asking and started feeling my breasts. My mom stood by in the corner and told my sister not to watch. I was horrified and on the verge of tears. After a while I started crying and said no and stop multiple times but she did not. When she was finished she didn't even look at me and casually told my mom that my breasts were developing completely normally. When we got home I sobbed hysterically and told my mom I never wanted to see that doctor again. She agreed and I never went back.

A few weeks ago this was brought back to mind and I'm having trouble discerning whether or not this was sexual abuse. I mean, she was my doctor and doctors are supposed to do regular check ups. Yet at the same time I didn't want her to touch me but she went ahead anyways. I don't think she was trying to be malicious but I can't help feeling like my privacy was invaded. She could have told me what she was going to do or asked me before doing it. With all these thoughts I still keep coming back to the conclusion that it was normal because she was my doctor. I am too afraid to ask anyone if they've had a similar experience because if it isn't normal then I would feel so completely disgusting. I just don't know what to do anymore. Has this happened to anyone? Was this abuse? Should I talk to anybody about it? I think I turned out fine I don't understand why this has been bugging me so much lately.",25Apr2019,0
100,"Last October I decided to do something that I never thought I'd do. I asked my crush out on a date. Now, mind you, I am a very shy person and lack any kind of confidence in myself, so imagine my surprise when he said yes.  He was my first boyfriend ever... I loved him. He was my reason for waking up in the morning, for not giving in to the thoughts I have nearly every day. He made me actually WANT to go to school. I can't remember a time I've ever been happier. 

Nearly the whole school knew about us. My friends would tell me we were the cutest couple in the class, and teachers were always keeping an eye on us (probably because we skipped a lot). We only went on a few real dates, usually just to the bay... one of my best memories is sitting on the rocks, watching the sunset among the pastel purple clouds as waves crashed by our side. We had talked about what we would do after high school... And he really confided to me. He trusted me enough to tell me that he was scared- I think we all are when it comes to this part of life. My profile picture is actually one of the pictures he took that day, I could tell he adored me... or I thought he did at least. 

Months go by. It's now February. I can tell things are getting a bit tense. He hadn't been acting like his usual self and I knew he had a lot going on at home- but he never wanted to talk about it. It's been a couple of months since we went on our last date so I come up with a plan for Valentine's day. I've always wanted to spend Valentines Day with someone that I loved... And I was determined to make this one as special as possible. The date gets closer, and closer, and we begin to talk about maybe ""doing something"" in the backseat of his car after the movie. He never had a girlfriend before me, and I've never had a boyfriend before him- so we both had no idea what we were really doing. 

It's now the second week of February. Things are too much. He's always upset, I failed my driver's test, I have no one to talk to, My mother is still absent-minded and in no shape to deal with the outside world,  and the thoughts come rolling back. I couldn't help myself. 

I don't remember what exactly tipped me over... but I do remember downing an entire bottle of 600ml tabs of Gabapentin, and a handful of Trazodone. I felt so empty... I didn't want to be here anymore. I thought to myself- If I survive this, then maybe there is a reason for all this. If not, then that's that. About fifteen minutes went by until I called him. I began to regret what I had done... I was scared. 

I wanted to tell him what I had done. I needed to tell him what I did. But he was busy playing video games. I don't know why, but I suddenly had the urge to finish the bottle of Trazodone while on facetime- so maybe he could see me. But he only caught a glance of the bottle and didn't make a big deal of it. and the call shortly ended. 

So there I lied. Time went by and I hadn't noticed until my mother came into my room a few hours later, unable to wake me up. Never in my life had my bed felt so comfortable. The rest of that night is hazy- but what I do remember is calling him again in the middle of the night as I wait in the waiting room of Mercy hospital, and telling him ""Hey, I'm in the hospital right now..."" - ""Why, what happened?"" - ""Overdose."" - ""Ari..."" That's it. That's all he said. ""Ari."" Then again, what more was I expecting? 

I won't go into detail about what else happened that day- it's a story for another time. But the result- I wasn't allowed to have my phone that night- and in the morning when I got it back- not even so much as a text to see if I was even alive the next morning... or afternoon... or night. He never texted me, never called, or never replied until the next day at school. I had to hunt him down to find him, and when I did- it was as if he didn't even know, or remember that night. 

Days go by. I'm too stubborn to think, so I'm still trying my damnedest to make sure everything is okay. I didn't know what I would do if I lost him, and I began to feel like it was coming to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Valentine's day. I stroll into school with a bag in one hand and gift in the other. I figured it'd be cute to fill a gift bag with little trinkets with phrases taped to them like ""You spark my heart"" on a box of sparklers, etc. We had first block together, so I settle myself in our usual seat. School starts, he's not here. fifteen, thirty, almost an hour goes by until he arrives. He sits down and bearly talks to me, so I hand him the gift. He doesn't even look in the bag. Okay. class ends and he leaves me with confusion and a rejected gift. 

I feel like caving in and hiding forever. I know what is to come, but I kept telling myself that would never happen, that it couldn't. 

It's the last block, he's supposed to be here... but instead, I get a text. ""Meet me in the hallway after school, we need to talk."" Fuck. I begin to cry in class. I know what's happening. I can't focus. 

Fast forward- I see him down the hall, I feel like I'm going to throw up. It's quiet at first, he's on the verge of shedding tears. Why is he crying? He's choosing to do this? When the words came out of his mouth I almost didn't believe him, I couldn't... I'm about to lose everything and all I could do was sit in the corner and tell him he should go home. And he does. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone on too long about this... there's so much more to this than I've said... But I'll get to my point. It's April. I teeter totter from angry to sad. What do I do? How do I get past this?",25Apr2019,1
101,"        So recently me and my friend [15f] were in the high school musical together. she and I became very close, and we are now great friends. The thing with this friend is that she was talking to a lot of guys on Snapchat, so I assumed she was content with that. She had been known to be flirty with guy friends, and had a thing going on with a guy at our school. Nothing serious, but they had done some stuff and were flirty. But I told her about this boy I liked about a month ago. [we’ll call him Liam] I didn’t know Liam well but I was infatuated with him. That’s really what i think it came down to, just infatuation. we had barely talked. But she and him were flirty so I began to wonder if he might like her. During the second day of the musical, during intermission, she told me that she liked Liam a lot and wanted to make a move on him. I didn’t know what to say, [what the hell do you say in that situation? “No, i forbid you.” And am i supposed to say yes? That’s the guy I like, wtf?] so I just told her to go ahead because she probably had a better chance with him and they seemed to be flirty with each other. She is also a lot prettier than I am and knows how to actually flirt. 
       I went back inside and tried to cool off. She stayed out to talk to him. But then I wanted to tell my other friends what she said. So I did. At this point I was pissed off at her and just wanted everyone to know that she was going to make a move on MY crush. I ended up ignoring her for most of the show, and she cried outside with my other friend comforting her. Eventually, that friend told one of Liam’s friends about what was happening. Liam’s friend then TOLD LIAM THAT WE BOTH LIKED HIM. Liam took my friend outside after that. They talked for a while, and I saw them both walk back in. He had his arm wrapped around her, you can imagine the conversation that went down. I was crying and really upset. Not only because of him but because of my friend flirting with him and not talking to me. (I’m really fed up with friends ditching me for guys a lot of the time) Even though I just had a small infatuation with him, it still hurt to see them flirting and being touchy with each other. 
         After that, the cast party happened that night. They talked to each other briefly. At this point, Liam has not said a word to me. I just assume he doesn’t like me at all, but I already sorta knew that. My friend comes back and tells me that Liam said he doesn’t like her. This was beyond confusing because they had talked the whole night and he seemed to like her. My friend and I are tense, but at this point I had told her to just go for it and I’ll move on like i usually do. The night goes on fairly normal. Anyways, a week or so passes and me, her, and now it’s the day that I’m writing this. Me, my friend, and 2 other friends from the musical are hanging out. My friend brings up Liam. She said that he now likes her and wants to get to know her better. It still really hurt to see that they were both happy with each other and I was alone. Now Liam wouldn’t even look at me. We used to kinda joke around and stuff, but now he didn’t even make eye contact with me or laugh at things I would say like he used to. I was on my friends phone, posting something on her Snapchat. She got a snap from a girl named Terra. I scrolled up a bit and my friend had logs of chats with this girl talking about Liam. She said they had deep conversations with each other and they were really connecting, and they both liked each other. I’m suddenly realizing that I liked this guy more than just infatuation. I had a big crush on him. And now that potential is shattered. I try to convince myself that I can do better, but I hate seeing them together and hearing her talk about him or to him. It breaks me inside. 
I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve always been the single friend. I’m only 15 and i know I’ve got time but I feel so lonely in life. No one has ever shown interest in me from what I know of. I feel so alone. I just need to know what to do. I like my friend and I’m still kinda liking this guy. She keeps asking me if I’m fine with it and im not but I don’t want to be the one thing in their way of liking each other. 
        What do I do? I honestly know that if I was in her situation I would give up this guy if she liked him to. I value friends so much more than her, and i feel like she’s selling me out for him. {I know this is very much just teenage drama, but I don’t know how to handle this situation anymore} :(

TLDR; my friend and my crush like each other, I’m very upset and lonely as hell. What should I do in this situation? I still like him and im friends with her.",25Apr2019,1
102," Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always wanted to join the military and then become a cop. I still do but when i was 17 i partied a little to hard and ended up taking the same drug, two different occasions. The reason is peer pressure, i wanted to fit into this group so i thought id be cool. I honestly dont even remember doing it, just know that i did.

My question is, what do i do about becoming a cop/ joining the military? Some jobs require a clearance too. I dont want to lie, but also need to ""prove"" my self as a good person. Bad people lie all the time to join, but im not a bad person.  I actually have done several youth police academy type things and JROTC. That will help show that im not a bad dude. Are there similar jobs to law enforcement that i could get now, to show even further that i made a mistake? Should i still try to join the military?

103,"Hi there, 
On mobile so sorry for formatting. 
So, I am a 22F who has been diagnosed with a heart condition. I underwent surgery for it back in February. I still had to start medicine because unfortunately there was nothing more they could do in that time period. The medicine started off fine but eventually my body got too used to it and the last week for me was hell. I did just about all I could to not be on bed rest but as soon as I got up and even went to the kitchen the pumping off my heart made me feel like I was running a marathon and would make me nap for over two hours at a time. Following this and being in constant contact with my doctor we decided to switch to another medication instead of going towards the pacemaker since I am so young that is supposed to be our last effort. 

This brings me to my question. It was brought to my attention that this medicine is because of heart failure therefore my heart is getting even weaker than we hoped. My heart has stopped me from working at times, going to my classes, going out with friends, it brought me back in contact with my father and that is a lot on its own. It’s just hitting me more and more and it’s really just got me down in the dumps. 

So the advice I need is: what can I do when I’m at home to make my time in bed less boring (I’m tired of tv) , what can I do to appreciate life more when it sucks and starts making me feel kicked when I’m down, and what if anything would you recommend for some cool like podcasts to listen to for when I just feel like coloring and zoning out?

Thanks in advance!",25Apr2019,2

Ofcourse i want to be her friend and im fine with that because we have been friends forever and nothing is awkward between us or off but i get sad more frequently and she is all that is on my mind and idk if i should tell her this or let it go and live my life knowing we might never be together or cut off the friendship.

111,"A little bit of backstory:

So my best friend, let's call her S, and I have been basically inseparable since first grade when we met. At the beginning of our Junior year in high school (this year) I met another really close friend who we can call J. Shortly before summer ended my first long term relationship ended and I was really broken up about it and J really helped me through this time. Well almost 6 months ago, J and S, who were now my two best friends, started dating. It was fine at first, they were an awkward new couple but I was really worried that J would be a really bad influence on S. During this time my friend who can be called K, who is also a close friend of S, and I started getting closer and became really good friends. All the while K and I were both realizing that my fear was becoming a reality as S started ditching class commonly and becoming a person who was different than the S I'd always known. A bunch of stuff happened that pushed me away from her but the final straw for me was when S told me that she had lost her virginity to J, which is not a big deal I'm really open about sex and tried my hardest to make sure she was safe, unlike my first few times. It wasn't the fact that she had lost her virginity, it was the fact that they decided to not use the condoms I gave them, and decided that pulling out was overrated. Luckily she wasn't pregnant but I realized she just wasn't a person I wanted to be friends with. Earlier today K and I were talking about how we would both break it to S separately that we didn't know if we wanted to be friends anymore. Well I just got a call from S that consisted of her bawling her eyes out and trying to tell me that K had told her that she didn't want to be friends anymore. Now I don't know what to do and I don't know if I should be honest and stop being friends with her or just suck it up and live with it because she's had a bunch of problems with self harm and attempts to kill herself.

115,"So this year we have to make a senior project to graduate on. But I started late because I can't think of any topic at all, once I have the topic there's only one advisor proff left so I approached him and he states that my topic proposal is not complete enough.  
So I went and think about it again and got another idea and e-mailed him about it which he never answered.  
At this point I thought that I need to work on something and show it to him, but I never did.  
Fast forward and we are nearing the deadline and the project I'm working on by myself is only 60% finished.  
At this point my guilt got ahold of me because we have a Project progression report class that we have to submit our work and advisor meetings info, which I wrote his name as my advisor but we have never met since the email because I was too afraid to get scold again on my new topic.  
I met with him again just before the initial deadline out of guilt with no plans.  
He admonished me for not having responsibility, not respecting him, not even having completed the project which he don't even have an idea about since he received no contacts at all.  
Being the dummy that I am I stayed quiet, speechless out of panic and fear.  
He says he does not approve my behavior at all and doesn't even have anything to grade me on my project. Which is true and I deserved that.  
  
Then I asked the Proff in charge of the project class what can I do about this?

John = friend trying to get with my sister
sister = obvious
Maria = second friend, mutual with me and John.

This is a long one, hold on tight.

I've known John since 9th grade. We are in the same grade (now 11th). My sister is in 9th grade right now, two years younger than me. Maria has known John since sixth grade, they are inseparable best friends. They tell eachother everything, which is the only reason I know about this. Maria trusts me almost as much as she trusts John. She told me she has a secret to tell me and not a single living soul can know.

I should've not asked.

""Your sister and John like each other and they've been talking for the past two months""

John isn't really a good looking guy, partly because of extreme acne. His gpa is hovering below 2 and he does not care about school and does not want to go to college. He's kind but sorta dumb.

My sister is smart, gpa above 4, wants to go to a top notch college, and has common sense.

They've been FaceTiming for hours on end for the past two months and have been secret for the most part. Now that i know, it's painfully obvious the cover-ups are fake, but I admit it's pretty slick the way they do it.

John came over to our house today, hung out for a bit. We had somewhere to go later so I needed to shower. I didn't want to leave them alone in the same room together.

I think it'll be helpful to point out John is a virgin and so is my sister.

This is my sister's first relationship and John's 3rd or 4th. He wants to get rid of his virginity. You can see where this is going.

She told my parents she's gonna go tutor her friend after school tomorrow (which she regularly does) but is going to John's house (it's a 5 min walk from ours). John told this to Maria, and she told it to me. I am in a sticky situation. John's single mom is also not gonna be home.

John does not like condoms (even tho he's a virgin)

John will get my sister pregnant and I have to deal with the guilt of having this knowledge and not acting on the situation.

This is a man vs self and man vs man type of conflict. If you guys have ANY ideas please let me know, no matter how ridiculous. Maria and I have already agreed to work together to stop this from happening at all.

Desperate",25Apr2019,1
121,"So long story short been with this guy for over 3 years now we planned to get married. We have a child together but I am doing all the working, paying, taking care of child, travelling on my own since baby was 2 months old, been working my ass of so we have money to spend when we see him as he hasn’t worked much and all money he makes he keeps. Nice right! 
So we have been fighting a lot reasons; we don’t see each for months but when we do he makes his friends and phone priority over making time for me and child if I ask him to go places with us he says I seek too much attention. 
He doesn’t pay much attention to a child and when he does he sure has his phone in his hand. 
My family I kept quiet on many ongoing issues I have where his one is involved in every aspects since he was a child. If I try to speak with him to solve issue his says all I do is blah blah blah but I guess he has issues where in the past was done to him with whatever he did in life and was never supported. 
When he speak he speaks with a lot of anger and always to hurt me and be little me. I have caught him saying to his family that I am crazy but that’s something they do to each on the regular basis is very normal. 
His family controlled his life but since I came to picture is very hard for them to that so they tell all the nasty things about him to fight. And some how I always do end up fighting. Oops 
If he fights with family is my fault even tho I am not even with him in the same country.

124,"tl;dr at the bottom. 

Hey Reddit. This is something that has been bothering me for months now and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Let’s call my friend J. J and I have been friends for about three and a half years, maybe four. I met him in high school and we were pretty close. He’s like a brother to me and he’s said I’m like a sister to him. So we’re in no way romantic at all. 

I moved to another country, but we still stay in touch. So, J is going through a rough patch in his life. He doesn’t live in the best place, is struggling with friends, and isn’t feeling very great. I know what that’s like and I’ve been there to let him know i’ll support him through his struggles.

Lately though, for the past few months some of the things he is posting or saying has been really bothering me. He goes on these really, really long rants on Instagram about his mental health, bashes other people, posts stuff he *purposely* thinks his followers will get riled up over. He is also **incredibly** obsessed with having a relationship. It’s to the point where it’s unhealthy. He has begun posting some pretty controversial topics, some on the line of sexist. (By no means am I feminist, but some of them sting a little sometimes.) 

Just imagine his Instagram as a mix of 
r/niceguys and r/im14andthisisdeep on steroids. 

I really do want to help him. I don’t want him to be feeling this way at all, but it’s taking such a toll on our friendship. I find myself wanting to open his texts less and less and I feel guilty about it. I’ve tried openly talking to him about the situation on separate occasions, but any positive results of him turning himself around don’t last very long. 

I feel like an ass posting this, and I don’t want to lose him. This is just honestly so draining to our friendship though. 

Thanks for any advice, it’s really appreciated it. 

Also he’s genuinely a good guy. Really smart, funny, kind and really really creative.

Friend is struggling with mental health, posting shitty stuff online, saying shitty things when we text. I want to support him, but it’s incredibly draining and taking a toll on our friendship.",25Apr2019,1
125,"So 1 year ago, I went on a school camp to austria (I'm 17 f and I live in holland). Because I wasn't sure we had wifi there, my dad bought me a new phone subscription so I could get extra MB's if I needed to. Kpn actually put it on my dad's name so if I bought MB's my dad would pay for it. The next months I actually bought more MB's so I could use it for myself but I didn't told my dad because I thought he was unaware of it untill last week. I basically bought around €10 of MB's per month without telling him because I thought he didn't noticed but he did. He came home furious because kpn told him he had been buying extra MB's but ofc he didn't. I just told him that it was really strange. My dad is a very intelligent man but also 62 so he doesn't know much about phones and stuff. Some days later he actually told me that kpn showed him a paper where it said that I bought the MB's. I just reacted really surprised even though I knew exactly what it was. He had been calling customer service and going back and forth to kpn trying to fix this problem because he BELIEVES me. Today he told me that the man from kpn said that I had been buying extra MB's and after that I probably deleted the messages history. That was exactly what I did but i still denied it. He told me this: ""I wanna know now, did you buy the extra MB's? If you lie to me right know I will kick you out of the house, cause I will get to the BOTTOM of this and find out exactly what happened."" My dad is someone who only speaks the truth. I got really stressed so I just told him I didn't know about anything and he believes me. I said that my 4g was on and maybe I clicked on something by accident but the truth is that I bought the MB's per sms. I know I'm the bad person in this story and I really wanna tell my dad it's my problem but how? Like I wanted to tell him I'll pay for them anyway but then I'm basically saying that I know I used the wifi. That I'm actually aware of the situation. I'm so so so scared he'll kick me out because I really can't go anywhere else. Does anyone have an idea of what I can tell my dad? Like for example: a lie but still the truth? Maybe that I bought them by accident? But again it has been going on for a year and he has the papers of when I bought it and stuff. And how do you accidentally buy something?

130,"I really like creativity. I love looking at a bunch of different types of media that do *something different*, you know? For example, I LOVE Persona 5’s art style. I love a bunch of older music from around the 60’s that have a certain pinch to it. I love the concept of certain horror movies like The Shining and Alien because they strived to do something unusual with horror to evoke an unique sense of fear and adrenaline.

I just love that type of art so much that I want to make something like that. 

The thing is, there’s nothing that seems like could work well for me. It feels like I’ve tried everything possible to express myself creatively, but nothing sticks. I don’t have the patience for drawing. I can’t stick to learning any instrument other than drums, which isn’t really useful outside of an entire band. Video editing doesn’t do it for me.

He was surrounded by friends, but I managed well, since my friend said after that I appeared very confident. 

I patted him quickly on the shoulder 3 times quickly, with a smile and said bye, which was so not like me. 

I asked for his insta and he followed me back within minutes and liked 1 of my photos from more than a year ago. 

Turns out he's kind of insta-famous because he posts photos of his body, diet, and working out.

Also, it seems like a bunch of girls are into him, and there's 1 girl in particular I am aware of now who has a crush on him, but it says on his profile that he's single.

These past few months, I’ve bought new watches for myself and my dad wanted his back. He asked me to replace the batteries in his watch so we can start wearing it. Well I just didn’t say anything and hope he’d forget, but over time he would start asking more and more frequently if I’d done it yet.

This past month he’s been asking every few days and gets so angry when I say I haven’t done it. He says he does everything I ask him to do but I can’t do one little thing that he’s asking. For the past month he’s barely looked at me and he just gets angry every time he talks to me and says I’m so disrespectful.

E hates everything about that school and we are thinking of everything and trying practically anything so E can transfer to my school. So we can all be finally OKAY, goddammit..... We’ve sketched out a scheme, an act she’s going to perform on her mom when she gets home from school to see just how far her mom would go to keep her in this CRAPPY ASS school.

Fast forward to 11yrs old, we started having problems as far as her not wanting to come with me on weekends because of friends, which I understood but it was getting to be every weekend. I would bring this up to her mother but that would never work (her mother is not the compromising type). Slowly but surely she grew apart from me and I  tried very hard to stay in her life but countless calls and texts went unanswered and my relationship with her mother was never good as she always loved to have power over me and using my daughter to do it.

For the first half of college I was pretty immature and just focused on partying and boys, and this is what my friend group and I would talk about. As I grew up, I grew out of that phase and really started becoming a less angsty-teenage-y person. Now I like to make jokes about politics, history, literature, art, etc. things of that nature. I'm the kind of person who loves trivial pursuit. I come from a very affluent neighborhood and my high school was in the top 5 in a state that is known for having very good education. I don't expect everyone to be well versed in every subject but I get bored with people who only get jokes that reference pop culture. The more I talk with my best friend the more I realize that she's just uneducated. That doesn't mean she's dumb at all though, she's averagely intelligent (in my opinion - of course there are many different types of intelligence) but just lacks knowledge about the majority of subjects.

Examples of things that I made jokes about that she didn't understand: Dysentery, Brigham Young and Joseph Smith, The Crucible, Libertarians, and the list goes on. I thought these were things that most people knew. I've also found that I don't really respect her opinion on things as much because she mostly doesn't know what she's talking about.

 I just don't want to always have to talk about other people, makeup, or pop culture. Am I being too elitist? Am I just unaware and think things are more common knowledge than they actually are?

For example, the other day a mutual friend said she was considering moving in with him after graduation and that made me really sad.

Also a side note, her boyfriend isn’t a very good person (don’t want to get too much into this) so it’s also hard to convince myself that I should want her to be happy and he makes her happy, so therefore I should be happy for her. they have somewhat of an abusive relationship (I’m not the only one who thinks this, mutual friends do to and they’ve been trying to get her to listen but she doesn’t).",25Apr2019,3

157,"Hey guys (f/20) ! So, my mind has been super jumbled these days on deciding if I should reject a job offer I already said yes to. It's to work and help fundraise for charities. I'm supposed to start on Monday next week (today is Thursday). I'm having trouble deciding because I'm afraid that getting a full time job (that works 1-9pm) is going to affect my family.
A back story first: I am the eldest filipina in my household. This means that I do most of the help around the house including laundry, clean up, helping my siblings (2 younger ones) with homework, and cooking them breakfast and lunch. 
My parents are also very strict and they finally let me get a job this year because I've proven myself over the years.
I'm afraid that if I get a full time job, all my responsibilities will shift over to my little sister who is 13 years old. I've always taken on the responsibilities because I didn't want her to go through what I went through and instead live a fun life. 
I'm also afraid that my mom, who is the only other person who helps clean the house, will be more stressed without me.
However, I really enjoyed the job interview. I really vibed with the staff and they represent charities that I really stand by. I also could see myself loving this job because it's going towards something I deeply care about (helping charities). 
They offered me the job right away and I was so excited that I didn't think far enough that they would actually hire me (this was my first interview ever and I passed the second round interview as well). They even sent me a message saying that they saw great potential in me and asked me what kind of tea I'd like for when I come to work on Monday because they're excited. The after thought is coming to bite me now though because I suck at making decisions by myself.
My boyfriend also gave me encouragement that I've never gotten before. He told me not to think about disappointing anybody and instead think of what I really want for myself. I do really want this opportunity if I didn't have my family to take care of. Then, he told me that they need to learn how to do without me because I'm not going to live there forever. It's a good point but I still feel really selfish.
So now my mind is ALL OVER THE PLACE. Either way, I will disappoint somebody which SUCKS. Words of advice from my wisdom filled senpais? Thanks guys.

Well fast forward now and I got rejected from that certain college, whereas he was accepted as a transfer. From my room, I could hear my mother talking to him about distancing himself from the friends who aren't happy for his college decision and aren't supportive of him, as it is a college with low admit rate and his friends applied with him.

163,"My mom has been grilling me about how I'm starving our new cat (it's our first cat and we just got her about 1.5 weeks ago) and that I'm being cruel because I refuse to give her more food/feed her extra outside of her meal times when she asks for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, because she's mentioning it so often I'm getting kind of worried.

&amp;#x200B;

Our cat is 2 years and 7 months old and 8.15 pounds (if this matters). The vet says she's a healthy weight and recommended I feed her 200kcal every day. So using this, I calculated out her meal portions. We feed her three times a day (roughly around 8am, 5pm, and 10pm), 1/4 can wet food + 1/9 cup dry food for every meal. Wet food is \~100kcal/can and dry food is \~400kcal/cup. If my math is wrong, then someone please tell me... We don't measure out the food super precisely, but it should equal around this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wondering if I'm doing the right thing since apparently our cat still seems hungry and wants more food? Or does anyone have any advice about how to deal with this? I hear that it's bad to just feed your cat  whenever they ask because it's easy to overfeed and they can get fat, but it's very difficult when it feels like that if she's not sleeping then she wants food... is it okay to just ignore her like this?",25Apr2019,3

Gonna go over a few points and please tell me how I can support her/stop her/help her. 

-She’s very disrespectful towards herself. Calls herself ugly, fat, doesn’t deserve me, etc. 

-She gets very sad sometimes and she tends to cut herself. This is especially alarming towards me because she tells me she will stop but still does it due to stress. 

-Her family tends to get into a lot of arguments. This stresses her out and makes her cut herself. 

-She was sexually assaulted twice. 

-She has social anxiety and is very shy around me and others

-One of the people who sexually assaulted her gf made rumours which essentially made her lose a majority of her friends 

-Sometimes she tends to be suicidal. Today I talked her out of that thought and calmed her down.

Things got a little steamy one night with him and I ended up sending lewds. 
That same night, a different friend and I were talking and I brought up what happened. She helped me realise that he was using me and I confronted him about it. 
At first he apologised and said he didn’t mean to come off that way, but later he finally admitted that he was using me for lewds even if it wasn’t his intention. 

(Backing up a bit) the only reason I even sent them in the first place is because I wanted him to have a reason to have some kind of attraction to me. I was desperate and lonely one night, and like any teenager, I was dumb and willing to do whatever.

175,"Hello Reddit,

Sorry in advance for the long post. I (23M) am looking for advice on how I can help my sister (16F) with her upcoming prom. 

My sister has had it rough compared to most high school students. In October of 2017 she suffered a concussion, and she has been dealing with nearly continuous headaches since. These headaches have caused her to miss a lot of school, which has hindered her social life and caused her to miss out on a lot of experiences that most high school students would take for granted (for example seeing your friends everyday). Missing so much school has reduced her interactions with others, and as a result she only has a few close friends.

She is an exceptionally bright individual, and despite the headaches she has maintained good grades and a few weeks ago she absolutely killed her ACT! She’s been dealing with a lot, but I’m proud of the way she’s persevered. A few weeks ago, however, things took a turn for the worst. First, she got rejected from NHS for lack of attendance even though she has some of the most impressive credentials I’ve seen. Second, she got benched on her softball team due to missing practices due to headaches. I understand if you don’t practice you don’t play, but being benched still isn’t easy for a 16 year old female.

Her woes really cultivated this past week. It is her junior year, so she gets to go to prom for the first time. Missing so much school, she doesn’t talk to a lot of boys, and she never really expected a boy to ask her to prom. So, a few months ago her and a friend made a plan to go together. She bought the dress, and has been so excited about it for the past 2 months. I was honestly thrilled to see her that happy about something because I haven’t seen her like this in a long time. 

She’s recently been talking to a boy at school, and a little more than a week ago he asked her to go with him as friends (the prom is this Saturday). She was excited, but politely said that she couldn’t because she had already agreed to go with a friend and she couldn’t ditch her that close to the prom. She also invited him to go to the prom with her and her friend as a group of 3. She then missed a couple days of school with headaches, and she returned to find out that the boy she was taking to was now going to prom with her “friend,” and both of them were ditching her. Needless to say she was devastated. 

I love my little sister, and to see what she has been going through has been a struggle for me. She’s had a lot of negatives thrown her way, but for the most part she has powered through. Now to see this happen so close to the prom it breaks my heart. She now has to no pre prom plans or a partner for the grand march, and I’m not sure she will even go to the prom at all.

My question is, does anybody have any advice on anything I could do to either cheer her up or make this an awesome experience for her? I’d obviously take her out to dinner myself or do something similar, but I’m sure a high school student would think that’s uncool. My sister means the world to me, and for one night I just want her to forget about her troubles and give her an experience she deserves. Any thoughts on how I could do this?",25Apr2019,2

186,"About 12 years ago my parents divorced. Since then neither has done great financially, mentally, or physically. My dad is surviving but my mom went through a few bad relationships, some abusive, and has hit really hard times. I feel like things are reaching a breaking point and I do not know what else to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated. This is a first for me and hard to do so I apologize if I come off cold or break any rules.

Since my mom moved in on her own after the divorce she has been through multiple relationships, failed marriages, etc. I think her mental health has declined to the point she is out of touch with reality (not a professional opinion just my own). She seems to think every person is out to get her. She also has a very serious alcohol abuse problem. On more then one occasion I had to go peel her off the floor and take her to the hospital due to her drinking problem. She went to rehab once but “can’t stand to be in that place with those scummy people”. To the point where she has driven away most of her family (siblings etc.) and my siblings. I’m just about the last one left who is patient enough to put up with her bullshit besides my elderly grandmother. Most other people have completely blocked her out of their lives. I used to go see her all the time but now she won’t even let me see her. It has been months. The problem is she won’t let me help her. I have tried on numerous occasions to get her to seek professional help but she just won’t listen to anybody and I can’t force her to go. Sometimes she is okay but other times she just goes off the deep end.

She has a background in nursing but has been let go from multiple jobs. She hasn’t worked in over a year. The plan was for my grand-mom to move in with her and help her pay her mortgage/take care of the bills and my mom to take care of her. This was going smoothly until recently. She blew everything up unexpectedly and I came to find out her home is up for foreclosure auction and she filed for bankruptcy. Foreclosure was postponed until late June. My grandma already gave notice to her independent care facility that she is moving out and has to be out in the next two months. She is able to stay with my uncle if necessary I hope. My mom’s plan is to go into “travel nursing” and go on the road and bring her dog and stay in hotels. I just don’t see this working out.

I wish I could help out financially but I’m barely getting by myself. I put myself through college and got a decent job but with the loan payments and my own bills I can barely scrape by. My mom has done a lot to hurt me over the years and has caused me a lot of pain but I just can’t bring myself to give up on her. As much as she has done me wrong and caused all these problems herself I could never live with myself if I turned my back on her like everyone else. I just don’t know what else to do. I live with 4 roommates so at the time her moving in with me would be unacceptable and unfair to them.

I am seeking advice in general for dealing with difficult parents, dealing with mental illness and alcoholism, and navigating bankruptcy/foreclosure options for her.

The promise is, once the project we are working on gets shipped, we will get royalties from it forever (which sounds like a pretty good deal and I hear royalties are in the 5 digit range yearly).

However, my first year after working here, I did not get a raise. Some coworkers did, including a coworker who i didn't feel was really any different from me (worse, IMO) who got hired at the same time.

I've heard no follow up on that, and I'm wondering how I should approach this with my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what response I am looking for but people tell me there is a place in heaven for me. Fuck heaven, I believe when I die then thats it. I have my fun here and there but when I do I am swarmed with guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I abandon my family? My grandfather had high expectations for me. I don't want to me some puppet cunt. I just want to do me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is I have become super cynical and morbid but I love life. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do ?",25Apr2019,1
192,"TLDR at bottom. 

I know it’s not a big deal to some people, but I do not want pictures of my son circulating in some quite specific circles. Bottom line, I don’t want her 1000+ friends, some of which I know are kid touchers, seeing my son from her Facebook, especially since I know 7 of them and that’s because they’re literally my other family members. Every single one of my family members has respected this wish (sharing amongst family was okay as long as it was private) except for her. She wasn’t even on my page to begin with (wasn’t friended/tagged/shared to/etc) she just took it upon herself to find my boyfriend’s and my page and downloaded the picture herself after our announcement. My boyfriend, myself, and another have already reported the picture under “child safety” but I get the feeling they won’t remove it. 

Both of us had commented on the picture asking her to remove it, in response she deleted all comments (besides all the congratulations towards her) and blocked us both.

I guess I’m just looking for advice on either how to get it removed, and if that’s just 110% impossible, how to make sure she never gets another picture of him. She was estranged for a very inappropriate-with-children reason and I refused to get in contact with her for almost 3 years except for today during the altercation. I know she wants to keep the picture up as a way to get attention, as pitiful as that is. 


TLDR; estranged grandma posted a picture of my son without permission and blocked both parents after being asked to remove it. Is there a way to get it removed or to make sure she STAYS estranged?",25Apr2019,2
193,"As the title says a guy friend of mine told me “let’s make this a night to remember” when I was in a shower in nothing but my underwear ( I threw up all over the place) I assume he came in by telling people he would help me out but he ended up offering me sex.



I don’t know if this is important at all but it’s a mother thing that’s been bothering me. My best friend sent me a picture of his butt as a joke (dumb I know) and the guy friend who offered sex to me begged my best friend for the picture ( it was their first time talking and everything) he even went as far by giving him his Snapchat just for the one picture, and he had the audacity to screenshot it without my best friend knowing


I don’t know if I’m over reacting about this whole thing but I’ve been feeling weird about it, it’s been playing on loop on my mind and I don’t know if I should tell my mom or confront him about it. What messes me about the whole situation is that he knew how fucked up I was I could barely get words out and he knew fully what he was doing.",25Apr2019,2
194,"hi all.
i am a very occasional pot user. i usually try to find what ppl who smoke regularly call ditchweed.
last saturday we were having a fire and the music was good and i hit my bf's vape. he has variously told me since then that it had cbd or thc in it.
i got 'high' but then i started having seizures, regular intervals, i don't know how long each one was lasting but the entire seizing episode was about 1.5 hours. inability to talk without stuttering, sometimes completely unable to say more than wha or wa repeatedly. legs twitching up and down if seated, flailing kicking at the air if laying down.
my emotions were roller coastering, but in a predictable way. i was able to discern, despite having little to no control over my body, that my thoughts were lucid and clear. there was a cycle: i would be scared/crying, bf would comfort me, i would start to think that he meant to harm me and make him back up or push him away, and then be terrified he was going to leave my side, lather rinse repeat....
he is a felon, there was a gun in the house and i did not want the expense/exposure of an ambulance ride esp. as he told me it would be over soon. i think he was just trying to keep me stable, i don't think he had any better knowledge of what was happening than i.

do i go to my doctor and get this episode however embarrassing into my medical record???? in my mind i was batting Way Above my League and ?something? happened bc of the drug i am so unused to.
i am clearly not going to tske this path again, so does anyone have to know?",25Apr2019,1
195,"My first semester wasnt great but it wasnt bad. This semester I have gotten the worst grades in my entire life due to some issues with my mental health. The sad thing is that I could be getting Bs but I just cant find motivation with any of my subjects. Im constantly asking myself why Im here. Like I just refuse to put in the hours for my italian or math homework. Yes, thats on me, but Im only here for my degree, I could careless about the things they teach here. I want to do vfx for film and television but at the same time I want to walk ok to either the football or baseball team at my school. Ive been thinking about going to a trade school for vfx but I realize that eliminates the possibility of playing a sport. This is all so damn confusing and difficult. Right now I just feel like college with all its basic and random classes is holding me back. Its not like Im a genius ready to go start a billion dollar company, I just think learning college level math, italian, and my public speaking classes are a waste of time when I could be improving my skill for my future career.

He flicked it open, and my history teacher heard it and confiscated it. In the school’s handbook (I’m in eighth grade) it says that any tobacco related items, in this case my zippo, cannot be possessed while in school. If it doesn’t have fuel or a flint, and I am completely clean, do I still have a chance for getting it back? If so, what should I do?

197,"I have an interview coming up in a couple of days and I really want this job. The job description mentions they prefer software engineering experience, but this is a cyber security red team job. I have a computer science degree which included several programming projects and I worked an internship where I developed a very basic software tool for the company, that i assume they probably don’t even use. However, when I graduated I felt pretty confident saying I could code. 

After I graduated. I could answer some knowledge based questions in developer interviews, but most of them stumped me and I didn’t make it very far in most of them. I wasn’t very interested in becoming a developer anyway. 

I knew I wanted to get into cyber security and I got a job in IT audit because I saw that as a pathway. Ive been doing that for a year and I’ve learned a lot about risk assessment, IT operations, and some security as well. However, I haven’t written a single line of code since I graduated and my security knowledge isn’t going to wow anyone. I’ve allowed myself to get into a rut and I’ve been stagnant other than learning my audit job. I am very interested in the security subject though, and I have studied for CCNA and Security+ certificates here and there in my spare time. Not as much as I should have. 

I’m sure the interviewers will be expecting me to be capable of coding. I don’t want to give them a false impression of my ability, but I really think I can excel at this job once I get some experience and knowledge. I also think I can pick up coding again with some practice, but not in time for the interview and certainly not enough to hit the ground running at this job. However, the listing only asked for 1 year of related experience, so I’m kind of banking on them willing to teach someone. How should I approach this?",25Apr2019,1
198,"Hello everyone- I should start by saying my boyfriend and I have worked really hard for a little over a year to be able to move to a larger city and take at least the summer off of work. Since graduating high school last June, I’ve worked at least a full time job, having a part time job on the side for most of that time period. The plan was to take the time to focus on art and get in touch with the hobbies I loved. I was also looking forward to advancing my “side hustle” sculpture collection, and my Etsy store as a result. I was really excited about this break, but out of curiosity/ letting my workaholic tendencies to get the best of me, I messaged the small mall by my new apartment, letting them know that I had experience in social media marketing in case their Instagram ever needed help. I was hoping for some freelance work at most. They actually ended up forwarding me to their marketing department, who in turn called me and asked for examples of my work. They later offered me a job, starting in two weeks that would be roughly 30 hours a week. I’m torn now. We have enough money saved up for living expenses, but I wouldn’t be opposed to bringing in a steady income on the side. The goal was to focus on getting my Etsy shop to a point where I could partially rely on it as a source of income. Should I work for the ad company and give up my summer break for a guaranteed pay check? Or should I focus all that time and effort into my own work, hoping it results in a pay check eventually?",25Apr2019,3

201,"So I’m not going to say their actual names so let’s call my boyfriend Mark and his father Sam. 

I have known Mark since birth, and we’re best friends for a long time up until he confessed his feelings to me which i reciprocated. We have settled down a bit and have been engaged for a while (Just some background)and his grandpa lives with them, so I have gotten to know him very well over the years. I don’t know when I started realizing it, but at one point i realized how touchy and weird Sam is with Mark. It’s to the point where I think it’s uncomfortable to do in front of people. Its just off in some sense, but certain things have stood out as extremely weird. Sam sometimes massages Mark out of no where, and slightly moans and groans and says “oh yeah” and stuff. My boyfriends mother has said something about it and he said “Am I not allowed to touch my son?” 

I also realized Mark has some weird attachment to his father.  He seems way to close to him. I feel like I’m watching incest happen or if I’m just paranoid. I have tried asking him about it and any time I mention it he starts flipping out at me. He has thrown me at points out of anger. His eyes look like pure hate. I told him I would leave him and he apologized and said it would not happen again. I did love him and I trusted his word for that point. He can be an asshole sometimes but I still love him. 

As I got to know his father better over the years, I learned he had a wife before Marks mother and had a son named Paul who ran away as a teenager and refused to have contact with any of the family. No one will tell me why and they all pretend he doesn’t exist. At one point they were looking at old family photos and I see Paul in all them. I just thought it’s strange that Paul would do that if they didn’t do something?

My boyfriend disregards my questions still. I don’t know if I’m just over analyzing but I feel like my boyfriends father is a creep and did something bad to Paul. 

Sometimes Mark has outbursts towards me and it’s never physical but he gets very angry. My boyfriends father also speaks of his friend who is in jail for sexually assault ting disabled kids. Really fucked up right? He also visits him on a regular basis and says they were best friends for so long he can’t abandon him. 

I have attempted to ask my boyfriend about it in the nicest way possible, or if he had experienced it in the past and he started trembling and saying don’t touch me don’t touch me and then walked away. I don’t know if it’s a form of PTSD. But I’m worried for obvious reasons and don’t know what to do.",25Apr2019,1

203,"Alright so I’m 20 years old which means that I make questionable decisions, one of which was financing a 2009 bmw 335i for $14k last March of 2018, I had pretty decent credit and my income was ok. I thought for sure I’d be Able pay for the car and any other things that popped up along with it. For example the $3,247 quoted price to replace the fuel injectors, $1,879 for a new water pump, etc... now another bad decision that I made was not cancel a gym(mma classes) membership in which I didn’t go for the last few months and had no idea that I owed them $1,043 by the end of the contract, so now the debt got sent to a collection agency and it now shows on the credit report, and knocked my credit down to 592 at the moment. Now I’m starting to pay back that $1,043 I owe, but I’m also considering trading in the bmw for the cheapest car I can find to lease. As I now have found from my own experience to never buy a used bmw. I have $11,811 left on the finance and was looking to lease a car under $15,000 for the full mrsp, which means it’ll get cut basically in half when I lease it, IF I CAN lease it. I just think it’s the best option to get out of this horrendous car, I do have a co-signer that makes $100k plus a year that is willing to help me, and I can put $5000 down. Now I just wanted to know, with my credit score, and my debt collection on the credit report, what should I do? Or what are my options? do you guys think any car company would lease me a vehicle with that credit report and having a co-signer with decent credit score and good pay?

Is something wrong?"" and he told me that my face wasn't pushed up enough against the testing device. He was right, as soon as I got in the right position I could see clearly again. But he only asked me ""Better one, better two"" like two times after I had been taking the test positioned wrong for at least 5 lens changes. 

I just got my new glasses and It almost literally made me sick to wear them for too long. Could I have completely messed up my entire exam due to not positioning myself correctly in the testing device, which in turn caused the doctor to give me the wrong prescription?

216,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I'm a woman in her 20s and I've never had sex or done anything sexual with anyone, except for my sister. 

When I was young, not more than 6 or so, my sister was 12 and started developing sexually. She had this amazing experience with masturbation and I guess she wanted to share it with me. She made this ""game"" that we just called ""The Game"", which was basically just roleplaying or playing make-believe, but whenever we played that when we were alone, it had sexual undertones. She would maturbate with me (or she would be masturbating and I wouldn't know what I was doing), go to porn sites and I would always choose the games to play because I liked online games and she'd get mad because that wasn't arousing to her. She'd ask me to eat her out and she would eat me out in return but I didn't like it because it just didn't do anything for me. I've never told anyone this and when I got older and she got a boyfriend we stopped doing this and I never understood why back then. 

We never talked about it ever after, but I've been thinking about it because I don't feel any sexual desires towards other people and I'm truthfully scared and awkward around the entire topic.

I don't know if what we did counts as her abusing/raping me because at the time I really wanted to play with her and I didn't struggle, but I also didn't understand the gravity.

I'm also severely depressed and I'm starting counseling soon and was wondering if I should ever bring it up. I don't want my sister to go to jail or something bad to happen to her. I still love her and our relationship is good now, but I don't think I can ever forget what she did to me.

Should I talk to her about it? Should I do something?

This is the only place I've ever talked about it. Nobody knows except me and my sister.

220,"Well, I've been told by a couple friends (male &amp; female) that I'm beta and too nice. If someone needs help with something, I'll help if I can. I cancel my plans if someone needs a hand with something (my plans typically involve me doing something outside for once). I've lent money and never mentioned anything about having it returned even though it inconvenienced me. I rarely argue unless it's something that can be proven with facts; I don't have the patience to argue about what I might've said last week, when I can hardly remember what I did or said yesterday. If I'm insulted I laugh it off. I'd pretty much give the shirt off my back if it'd help someone I care about.

The term doormat has been used as well. There's a young woman I'm interested; I'd give her the world if I could, but we're sort of friends. Sort of talked with dating in mind a few years back but nothing came of it. But even she feels that if we were to date and had an argument, I would go sleep in a doghouse because she said so. She said this to one of her brothers and it got back to me.

I'm a pretty ho-hum guy. Don't really rock the boat unless it's necessary, and I try to keep it peaceable if possible. I don't really assert myself and I go with the flow for the most part. I usually say no to hanging out whenever I know I'll be bored or uninterested in the event. Don't drink, don't watch or play sports. Play video games but primarily story driven games; not really into competitive games. I don't really have ambitions or goals that I'm striving for. I just want to live a peaceful life, grow old and die of old age. At this time I live with my mother at age 32, with an entry level job. I screwed up after high school. I know it's not ideal but it works for us. No car. And while I'd like to have one out of convenience, I live in an area where busses run every 10mins and I don't mind walking.

You don’t get a lot of time to talk in school and there are no parties planned either so texting is a good way to get to know each other more and maybe it’ll be easier to talk in school.",25Apr2019,1
224,"My boyfriend broke up with me about two weeks before we were suppose to get an apartment together and start the next step of our lives. 

Backstory: we’ve been together for two years and have had a pretty rocky relationship. We’ve had amazing highs and very low lows. I’ve made a lot of mistakes and so has he. After lots of fighting we decided to break it off but always kept in contact. Everyday he would text me wanting to get back together, and said he really worked on himself, and I agreed to give it another chance. 

It’s been two months and we’ve had one fight about him going out to a bar but besides that I thought we were fine. We seemed to be good, moving on, and working together. He told me today over text that he feels like he’s not over things and he can’t be with me. I feel so upset and heartbroken. I love this man so much and I can see my self marrying him and he hits me randomly with he “can’t do with anymore.” He told me he was ready, had gotten over our hardships, and convinced we should try again. I feel so stupid, humiliated, and heartbroken. I’m not sure if it’s another woman, me, or simply he’s not in love with me anymore. I’m just at a loss for words, I saw him today saying I love him so much and he probably will ignore me and try to get over me as quickly as possible. I’m so beyond hurt and I feel betrayed. How can I see a future with someone who doesn’t even see one with me? I can’t say I’m mad at him because I’m glad he told me the truth, but it’s going to hurt seeing him be with someone else when I wanted that to be me so bad. I can’t even imagine that, and even years from now I don’t think I will be able to get over my love for him. 

I guess this was kind of a rant, I needed to say how I feel but I also don’t know what to do. I guess just let him go but it’ll be so damn hard letting that happen, I thought I could marry this man. I know I’ve made a lot of mistakes but I feel like a terrible person for everything, I can’t help but blame my self for the end of our relationship.",25Apr2019,2

228,"As the title states, I have a very big fear and a lot of anxiety about driving. When I was younger, I truly never wanted to learn to drive. I only learned because my family pressured me into it. I ended up getting my drivers permit, and I learned to drive, park, and all the other bits and pieces required. When it comes to driving and parking, I'm confident that I can do it well. 

While I may not have desired to drive, I was mostly neutral about getting a license until my family ended up suffering through quite a few accidents that put this fear in me. Now I cannot even sit in a car without feeling like crawling out of my own skin and running away. But I don't have a choice if I want to be able to get to places so I will get into a car with family members or with my bf but I will either force myself to zone out or else I focus on my phone so I won't have to look outside. 

Otherwise, if I don't do this, I end up feeling my heart constrict and jump into my throat each time a car or truck passes by too close for my comfort. My body gets these cold chills up and down my spine, and I feel frozen in place. It has gotten to points where I feel like I may pass out from the emotions. My family has poked fun at me over my fear and I'm afraid that others around me don't understand or don't take this as seriously as I do either. 

Recently, I decided that I would try to get my license after all because I need to be able to drive to get a job that better suits my certification. I am taking the steps to obtain my permit but haven't found the right/best time to do so yet and I'm constantly pressured by family to hurry up with it. I'm at my wits end and I truly want to just tell people to leave me alone about this.

TLDR: I'm dead scared of driving and don't want to get my license but I'm forced to in order to get a better life. How do I deal with this fear and anxiety so I can accomplish this pointless and stressful task?",25Apr2019,1
229,"Hello,

I needed some advice. So my favorite basketball team just lost a close game. I was super upset about it and I used a bunch of curse words and it really bothered me. The thing is, whenever they lose, I’ve noticed how I’ve gotten less sleep, and the effect of the loss stays with me for a few days. 

So my question is:

Is this sort of behavior typical? And how would I go about it? My goal is to not make a mountain out of a molehill, but it’s been tough. I do have a mental health condition but I’m not sure if that’s the reason why I’m reacting so much to something I can’t control.

230,"hey all

i'm in the early twenties age bracket where you start to really get an idea who you are and what you want to do

and yeah, that's been happening

but i don't actually ""approve of"", in some way, which parts of living i'm starting to enjoy

my whole life up until this point i've been pushed, and pushed myself, to go further and to make a positive difference in the world, but i'm discovering i'm not actually ambitious at all and just want a peaceful life where i don't have to worry about that sort of stuff at all. i'd rather be kind and giving to the people around me than smart and career-oriented

but i feel really guilty or that it's lame, in a way, because i won't be using my potential to make the biggest positive difference i could be, especially in this era of climate change and political catastrophe. it feels like a total copout

i feel like if i choose to act on this ""rather kind than smart"" angle i'll be a hypocrite, because i could have made much bigger/better contribution to the world had i kept going against some ""bad feelings"". i mean that there feels like a really lame reason to give up, too

242,"Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for reading. (I know I might've made my mother seem like a villain but I'm sure she really does care for me and has good intentions.) I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to begin or if I'm just giving unnecessary history but, I'm a sixteen-year-old male. And for the majority of those sixteen years, I never felt like I had a choice in the things I want to do. I grew up listening to the demands of my mother and father, and for the most part, I agreed to every single one of them. It consisted of playing an instrument I hated for about seven years, attending extra classes at a different school, being the ""perfect"" student, to study the path of a doctor, etc. My childhood was a mess- I remember making one friend during elementary and then immediately moving to a community of different ethnicity. Needless to say, I was bullied and didn't have anyone to depend on. I didn't have the luxury of hanging out with friends, having a conversation, laughing. I decided to just get it over with. So comes high school and with it, the rebellious phase I guess. I quit piano and finally told my parents that I didn't want to be what they want me to be. Of course, they didn't take it nicely, scolding me for being a failure and whatnot. That eventually passes for them but not me, I still hold a grudge. Anyway, I decided to try to get back on their good side, saying I'd graduate high school early, be someone that makes a ton of money, go to some prestigious college and all is fine! Except, I find out later that I'm chickening out on the latter one or two. I begin working towards it, extra advanced classes and all to the point where I became so stressed with what's to come, sexuality, and expectations that I requested a therapist. It was delayed, and I began to contemplate running away, hurting myself, or worse. If I had to describe how it felt with only a few words, I'd say I felt really disconnected with everything. I didn't know what I wanted, I didn't feel like I even had a family, as if I had no one to talk to. I decided to just give up. I tried several times to drop out of high school and cried many tears trying to even say ""I don't want to go to college"" to them. An early-graduate who has the grades to be the salutatorian of the school wants to drop out and not go to college. In the midst of all the ridicule and shame, I found my life, like all of a sudden, a ton of good things happened. I began to draw, and draw more. It was the first thing I think I enjoyed wholeheartedly, I would pour anywhere from three to fifteen hours a day just drawing, learning, and talking to artists online. I found my first crush, made friends, actually left the house to hang out somewhere, began finding my hobbies, etc. So I decided my job would be an artist, I would take a gap year to refine my skills and maybe go to my top choice art school if money allows for it. It was met with a ton of discouragement at first and I get it, it would most likely be an unstable job. But it was my passion and I wanted to hold on to it. Then one day while I was hanging out with someone in a videogame, she asks, ""Are you drawing? Why aren't you drawing?"" This continues for a while where out of nowhere when I'm taking a break, she continuously pesters me about drawing. When I am drawing, she enters my room, is silent, and then leaves. There's just something about the question ""Why aren't you drawing?"" that kills my passion. I still love drawing, but with this, it's becoming dreadful. Then again out of nowhere, she begins asking questions that remind me of school, and she knows I hate school. ""Do you have homework? Have you decided to go to college?"" Fast forward to now, every time I hang out with people she begins to ask, ""Are they male or female? Are they \[insert ethnicity\]?"" I don't see why it matters and it's like if the questions are the extent of our conversation, just a whole bunch of miserable. I've tried to confront her about it, how those questions really upset me and she would stop for a day only to continue the next. Only then do I realize how little I know of my mother. So I try instead, to expand the scope of our conversations by asking a question like ""What are your hobbies?"" since she would keep poking at me about drawing. She says something along the lines of ""I didn't go to college, so I have to work a shitty job and thus, don't have the luxury of having hobbies."" So here I am about to graduate and start a gap year to work towards my dream, very happy, yet full of doubts. Losing the motivation to draw to a simple question like ""Why aren't you drawing?"", is my passion real or did I get ahead of myself? Am I being too lax, not taking advantage of my opportunities?  Am I being too selfish? How should I talk with my mother who only seems to ask those questions? Am I overthinking?",25Apr2019,2

248,"So I'm a soon to be 18 year old dude who has failed 11th grade(junior year highschool) twice in a row. My mum feels like shit because of it, she feels she did a bad job raising me, especially since I was diagnosed with depression. The treatment for that has been super on/off. I feel like I'm a pretty garbage child too, as Idon't really listen to anything she says and am a disappointment overall, since I don't really have any talents or hobbies and don't even do basic tasks like brushing my teeth or bathing regularly.

Today, we were called to my school to deliver us the news of me failing for the second time. My mum was extremely upset, but she knew it was coming so she didn't say much. While on the way out, she said that she really wish that I had put in the effort to pass. At this point, I get frustrated because I had explained to her multiple times that I did put in effort, and had wanted to pass, just wasn't able to(not sure if this is true or not, at times I feel like I tried but honestly maybe not). We got into an argument because of me being frustrated, and I called her a bad parent and stuff in anger, this made her furious too, and she hit me.

We didn't talk on the way home, but then when we got there, she started to work and then asked me to leave the room because she was getting annoyed looking at me and couldn't focus. I don't know why, but I didn't listen to it and just sat there. She got extremely angry at that, and started screaming at me, and then in a rage beating me. She tried to choke me, hit me with a glass bottle filled with water, splashed water on my face, tore my t-shirt trying to drag me out. Eventually, I started feeling like shit so I just told her to stop, and left the room. Now, I'm just in another room typing this out, and am really scared cause she will probably treat me really badly.

She isn't exactly as bad of a parent as this portrays her, to be clear. She really cares a lot about me and has been through a lot. She tries her best to provide me every material thing and is overall a great person IMO and I really don't wanna lose her.

So id eat an apple a day or something equivalent to size just so I didn’t feel like I was dying. I stayed around 132 all through high school. Sunk in face and all, I looked dead.

259,"First off, I made what I consider to be a mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

My longtime friend and I both moved in together. We've been pretty good friends for 8-9 years or so. He was messing around with his FWB when we first moved in. About a month after he had this new FWB thing start up and turn into his now girlfriend. He had told me on multiple occasions that he had no feelings for this first girl and that it was a strict FWB thing that was never going to go anywhere. This first girl ended up coming to our new years party. I had drank and I nearly had sex with this girl. I stopped myself and I continued to make another mistake. She started messaging me on FB and the conversation got explicit and we had discussed plans to have sex when my friend wasn't around, however I ended up blocking her deciding it was a bad idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these girls are friends with each other and the entire sexually charged conversation and plans to have sex were disclosed to my friend via his new girlfriend. He never brought it up to me and told a mutual friend that he ""Didn't care because he didn't have feelings for her"".  However his demeanor around me is completely different. I'm afraid I've lost his trust by not disclosing what happened myself and him having to find out by someone else. I'm also afraid his new girlfriend (that he spends most days with) has convinced him that I am not trustworthy and that I'm not a real friend. I've always seen myself as trustworthy and a good friend to all of my friends but this is absolutely killing me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a conversation over the phone letting him know that ""nothing happened"" but that I still felt awful and he fed me that line that he didn't care again but it still seems like he does. Through the same mutual friend he has expressed that ""He doesn't know what to think about it"" and that just seems to me that I've lost one of my best friends by making a mistake. His new girlfriend absolutely hates me, which is obvious, and won't talk to me and avoids me when she comes over. Any advice on how to get my friend back? I feel like this should be something we should be laughing at together, not tearing us apart. Also any advice on how to get his new girlfriend not to think I'm a total piece of shit?",25Apr2019,1

264,"I live with 5 other college boys in a big house and every once in a while the other 5 throw small parties of about 20-30 people. They drink, smoke, play loud music and play beer pong.

265,"So, a little over a year ago, basically, I got upset with my mom. I'm at college and don't live too close to her or the rest of my immediate family. I didn't tell her I was mad at her, I just said I needed some space. It's kind of complicated, but she found out I was mad at her through my dad who specifically asked if I was. I didn't want to lie so I said yes. He told her and she stopped talking to me, even though she didn't know why I was upset. She didn't talk to me for eight months. She's done this before, where she'll give you the silent treatment until you apologize if you get upset with her, normally when she knows you have the right to be upset. It's so manipulative and I didn't want to give in this time, because it's just not fair to do that to someone. I didn't do anything wrong, all I said was I needed some space. Eventually she realized I wasn't going to give in and she basically tried to bribe me with presents this past Christmas, but I didn't even open them, because I felt like if I did then I would be accepting her bribe and things would go back to ""normal,"" which by the way, things really were not ok before this happened. She said hi to me and stuff and I saw hi back because I didn't want to give her the silent treatment like she had done to me. But she wanted ME to come up to her and fix things, to keep our relationship one sided and have me keep doing all the work. She sent me a package with candy and a card. She said she loves me and that she really does miss me, and that we don't have to be best friends but we don't have to be enemies. It felt like she was acting like I made us enemies. I don't see her as an enemy, but she really hurt me, and after a few months of not talking to her I decided my life would be better off without her for now. Before you judge me for this decision, she has always been very manipulative. She tried to turn people in my family against me by telling them that I stopped talking to her so that they would be upset with me, and I would either have to give in and call her and apologize or face isolation. Well, I chose isolation, and that really did hurt me. The other family members involved wouldn't listen to me, and they know how she is an have experienced the things she does but I've always gotten the worst of it. Everyone is always against me, and now I don't know what to do. I feel like if I call her I'll be giving in. I found out my twin sister and her were tracking my phone because we share an iTunes account and they were basically spying on me. I made my own account, turned off find my iPhone which apparently my sister turned on without my knowledge, although I don't know how, and blocked them both. I also ALWAYS keep the find my iPhone feature off just in case. So since I blocked my mom, she can't call me. I'm sorry the post is so long, but I wanted to give some context and reasons for the decisions I have made. Should I call her? I really don't feel like she is willing to put effort into our relationship but not having my mom in my life at all makes me really sad. I'm just trying to protect myself, but I feel awful.

268,"Mobile so formatting.

I feel like the obvious answer is ""if you have to ask, don't you know the answer"" but i'm really not sure. I'm 19, in college, and relatively healthy if slightly overweight.

For starters, i dont smoke (tobacco. i do weed on occasion but i'm managing that well), only vape, and usually only do it in social settings. My friend and i have ""joint custody"" over a vape if you will (juul, i know, it's lame). My usage of it has normally been in the evenings, after work when i go to hang out at his dorm.

I assume it can take some practice to recognize but i've never had something i'd classify as a craving or withdrawal. If it's been a while since i've used one, and i'm bored, it may flick through my mind but if i'm occupied, it really doesn't (think like a thought about good food). Maybe sometimes it'll flick through and i'll end up looking forward to it, but i'm never like ""oooh, gotta have it, gimme that shit."" On the flipside, usually i get to his place and the first thing i do is reach for it. 

My dad smokes so growing up around that, i have no intention of ever touching a cigarette.

I mention my dad because he obviouly has at least a moderate addiction, going through a pack every other day. We have very similar personalities, mindsets, mannerisms, you name it. I recognize when he's having cravings or withdrawals and i haven't seen any of these in myself yet.

Anyway, cut to the chase, i recently went out and bought a few disposable ones while the one i usually use was unavailable. This didn't worry me until i just finished the last one and went ""shit, what now.""

I don't necessarily want to give up the social aspect as it's a good convo starter (nearly everyone at college parties has one), i.e. ""whoa, what mod is that, what flavor, etc. and sort of a comraderie situation, but my casual everyday use of it is starting to give me anxiety. 

So, am i at a manageable amount of use or do y'all think i should cut back. Obviously 0% usage is ideal, but see above paragraph. Sorry for the novel 😅",25Apr2019,2

274,"Hi there, 

I’m an undergrad college student taking a general education math course. Earlier in the semester I had a health scare (liver damage/jaundice) and I was out of school for 3 weeks. The first day of being in the hospital, I let my professors know I’d be gone for a while and updated them weekly. They were all accommodating, although I had the most work to make up in my math class. I came in to my teacher’s (we’ll just call her Mrs. A) office hours with a doctor’s note and list of the assignments I was gone for, and I turned them all in and also made up an exam I missed within 3 days of coming back. 

Fast forward to 2 months later, and I have a follow up procedure in 2 weeks on the same day of another math exam. Yesterday I emailed Mrs. A *2 weeks* before the exam to ask if I could take it early (it’s online, so all she would have to do is give me access the day before) and she responded with a pretty rude email that came out of nowhere. I’ll spare the entirety of it, but the last lines were “Your requests are outrageous. You should’ve picked a class that was more suitable for your complicated life.” 

Now I totally understand that she has no obligation to accommodate me, and I would’ve been okay with her just simply saying “No, sorry”. But her comment about my “complicated life” really rubbed me the wrong way and I’m not sure how to respond. I’m not sure if I should tell her that was uncalled for, or if I should just let it slide with a “okay, thanks anyway”. My major is in a completely different department so I’ll likely never see her again after this semester’s over.",25Apr2019,2

278,"Hey so I am a 17 year old male posting on my anonymous account cause my friends+family know my real one. Its kind of a long story but i thought id put this here because im just unsure of what I should do about it. My family of me, my younger sister, mother and father never really had too many problems with each other. My dad occasionally would get very upset about little things, he would yell and get very agitated when angry. My mom or dad has never actually hit me as punishment, my mom is seriously against that as shes been a teacher her whole life and really is against any physical punishment. Once when i was in elementary school, i left my muddy boots on the floor instead of the mat, and my dad got pretty angry and yelled at my face “he was gonna smoke me” but that is the closest thing he had ever come to actual physical violence. I know this might be weird but I consider my room to be the most important place in the world for me. I dont have drugs or anything hidden in my room, its just that my personal space is so hugely hugely important to me, I always leave the door shut and everyone has to knock and ask before they open the door. I rarely let anyone in. I just really appreciate my own room to myself because it makes me feel safe and comfortable. Fast forward to about a year and a half ago, my parents had gotten very angry about how much I was using my phone . My dad barged right in yelling, my dumbass wouldnt just hand over my phone, so he shoved me hard and yanked on it and my charger and hands to try to seize it. Honestly i dont know what i was doing, i should have just let him take it, but he shoved me and was grabbing me hard so i hit him in the arm a few times to get him to let go. He then proceeded to choke me and then slam me into the wall and then the ground as my mom is screaming in the background. He runs backdown stairs with my phone. My mom really didnt tolerate that and she immediately took my sister and I to a local hotel where we stayed for a couple days, and then we went over to my grandparents house for a bit. When we moved back into the house, my dad apologized to me, i didnt really wanna think about it, i accepted it and moved on. Maybe i was being a bitch about the phone but I really dont think its right to choke slam your own son and try to take his stuff by force. Anyways i had thought we both moved on. My parents had never really shown too much affection towards each other, and a couple times i saw some text messages about them talking about divorce and how they havent been intimate for a very long time (i think maybe years but its really not my business). Obviously that made me a bit sad but i was like 15-16 when i realized that my parents probably dont love each other that much or at all anymore. I mean divorce is just a part of life. So i thought we had moved on from the phone incident until today when he got very frustrated at me for eating dinner at a friends house and not telling him. My fault on that one, i shouldve told him where i was and that i wouldnt be needing dinner, but he made a HUGE deal about it. He yelled at me all car ride about how much I disrespect him, how all i do is play video games all day, how im not gonna go to college cause my grades suck (which is pretty hyperbolic in my opinion. My grades are getting better and im a very active basketball player). My mom asked me what happened because my dad looked pissed, so i just told her the truth that my dad had gone on a screaming rant in the car. This rant didnt bother me as its just typical parent stuff, what bothered me is what happened an hour ago when he opened my door and stuck his head through and started snarling at me about how its totally my fault their marriage is crumbling, how they havent had a relationship in years, how hes gonna leave the house cause hes done with my shit, how i cause all the negative stuff in the house, how my mom still is pissed off about the choke slam incident and doesnt forgive him for that. I honestly thought we had moved past that but i guess not. It was very scary, he was spitting everywhere and I really felt unsafe. Maybe im being a pussy or a bitch, I do struggle with Anxiety/panic attacks and intrusive thoughts, but I really feel unsafe in my house because i dont know if hes just gonna suddenly come into my room and get all up in my face or get physical. Im so sorry this was such a long poorly structured post i just wanted to put this somewhere. I would not say i have an abusive father. I definitely think he has anger management issues and i dont feel safe around him when hes mad, especially when he barges into my room. I know this situation isnt as serious as teens who legitimately have abusive parents but i thought id post here and see if you guys could help me? Is this something I should be worried about? Should I talk to somebody and if so who? What can I do to feel safer in my house? this is just my side of the story but i tried to be accurate and include everything.

So the other day I broke up with my boyfriend (he is 27, I'm 21) of almost three years. I felt like he was very critical of me and that my heart was distancing itself. I was looking for a sign to leave prior to that... and we got into this fight;
Only thing is now I'm worried that I was too hard on him about this fight. I don't think I want to get back together right now but I'm worried that I was actually too hard on him. And after I describe the  fight I will explain why I have a chip on my shoulder about what we fought about. 

Here is basically the convo, which took place over text;

So he said he wanted to do a quickie but I was home with my parents, he had asked me if I could sneak out or sneak him in, which I obviously said no because I'm too old for that. So I was talking about days we could have sex, but I explained to him that since I'm off of birth control right now he needs to use a condom. 
Him: ""I want to fuck you and cum inside your mouth. We don't have to worry about you getting preggo! Lol""
Me: ""ok but I don't like that""
Him: ""lol babe it's happening""
Me: ""nah"" 
...

Him: ""lol but I am cumin in your mouth lol it's happening""
Me: ""no not my thing""

...

Him: ""so it's happening babe and if you don't like it we don't have to do it again."" 
*he calls me wack after saying no again, I call him wack back*
Him: ""no you are (wack). Your not willing to try new things. Have you ever done it before?""
*I tell him I think I did it with him, he asks if I did it with my ex. I tell him I don't remember*
Him: ""Explain yourself, I'm not buying it. I'm trying to understand why you are so against it.""
*after going back and forth for a little bit, me telling him that I don't remember and him telling me that he doesn't think I'm telling him what really happened, I tell him it's not that deep*
Him: ""it is deep, sex is more than just sex and hormones going crazy, it's a spiritual connection."" 
Me: ""yes I know but there are things that people don't like to do."" 
*we go back and forth more about him asking me if I swallowed my ex's cum? I eventually tell him he is acting weird.*
Him: ""yes because I can't fully express myself when it comes to sex. So sorry for acting weird. I want to know why you are turned off by it.""
Me: ""because I'm not into it, it grosses me out""
Him: ""that's wack""
Me: ""okay I'm wack"" 
Him: ""it is what it is I guess. But I don't think I could be happy when it comes to sex, you're not willing to give a shot that is out of your comfort zone. It's my sexual problems though.""
Me: ""well sorry. If I'm not comfortable with something I'm not going to do it.""
Him: ""no you are not and that's okay. You're not at fault. I like different things I guess""
Me: ""yea."" 
Him: ""Not sex but I have been uncomfortable around your folks at times. So I have been uncomfortable but it was my choice to stick with it."" 
Me: ""what are you trying to say""
Him: ""we are two different people when it comes to being uncomfortable and having our sexual preferences."" 
Me: ""are you trying to say that I'm uncomfortable with things during sexual but you are uncomfortable with my folks but try anyway?""
Him: ""now you got it. Pretty much I have been uncomfortable as you know but I did try. The problem is sex and dealing with people is two different things. You never did anything that I didn't like when it comes to sex."" 
Me: ""so why are you bringing it up now?"" 
Him: ""you said you were uncomfortable so I was trying to relate to you."" 
Me: ""you are acting weird tonight.""
Him: ""I'm not acting weird. I just don't understand for being with someone for almost three years is not willing to give it a chance. That's weird so I'm going to knit pick why and I want to know your reason."" 


That's basically the bulk of the convo. Here is the background. This is not the first time we had a convo like this. There was a time where I got nervous when we were about to, so he ranted about my family and the fact that I put him through a lot and the fact that there are girls that hate me cause I am with him (he apologized), he has gotten mad if I didn't want to sext a few times, there was a time that I didn't want to give him a blow Job so he lowered my head to his dick, which I think I resisted (that was a while ago). He has ranted that I am not willing to try new things before. For a while when we had sex he would keep telling me to call him daddy, which I would say no, so he would go harder. Eventually I did cause I wanted to make him happy, he didn't ask me that time. 

And the reason he was asking me about my ex was because my ex used to get mad if I didn't want to have sex with him, so he would masterbate next to me  even if I asked him to stop, saying he had to. Or he would go downstairs and literally bang on his walls. He would tell me it was like a mental illness, and when I told him I wanted to stop until he got help, he said that would make him do it more. The relationship went downhill from there. 

This time though, he said he was trying to ""relate to me"" when he brought up feeling uncomfortable around my folks. (Which he later explained he was talking about my friends, which he has had some bad experiences with). I definitely went hard on him the next morning, telling him I believed he was trying to guilt me into getting some, which he denied. He didn't really apologize until he feared me losing him, before that he accused me of comparing him to my ex.

Am I tainted by my experiences? Do you guys think he was really trying to relate to me? This convo was over text.. I'm just worried that this got misconstrued and that I was too hard on him, because a lot of this behavior did go away.

The mother chose the daughter’s side because of how hysterical she was. All while, the son (my friend) was undecided on what to believe. On one hand he had his sister saying one thing, while on the other, the dad was denying it. 

It’s been many years since and I’m worried that things will never change for my friend. He was clearly depressed and barely graduated high school. Once substances got involved, he started indulging heavily. Drinking became a problem and now he is consistently smoking and barely getting through in life. Most of his friends, including me, have lost touch with him because he distances himself and constantly lies to us. Now he lives with his dad and when he is belligerently intoxicated (only times I’ll see him) he’ll rant about how difficult it is to see his dad. It seems that he wants to believe his father but his sister hates him for it. 

Is there anything that would help him? I can’t necessarily go to his family because that wouldn’t help and it’s not my place. I just really care about this guy but he refuses to do anything about it other than suppress himself with substances. I’ve told him how I feel about the situation but he brushes it off. I’m starting to think I should just let it go.",25Apr2019,1
287,"hi so im a 16 year old student looking for a part time job. recently, i went for an interview with a bubble tea store in my area. after the interview, they invited me in for a ""trial shift"" that is unpaid for 1 hour. i went on our scheduled day and to my surprise the manager wasn't there and nobody was supervising me to see if i ""passed"" or not except for another employee who seem surprised of my arrival and taught me a few things before leaving my completely alone for the hour. after i received a message from the manager asking how the shift went which i find odd because I thought the manager would be telling ME how my shift went and how well I did and if im hired. so i said it went well and he asked for my availability and wanted to schedule me in for longer shifts. he did not mention training, contracts, if im hired or anything. just said hes gonna schedule me in for longer shifts. so i feel a bit sketched out so i ask him what method i will be paid through and he said he'll ""get my pay information later"" so i need some advice or ur thoughts on if i should go to this long 5 hour shift he scheduled for me??? or am i not gonna get paid at all and hes just using me. because I need to be trained clearly because that 1 hr i had was barely enough for me to learn how to use the register and select orders. i feel like if i go to the shift no one is gonna train me since he made no mention. thanks for the help, anything would be appreciated!",25Apr2019,1

I call my boyfriend crying almost every night and I feel like such a burden. The idea of suicide just honestly sounds really appealing. It just doesn’t really make me sad or scared to think about at all. It’s just that life kind of seems like too much and I could literally just have it be over in a second and then it wouldn’t matter. I know that everyone’s response to something like this is that it’s selfish and you can’t do that to your loved ones but I just really feel like me being gone would make everyone’s lives a lot easier. The emotions I feel are just too much for me to handle and I don’t really see any reason not to just stop needing to deal with it. I feel like the only real thing holding me back is just actually physically doing it. I know this sounds just so bad but in my mind right now it isn’t this big tragic thing it’s just getting to turn it all off and never need to feel this way again.

290,"My family decided to put our three year old dog down due to complications from a condition called IMT. Basically, his immune system was attacking his platelets and he could’ve spontaneously internally bled to death at any moment. This all developed over the course of three days. 

Unfortunately, I can’t help but think more could have been done to save him. I wasn’t there to make the call, but I drove four hours from school to be there when they put him down. My mom made the ultimate decision to put him down, but chemo and a year on steroids *could* have cured him. She didn’t want to put him through that and pay for it, so she decided putting him down would be best.

291,"This all started around 3 days ago. My dad has been randomly snapping at me and my family and purposely being as horrible as possible.

He has taken away all of my electronic privileges (I have snuck on my phone) and has repeatedly threatened us when we ask him why. His threats are along the lines of “I’ll bust your fucking teeth” and “I’ll fucking smash that phone if you ask me again”.

We don’t know what to do. We have confronted him and it just ends with threats and him retreating to the garage. He hasn’t physically hurt anyone yet, however he did rip my PlayStation off the stand. I tried to block his path and tell him to stop but he just pushed me aside and shoved it in his closet. If needs be I could defend myself and my family from him if it does get violent, I just hope it doesn’t come to that.

He has done it before but this is the worst I have experienced, I remember he had an outburst onetime where he smashed everything in his garage with and axe and ordered my mum to pick it up.

I met a girl on tinder who I grew to like quickly, but she ended up being a month away from her 18th birthday. We remained friends on the premise that I told her nothing could happen. Gave her a ride home from work late one night and we ended up messing around, no actual sex though. I instantly felt like a total scum bag for it. Cut ties with her right after it happened. This was 5 months ago now and the guilt is killing me. I’m also really worried about her telling the wrong person and it coming back to bite me in the ass legally.

296,"Yeah sooo, im bisexual. I’m a senior in high school right now, about to graduate, get on with my life etc. And for the past 3 years I’ve had a huge crush on a straight guy. I know it seems dumb, why would I STILL have a crush on him knowing that he’s straight, and I’m not quite sure why either. When I first met him, I thought he was gay. He just gives that impression, I’ve talked to other people about that too. I even thought he had a crush on me too because he would stare at me a lot and sat next to me in class the first day of school! Even His mom thought he was gay and was in a secret relationship with me when we started to hang out a lot. We’ve been really good friends, best friends right now to be exact and god I just have the stupidest dazed and confusing gigantic gay crush on him. He knows I’m bisexual, I told him a while back, this year I even told him I had a crush on him. Notice that I said I told him that I “had” a crush on him, (I still have a crush on him) I don’t think he knows to the extent that I truly crush on him. And I can’t get away from him either. I spend more than half of my day with this guy during and after school, we have lots of classes together. I’m not gonna lie, he used to not be the most popular kid and he didn’t have that many friends either. When he started hanging out with me though, that’s when he really became social. I’ve been feeling like this for a long time, but I feel like he’s taking advantage of me. He befriended everyone in my social circle, dated my best “girl” friend, and he even started dressing like me, stealing my jokes etc. I feel like he’s just a parasite and an energy drainer. I would stop hanging out with him but it’s literally impossible to ignore him because I have a giant crush on him, he always wants to be the center of attention, and we have the same classes🙄. From softmore year to senior year he’s all I can think about and I’m fed up with it. I’ve been so blinded all these years with hope that one day he’ll somehow like me back in the way I want him to, and it’s just never going to happen. If you have any advice, questions, or comments please let me know so. I’ve just been hating how I feel about him for a while now and I just don’t know what to do.",25Apr2019,0

300,"I won’t make this too long. I had a very hard upbringing tbh, not to complain, it taught me a lot. I try to look at the positive side of things as much as possible. 

At around 14, I met my now ex and he made the happiest I have ever been. I can’t explain it in words but he was like my “home”/ “safe place”. I didn’t have that in my life then so I really fell in love. We dated until I was 18 , stayed in touch until I was 19. Basically most my teen years. He was 2.5 years older, not that that really matters. 

He cheated on me, because he went away to the US for college, (not originally from America). I guess getting with someone young you either grow apart or grow together. And you get to know someone when they aren’t around you and are confronted in different environments. Things about your character that collapse are just ideals then. 

Anyways, i remember it made me sick to my stomach. I threw up, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. It sucked. It was like did I really even know who you are? Because never in a million years would I think he would do this. 

He’s the only person I been with/ and been intimate with. And it was a big deal to me because I told him if I lost my v to you then it’s something that you need to tell me you see a future with us. 

Not to sound cocky at all, but I looked at the girls he cheated with and it was just like ...? I don’t get it. Not to be rude but they weren’t pretty or anything interesting. I just didn’t get it. I am a semi famous model - million followers , and I mean again not to be rude but I get told I’m beautiful often. I’m doing my masters in psychology so academically pretty successful as well. And I think I’m a nice girl? Like out of everything that’s the biggest thing- that I’m just a caring person. We were best friends, it was a very deep emotional connection and I know that’s how he felt too. (Until he left). 

Looking back that relationship taught me a lot. I can’t go back and change things. I am grateful for the memories. But it’s like Ofcourse we had our ups and downs but IMO the ups &gt; the downs.

About 6 months ago a managerial position came up and I put forward someone I had previously worked with.
They got the job and the whole store took off in ways it hadn't before! We were smashing every target and things that had been ongoing issues for years were being resolved.
However some members of staff took a disliking to the new manager as with the previous manager they were very friendly and got special treatment.
These members of staff have now caused the new manager to quit their job as they put in a complaint against them saying they were being bullied.
None of this is true but because there were two companies it was taken very seriously. Unfortunately as these members of staff are friends with the previous manager who is now the district manager I feel as if they took their word for it and forced the new manager out.

I'm now left in a position where I don't trust the people I work with :( i knew from the day I started there was favouritism and that me and the new manager were seen as outsiders.

306,"I'm a young female working in an almost all male environment. I'm used to stupid comments but a few months ago my manger joined in and proceeded to get more persistent. I kept telling him no. He kept telling me to meet him in the back room and he would already have his dick out and waiting for me to get back there. Not knowing what I was getting myself into I gave in and basically just let him pressure me. After we were done he said if I told anyone that BOTH of us would get fired and his baby mom's would put him in child support again and that he would deny everything.

I can't even remember accurate dates or times and I feel as if they will just conclude the investigation by firing me.

307,"Recently I have been having a really bad time mentally, I'm losing my emotions, I barley sleep, i feel like trash, and I had a panic attack where I almost ended up cutting myself. I have been going through a lot recently so I was off social media for 2 days then I didn't go to a party my friend was hosting because I was not in a good place mentally for it and I felt like I would bring the whole mood down. 

The same day of the party I had a panic attack and almost ended up cutting myself again, I knew I should not be alone with my thoughts because I would do something stupid and I was not going to go to the party because I didn't want my closest friends seeing me in such a state, so I went to a bar with some friends who were not as close as the friends hosting the party.

The problem is that the next day my close friends found out about me going to the bar and after explaining the whole situation to them, I ended up apologising to one because our conversation was going nowhere. She was hurt because I wasnt honest (She thought I wanted to go to the bar with my other friends instead of her party) and I genuinely thought that prioritizing my mental health was important and that I did nothing wrong by getting out of my house to clear my mind.

My other friend told people she was disappointed in me because she thought that I ditched them for another group of people. She would then ignore me for about 2 weeks and after constantly telling her to hear me out, she finally listened and recognised that I acted in a way to prioritize my health but she is now still ignoring me and barley talks to me. 

I'm not in a good place and I'm confused because when one of the 2 close friends had mental issues, my other friend and i went out of our way to keep checking on her and supporting her, my other friend  even went to the therapist with her.

308,"Initial apologies for if something is worded weirdly or is not clear, I have difficulty articulating how I feel regarding this particular situation since it seems to be in a constant, vicious loop of emotions.

So, for a preface, I am currently a 20F in university, and Pre-Med. My major currently is doing a great job preparing me for what I would like to pursue (medical school), and therefore I have a little more time than what I was initially expecting in my life, and I want to fill it with further dedication to hobbies I use to do pretty actively in the past since I just can’t sit still and binge Hulu or Netflix (believe me, I’ve tried). These hobbies were specifically cosplay/costumery, traditional/digital art, and makeup. However, I’ve been having a difficult time trying to decide what to pursue more, since there tremendous caveats to all three, especially when bringing into account my mental state.

I wouldn’t say anything along the lines of being unstable, but I definitely have my ups and downs. I’ve had anxiety for most of my life, and its been pretty severe to the point of medication. Since I was also diagnosed with depression at the time, I was tried on a multitude of SSRIs and SNRIs to try and mitigate the toll it was taking on my daily life. However, the side effects for most of them were rare and severe for me, one even going so far as to giving me the equivalence of narcolepsy. My family was compliant enough with helping me with medicine, but I wouldn’t necessarily call it supportive. There were times where I was told to just “calm down” and “stop acting depressed” more times than I could count, and coupled with layers of family dysfunction, school stress, and dealing with what probably was inklings of OCD as well, I’ve become someone who finds it extremely difficult to trust my own choices, and am currently just trying to live with my severe anxiety. 

(For clarification, the OCD was mentioned by my therapist, but I was stopped from seeing her again due to insurance increasing rates to be economically unfeasible, and my family’s fatigue with her failed attempts to find a medicine that would support me with non-extreme side effects. It’s a bit of an “everybody lost” situation, so I am not necessarily mad at anyone involved. It came from me needing very strange, methodical, and ritualistic things to be done at certain times of the day coupled with obsessive thoughts about cleanliness and personal performance.)

What does this have to do with any of my hobbies? Well, its these experiences that are stopping me from even starting them. It feels as though there’s a mental barrier that just stops me from pursuing any of them to the extent that I want to, perhaps from a subconscious fear that my grades will start to suffer if I start to be more active in them. I have outlined below the pros and cons of each of the three hobbies, as per my brain.

COSPLAY:
Pros: 
*Great community built around it
*Plenty of experience with craft and people
*Lots of events to attend
*Way to express love and appreciation towards genres I enjoy 

Cons:
*Extremely time consuming
*Very wasteful, in terms of money and product (there are a fair amount of cosers that simply wear an outfit once, and then never do anything with it again, especially when bandwagoning. I can’t easily justify buying 40-80 USD costumes bi-weekly/monthly, only to have them rot in my closet indefinitely. I know selling is an option, but that is pretty hit-or-miss, especially regarding my size (I’m pretty tiny, and in the past my M sizes sold off far quicker than my S or XS)
*Very difficult to avoid drama, even from other communities especially on IG


ART:
Pros: 
*Done it forever, consistently have kept my skill level up through practice
*Already have a great deal of supplies, so not super costly
*Already do it for relaxation, so it would more be like adding additional time to increase what I do

Cons:
*Very slow, especially when doing the type of work I do (extremely detail oriented traditional and digital art)
*While I would like to eventually set up a shop and maintain a social media account for it to share my work,  the irregular scheduling would be difficult to maintain
*Production management, especially of merchandise and being able to maintain a web-shop and make physical excursions to cons

MAKEUP:
Pros:
*Already have plenty of the stuff, since I have dabbled with it in the past and was blessed with a cousin who worked at Sephora
*Very similar to art, its just on your face!
*No limitation in what I can make, very open-ended and flexible

Cons: 
* Needing a very constant camera set-up, which could take a large amount of space in my current dorm room (and would need permission from my roommate as well since it would be in a common room)
* Completely venturing into new territory with filming/photos and editing footage, since showing off makeup is very different from cosplaying or displaying art
* Overall anxiety, since I’m especially afraid of false hope and letting down an audience (this may not be specific to just makeup, but it is the one where I feel it the most. When I say false hope, in high school some ex-friends of mine thought it would be a good idea to buy my at the time art account to boost how I felt. However, I found out about it and it still is something that worries me to this day.)

I’m so sorry if this was too long, or that there are too many rambles/unnecessary information. I guess my biggest point is I really need advice on how to narrow it down so I can stop constantly going back and forth between them and not pick any of them in the end. It’s been going on for a few months, and my SO is also locked in that they can’t really pick one or the other. It’s a huge source of stress for me, and it absolutely shouldn’t be, after all, I want to do it to reduce my stress to begin with !

312,"I'm 23, my boyfriend is 27 and we have been together for almost 5 years. I'm still studying, I will have my final exams in December and he is working as a junior engineer. We live together in a rented apartment and get by on his salary and my scholarships, with a tiny amount of left-over money. 

There are not a lot of day-care facilities around and I plan to stay home with the baby for at least 1 year. There is government support (based on health insurance) for families with new borns that roughly equals my current scholarships, so our income will not decrease.

We didn't plan this baby, I was on the pill, but we are both really excited for it :) We haven't told the news to our parents yet, we already want to have at least a plan, when we talk to them. We have quite a few options, all of them have pros and cons.


A) We stay where we are and raise the baby in our rented apartment. 

Pros: we preserve our independent living style, we don't have to move and don't lose money for quitting the lease ahead of time.
Cons: money will be tight, might even need our parents help financially. His parents live 45 minutes away, mines live 2,5 hours away, so I won't get physical help from my mother, which is a bit sad. I would like her support.


B) We move in to my boyfriend's parent's ""extra house"". It will only add about 10-15 minutes of travel time to his drive to work.

Pros: we can save a lot of money, parental help on his side is really close
Cons: that small town is very isolated, loss of independence, my mother is still very far away, no friends or any kind of company near us, other than his parents, and the house is quite small, only has 1 room


C) We move close to my family and my boyfriend transfers inside the company to a different office. Transferring wouldn't cause any significant trouble for him.

Pros: we are close to my family, my mother can help out, we are not isolated, we both have friends nearby and it's overall a nicer living environment. The baby is even close to his/her only great grandparent, who is in good shape and can also help out.
Cons: the cost of living is much higher there, we would definitely need financial help (unless my boyfriend gets a significant pay raise, which is possible), and my boyfriends family is far away, but he said that if we visit once a month, he is fine with that.


I would like to hear your inputs on our situation. Which one of the options is the best? What are the things I forgot to consider? Anyone, who has got through pregnancy: is it possible for me to finish my final exams in December, being that pregnant?

314,"I’m 19 years old, 20 in a month. My parents recently went through a nasty divorce. My dad moved from California because he got a new girlfriend in Florida after they ended their relationship and my mom constantly berated him about it, so he moved there. My mom would constantly shit talk my dad, and she’s pretty mentally ill, idk in what way though. She is a very loving mother, however.

But, due to this shit talking and constant arguing over whether my dad was a piece of shit, I decided to move in with my dad and his girlfriend. Things were ok for a while, but it got chaotic and we suddenly moved to New York, all my family is here. But now he’s considering moving back to Florida, and I’ve already told him I’m not going there if he does, that I’ll move back to California. 

But I really want to move back there regardless. What I’d like to do is move back there regardless though. My plan is to move in with my mom until she moves to New York, which should be around the beginning of July, save up some money for a used car (I don’t have one), and then move in with friends (they have three fulltime incomes there as it is, one just picked up a second job). 

However, my dad has been bombarding me with what ifs and telling me his experience and he doesn’t think I should be 3000 miles away from my family in case something goes wrong, which a lot can potentially. But the thing is I’m just not happy with my situation right now. I don’t want to be here, I want to start living my own life without the level of support I’ve had from my parents. I want to be independent and do as I please.

So my question is, is my dad right? If he stays here, should I just stay here and continue to accept his support because it’s the safe option? Or should I take the risk and do what I think will make me happiest?",25Apr2019,11

I don't have the time for a job, nobody will hire me for the hours I can do and I know if I did get a job it would affect my school work, I constant;y have essays.

My partner is mentally ill and I have decided to take on the responsibility of the financial burden for our household. Over the past 5 years it has been difficult but given the opportunity I wouldn't change a second of it. We are both firmly committed to each other and my partner has made a lot of really great, noticeable progress during their time with me. We get into fights every now and then which I feel is normal and it's never physical.

I've evaluated it for myself countless times and I want to stick with it despite any financial stability or financial benefit my partner can offer. First and foremost their mental well-being is most important. I have no regrets about the situation but I just don't know how to deal with my family that is constantly trying to get me to put pressure on my partner to get a job.

I know he likes this shirt because he wears it a lot. He had given me another one of his shirts to wear too. As soon as I realized I took it I sent him a photo and made a joke about  stealing it.

Anyway, today we had a date planned so I was gonna drop off his clothes at his house before we go. I washed them, trying to be nice and bring back clean clothes, but I left my chapstick in the pants of something else that I threw in the machine. I did a full wash/dry cycle before I saw the empty chapstick container. There are oily spots all over his shirt now that won’t come out. I’ve tried stain cleaning and dish soap and have come to the conclusion that the shirt is ruined. 

I went to buy him a new one, but the color of his shirt was sold out in his size. I’m getting really anxious about bringing this up to him since we’ve only been dating for a short period. I also feel like a dick because of this. Should I ask him to pick out a new design? I feel like that would be awkward and he might oppose me buying him a new one if hes involved like that. I just really will never get over this if I don’t replace it. Should i buy the same design in a different color? I was thinking of buying him 2 as a “hey sorry i suck” gift.",25Apr2019,1

Do companies still prefer to hire those with college diploma?

I lived with my mom until I was 13 but moved to my father's because my mom and I got into very big fights almost daily and I just couldn't do it anymore. My father is a very complicated person, too. He has no job currently and has had a very upsetting past himself. He's very hateful, thinks the whole world conspires against him and only sees the negative. I'm 20 now, my relationship with my mother has gotten a lot better and we've been talking about me moving back in with her, my little brother and my step dad. All in all I want to do it right away, leave my toxic father behind because living with him is draining me completely, making me angry all the time too and I'm afraid I will end up like him at some point. The only problem is that I have a cat and I love him dearly like he's my own little child, I think pet owners will understand. Sadly I can't take him with me to live at my mom's because my brother is super allergic and it's just not possible. I'm torn. I don't want to leave my cat behind but I also cannot live at my father's place anymore, it's pulling me down and destroying me (to be a little dramatic). I can't afford my own place right now but once I can I would take my cat with me. But I don't know when that will be and just the thought of leaving him behind is breaking my heart.

330,"This is my first ever reddit post, oh well, I went here because I think I need a piece of advice on a thing that's on my nerves and saddens me for exactly a year now. The thing will be a bit long to explain so sit tight ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in summer 2017, a friend of mine (We both live in France.) hosted a guy of our age coming from another country in Central Europe, met by a movement that we're all member from. I thought it'd be cool to join the and give the international guy a tour of my city (Lyon, 2nd biggest in size in France.) that I know pretty well. Seems like that the foreign guy and I got a long each other pretty quickly as we had the same interest and some similar visions on several points. Touring around the city was great and we met a second time in another city near mine for visiting other stuff, he left some days after and we added each other on social medias and that stuff. I was actually at a crossroad in my life ; I just ended high school with a lot of my friends leaving for another cities in the country for studying in university, I was about to discover a whole new thing that was superior education. I was also recovering for a breakup of a relationship that I had to end given she kinda stabbed me in the back, speaking figuratively. So yeah, the guy I made friend with talked a lot during the summer and began to know each other well. Incidentally, I also became close with one of his close friends who was also in the aforementioned movement. He proposed to my friend who hosted him to come over to his place some day but my friend refused so he invited me instead, thinking it'd be great. I left for a week to his place in late october-early november 2017 and it kinda was one of the most memorable holiday weeks. Honestly it was really great,, did a bunch of stuff in a country I've never visited. (Although I always had a huge interest in Central Europe and Balkans, wanna specialize there later.) I still had a bunch load of photos and honestly full of awesome souvenirs. It also kinda helped me to heal completely of my previous relationship even though I was embroiled at the same time in a weird thing with another girl.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, as I pointed out, this week made us really close as he told me, we planned future stuff and it was great. 

Thing is, when you begin to know each other well, you also begin to know about their problems, especially when they began to talk about it and I knew he had some troubles, some pretty nasty phases when he was'nt that good. SO yeah, helping friends is a thing so I've always tried to help (While at the same time being terrified of doing something wrong, I've always been like that. Scared to hurt friends).

Approximatively one year ago, april 2018, he had a difficult phase and I made a mistake. I was a bit too insistent on trying to help and he took it very personally, like he took it as an attack to his feelings and how I didn't care about how he feel soo he blocked me on some social medias and basically wanted to clear out everything. I kinda felt bad for some days with some of my friends asking what was wrong and if they could do something, ironically. Yet I am stubbron and i really don't believe that letting go people at the first difficulty is a thing to do. Some of our common friends tried to talk to him about him without a lot of success, some reported he said not so nice things about me. Really don't blame him, he was feeling bad after all. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end of may, I took the decision to send a letter to his house as it's a bit of unexpected thing to do. Arrived in approximatively 10 days and it worked. He unblocked me and sent a messaye saying that he had a really rough phase and that it was ending but he still needed some time. He told that me that he knew I did nothing wrong (Even though I truly feel I did, hence my apologizes) He apologized for what he said and I was just really happy. Across the summer, we began to talk again a bit, gradually more ad he was healing. In september/early october we agreed on the fact that we had to do a Skype, like before just to end of this stuff. Because they were exams and stuff, we weren't able to find a date saying that we'll find one a little bit later. And this very missed Skype is the reason why we're having another trouble. He also confessed that he was ""feeling weird"" at sending messages, referring to what happened before. I told him several times that it was okay and that it's all over. At the same period of time, I started a relationship with a girl of my uni which is still ongoing, things were going pretty good and we were a solid band of friends, in uni + i was seeing regularly my old friends.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's where there's a problem. Again. He stopped answering for like a week and i got nervous, saying him that he shouldn't feel wird and that it was over. Aaaa don't know why but he took that as me blaming him, like constantly reminding him what he did wrong which was obviously NEVER my intention and so he stopped talking again, this since the beginning of the year. He said to some common friends that he did confront me about it, I hate to say it but it's just false. On the other hand, it's nto like he blocked me like the last time. Nothing of this, we're still friends everywhere, he ""just"" unfollowed me on insta. Woo.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, trying to know what to do now. Obviously, if he was living two streets away, i'd obviously knowk his door a a simpel conversation could clear this thing out. That's the big problem of international friends, distance is a problem. Most of our common friends are kinda on my ""side"" when I mentioned the thing to them even though there's not really a side. I just see this whole thig as a wasting of stubborness, like it could be used on other things much more important. The fact that he ""lied"" about this confrontation and the fact that we're still friends everywhere makes me think that he knows that in himself and i'm just trying to find a way how to resolve this because it's still on my heart. Some people are pushing me, supporting me for keep fighting, my girlfriend being the first to do so. Some few people are telling me to let go and that he's just being an immature prick. I don't believe in that and think that issue is resolvable but I don't know how...  I was thiking to another letter maybe or just sending a message. I didn't take any action since early this year. The thing that makes me keep going is that we were both really willing to forget all the thing that happened + we were close.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's long but every element is important. Right now, i'm just sad because of this but I truly hink that there's an issue. If he wanted to confront me, he'd do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know he's on Reddit, lowkey want he stumbles upon the thread, would acc be funny as he'd recognize the story ahah.

&amp;#x200B;

So.. What's your thoughts, and what to do in your opinion ? I can bring any clarifications if needed.

331,"Growing up, I developed attention seeking tendencies. My childhood wasn't that much worse than other's.

But i am going to have some special guests. Miley Cyrus, Brandon Flowers and maybe more that i'd decide later. Miley is going to sing her best songs including ""We can't stop"", ""Party in the USA"" and finally ""I adore you"" Specifically for me. Why i said specifically? Because besides singing, i have a extra job for her. I want to hug and kiss her while everyone is watching and while she is singing her ""I adore you"". She is going to walk towards me while i am sitting on the right side of the scene like a boss and put her hand on my face while singing ""When you say you love me, know i love you more, when you say you need me, know i need you more, boy i adore youuuuuu, boy i adore youuuuuu!"" and then i'd stand up and cuddle her while she is singing rest of this song. And at the end we would kiss like two real lovely couples and take pictures together. I want her to treat me like a prince and i would treat her like a princess. I've been having a crush on her for so long and i've been waiting a lot for a good situation to make love with her and this is the best thing i can try.

338,"I’m gonna be blunt. I sometimes experience attraction to minors. I know it’s gross, honestly I experience a lot of self loathing and self criticism about this. Please withhold judgement ... I already judge myself plenty .,,

So I’m paranoid around minors. I know I need to be responsible, as well as how to maintain my formal respectful composure and whatnot. But like with a coworker, or online, I still need to interact as a peer, mentor, or friend to teens sometimes. Life happens. But irrational anxious me, I’m paranoid that some kid might like me and what would I do if such a situation arose?

So my question is twofold;



1) What should I do if a teen tries to flirt or make a move on me? Assume for whatever reason removing myself from the situation isn’t simple or immediate, or perhaps not even realistic. 

2) And, the title question. If I’m in a situation where I need to explain to someone that such a relationship is wrong, what are key points I need to explain? I firmly believe that the best way to understand something is to be able to teach it. And it scares me that I have no idea how to teach the immorality of such a relationship. 




(And if it matters that this isn’t just theory... about a year ago I had a gaming friend of about a month who idk how old they were but I could tell they were in high school. They knew I graduated from college. We texted, at first to coordinate gaming but it turned to casual chatting. And after a few weeks, they certainly seemed to be developing romantic feelings for me. Started complementing me a lot, and tried to role play (sfw) like minion/super villain or knight/lord with me. I got really scared and ended up ghosting them (ugh I’m horrid I know) and honestly ever since that situation, how I dealt with it real haunts me and I want to know how to be better.

345,"Hi there reddit , 

&amp;#x200B;

Well let me give you  some background information,   I am a male (25y ) .

 Had a very serious relationship  from 15 till 19 . 

Was about to get married to the girl , then a fight between us broke us up .

\+ had several familly issue's which did not permit me to get ready for a new relationship .

Now 6 years later finally done with most of the familly issue's , i am in a stable position . And i thought to myself hey this bed would be a lot better if there was someone right next to me . A lot less lonely too . 

But i don't have a single clue as how to find myself someone i like , i have ponderd over this for over a year now .

It would have helped if i had some friends who could hook me up , but they dont actually have any female friends.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah how to find someone on my own ? Where should i be looking for ... I seem to be lost at this ,  i found it a lot easier when i was in school . Now as an adult i feel more akward then when i used to be a kid . Have no idea how that happened . I used to be a lot more social too , now it could be said im the definition of an anti social person . Damn ... 

 

PS : Ive tried dating apps , they dont work for me .",25Apr2019,1

348,"I will get done with college in 22 days and the thought of leaving campus for the last time makes me overwhelmingly sad.

The college I went to was a residential one -- so I've spent four years here. As a result, I've many, many memories, both of the place and the people. The past few weeks, I've realized that it is the probably last time I'll walk on this lawn, the last time I'll see this person and the last time I'll hang out in my room with all my friends. 

College has been a place with both happy and painful experiences for me. I've learned and grown so much as a person. I've formed such close friendships with people here -- this means a lot to me because I came to college as a loner. I won't see most of my friends for a while because we're all moving to different cities/countries.

I start work soon and I'm finding it very difficult to imagine what my daily life will be like without these people and this campus. It's been making me very sad.

Every now and then, however, I find myself in a friendship with someone who ends up just using me as a free therapist. They only come to me when they have a problem, dump their stresses on me, only talk about themselves and disappear when things are going well for them. 

One such ""friend"" recently cut me off because even though she kept asking me my opinion on what I should do, then decided she didn't like what I had to say, and got further upset with me for basically saying ""my daughter has just been in hospital, I can't really take on your mental load right now as I have enough on my plate"". If she wants to cut me off for good, this is ok with me because I was getting over her treatment of me.

The trouble is, there's another friendship I have that I can see is heading in the same direction and I am sure that unless I learn to set up boundaries, it'll happen again and again.

everything was kind of okay before this but i do admit some of the things she’s said rubbed me the wrong way. but this week she said a couple things that i just cannot fathom. and i’ve been acting normal but its not something i just want to let past me. i don’t want to be friends with someone like this...

considering she’s a minority herself (trans) i wouldn’t have expected her to say things like this. sure we joke around and talk about memes but i don’t think those things should be said so casually. 

for the n word thing, she was showing me this subreddit with the word in it but in no way did i think it was okay to say it. she literally didnt have to if i could read the damn screen. its such a derogatory and racist term that she shouldn’t be using at all, especially considering she’s white. 

for the cultural appropriation thing, i don’t think it’s something to joke around about. i don’t know if she was even being serious but regardless, it wasn’t okay of her to say that. as the playful teenager i am, i was saying “owo” and she says “stop appropriating my culture” in a joking manner. (insightful to know that she is a furry. i’m DEFINITELY NOT but i just try to ignore it). i say sorry bc wtf am i suppose to do ??? and she goes “whatever, cultural appropriation doesn’t exist anyways” so i’m just sitting there mentally freaking out like ??????did i hear that right???

she did that two days ago and yesterday i acted normal because i wasn’t sure what i should do or if i should do anything at all. but i can’t stop thinking about it and the guilt is eating me alive.  

should i even _try_ to stay friends with her? in all honesty, i don’t think i want to. but i feel guilt tripped to stay in the friendship bc she told me i’m her only irl friend.

Tl;dr I graduate from college in a few weeks and I need advise on ways to properly thank my mentor, letting him know just how impactful he was on my life. I have crippling social anxiety, potentially an undiagnosed disorder so I really do not know what is and what is not acceptable and worthy.

Background (with vagueness): when I started college attempting to achieve a degree in a science field which I thought I loved. The first year and a half of my endeavor was quite catastrophic resulting in me nearly dropping out of college. In addition to this, I lived close enough to the college that I would commute. Unfortunately, my parents were going through a bitter divorce so that took a toll on me. I ended up taking a semester break just for the sake of my mental health. When I returned I started kicking butt in the science field, making it all the way to the top level courses and achieving top marks in some of them, but at the same time I had taken a generally education class with Dr. S (obviously not a real name) and it was the most interesting thing I had ever studied. Despite Dr. S not knowing me well because I didn't speak in class (since I have crippling social anxiety from a potentially undiagnosed social disorder-thanks parent-), he agreed to do an independent study with me. He swiftly became my mentor. I come from a poor family and I can't really afford college so he got me a high paying student job and also gave me tons of scholarships. I ended up changing my major and will graduate with a degree in his field. He has taught me specialized knowledge of the field which sets me well above where I should be.
Basically, I would not have gotten through college (money wise) nor would I have found my calling in my current field if it wasn't for him. He also helped me in a time of severe personal crisis.
Unfortunately I am still awkward around him because I don't know how to not be. I try so hard to not be weird but I always am, so I don't think I have shown just how much his efforts for me have mattered. I really wish I wasn't like that and I have no reason to be but I can't not be. It's the most frustrating thing on the planet when you think the world of people yet they are always at an arms length because of no reason whatsoever except the way your mind reacts to social stimuli. 
Anyways, I want to honor him and thank him properly, how would you go about in in such a situation?
Thank you so much.",25Apr2019,2

Backdrop of this is my wife has a drug problem about 4 years ago that no one knew about. She was controlling finances since more organized.. I had no reason not to trust her..  but she tanked my credit doing stuff behind my back. She then came clean but damage was done. She went to rehab and was clean for 4 years..my credit was slowly getting better. She did unauthorized stuff on my accounts but the only way I could get rid of it is filing police report and I didn’t want her to go to jail.

Fast forward. She apparently relapsed in early February. We paid our rent for February. However, she started pissing around with landlord and making excuses-I had no idea anything was going on until 5 days into the eviction process.  She apparently spent rent money on drugs.She wasn’t on lease only me. I didn’t find out about anything until 5 days into the eviction process. I got sued and then now we are being evicted.

I bought him a fifty dollar gift card and he invited 21 other people to his party(no i'm not joking) and he wanted most people to buy him gift cards too so they did. He lives in a small apartment so we were cramped. The total of the playstation gift cards was 220 dollars. I told him to buy rainbow six siege or Red Dead Redemption 2 so we could play together and have fun because none of my friends have those games necause they play fortnite all day. He refused and spent all the money on V-bucks. I was so disappointed because that's my and other people's money going to waste so he could buy skins and i bought him a 50 dollar gift card so we could play some rainbow six together. My other friend also regretted giving him a 20 dollar gift card and the other party members where cheering for him to buy more V-bucks. I mean i gave him the gift card and it's now his but i was very disappointed and felt my money going to waste and our friendship went down hill since then.

361,"About a month ago I started to like this girl I go to school with. I’ve know her for about 2 and a half years and never felt anything for her. It all started when a mutual friend of ours told me about a dream he had in wich this girl and I were kissing. Before that I’d never see her as someone I would be kissing in the way he described but for days after that was all I tought about when I’d see her, and truth be told I kind of liked the idea. 

Few days after this friend told me about his dream he told her, and her behavior changed around me. Not in a negative way mind you, she got flirty saying things like: “Lets make FRIEND’S NAME dreams come true”. Sometimes she’d get even more sexual in account of some innocent question I’d ask her. I liked the attention, but took her comments as a joke because of one little detail... she has a boyfriend. 

Time went on and she stopped making this type of jokes, I liked everything she had said to me. I told my two closest friends about my feelings for this girl hoping they would help me. Little did I know this would complicate things a lot. Turns out one of these friends, the one who was helping me, likes me. I did not know about this when I asked her for help, didn’t even suspected she did because she too had a boyfriend. I haven’t liked anyone in years, so now that I fell for somebody I was trying to waste as little time as possible. I asked this friend to act as a proxy between me and the girl I liked since they were close friends. Told my friend to ask her if there was any chance she’d leave her boyfriend and be with me instead, and as far as I knew, the answer was no. 

I was happy with this answer, but not for long. That same week my friend asked me to prom and this made me doubt whether she had used that opportunity to steer me away from the girl I liked. 

Few weeks pass and I find myself still thinking about this girl. Missing her when she’s not around and getting very happy whenever I get the chance to be with her. This monday we came back from spring break, in the afternoon this girl, her best friend, my friend and I started talking casually, but things went off in unexpexted ways. The girl I liked started making very sexual gestures towards me and made remarks about how she has liked me all through high school. 

Riding on this high I arrive the next day ready to confess, but she didn’t go to school that day. For the whole day I felt like my chest was being pressed. 

Today I arrived to school, nervious as all hell. We where the only ones on the first period so we start talking, but I don’t confess. About 1 hour later, after second period, I find a chance to talk to her alone, I sit next to her and ask her about what she said about liking me for years and all that. The answer I get: “That was joking”. I feel like a train just ran me over, the girl I liked and that acted as if she liked me just told me it was just a joke. Then she goes on about how she wouldn’t be with me because of my friend that likes me and her best friend who used to like me but now has a boyfriend. Then she said something about her boyfriend, but I don’t know what exactly. At that point I’m ready to pass out and go into a coma. 

I’m still thinking about her, just seeing her makes my day better and being without her makes me miserable. I don’t know if I am an asshole for thinking I still have a chance and wanting to talk to her best friend to see if I do have it, even though she said no. From where I’m standing these friend aren’t so big a deal since her best friend has a boyfriend and my friend has a history of interfering in other people’s relationships that I’m just finding out about. On top of this, another friend of mine whom I trust and has being helping me told me that the girl I like cheated once before on her boyfriend. 

Advice if you will. 

TL;DR: I liked a girl but she won’t date me because one of our mutual friends likes me, her best friend used to like me, and she has a boyfriend. I still like her and feel like an asshole for wanting to try and get with her after all this.",25Apr2019,3
362,"My ex girlfriend and I dated for the last year. 

The relationship finally came to an end and at that time she told me she couldn’t see us moving forward together and told me I should move on. 

I was devastated so I took that advice and I tried to move on by doing what any guy does - hooking up with other girls.

We started talking about two weeks ago and things were working in a positive direction, but when she asked me if I had hooked up with anyone I told her no because I didn’t want to hurt her. This “talkationship” eventually lead into us meeting up this week for dinner and drinks. 

She ended up coming home with me and we hooked up. It was a super positive night from my perspective and before she left she told me “wait for me to come to you.” 

I find out the next night she goes out on a date and hooks up with a random guy she met online and then tells me. When I find this out I’m hurt so bad. It feels like getting cheated on. I try to explain to her how this makes me feel but she says, “well, we aren’t together, we should be able to explore other people.” At that point, I tell her that I hooked up with a few other girls while we weren’t together - I wanted us to have a blank slate. But, looking back on it, I was trying to one up her. 

She goes NUTS. Messages all the girls I recently added on insta and tries to have a witchunt and find out who I hooked up with. She has blocked me on everything and has made me out to be the bad one in this situation. 

Am I in the wrong for not telling her I hooked up with people off the bat? Or, is she wrong for sleeping with a random guy 12 hours after sleeping with me and leading me on? ",25Apr2019,1

I only have my high school diploma and I am not a very social person so a place with customer service would probably not be the best for me although I am willing to try it.

Pros:
- Great pay and benefits ($14/hour plus an attendance bonus so they pay around $17/ hour and more for overtime. I end up taking home around $600 a week average)
- Free health clinic
- Coworkers are not too rude they keep to themselves like I do
- Not very strict
- Decent work environment
- Decent vacation time

Cons: 
- It is about 45 min minutes to an hour away from where I live depending on traffic
- Long hours (6 am - 4:30) most days
- I have to wake up at around 4 am and I'm usually home around 6 pm with a bedtime of around 8 - 8:30 pm

- Little opportunity for advancement.

364,"Summary: Company has selected me for an internship, was told to expect the formal offer by yesterday, how long should I wait before inquiring about it?

Excuse me for being silly over a scenario that’ll probably resolve itself today. I’m just in unfamiliar territory, and this is something I’ve worked very hard for.

Company has offered me an internship with them starting in a little less than a month. Company is definitely real, and the informal offer has been made in good faith by multiple people after successful interviews, and we’ve discussed things like available benefits and approximate salary. All that’s left is the paperwork, which I was told to expect yesterday but I have not received.

I know ‘yesterday’ doesn’t sound like a very long time ago, but understand that the whole interview process has been moving at breakneck speed (initial screening to final selection happened entirely within the timeframe of last week). That said, I was given the timeframe on receiving the offer only two days ago, and some previous interactions with Company have happened ‘late’ already so this isn’t completely out of the ordinary.

My concerns are these: First, because of the accelerated time table from the whole process I believe the formal offer will likely also have a short window of time in which I need to accept or decline. If for some reason they think I have received the offer (but haven’t), I don’t want to say silent and have the offer expire. Second, I want to get final details on salary and start of employment date so that I can make relocation arrangements ASAP. While I have an idea what my pay will be, I like to work with actual numbers. Third, my experience with things is that nothing is truly done until it’s done, so while the informal offers indicate I have the job, I know I don’t really have the job until I accept the official offer and I suppose I’m being impatient because I like to get important things finalized.

My question is, should I send an email to one of my contacts at Company about the status of the offer, and if so how long past the expected date should I wait before doing so?",25Apr2019,1
365,"In a couple of days i need to make the decision of where I want to go to study university, somewhere abroad, and I am conflicted between what I think I want and what my father thinks is best for me.

 **backstory** (important):  I was born and used to live in Russia and I studied in a state school where my education was fully in Russian. I had to move because of my moms work which required her to move to another country. My family and i moved there and we encountered a problem. The country didn't have any Russian schools and i didn't speak the national language. My parents decided that I should go to an English school. At the time i didnt know english at all. Skipping a couple years forward we moved again and I am living different country. I thankfully learned English and I am 18 years old soon about to finish my last grade of high school. My parents have divorced and my dad is living back in Russia alone and I am living with my mom. 

I never really took my education seriously and I was never really good at school overall. I am generally a very lazy person and when I moved again to a new country  and after the divorce of my parents (which made me feel depressed) I gradually became more and more unmotivated to do schoolwork.  I wouldn't say I am a stupid person but school work never interested me. This lead me to get poor grades and right now I barely getting a high school diploma.

**Making the decision**: 

I have applied to a couple of university in Netherlands and an American university in Russia (not as bad as it sounds). The studies in Netherlands cost A LOT and the one in Russia compared to those is very cheap. The university in the Netherlands offers the course i want and the one in Russia doesn't.  My father wants me to go to an American university back in Russia where he lives. He is trying to persuade me to go there for different reasons that he is constantly telling me. He tells me that I am not really a school type of person and there isn't a point for me to go to a university far from my parents if I am not gonna learn. He isn't judging me for it and thinks that some people are good at school some aren't (doesn't mean they wont succeed in life). He tells me its gonna be a big waste of money and I should go to uni where studies wont be as difficult for me and somebody will be there to ""take care of me"". 

But I dont want to go to that university. I want to study in the Netherlands for different reasons. I think if i move and live alone and take care of myself it will be a clean start for me to start new and start learning. I feel like if I go study there I am gonna become independent and responsible for my own studies and see the importance of it. But i am conflicted because I don't want my parents to spend so much money for nothing if I wont study or even drop out. I am scared that I have had 12 years to start new and even moving to different countries when I moved with parents was also an opportunity but i never used it. 

Should I move in with my dad and go to that university or move to Netherlands and study alone? please help.

**P.S**. Can i have advice other than its your decision to make not your parents'. I value my parents' opinion because i feel like they have had expirienced in life and they wouldn't advice bad things for me.

We work together and I’ve had feelings for him for quite a while now. I’m not going to say I’m in love or anything but I do feel strongly for him. He messages me frequently (he’s always the initiator) which makes it hard to distance myself. I feel as though he’s dropped a few flirty hints here and there which encouraged me to actually tell him how I was feeling... big mistake. It didn’t go as planned and I pretty much got shut down. He didn’t say why, all he did was apologise for the mixed signals he’s been giving me. WTH?! He still continues to message me and we have great conversations all the time. I don’t know how to get over this guy. It genuinely sucks.

372,"PREFACE: I realize that I come of as a spoiled, privileged, ungrateful manchild. I want to work to change that, downvote and move on if it bothers you, no need to remind me. Secondly, I'm not going to go to a psychiatrist/psychologist/therapist and I'm certainly not going to take antidepressants or other so called ""medications"". If you disagree that's fine but **this is not up for debate.** Downvote and move on.       

I'll start with my life story. I wrote it because I thought reviewing my personal history might help me and since it's already typed out I might as well add it to my post. It's probably too long and not written super well so feel free to skip to the section labeled **Now**. The most relevant parts are summarized later on anyway. Also my autobiographical memory is very poor so the ages and timespans are all approximate.           

**Childhood**
I was born in Europe and I came to America with my family when I was ~10. I hold citizenship in one of the Schengen zone countries and I have a green card. I came here with my mom, dad, and sister. They might as well be the only family I have since I haven't kept in touch with my other relatives. We immigrated because my dad[60M] got a job offer, he has worked for the same company ever since. He enjoys his career and makes very good money. My mother on the other hand has never bothered to look for work, improve her English, get a driver's license, or assimilate in any other way. I should add that they're married but before moving to America they did not live together and my sister[27F] and I would only get to see our father on the weekends. In school I did well in math, science, and history (or social studies as it was called). I did poorly in English (the class, I picked up the language quickly), and arts/creative stuff. I never played any sports and until I was ~20 I was fat and weak. My parents always pushed us to do well in school and I was expected to go to college and then graduate school and do research in some type of hard science, push the cutting edge etc. I went along with it to avoid punishment. My sister does this sort of work now. I never had much of a social life as a kid. My mother discouraged me from making friends, saying that only family counts. I wasn't allowed to go outside by myself or to have people over until I was 13 or 14. This also went on in the old country but to a much bigger extent since I lived full time with my mother and my dad didn't get to have a say in the house rules. I think this has stunted my ability to function in society and to relate to people. I didn't get along with my sister but now as adults we're on good terms with each other. I didn't date in school, didn't got to dances or to prom. I spent my time on the internet, playing video games, in front of the TV, and I used to read voraciously. In high school I played WOW a lot. Essentially all of my recreation was in the form of consuming content. I didn't have a real friend until high school.           

**College**
After graduating high school (got my diploma but didn't go to the graduation ceremony) I took one semester off to get a job in order to have spending money in college. At work I met a guy who would later become my best friend (I'll call him M). I then quit work and began taking classes at a community college. The plan was to eventually transfer to a 4 year college and get a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I didn't have much interest in engineering but it pays well and my father does that sort of work so I thought why not. This turned out about as well as you might expect. When I was 20 I attempted suicide. There was a lot of blood involved and I got 5150'd and 5250'd. After being released from the medical hospital I was sent to a mental hospital for 2 weeks. I told the shrink what she wanted to hear and took antidepressants so that they'd release me quicker. I think psychiatry is basically a scam and this experience has done nothing to change that opinion. I hated the doctors and shrinks and losing my freedom. On the other hand the nurses and orderlies/guards were all very nice to me and I hold no ill will towards them, I want to make that clear. In retrospect getting butthurt like that was rather childish, it was only 2 weeks and it's not like it was a real prison. It wasn't all bad, the food was OK and the painkillers, sleeping pills, and Klonopin they handed out were fucking great. I talked to the other crazies a lot since there wasn't much else to do. The ones I hung out with were caring and interesting people, I wish I had met them under better circumstances. I had a crush on one of the crazies, she was 10 years older than me and looked gorgeous. I think she liked me back, at any rate she flirted with me and we talked for hours every day. It was the first time a girl showed interest in me that way. I met up with her a couple of times after we were released. We didn't fuck or anything since she was still married. I looked her up last year, she died in a car accident. I still keep her picture. I didn't go to therapy after being released and I flushed my antidepressants down the toilet (got the brain zaps for a few days lol). Those two weeks were the only time I've spent living away from home. Just typing out that last sentence makes me feel disgusted with myself. The fact that in a weird way I look back fondly on that time makes me even more disgusted.           

**After College**
I attended one more semester of college and then dropped out. My parents and sister were a lot nicer to me after my suicide attempt, I think they felt sorry for me. Everyone shouted less at each other. I then got in touch with M again. We quickly became good friends, him and his wife L. Their whole social circle sort of adopted me. We partied a lot, they bought me booze when I was l under 21 and let me sleep it off on their couch. I began to drink every day and do other things I do not need to discuss in a public forum. I talked a lot about being suicidal and it worried M and L. They'd sometimes nag me not to drink half a liter of vodka a day, not to smoke as many cigarettes and to eat better and to take care of my health. It was annoying but also made me happy because it meant they cared. So I started eating better and began lifting weights and doing calisthenics. For the first time in my life I was happyish with how I looked. I started dressing better, paid attention to my appearance, etc. I think my friends were proud of me too. Sometimes I felt M and L were patronizing towards me and I resented that somewhat but now that I'm older I realize that it was not unwarranted. After all they had their lives more or less on track and I was still living at home, working a shitty retail job, aimless. I met a girl at work when I was 21, she was my first real girlfriend. I lost my virginity to her. The ""relationship"" lasted about 3 weeks. Later I had a fuckbuddy but that didn't last long either.          

When I was ~23 I entered my first period of NEETdom. I quit going to work and slowly withdrew from social activities. I didn't answer my phone or even leave my room. I stopped showering, playing video games, exercising. I slept a lot and during my waking hours I drank and laid in bed. After a ~month of no contact M and L showed up at my house to check up on me. My dad answered the door and they talked to him first before he got me. I literally asked M if he thought I was dead and he said yes. We talked for a while and then they left. Afterwards my father asked me what that was about and I talked to him for a while. He said stuff like there's a world outside this house and that people care are about me. This made me feel ashamed and motivated me to unfuck myself. I significantly cut down my drinking, started showering and exercising and began looking for work in earnest. I started socializing again and found a new job. That time around I was NEET for ~5 months.          

So I worked my new job, it wasn't great but it wasn't retail and I continued to hang out with my social group. This went on for about a year. I grew distant from M and L, they finished college and began their careers and their life was becoming so different from mine. I probably resented their relative success. I ended up ghosting them after a minor disagreement. I don't even remember what it was about it was that petty. They tried to get in touch with me on social media, I deleted my accounts and stopped answering texts. Ghosting them might be the worst mistake I've ever made. I had nightmares for a year afterwards about M and L, in which they'd ask why I abandoned them like that.               

A few months later I quit my job, on good terms. I had this idea that I'd go into ""cocoon mode"", teach myself programming and work on myself in general. That worked for like a month. I began declining again, but I had free time and savings plus what I made on crypto so I thought maybe a road trip would help me snap out of this. It was nice, I drove around California and Nevada for 10 days but when I came home it didn't help and I descended into NEEThood again. And then my car broke down to where it wasn't worth fixing so that just increased how much I stayed indoors doing nothing. That's how I've been ~~living~~existing for the past 3 years.                  

**Now**
Which brings us to today. My 28th birthday was a few days ago. For my birthday I bought myself one of those ratcheting tie down straps and decided to strangle myself to death. Half way through I changed my mind and hit the ratchet release. I wasn't scared and I didn't see ""the light"" or anything like that, I simply decided it's not my time to go just yet. I felt so alive for the next few hours, more alive than I've felt in years. I'm missing out on so much and it's my own fault. I want to feel alive every day. I want to unfuck myself live and not just exist. That's why I'm asking you guys for help.  
       
I think the best best way to go about this is to break up the next part of the post into 3 sections: what my life is like right now, what I want to change, and ideas I have on how to change it. I welcome any advice and/or criticism except for the two things I mentioned in the preface. Otherwise I'm open to basically anything.          
           
**My Life Now**
minuses:
* I haven't worked in ~3 years
* I have no work references any more
* I don't have a single friend or acquaintance, online or off
* I don't speak to anyone except for my dad, my sister when she visits sometimes, and store clerks
* When my father tells me to get groceries I have like a pattern of stores in town I go to so as to avoid becoming a ""regular"" anywhere 
* I don't have any social media accounts, not even reddit (except for this one of course). Don't even have discord.
* My days consist of refreshing the same 4 websites, porn, laying in bed, and doing some housework
* I sleep too much and at weird hours
* I don't read books, play vidya, or even watch movies anymore
* I have no real hobbies
* I eat too much and I'm fat. I haven't lost my muscles so I have a gut and bitch tits with muscular arms, legs, and traps combined with the stereotypical Slav potato head. I must look ridiculous.
* My hygiene has declined, I still brush my teeth daily but I only shower and shave my head and face like once or twice a week
* I hardly ever work out and I don't go hiking anymore
* All this free time is making me constantly think about idiotic shit that has no bearing on my life, just wasted thoughts going back and forth in my head
* I'm getting the feeling that all of the stuff I just listed is making me stupider and is making my attention span shorter and shorter. I can't exactly prove it but it sure seems like it's happening.
* I've lost my curiosity
* Self improvement efforts peter out after 2-3 days.
* I'm worried my social skills have atrophied to where people will think I'm a creepy autist if I open my mouth
* The idea that life is passing me by is painful
* I'm a parasite
pluses:
* I drink very little now and I've quit smoking
* My dad says I'm a good cook, I make dinner and we eat together almost every day.
* I don't have a criminal record and my driving record is clean
* I have a strong desire to improve right now, which is something
* I still listen to music      

**Changes I Want to Make**
* I need to move out. Firstly because I don't want to be a burden on my father anymore, I feel tremendous guilt and shame about this. Secondly because I'm pushing 30 and I've never lived alone or even with roommates and that's insane. Thirdly, what woman would want to have sex with me if I live at home at my age.
* I need to earn money
* I want to fuck something other than my left hand. Right now I just want sex but a committed relationship is something I'd like to try in the future. I've never loved anyone and I think it would be good to see what it's like at some point or if I'm even capable of love.
* Even more than the previous point I crave some sort of social interaction. Doesn't even have to be face to face. I've always been very introverted but as I got older I realized I can't function totally alone. I need to have at least one acquaintance.
* I need some kind of hobby or some sort of self improvement type of thing             
           
**Ideas &amp; Concerns**
* I live in one of the highest Cost of Living counties in (one of?) the highest CoL state in the country. So to move out, even with roommates, is simply not realistic. I'd have to move to a different part of the country or back to Europe. I'm ok with that though, but first I'd have to save up for a while. There's nothing tying me down here. I'm also ok with moving back to Europe permanently and giving up my green card. I'm not happy here anyways. People say that moving away from your demons doesn't solve them and that's true but I also think the opposite is true; moving away won't make them worse either.
* How do I even get a job with no references and such a big gap in my work history? Do temp agencies care about that sort of thing? I know that I'm a spoiled brat with rich parents but I'm physically strong and manual labor doesn't bother me at all I've done it before, it's better than interacting with the public at least. So suggestions for manual work are welcome. Also in a few months the fire season starts and like half the state is going to burn down so there will probably be lot's of demolition and cleanup work. Those people don't care about a sketchy work history, they probably don't even do interviews right?
* So I actually have taught myself some programming. I'm pretty good at Python and I know some JS. The problem is that I'm self taught, and on top of it I study on and off, so my knowledge is patchy. What I mean is that I understand some things in great detail and I'm totally ignorant of others. It would be good to learn in a structured way. I was thinking about attending a coding boot camp but they seem sort of gimmicky. Would anyone with experience going to one like to share their opinion? Also is nearly 30 too old to get into this industry?
* I need a car to do any of the above but I think I could scrape together money for a cheap beater. I know how to do basic repairs and preventative maintenance and I have tools so it doesn't even need to be in that good of a shape. Well more like I can formulate very good google queries and follow the instructions correctly.          
         
So yeah, those are the things I've identified that need to change in my life. I'm not just interested in your thoughts on how to do this. I'd also like to hear what you guys think I should change in my life. Particularly welcome is advice on how to break mental inertia. Again I welcome any advice except I'm never going to go to a shrink. Thanks for reading my textwall.

373,"Obviously this is a dangerous topic to bring up to a SO, but it's gotten pretty bad. Her doctor told her if she didn't watch what she ate and didn't start being more active, she would end up needing to get her stomach reduced in order for her to lose weight (along with other health issues). She is constantly short of breath, and I know it's driving her to be sad. 

I've tried to avoid this topic for long enough but she's not getting any better and I want to help. She eats pretty bad, she doesn't get a lot of activity through the week, and she will constantly make excuses as to why she doesn't need to lose weight.

375,"Sup Reddit, 20yr old college student struggling to help a life long friend. I'll call him C. 

&amp;#x200B;

His parents are Vietnamese and are very traditional. Regardless, they have shown me nothing but kindness and welcomed me in their home to play with my friend C. We've known each other and their families since 2005. His parents own a store and therefore were not home much. During their long days, lots of the neighborhood kids would come over to his house, as his parents left money for him and his older brother who I will refer to as T. We would play video games and order pizza all day after school and never got into arguments. We'd play outside with all the other kids and it was real fun.   


T although, just seemed to severely mistreat his younger brother C. I can remember times where T would lock C out of the house and then get the hose and spray him with water, even on cold days. Me and C would sometimes grab some of his toys and just sword fight. His toys were in his closet, and we therefore had to go in there often. I vividly remember T locking us into the closet, and C crying hysterically. Considering he lived with this bully, and I was just  a passerby, I didn't care much. Being as young as I was, I didn't understand what any of this meant. As we began growing up, I distanced myself from T though. Not many of the other neighborhood kids associated with him, as he wasn't very kind to us. He was openly gay and told me that since we first met. Living in the suburbs of NYC, I was unfazed. That detail will be important later.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about 2012. T now moves into the apartment downstairs apartment of the villas we all live in. So C and the parents live in the upstairs portion of the house, while T lives in the downstairs. T adopts a Shiba while the meme is fresh and new. I've taken care of her when their family was away, screenshot with my gross typing back then. 

[https://i.imgur.com/hjjytRt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hjjytRt.jpg) 

Around this time, I get accepted into a different high school than C so we don't hang out as much, just occasionally see each other around the neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2019. T now has his boyfriend move into the downstairs apartment. The real problem is here, where T is getting upset that Lucy is shedding over the floor and is old. She no longer can walk straight as she has a literal imbalance, I'm not sure what it's called but she cannot walk in a straight line properly. T is mad that the dog is old and refuses to walk nor feed her. Therefore C is taking care of the dog more than he is, walking her many times a day. T abuses the dog verbally often and sometimes physically. T wants to throw the dog out or have her put down because she is not as energetic anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

They argue over what should be done with the dog and cannot come to an agreement, therefore T decides to cut C off. C's gaming PC and PS4 (with games C paid for) are in the downstairs portion of the house. T also changed their Netflix/Hulu passwords. C tries to talk to the parents about all of this but, the very traditional parents they are, side with the older brother, T. T convinces the parents that C needs to be taught a lesson and to man up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to highlight that T is 25 years old, out of college with a $90K salary, while his boyfriend makes $50K. C is 2 years younger than me (18yrs old) and comes to my D&amp;D sessions with eyes full of tears. I hate seeing him like that and it's breaking my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only advice I could give him was tell the parents about the two leeches living downstairs who are homosexual, prompting to have him kicked out. I said this purely out of spite and had no other helpful words, other than that he can chill here at my house as much as he wants. These parents are very traditional and believe family matters are to not be discussed outside of the home. This is what enables T to abuse him mentally to this day.

378,"*throwaway*


I had have a high number of sexual partners but not because I truly wanted.  The problem has been this:

-I met guy.  

-Guy and me go out for a few hours/days/weeks.

-Have sex eventually.  

-Get ghosted.  

I had made sure to fix any issue with myself that could be an issue (hygiene, skill, grooming, sexy talk, etc) over and over but it still happening. I'm not clingy or needy.  I've only had repeated sex with thirteen people (including my past two husbands) in total through the 14 years I've been sexually active (I'm now 31).  I want to have better success at retaining sex partners.  Playing the waiting game is hit or miss: I can have sex within a few hours and have that person being a repeat sex partner or wait weeks and get ghosted.  Second, my physique has nothing to do with it either: I've been both skinny and chubby and they do it regardless how I look.

383,"I'm a student in college, and I work about 30 hours a week at a food service job to pay bills while I'm taking classes. Since the store is on campus, it's licensed by a different company, and operates differently. (One such difference is lower pay.)

Long story short, I've been there for a couple years and have been promoted up to a lead. I'm on good terms with the store manager and have really busted my ass for this store. Me and one other person are the only night shift leads, and they're about to quit. Simultaneously, two shift leads have quit at the off campus store that enjoys better benefits.

385,"Name a better morning then waking up to a text about your dad having an affair with a girl for months while never telling her he was married. This just happened to me, and she sent screenshots for proof and a video of him going into her house. She also showed me his ""tango"" account which, as I just learned, is a dating website.

&amp;#x200B;

She asked me to tell my step mom (who by the way is a awesome stepmom even when we have bad moments), as her original intention was to tell my stepmom herself but I told her I felt uncomfortable with that and me and my brother will handle it. That was a lie and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that she understands and that she trusts us to tell her and that my stepmom can message her if she chooses to, but what do I do? My dad gets pretty aggressive when he's ticked and I feel I'm in an awkward situation.

&amp;#x200B;

If I tell my stepmom, I fear my dad will hate me for telling her and feel betrayed of some sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

If I tell my dad, my stepmom will never know of their affair but if she does, she'll probably feel hurt that me and my brother lied to her after everything she's done.

My brother recommends we just do nothing and no one knows and we just move on, but I can't see that working. She has the right to know since he's been having an emotional and sexual affair for months behind her back. What do I do? Who should I tell if anyone, how do I handle this? I'm currently at school right now and I feel stressed about this. My step mom helped me get into the college I wanted and is extremely supportive of my hobbies, and even helped my brother go from F's in school to B's and A's.

386,"So nearly a year ago, I met this guy on r/GamerPals . We started talking on discord, got pretty close and i found out he actually lives in the same town. We met up and hung out a few times and I thought things may have been kind of going somewhere ykno? 

 Around mid January, I stopped hearing from him. He was still online on Discord, I still saw him in games of League occasionally, I just didn't get any responses to my messages. This went on for about a month and eventually I just messaged him and said ykno like ""Ok, since I guess you're done being friends with me and don't want me around anymore and you won't even block me, I'm just going to block you now so I wont be tempted to message you again pointlessly"" He still had other ways to contact me ofc, but to me it was just really upsetting that it needed to resort to that  I guess.  


About 3 days after i sent the message, i got a text from him saying like ""Hey, it wasn't anything personal, i wasnt upset or mad with you, i just got super busy with school and had to take time offline to catch up"" which I understand. He made sure to clarify that I hadn't done anything wrong and it wasn't my fault. I was still kind of on the fence at this point cuz ykno i really like this kid and i wanted to stay friends and be around him, but i dont know how to react if this sort of thing were to happen again or how im supposed to feel with it even happening in the first place.

Either way, i ""forgave"" him and we were chill again. Talked nearly every day, hung out a few more times, and it was super fun and there were some things happening that made me think like ""oh this may not be platonic"" ykno? Maybe i was just getting my hopes up and he's like that with everyone but? i digress. about 3 weeks passed of us talking and once again, he's awol. The last i heard from him was March 19th, and he's been on ""do not disturb"" on discord since then. I just dont know now.. its making me question everything i thought about what was happening and I dont know what to feel now. like, whether he even liked me in the first place, what im supposed to do if i *do* hear back from him at this point. I still really like him I think, but i cant deal with this inconsistency with no warning. I think I'm a generally understanding person and if he came to me and said ykno like ""hey im going to be busy with school, i wont be able to talk much for a month"" then id just be like yeah ofc i understand, take your time ykno?   


All in all, im just really confused with this situation and need someone to talk to about it ;w; what do i doooo",25Apr2019,1
387,"So I recently started a new job, but I missed the past 3 days as I had some sort of stomach bug and spent the majority of the time in the bathroom. To return to work, they require a doctor’s note. The only problem is that my health insurance with them doesn’t start until June, and I’m currently uninsured so I can’t just go see a doctor and attempt to get a note. I also have $2.07 in my bank account at the moment, and payday isn’t until next Friday (May 3rd) so I cant afford to go to the walk in clinics at CVS or Walgreens. I’m not sure exactly where to go or what to do, but if I miss more than 3 days already I’m afraid I’ll end up losing this job, but they won’t let me back without a slip from a doctor.

391,"Hi, 
I am currently at a stage in my life where I’m feeling extremely lost and confused. I feel like I’m wandering through my life currently with no real purpose at all. I’m studying commerce at university, which I believed I always wanted to do however, I hold neutral feelings for it, I simply feel no passion or motivation to it. I play sport, I love this sport but after a few setbacks I’m currently distancing myself for it and losing my love for that, which was one of my main identities. I don’t know how to find what I love doing, what my passion is life is. In high school I had that, I was my sport team captain, I enjoyed my school work. But now I enjoy neither, I feel as if I’m wandering with no purpose, and as I’m doing that I’m burning up precious years of my youth. I work a lot, I’m saving up a lot of money, yet I have nothing I want to do with the money, I would love to travel, but I don’t know where, I don’t have any interests where. The only thing that’s currently making me happy and passionate is the female in my life and my friends and social network. 

I don’t like doing nothing, it’s not me and hasn’t been, however at the moment that’s all I feel I can do, as I have nothing else to do. 

I am seeking some guidance in what I can do to manage this, how I can possibly find what I’m into.

393,"For background I have my bachelors in English literature and I’m about to complete my masters in Information/Lib Science. I’m honestly giving up on the librarian career. I have been rejected from several associate jobs and most of the feedback is “well your interview was perfect but we went with someone else.” Later on i encounter the assistant and they’re rude af, can’t locate a resource, barely engage with me as a patron...

But librarianship was never my ultimate passion. I think I’d really like to teach creative writing or literature classes. There’s several universities within a 50 mile radius of me hiring. If I want to apply, what should I prepare? 

I haven’t ever been published except for two poems in my alma mater’s annual journals. I know I’d have to probably expect to have a lesson plan or something like that ready? Would they be looking for research published as well? Thanks all, sorry for the ignorance.",25Apr2019,0
394,"So to start things off, I've always relied on school as a way to make friends. I think a lot of people use school/college and their jobs as a way to make friends, which isn't a bad thing; it actually makes being social a lot easier. But because of that, I'm not really sure what to do in this new situation I'm going to be in in less than two months.
At the moment, I'm on exchange in another country, and my family in the U.S. (where I actually live) will be moving in a month and a half before I return to them. About a week or two after they've moved, I'll be scheduled to fly back to the U.S. and get settled in our new place in a city many hours away from our previous home. 
I've already graduated high school (this exchange year was supposed to be my gap year), but for messy personal reasons I couldn't apply to any colleges. As shitty as I feel about that, I decided I'll just get a job and work until I can apply to the colleges in and around my new city.
Besides working, I know I'll really wanna try to make friends in my new city, but I'm not really sure how. Usually I would just leave it to getting to know people in college, but as I'm not going yet I can't rely on college. Another place I thought of that I could meet people were bars or clubs, so I checked online to see if adults under 21 are allowed in as long as they don't drink, but most don't allow it.
The only other thing I can think of is going to parks or other public places and just waiting for the perfect situation to talk to someone, but since I'm awkward and not charismatic I didn't know if I could pull that off. I don't want to become ""that creepy lady that strikes up awkward conversations with strangers"" or strike up a conversation with the wrong stranger and get kidnapped or something. 
I know I could just wait until I've got a job and then make friends with my co-workers, but is there anything more I can do? I get very anxious around people I don't know, so I usually don't actively seek out strangers to get to know them, but I'm willing to try to put my anxieties aside if there's a way I could possibly make friends before college that are outside of a work environment. If any of you can see an obvious way I could make friends that I didn't list, then that's just more confirmation to how clueless I am on what to do here. If any of you have advice on places I could go to or ways to approach people/things to say to people or anything else please let me know! Or is it possible this is a pointless attempt and I should just wait until college? 


TLDR: I'm moving to a new city. I already finished high school, but I can't attend college yet. What are ways I can make new friends before being able to do so in college?",25Apr2019,1
395,"I swear I'm not generally such a piece of shit. I'm 36 and happily married, I worked for 3 years as a programmer for a company in another state, and when my wife got a job as a doctor where we currently are, we moved here and my company was good enough to let me continue working remotely. Things went fine for the first 8 months or so. I don't know why I'm doing this, or why now, but for the past month I flat out haven't worked. I haven't gotten anything done or accomplished anything. Every day, I spend the entire day surfing the internet, watching videos, playing video games, and masturbating. I got myself to stop playing games only by uninstalling them all, but I'm still wasting all my time. The things I do get done every day is make my wife breakfast, take her to work, do laundry/housework stuff, prep dinner, go pick up my wife from work, finish dinner, do dishes, and give her a massage. I do all this because she's doing her internal medicine residency and her job is just hell. It's 12-13 hours a day, 6 days a week, of her being so busy she doesn't have time to get a drink of water. She's exhausted every single day, and even with my support, is getting burned out. From her point of view I'm a great husband. I've hidden from her how I'm wasting every day and I'm afraid to tell her. I know I'm certain to get myself fired at this rate. I'm sabotaging our life and I don't know why.

I don't know exactly what advice I'm looking for. Anything you think will help me get back to work, assuming you're kind enough to want me to get back to work. I deserve to lose my job at this point. I've been taking money without working, which is stealing. That's it. Please give me any advice you have. Thanks.",25Apr2019,18
396,"This may seems totally random but it is a question I struggle with everyday. When horrific events happen, like what happened in Sri Lanka, I always feel helpless. I have such a comfortable life, what can I do to help? I’ve donated money before (like to relief funds), but feel like that isn’t enough. I especially feel this way because I live in the United States and am overwhelmed and saddened by the actions of our government (children of asylum seekers are in detainment centers.) I vote, but don’t think that really makes a difference. And I teach so I feel like I am able to make some positive impact in my community. However, I think of this quote a lot  “The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing.” I don’t want to be asked by my children and grandchildren why I just did nothing when so many terrible things were happening right in my own country, in my own city. And I don’t want to be so caught up in my own life.

I've been holding this problem in for a while, but I don't have any friends in school that I like, not in a picky way, I'm just never able to relate to anyone.

Sure I have a friend group and I talk to people and socialise, and I get called names by those more popular than me. I'm not an outcast, but those who give me the time of day are just not at all like me.

 I hate to say this, but it's the truth, almost all of the people in my year in school just aren't as mature as me, and I hope that I don't sound like someone off of r/iamverysmart . If I do I'm sorry.

I wouldn't be too bothered if it wasn't for how disabling it is, I can't have a genuine conversation with anyone not within my immediate friend group, there's just this wall of insincerity.

I'm having a bit of trouble at the moment. I recently moved from my fiancè's home country back to my home country to find a decent job so we can get married. 

Recently (earlier this month) my fiancè got added on Facebook by a very, very old school friend (weirdo). The friend has been messaging her, telling how much he likes her, how beautiful she is etc. Fiancè told the old friend that she is in a relationship, will be joining me in my country after I get a job and is not interested. He ignored all of that and continued to message her, trying to find out her address (her mum has a restaurant so he wanted to find her address from that). Fiancè went one further and told him she is already married. He continued to message her weird, pseudo-romantic things so she blocked him.

All seemed done and dusted until today when he posted a picture of my fiancè on *his* Facebook page, saying how much he loves her and how he's loved her for years etc: over the top, creepy obsession stuff. All this despite her blocking him- fiancè found out after her friend informed her of what was posted and sent her a screenshot. 

On top of that, there's a multitude of highly explicit, sexual comments the weirdo's friends have posted on my fiancè's picture- this has upset us both. 

She worried. I'm worried. We're concerned this is going to develop into something bad, if it hasn't already. I'm not there to look after her so I'm feeling quite shit, not fulfilling my duty has her partner. And she's worried about the guy following her.

Is there anything I can do to help? Or anything she can do?

Thanks again guys.",25Apr2019,2

405,"I am currently studying Japanese at a university in my home country.  I recently found out about the MEXT scholarship which the Japanese government offers. There are a few requirements and I do meet all of them. They actually offer two types of scholarships.

First scholarship:

\- Study for five years

\- You get to choose your studies, it does not have to be about Japanese specifically

\- You will be enrolled in an intensive course to learn Japanese, which is needed for your future studies in Japan

(To my knowledge, nothing stops me from applying even if I am already a student)

&amp;#x200B;

Second scholarship:

\- You have to be a Japanologist

\- You study for a year

\- You need to know enough Japanese in order to take their classes

\- The studies are meant improve your knowledge of Japanese and Japan's culture

&amp;#x200B;

The first scholarship sounds very, very tempting, but 5 years in a foreign country with no friends or family is scary to think about. I would need to learn to be independent, which will probably be difficult considering I've lived with my parents all my life. That might even be considered a bonus, I NEED to learn to be independent and throwing myself in such a situation would surely help in that goal. Also, I would need to quit my current university in which I've been studying for two years.

The second scholarship is good, but a bit less tempting for me. One is the fact that I doubt my Japanese is good enough yet which would impede my chances to be accepted in the first place (I could take it next year when my Japanese gets better), I would only study about things related to Japan which might be good for my goal to learn Japanese in the first place, but after taking some elective classes from the department of General Linguistics, I realised that I do not just want to be a Japanologist. I love going deep in languages, learning about morphology, syntax, phonology...all of that just fascinates me. So to recap.

First scholarship: I get to study what interests me the most; It is for five years, which I find very scary, but it might end up being good for me; I would need to quit my current university. Which I should mention, I am not quite happy with, but that is a whole other story.

Second scholarship: I get to study about Japan only which may interest me but not as much as linguistics in general; I get to study for a year which is significantly less scary.",25Apr2019,13

413,"Tl;dr at the bottom in case people don't want to read through.

&amp;#x200B;

So I work at a local convenience store. It's not permanent (I'm going to be doing my Masters next year and hope to continue up a career path I've always dreamed of), but at the same time, I want to get a good reference since it's my first full-time job.

I work nights and I get along with everyone bar one person, whom I'll call ""J"" just to make things easier. Now J is a lot older than me, has been working at the company for 15 years but is also the same ""rank"" as for me. He's not my boss, he's not in charge of the shift, he is literally doing the exact same job as me. J is kinda known for being (for lack of a better word) an ass. He's taunted everyone he's ever worked with up to the point where they've turned around and told him to shut up (and they have all told me this). I've even been told by my shift leader that he once sucker punched a fellow employee off camera and boasted about doing so.

When I first met J he seemed like mustard, a strong personality that you either love or hate and I assumed that what he was saying was all in good fun. Then he started to mock my anxiety disorder. By which I mean I have to go to the bathroom every so often (usually once every 2 hours) and leave the tills for at longest 2 minutes. My shift leader and boss know I have the problem, and I deal with it quietly and quickly, usually meaning someone needs to cover me at most twice during my 7 and a half hour shift. Then, he started to critic my work (usually in demeaning and rude tones), asking why I hadn't done this, done that, etc. Usually, I hadn't done those exact things because A) I was midway through it or B) My shift leader (or boss) had explicitly asked me to do something else instead. When I respond he has always gotten more and more pissy with me. This escalated to where last shift he brought out a tonne of products and in front of customers told me I had to get it all sorted before I go home. I didn't respond to him, and I left work at the end of my shift having done more than my shift leader had asked of me.

I've actually been worried so much by his comment I have asked my boss and shift leader if they have any problems with my work, and the response is always positive and they always say that I'm doing well (and usually comment that I'm better than he is).

&amp;#x200B;

The honest truth is that I don't know how to deal with this situation. Much though I would love to be, I'm not quick-witted. I'm not the kind of person that tells people to ""shut up"", I try and quietly get on with my work and other than report into my shift leader, I just get on with my work. What exactly can I do to get this guy off my back and to make him show me a little respect?

What I can remember however is the last time she told me I wasn’t good enough after doing well. She constantly tries to convince me that I don’t have any friends, and attacks my self-esteem.

Now whenever I go to my dad’s place it feels like a relief from all this but unfortunately he only has every other weekend.

Over the last week me and my mom were constantly fighting over the smallest things, like for example: me being able to be on my phone past 8:30 pm. I’m not a dumb kid and despite being in double honors with almost straight a’s and b’s I still am told that I’m lazy and stupid.

It is hard to live and go to school in this toxic environment so what should I do?",25Apr2019,2

421,"I’m the youngest child in my family [16M], with two older siblings, the oldest being a [28F]. 
Ever since my sibling was around 7 years old my mom has been abusing my father. She has been shaming him for his weight, job, looks, behavior and has been calling him a failure. She has also smashed plates around the house, ruined their bedroom door, tore his shirt and clawed him with her nails and almost smashed his computer in fits of rage. 

One childhood memory that has been branded in my brain was one where she was yelling at him in the car threatening to jump out when we were driving home when I was in 5th grade. She yelled at him and tried to take control of the steering wheel which caused the car to swerve and almost get caught in a car crash. It was a traumatic event for me and yet I can never bring it up because it will just lead to a fight. 

She has been doing it for so long that my father has gotten used to it and, like a sponge, he soaks up her abuse. Once in a while he explodes, resulting in a screaming match between the two. 

My father is a good man, a good father and a great teacher. I love him to death, and I can’t stand idly by while he gets bombarded by my mother. So I started fighting back. I started defending my dad and getting into fights with her, which my father hated because he doesn’t want me to intervene. 

My siblings said that they went through the same phase as I did but eventually gave up and let her continue the abuse. I don’t want to let her continue the abuse. I can’t let her continue the abuse. 
My siblings said that it might have to do with her work overload, as she is currently working as a professor in a university and as a head of a national organization. While I think it causes her fits of rage to some degree, I refuse to believe that it is the only reason, as she has done it for over 20 years and she did not work those two jobs 20 years or even 10 years ago. 

My relationship with her is complicated, but ultimately my one wish is that my father leaves her and gets a divorce. I hate that he has to suffer. 
I have no idea why he stays with her. Maybe he believes she still loves him? Maybe he stays for the family? Whatever it is, it hurts me to see him get hurt. And I feel like if I try to help him or defend him he eventually gets even more hurt by her. 

She often goes to her room to weep. She usually plays the victim card and goes to their room after a fight. 

Sorry about this long rant, but I had to write it down. Any advice?",25Apr2019,2
422," Bit of back story, I have always been described as a very bright person and I know I can do well in academic scenarios but ended up leaving school due to missing loads of my final 2 years (I was going to fail regardless of what I did) the last thing I wanted was to be a burden on my mom and stay at home so I moved from Ireland to England and found this apprenticeship. As a result of this I don't have a leaving cert or graduate from school.

At the moment I'm in the apprenticeship which is quite a bit below me in terms of its academic challenge (This isn't me being cocky, this stuff can be laughable to school students) and I feel like I'm going to go insane here, I can't stand it at all and need to escape from here but I feel like I've got nowhere to go and will be screwed out in the real world with nothing.

I didn't learn until recently that my real passion is insects and animals (conservation and studies etc). I genuinely want to follow this as I can actually enjoy myself and surround myself with like minded people to me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated in terms of what I can do.

TLDR; I left school before graduating and am now on an apprenticeship I need to get out of to study and hopefully go to college in something I enjoy.",25Apr2019,1
423,"I'm feeling too much pressure from my boyfriend, friends and people in general to change. In fact, I think I am the one putting most pressure in myself.

I'm too naive, too invisible and too passive. I'm too nice to people that they often take advantage of me. Lately, I've heard a lot that I'm over sensitive. People ignore me at places because I'm waiting for them to finish chatting so they can listen to me when I talk to them and actual order or ask for information.

I've been trying to change, to not care too much about what others are thinking and build up defenses so I can become stronger. However, I noticed that it's bringing up the opposite effect. I will never be strong enough and whenever someone brings up the fact that I'm sensitive... It just kicks me back to the lowest point.

My mom doesn't give a damn about me and she's always criticizing whatever I do. Even my gifts for her. My boyfriend is 100% practical and so straightforward that it hurts. He's always saying that I'm over sensitive and he wants to stay with me so he can see how much I've changed.

I know none of this is healthy for me, but I don't have a  good self esteem either. I know you're going to say: oh, but you have to be yourself and be comfortable with it. How is that going so far for me? People using and taking advantage of me? Hiding important things from me because I am too sensitive and take things too serious? Even when I was living with my boyfriend his mother would make fun of me behind my back.

I can't even seem to have fun. I had no friends at school because I tried to follow rules and expected everyone to be nice and do the same. You all might be cursing at me right now, but why can't people just be nice to each other to make this shitty life easier for everyone?

425,"I'd like to start by saying I am not a mental health professional and have no business making a diagnosis. With that said, I hope I am wrong, but don't think I am.

I have worked with 'Juan' for about 6 years. He's 23 now. Juan immigrated to the US from Central America when he was 14 and started working at my job shortly thereafter.

About 6 months ago Juan started using Cocaine. It started casually then quickly devolved into a serious problem. We're talking being up all night drinking and blowing lines, coming to work on no sleep, and having do more coke to stay awake. Then repeat. He'd go three or four days without sleeping. 

About 2 months ago he quit cold Turkey. I've struggled with substance abuse in the past, so I expressed to him how proud I was. I explained my past to him and spoke to him on how difficult it is to take control bht how rewarding it is. Since then we've forren much closer. Juan's talked to me about how difficult it was growing up without a father. Juan explained how his cocaine binge was instigated by finally finding out who his father was, attempting to stoke a dialogue with him. His father rejected Juan as his son and told him to make no further attempts at contact. After a series of these conversations, Juan told me that because he's told me more about his past problems than anyone, he considers me his best friend.

Fast forward to this past week. Juan explains to me that he was all the prior night, just thinking. Thinking and talking to God. He says God told him he's a prophet, one of the four. I believe this was a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He told me one of the other Four is a famous Hispanic musician to whom he bears a striking resemblance. He explained how his caballo (horse) is his car, because what he's bringing to his prophet-hood is science and technology. 

At first I laughed because I thought he was joking. He said he knows it sounds crazy but he talked with God and it's true and I will see the proof of it soon. He has continued speaking about this belief, elaborating slightly on it. I am so confused about what to do. I don't believe he has legal status and doubt he has health insurance.

I had an internship at a news station this past summer creating commercials for local companies. This last month I was beginning to send my resume to a ton of places before I graduated. I got an email back from the station I interned at and they were going to give me a part time job as a production assistant. I was fine with this because I would be just out of college and didn't expect a full time job starting at some unreasonable wage and I knew that it was something I was going to enjoy. I emailed him back and took that position. However, he emails me back saying that he has a full time position open if I would like to apply for that instead. It was a promotions producer job and didn't feel I was 100% qualified for the job but I went ahead and put in my resume anyway and got a call back a week later for a job interview. Since I am away at college, I was unable to do an in person interview so we set up an over the phone interview which went horrible due to the fact I get lost pretty easily if Im not face to face with someone. Anyway, two days later I got a call back. I was shocked when they said I got the job and I took it.

432,"Hi there. Sorry this is long, also on a throwaway account.

I want to make it VERY CLEAR that I’m straight and always have been, but I have many LGBTQ+ friends who I love very much. I support the community with all my heart, but this is not okay, regardless of sexual orientation. I recently started a job that I really enjoy and have met a lot of new people. One of these people is a lesbian who at first seemed fine (we’ll call her CC (creepy coworker)).

I didn’t have an issue with CC at first, but another coworker/friend had begun to express how she made him uncomfortable, especially regarding his girlfriend. I listened to him rant, because he just wanted to vent on our break, which was fine. Then she began buddying up to me. CC would nonstop ramble to me, ask to take pictures (we work at a haunted house) and would pose in a way that made it look as if she were licking my neck, she asked for food, laughed obnoxiously at any sarcastic comment I made, you get the idea.

I began feeling uncomfortable when I was asked by another coworker for my number so we could hitch rides to work together. My phone was in my back pocket and I called out for someone to pull my phone out and CC came from the other side before the person I was talking to could. CC did as I asked, but then began commenting on my butt, looking at it and then looking me up and down. From that moment, she began making advances.

CC began asking me if I was bi, had I ever been with a girl, have I ever kissed a girl, yada yada. I would respond with “No, I’m very straight” with a laugh that probably screamed uncomfortable. She nonstop messaged me on Snapchat and text, asking me to come over and smoke (even after I told her I don’t smoke weed). CC would always post things saying that she wanted to “convert straight girls” or “eat straight girls’ c***s til they turned gay.”

She constantly comments on my Snapchat pics, especially if I post a selfie. The other day, I reached the point that I needed advice. She asked me what I was doing and I responded, thinking it was casual convo. CC proceeded to ask if she could take me on a date, to which I responded no. She began rambling about how “no one is completely straight” and I assured her that I was talking to a guy, sending her a pic of his dating profile. She finally gave up, but not before saying this: “Eh, f**k it, if you ever want to try out a girl, ask me! ;)” I sent her “lol, I probably won’t.”

Ever since then CC won’t leave me alone. Calls me boo thing, cutie, babygirl. I’m really non-confrontational and I’m a bit of a pushover. Please help me. I don’t know how to make her stop and I’m afraid if I block her she’ll confront me at work. There’s more incidents that have happened at work, but they’re all tied into the fact that she is actively trying to get me to let her get it in with me...

433,"Context: I'm 24, mum is 60 and stepdad is 57.

My mum and stepfather who has been in my life since I was 11 has left our family on Easter sunday. He told my mum it was because he no longer loved her and made her feel like a monster, saying she's cold and has hurt him for years with being distant and stressed as she has a hard job, made comments about her not making effort with her appearance and just generally wore her down. She didn't kick him out as she felt like she was to blame and was waiting for him to find a place. Turns out he was just making her feel guilty so she wouldn't kick him out, and he was actually caught on our CCTV fucking a girl the same age as me. He has been kicked out this morning and my mum is obviously heartbroken that someone she saw as a best friend would do this to her. He was the closest thing I had to a dad and I am disgusted. After shagging that girl they came and visited me, I took them for afternoon tea and he looked after my 1 year old daughter (he acted as a grandad to her).

After finding this out my mum also phoned me to get a long held family secret off her chest as she was worried my step dad would tell me instead out of spite. It turns out my mum had a secret baby the day before her 15th birthday and he was unwillingly taken from her and put into adoption. Her dad made the decision for her and she hated him right up until the day he died for doing that to her. She has no idea what his name is or where he is now but he would be 44 years old.

436,"TL;DR My best friend of 6 years takes advantage of my easy going personality to get what she wants. How do I talk to her to make it stop?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone. For context, Celeste (not real name) and I have been best friends for 6 years. We went to college together and moved to the same city after college and now live together. She is a great person and a really good friend most times. We are very close and have a lot of fun together. There's 2 things about her that I don't like- 1) she is never satisfied with where she is in life. She always needs to do something MORE. Case in point= has had 3 jobs in the past 2 years because she decides she ""hates"" every job she does. She follows every trend in exercise and beauty and won't shut up about it until she finds a new trend. She is very fickle and can never make decisions, and will talk your ear off about her latest obsession for hours. 2) she wants things without working for them. 

This brings me to my current issue with her- we live in a great apartment. When we moved in, I was making more money so I took the larger room and paid more. I put a lot of effort into our apartment, including painting all the walls, buying most of the furniture and the TV, and cleaning. 2 years later, she wants to move out or switch bedrooms. She hasn't put any effort into her room (which is definitely smaller, but its not horrible). She has all her clothes shoved under her bed, never cleans, didn't paint or put up curtains, and just generally doesn't take care of her space. All she does is complain. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I travel M-Th for work and *if she would give me money to fix up her room*, I wouldnt mind switching rooms. It's not worth the time and energy in my opinion to fight her. However, those around me believe that *by principle* I need to stand up to her and say no.

Now I'm in a position of having to switch rooms or telling her to move out and having to find a random roommate. Should I suck it up and switch rooms, or should I stand up to her and tell her that I won't deal with this anymore?",25Apr2019,2

I have a slight problem right now in my life.

Me and my gf went... No... Go through a tough time rn. Just yesterday we had an argument yaddayadda leading to her going through everything that hurt her in our relationship.

One of the things she mentioned was my mum.
For context... My gf is born in the country we both live in but her family comes from China so she of course looks 100% Chinese.
My mother... Is from here... But that isn't the problem... The problem is that she is to a degree racist and Islamophobic... She has nothing but bad stuff to say about them... Blames them for increase of crime rates, living out their culture out here (reason being that this isn't an Islamic state but a Christian one and that thus they show some restraint).

She wasn't always that bad about it... For a time she even made sense to me and i agreed (to a degree) with her.
But it is at a point where i would rather ignore her than talk about it.

At this point you might see a problem here... My gf might not be Islamic but i understand why she feels uncomfortable when my mother goes on another rant.

My mother is a strong minded person.
She has nothing against my gf... Likes her even... But i already know that she will defend her position on Islam and such stuff to the bones.
I don't want to argue with my mum because she is a wonderful mother... But i also don't want my gf to feel unnecessary uncomfortable...

My friend's mother is going to send her to a coaching institute for the next two years which is very far away, about an hour and a half ride by car (which is not too much, I agree, but a lot for her).
I remember going to a concert with her and she couldn't stay in the car for even 15 minutes due to her extreme motion sickness and had to take medication for just a 30 minute long drive. Not only that, she also can't take a car to get there and has to take a train and then walk to there. She hasn't taken a train in all her life. (She has never required to do so as our school was only 15 minutes away and we could walk there).
Another issue is that her parents refuse to acknowledge this. They think that showing her once how to ride a train will get rid of the problem (it won't. She has motion sickness and gets drowsy really easily. She fell asleep nearly every time she took it. Thankfully I was with her the whole time)
I wish I could've joined the same institute since I really care for her and it's a extremely good reputed institution but due to complications I definitely can't go there.

Please tell me a way of expressing my feelings and her problems to her parents so that they understand her needs. She has told them but they just won't budge. I really really do love and care for her and I don't want her to feel horribly tired day in and day out.

I'LL PUT SOME FUCKING HEADPHONES IN!!!"". i know it doesnt sound like much but it was fucking scary. also this guy is friends with bikers and told a story of his friends uncle that was a hitman that cut some guys thumbs off. i was so freaked i had to call the cops to come check it out and moved all my shit into a different apartment (i live in a student accomodation complex). i plan on getting revenge by emailling his uni and tell them about the trip to the psychward, that he screamed at his 16 year old roommate (me), and that he tries to fuck girls half his age (he is in his 30s). i would obviously do this after moving out of the complex. he wouldnt know where i live. what do you think the repercussions could possibly be??? i dont think he is very dangerous and the psych ward trip mightve just been an excuse to get out of jail time for getting in a street fight. my biggest worry is that when i start working in fast food that he will come to the fast food place and know where i work. what do you think. i am incredibly vindictive btw.",25Apr2019,3

449,"Long story short I started cutting myself due to circumstances in my life December of 2018. My ay the time boyfriend tried to help me but ultimately ended up leaving me cause he felt like he was hurting me. Since then he knows of one more time I cut but not the most recent which was 3/3/19. I’m excited that I’m almost at 2 months since I last cut and I’ll likely see him on the 2nd cause we started friends with benefit. 

Extra context: 
•He got really really upset when he first saw the cuts and honestly knowing how upsets he gets and that he would see it has been a great motivator to keep me from cutting (but not my only one)
•he has asked to not do any one on one date things with me, movies ect
•I will never tell him the reason for that cut but he knows the reasons behind the others 
•We were not talking for a few weeks when it happened 
•Before first time I we hooked up I specifically asked him not to mention my scars cause they make me self conscious and his reaction was “*scars?*” which to me came off as shock but it hasn’t been brought up since 

What I need advice on is if it would be a good idea to share this victory with him? I’d like to ask him to help me treat myself to a McFlurry. I don’t know how he will react to finding out I cut a third time or if he’d be willing to go get food with me.",25Apr2019,2

452,"I switched to another job after being in my last one for 6 months. My last job was great, super chill, easy. Only problem was that I had to drive about 2 hours each day and I was getting paid $15/hr. Which isn’t terrible but I need more money (who doesn’t nowadays?), it was also a lot of customer service in which I’ve grown tired of. Overall the company is great and would greatly recommend to anyone.


The current job I’m in seems alright as far as work goes. Doing e-commerce and doing back end stuff which is new and cool for me. The company however is a startup, it has been active for 11 years and we sell horse supplies and apparel. I’m getting paid significantly more is why I chose to change jobs, and it’s in the city about 20 minutes away from my home and taking the train.


So it’s all great and all, apparently I’ll have health insurance in 3 months which should be good... if they can afford it? Anyway, after speaking to another employee here, apparently it gets very chaotic with discussions and demands from the CEO. As expected from a startup, it’ll be hectic. But after seeing their data... everything is so incredibly disorganized. We have a million gmail accounts and our own with about 7000 or more unread mails, there’s no communication from anyone, tons of errors and listings that were never put up, ASIN’s (Amazon number) that are in wrong products, incorrect SKUS, shipping issues, wrong products received due to listing errors, etc. We’re above standard in eBay (good I guess?), have gotten jibbed by Amazon many times.

It’s a mess.

I’m already dreading going to work and it’s only my 3rd day here. The CEO and upper management aren’t available this week since they had to attend an event, which is why it’s relaxed right now but once they come back it’s hectic apparently.

Idk if I can take it, but idk if I should just stick with it. This has been my 2nd job that I’ve switched to in less than a year. I moved to Chicago and got a job at an animal hospital which didn’t last since I left after 2 weeks, then got my last one which I was in for 6 months and now this job where I started this Monday.

I don’t have a career or anything so a lot of people have told me I can switch jobs like it’s nothing, but I’m not sure if it’s good for me either. It’s been a while since I’ve been at a job for a year. What should I do?",25Apr2019,1

This turned into a 30+ minute conversation about the oceans and over fishing. It was a great conversation, I was going to ask for her information but shipment came and I got distracted. She said bye almost like disappointed and that was the end of it. This does happen often and other customers have asked co workers why I didn't pursue them any further. So this would be my first time messaging someone and a customer.

456,"So there’s this guy in my grade, I’ve known him since sophomore year (we’re seniors now) and there’s always been something off about him. I wouldn’t say I was friends with him, but we did talk every now and then. Last year, he messaged me in the middle of the night claiming the voices in his head are telling him he needs to be with me. It was enough to creep me out, so I blocked him on all social medias and haven’t talked to him up until 3 months ago. 

He sits at my lunch table, and normally I go to the library for lunch. Every time I sit by him, he stares at me. It just made me overall uncomfortable but one day I figured I’d start up a conversation with him. It was going fine and I thought I just labeled him as a creepy guy when he wasn’t, so every time I sat at the table after that we’d talk.

2 weeks ago, he pulled a journal out of his backpack. He opened it and was drawing some sort of blade. I love art so I took interest in it and asked to see his journal, and he said I can’t tell anyone what’s in it. I agreed figuring it was just drawings with a darker theme to them. My friend made a joke that it was his manifesto, and he got irritated, claiming over and over that he didn’t have one.

I opened the first page and in the entry he talked about me. I shrugged it off and kept going. There was symbols and more weaponry drawings. Then an entry about how the voices in his head are telling him to kill people. He talked about how people think he’s a school shooter. He noticed my expression reading through that and told me he was really depressed when he wrote that. In one entry he claimed this is his version of Mein Kampf, but the words were so scribbled that I couldn’t make out what they said.

I kept going, and there was a list. I don’t remember the exact wording, but it said something along the lines of “distanced myself from.” There was my name, 3 other girls I didn’t know, and “mother.” On the next page was a list that said “might open back up to.” My name was on there again with only 2 other girls this time. 

It freaked me out. I avoided going back to the lunchroom for awhile, and he stared at me in the one other class we have together. Yesterday the library was closed and I came to sit at the table, hoping to just ignore him. There was 3 other people with us and he started saying some dark things. He said “I keep my victims strictly to female humans” and talked about cannibalism. Later that night he messaged me saying “I was mostly joking about what I said today.” I ignored him.

Today, we have an active shooter lockdown drill. I’m not in school today because I was feeling well, and around 20 minutes ago he messaged me asking if he should bring David to school. We have a mutual friend named David so I asked what he meant because school already started. He replied David is his knife. I said no and he left me on read, that’s my last contact with him as of right now. He’s also mentioned in the past he knows how to make a bomb. 

I’m seriously torn about what to do, I want to tell the school but I’m worried about what he’ll do if I do. I’m also considering switching my classes to be nowhere near him, even though we only have 3 weeks left. I think he’s a potential danger to everyone at school but don’t know if there’s enough evidence to show that. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? I don’t feel safe anymore",25Apr2019,1
457,"Very long story made shorter but still long: I just got abandoned, is the best way to put it (he took a job in another state knowing I couldn't move and didn't tell me until he'd already put in his two weeks), by my boyfriend of two years and called out of work because I was an absolute mess. My boss said sure and asked of I was okay and I kinda broke down on the phone and ended crying into the phone at him for an hour.  

Some background: My boss hired me as an intern last year, and recently offered me a full time job. We've always been work friendly, and I tried a little to be his friend too but I wasn't really sure what he thought. I'd text him and he'd answer and we'd talk about a mutual hobby sometimes, but he never texted me first and we never hung out outside of work. We'd talk all day at work though.  
  
Anyway, he asked if he could bring me some dinner but I didn't want to go back to my dorm looking like the mess I did and get all the questions, so he offered to take me back to his apartment and I said okay. Sometime around 7am we fell asleep, and then I woke up with his arm around me (both of us fully clothed). I was surprised and waited a second for fear to set in, but I ended up feeling more comfortable than I had in months. I'd told him things that night I could never have told my ex after two years, and being in his arms just felt ""right"".  
  
I fell back asleep, and woke up to him jumping out of the bed and apologizing, totally flustered. He's usually so stoic, I laughed.  
  
Anyway, we ended up talking a lot more and I've spent a few more days/nights at his place. Again, just talking - and the more we talk the more I think I could fall in love with him pretty easily. I told him that, and he didn't say yes, but he didn't say no - more kinda just agreed with me.  
  
I made a list.  
  
Reasons to ask him to be in a relationship:  
- I really like him.
- I want to.  
- I really really like him.  
  
Reasons not to:  
- He's my boss.  
- I'm a week out of a long term relationship and totally not even close to being over my ex, maybe I'm just rebounding? It doesn't feel like it though.  
- I'm 22 and he's 31.  
- I'm not ready to be in another relationship and that's really not fair to him.

459,"Okay, this just happened, so pardon me if I'm not writing at my peak right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I  was messaging a female Redditor on Discord over the past two days. She posted on one of the website's personals subs, wanting to talk with a guy who had similar interests. She was from another country, and I liked that region's culture and language. I figured that it would be a good learning experience to talk with her, because there aren't many foreigners where I live. Well, as it turns out, she actually wanted to write to me too and said that she filtered me out of around 80 candidates. I was flattered and appreciative that she wanted to hear from me.

&amp;#x200B;

The conversation seemed to be going alright. I let her hear my attempt at speaking her language, and we shared some common interests. Well, last night I had a rather open and frank discussion with an older user, asking for her thoughts and advice on certain topics of attraction that I'm rather self-conscious about. She works in the women's health sector and so was comfortable with (non-sexual) female nudity. Well, I sent a photo and didn't think anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Come this morning, I resumed my conversation with the international user. We were both natural sciences students in college (I was in agriculture), and I wanted to show her the type of native maize that is grown in her country. Well, I'd never sent a picture on Discord before, and I'm still learning how to use my phone with its various apps. As it turns out, nude picture and maize picture were right next to each, and while trying to scroll around, not knowing that I didn't have to double click....I sent nude photo instead. Out of the blue. In the middle of the conversation. Completely unsolicited.

&amp;#x200B;

Her response was exactly: ""WTF?!?"" I tried to apologize and wrote multiple times that I didn't mean to send it, ""What did I just do?!?"", ""I swear to God, I did not mean to send that!  😭 "" We both agreed that it was just awkward at that point, and I told her that I was going to leave her alone now. I deleted her from my Discord friends list too.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do here. I wasn't romantically interested, but she seemed like someone that I would enjoy being online friends with. My slip up made me look like a creep. I don't think that she has blocked me on Reddit yet, so there might still be a chance to salvage this dumpster fire of mine, but I don't know. This is the first time that something like this has ever happened to me, and I'm completely lost. Can anyone give me advice on what to do?

460,"Hi all. Sorry in advance if this is long. I just want to get all the details straight, so please bare with me. I've very ashamed of what happened.

I met Ryan (name changed) when I was 15 years old and was on a summer teen trip with a very reputable travel company. We spent 4 weeks in Africa, and Ryan was the 24-year-old leader of the trip. Ryan was handsome, charming, funny, just ""*soooo coooool""*, etc etc - everything a 15 year old girl would go nuts for. On the trip he would seek me out and give me special treatment, he would always tell me what a mature and incredible and gifted ""woman"" I was, and asked me multiple times to confirm that I was, in fact, 15 years old. At the time I was incredibly flattered and excited by this.

I had a massive crush on him during the trip and well into the years following that summer (we stayed in touch on Facebook). We'd talk frequently, make plans to travel together (never came to fruition), and he even invited me out to Michigan (where he lived) to spend a week with him (I didn't go, of course parents said no). 

We fell out of touch when I was about 17, but when I turned 18, he messaged me on Facebook and we very quickly rekindled our friendship, which *very* quickly became something romantic. Though we were living across the country from each other, we would text each other all the time about moving to the same city, what our dreams are, how much we care about each other, etc. He even would talk about marriage and engagement rings. He professed his feelings for me a week after my 18th birthday. We'd Skype and things would get very hot and heavy. It was insane, but I had had a wildly intense crush on this guy for 3 years, so in my naive mind this was an actual dream come true. It makes me sick to just type this.

There were two times as well when we met up at hotels (he was traveling through my city on layovers) and would spend 24 hours or so together. We never actually had intercourse (he was very adamant about not going PIV - later I found out why), but we absolutely were sexual, naked together, no question about it. 

After about four months of this, however, and after I had bought a ticket to fly out to see him where he lived, he confessed that he actually had a longterm girlfriend he'd been living with for well over a year. He had been hiding this all from his girlfriend, obviously, but insisted that he and his girlfriend were about to breakup and were on really bad terms. Our ""relationship"" continued via texting for another month or so (I didn't fly out to see him), but then I slowly cut off contact with him, he took the hint, and stopped really conversing. About two months later I got in a relationship with another guy, and I got a Facebook message from Ryan telling me how hurt he was, and we stopped talking for a long time after that.

In the years after (this was mid-2013), Ryan and I seldom spoke, but then slowly started to become friends again. He'd broken up with his girlfriend, and we'd chat on the phone, give each other life and career advice, and it was actually pretty nice to regain a friendship with someone who had been such a cornerstone of my teenage years (I know how that sounds, but that's how it felt). While we were both single, we actually met up on one occasion - he flew out to see me and we spent a weekend together. The weekend was awful. He would grope me but then turn me down as if I were the one coming onto HIM when I'd turn around and try to kiss him. He'd constantly be on his phone texting other people. He would randomly tell me that he was not expecting this weekend to be romantic at all, WHICH I WASN'T EITHER, but he was throwing mixed signals left and right and making it out as if I were the one coming onto him. It was the epitome of gas-lighting. This was early 2017. 

After that, I haven't spoken to him much at all, though he continues to reach out to me. He will send me Instagram messages telling me how proud he is of me (not to toot my own horn, but we both have the same life/job goals, but I've absolutely surpassed him both in terms of money, successes, and actually making my dreams come to fruition and having my own incredibly happy and independent life, whereas he works as a waiter in his hometown and lives with his parents). I don't reply to his messages on Instagram anymore. It just drives me insane to get ""I'm so proud of you!"" messages AS IF he's done something to make my career grow or make me blossom into who I am. Instead, as I get older, I just realize I was majorly creeped on by a lying loser who was basically waiting for a 15-year-old girl to turn 18. (Oh, did I mention how he'd always tell me that he wished I was 18 while we were on that teen tour? Because he'd tell me that, as if it were a compliment. It did feel like a compliment at the time).

So the reason why I'm writing this is because I do not know where to go from here. A HUGE part of me wants to send him a long email and tell him that I can't believe how naive and blinded I was to his absolute creepiness. I feel so sorry for his girlfriend at the time and I wonder if she ever found out he cheated. I feel like an idiot for ever telling him how incredible I thought he was, for inflating his fragile ego, because now I realize he's just a loser who lies about his success and has nothing to show for anything. I just feel like I owe it to myself to do something with all of this, because it's been 9 years now and all that's happening is I'm getting madder and madder and more and more sick when I think about it.

Like honest to god I had forgotten we'd hooked up in hotels until I started writing this, I really think I'm surpressing memories or something.

She severed all ties with me because she got jealous over nothing (not her first time doing this) but every so often she comes around, and when we’re together, we’re happy and can’t keep our hands off each. However, when we’re apart, she’s distant and somewhat cold. I understand that perhaps she’s immature, and isn’t fully developed in terms of critical thinking or mentality. She has a tendency to be a bit proud and would never go out of her way to call or text me. That being said, every time I see her, she looks worse and worse, and I’m afraid it’s negligence on the behalf of her family? She looks ghastly and anemic, almost on drugs and I’m really want to help her. I know most of you would tell me she’s my ex for a reason and to keep it that way, or to move on, but I just feel this misplaced sense of this paternalistic instinct to aid her. I’m at a point in my life where I’m happy, I’m healthy and people have taken notice of this. My confidence is through the roof, and I thought this would all appeal to her, but it seems she gotten really bitter about it.

469,"I’ll try to be quick but there’s this girl I met a few years ago, became friends, then last September we moved in together w another guy. Sounds cliche but she really is the best person on earth. Cool, kind, smart, etc... anyways, I got feelings for her around the time we moved in and wanted to ask her out. She had just gotten over a guy she was in love with, has never been in a relationship or had sex. Time slipped by as I thought about how I was gunna make the move or when. Also not wanting to disturb things at home. Then in convo she said she wouldn’t be able to be friends w someone after they asked her out as it would change everything. I didn’t know it was a context specific thing so I took it WAY too seriously and missed all other signs/things said to have asked her out. It’s the worst line but I didn’t want to lose the friendship, I couldn’t handle losing her in life (All dumb ideas). Things weren’t going well w her career so she moved back home to India. Told her about my feelings right before she left and found out I was right the whole time, should have asked her out before she committed to moving back and fell back in love w the guy (right before she left they talked and she swooned again).  She was open and down to try w girls. Has never got a crush on a girl and just feels like she’s kissing a friend when she has, but I think we could have worked out. Maybe I’m just being foolish, but she was open to try and we get along great and she would have considered me. She would have been using me as an experiment and say yes because things aren’t working w guys but is that really so bad? Would have gotten the date w her and idk see what happens. Door isn’t completely closed to using me as a test in the future. I’m visiting her in December but we’ll be around her family so I don’t think anything will happen.

471,"ok, this is going to make me sound like a terrible person but I will justify my actions at the end

So one of the kids from my high school graduating class sent me a message over snapchat asking me to write a 5 page research essay on a particular topic in business statistics for April 26 in exchange for $50 (aka slave labor). I sent him a message back through snapchat text saying “OK.” Yeah, no. I didn’t realize how tight things get around finals season so I procrastinated and here I am with a massive chemistry exam tomorrow and this kid’s research paper unfinished. 

Now realizing that I have no choice but to pull a fast one on this kid, here are a few options that I have contemplated:

1: Complete block/ghost on all social media including close friends of his that know leaving him to struggle

2: Send him a corrupted word file later today and place all blame on his system

3: Come clean (this isn’t helping anyone)

Bottom line is that I am effectively ending this kid’s career because he was too lazy to do his own work, especially for his major. I don’t really feel bad because he was being academically dishonest from the start so he should have been prepared for something like this.

Once again, the “agreement” was made over the internet without any contract or text proof (i went back and deleted any incriminating snapchat texts last night) and I have taken no money from him.

Would appreciate insight on how to proceed since my decision has been made",25Apr2019,1
472,"Hello,  


First of all, If this post isn't allowed here, please direct me to a more appropriate subreddit.  


Now onto my post...  
Can men wear women's clothing? I don't mean skirts, high-heels and such. I mean tee-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, skinny-jeans, punk boots - hell, even crop-tops. I'm asking because I find myself attracted to female clothing. I have done so since I was about 16 or so. I have never purchased any form of female clothing before due to always being fearful of bullying and rejection - I'm hesitant to even post. Do you think it is acceptable for a man to wear any of these such items? I find there to be more options for women in regards to clothing - style, designs, quality and for the most part, a better fit.  


Each time I browse an online retailer, I always find an item that I rather like only to find out it's for girls and have to continue browsing. Two days ago, I was browsing a clothes store at my local shopping mall and there were several tees, a pair of sweat pants and a hoodie that I liked, but they were all for girls. There was a young girl working there and she asked me if I was aware that I was looking at the women's section. I told her *I am, but I'm not looking for myself*, only I was...

I am a straight male in my twenties. Is it wrong of me to want to wear certain types of female clothing? Should I or should I not do it? How would I break it to my family and friends if I were to do so?",25Apr2019,1
473,So I (F16) had a sleepover with this girl (F16) and she was talking to me about how she was questioning and wanted to experiment. Later on in the night she said she wanted to kiss me and that she was thinking about it all day/night. I didn’t know what to say and she leaned in and she kissed me.... I kinda regret it coz she has a boyfriend and I really wanted my first kiss to be special. I don’t really think of her as more than a friend and now it’s gonna be awkward. Idk what to do.,25Apr2019,3
474,"I have grown up living in the Midwest (Chicago) pretty much my entire life. I have a career in game development and selling my personal artwork and want to go to the west coast to pursue more growth in my career. I also just really want to get out of the Midwest and live somewhere more interesting and beautiful. My plan is to have a job lined up before making the move, but it seems like I will need to do some more networking out there before I will land a job in my industry as most of my connections are in Chicago. I am totally ok with working a ""regular"" job like at Trader Joe's if it can pay the bills while I work on landing the job in game development out there, but I am unsure of a few things. Here are some questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a really bad idea to get out of the games industry so I can relocate, and work on networking to get back into it out west?

How much should I have saved before considering moving?

Can working a job at Trader Joe's be enough to pay the bills? 

Better question, what rate per hour is ""livable""?

Where is it possible to live west without a car and commute by bike or public transit?

Any sort of general advice about moving west is welcomed and appreciated. My heart is set on going out there, I just want to be smart",25Apr2019,1
475,"Because of the gruesome nature of my FIL's suicide and the fact that he left no note, the police are treating it as a homicide. Before this happened he was extremely depressed, a bipolar trying to wean himself off his meds. My partner found him yesterday morning in his garage with his head in a chop saw. I'm 31 years old and I've never dealt with death this closely before. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, what to say, or how to help my partner.

476,"Hi, I’m currently 18 and doing an exchange year here in Germany. October 2018 - July 2019. I’ve always wanted to live outside Mexico in search of a better life. I came to Germany because it’s one of the easiest, most viable options. University is free and immigration is not so terribly hard as in the US or Canada for example. Everything sounds nice right? Well, my problem here is the way people are. The culture is immensely different as in Mexico. I’m from Mexico City. I have a long history of post talking about these, that helps in giving a backstory. In Mexico I have a normal life, I have plenty of friends, for the vast majority I’m happy, of course there’s exceptions. But here in Germany I’ve been sad most of the time, I can count the times that I’ve been truly happy likely with one hand, the others I’ve been not so happy. There’s plenty in my post history. There’s the obvious reasons why I would want to move to Germany, better job, security, better quality of life, etc. But there’s cons also. And I’m afraid that the cons outweigh the pros because they most likely do. I know it would be a smart thing to do, to study here, from a career point but I’m not even sure I would want to live here in Germany definitely. I’d love to be able to study in Canada, the US, or Australia, pretty much every English speaking country because the culture shock is not as harsh as it is here in Germany. But the university in those countries is very expensive. Tho in those countries I’d definitely like to stay and live there some time. 
I’m mostly rambling on here but I hope you get the point. If there’s anything else you’d like to know let me know. It’s a really hard decision.",25Apr2019,1

479,"We were in class and me and this other friend of his decided to write his name on pieces of classwork with love hearts around it and hand them out. We finished the joke after the teacher told us to stop, and after we both laughed with him. After class I asked him if he was okay with the prank and he responded no, to which I replied that I was sorry. I decided to give it a few hours before I talked to him again.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we're in the halls, I approach him and tell him I'm sorry, to which he responds that I'm an idiot; knowing I did something he didn't like I took the insult and told him it was a joke that he shouldn't get too bothered about.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it slipped out of his mouth. He said that I only did the practical joke so that I could get close with his friend (the person who I did the prank with and the person who initiated it) and nothing else. I told him that I can be friends with his friend because we've been in the same classes for months, and his friend really enjoys my company. I left him after that and decided to give him time to chill (as recommended by our mutual friends). What should I do next?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Played practical joke on friend with a mutual friend he had introduced me to months prior, he got mad and said that I always use him as the butt of the joke so that I can be close friends with mutual friend. After constant apologies, no improvement. What do I do next?",25Apr2019,1
480,"I'm a 2nd year Culinary Major student in Upstate NY this was supposed to be my last semester, but I am still missing some credit to graduate with a 2 years associate degree. The reason for my contemplation is because the nature of my major. I feel that most of the things I do or will be doing comes from experience in working in the kitchen, yes my school offer that experience, but I am so tired of other classes that I have to take in order to get my degree. I did my 480 hours internship last summer and I made good money, and I'm thinking to myself that I could be out there in the world, working, building my craft, gaining experience, skills...all that. Though I'm very afraid that I won't get anywhere in the world without degree.. I'm pushing through this semester and hoping I don't fail out of the college, but even if I did pass this semester I won't even graduate..so I presented a bunch of choice to myself A) Drop out B) Do another semester just to get my 2 years degree C) Step up my game and actually get 4 years degree D) Take another gap year and find myself, whether I want to go on a journey or do more school.

482,"I work as a cashier for a grocery store and I get 15 minute breaks and hour long lunches. I’m only 16, so the having money to spend everyday is new to me, but there’s things I really need to save for (college, and I’m a guitarist in a band, so all the expenses that come with that) and this food is making a dent in those savings. Even when I’m not at work, I still find myself buying candy at gas stations whenever I’m not in a hurry, which is often. 

I’ve thought about taking something to eat, but the only thing I have is chips that I can keep in my car. I can’t make any sandwiches or anything like that at home because these is no refrigerator in the break room and I’m more than positive it’ll go bad in the 100 degree heat where I live.

483,"Hello, so long story short, I’m 24, had pretty bad depression since I was 13 but it became catastrophic when I turned 23, and now two months ago I moved home to West Virginia after resigning from my job in Washington, DC to basically recover, go to tons of therapy, and relaunch my life and ultimately find a new city and career.  

While I’m here, I would love to live life authentic to who i am.  That doesn’t mean running down the streets wearing lipstick and a rainbow flag.  the funny part is I have actually been fully out with every friend I’ve made since my first day of college back in 2013, but it’s something that only like 3 friends in West Virginia knew and they have since moved away.  While I’m here,  I just want to be unafraid of acknowledging my fundamental truth (like if someone asks me if I’m seeing anyone, i wanna be like no i haven’t met the right guy yet), go to the local pride organization’s summer picnics, and go to the one gay bar in the region because i have literally no friends left in this town and my parents don’t want most people they know to see me because they’re very embarrassed that my mental health collapsed and i had to move home.  I want to just be myself and unashamed.  

My mom is completely opposed to this.   She knows I am gay but my stepdad and 8 year old brother do not.   My stepdad is a very successful business owner in our region.  She says the things I mentioned earlier are selfish because I will damage my stepdad’s reputation and being out will result in my little brother getting bullied at school.  She says that i owe it to my stepdad and his dad for them to not have to deal with awkward questions from their friends. She says that when I recover and relaunch my life I’ll be going to a more metropolitan area anyway, so I should do the right thing and wait until I’m far away enough that no one in town will know about that side of me.   

They legitimately are doing a great deal for me.  They are giving me a place to live during this total collapse of my life and are paying for my therapy and other incidentals like food, so do I owe it to them to suck it up and go back in the closet until I relaunch my life?  Or is there a way for me to be true to myself even while I’m staying in “their” town while I recover my sanity?

Thank you for your advice, CMC",25Apr2019,1
484,"i really didn’t know where to post this and be able to receive a response in a timely fashion, so i’m sorry about that. 

long story short, my dad has a friend who owns a beach house about an hour and a half away from us. he offered that we could stay there for a bit over spring break, so we planned out staying from thursday through sunday. 

we bought food, brought toiletries, etc. we also didn’t have to pay to stay there because it was a family friend. 

so we arrived, and of course, our luck, the house is absolutely filthy. not what we were expecting at all. my dad used the bathroom and it not only clogged, but OVERFLOWED. the place has dead skin and dust everywhere. it’s disgusting and we all decided we DIDN’T want to stay here for three days. and the last thing my parents need is to clean the place themselves—that’s why we’re on a mini vacation to begin with. i mean, that’s not fair at all?

the dude’s dad was staying in the upstairs apartment and tried to help with the toilet. he used the wrong cleaning utensils and a dirty mop, ultimately being the last straw for my mother in particular. i don’t blame her. 

yet, they’re both still expecting that we’re staying the three days. i told my family i’d try posting to reddit for advice considering none of us had any idea how to politely back our way out of this. we’re at the beach currently trying to figure out what to do. 

any advice, reddit?",25Apr2019,0
485,"As the title implies, I (30/F) am on the fence about having children. I'm an (adopted) only child with older parents (mid-70's), so I feel this undue pressure to have children, especially as my parents get older. For now, my parents have a grand-dog to dote on, but I *know* they expect to some day be grandparents. My husband (30/M) has told me that he will be happy with any decision I make about having children, except for having several children (if we do have kids, he wants to start with one and then see how it goes from there). Honestly, since I'm on the fence, I feel if we do have kids, we'd only have one.

One of my biggest deciding factors is my health. I have a few health issues that may make pregnancy complicated for me, assuming no other pregnancy complications that could occur, which makes me almost terrified to be pregnant. Due to some of these health issues, I already know I will need to have a scheduled C-section, which, again, terrifies me. Plus, I'm a very active person and am worried about the depression pregnancy will put me in if I have to stop being active, while my husband can continue being active. My husband and I are definitely on board with adoption, seeing as how I was adopted as a newborn, but I know if we have the ability to biologically have our own children (my parents could not), he would prefer our kids to have our genes for medical history reasons.

Another big deciding factor is the loss of freedom. I LOVE to travel and want to explore as many places as I can in my lifetime. My husband is indifferent to traveling, but enjoys the 1-2 trips I plan for us every year and loves traveling together. I understand that other parents have figured this out, but all the parents I know do not have the desire to travel like I do and some of the places I want to see are definitely not child-travel-friendly. For example, I'm planning a big hiking trip for us later on this year out in the Midwest US, where one of the hikes we will do is several miles. We previously spent 2 weeks doing our own tour of Iceland and spent nearly every day hiking places most people do not (I'm not the tour bus kind of tourist).

My final deciding factor is I *do* believe I would be a good mom, to an extent, and would be happy with at least one kid. Part of me feels that if I do choose to not have kids, I will regret it. Then another part of me says ""well, look how happy you are without them and how much freedom you have!"" Plus, I love my marriage and do not want to risk doing something that could negatively affect it, especially since I've read lots of articles about how married couples are overall happier without children.

There's no financial or work concerns. Both of us would continue work and I, fortunately, work for an American corporation that treats mothers extremely well (on-site daycare, fully paid maternity leave, private rooms for pumping, etc...). We both have stable, well-paying careers, own our house, etc...so even now we're in a good place, financially-speaking, to have children. It's more the emotional side that is putting me on the fence.

Any advice? Anyone else (with or without kids) ever feel this way?",25Apr2019,1

487,"Me [25F] and my fiancé [25M] are having a dilemma of what next step to take in life.
We currently live somewhere where it is on average $1400 a month for a small apartment. I have a nice job that MIGHT not become permanent (currently contracting, but contract ends soon and company may not budget to make position permanent). But if it were permanent it’s a high enough paying job to justify paying the rent price.
I could just find a similar job in the area, but to be honest even though it’s not a bad job it makes me depressed. It’s just not something I’m passionate about, even if on the outside looking in it’s a lot of people dream job. It feels like I go through the motions of day to day life like a robot. Work, traffic, eat something quick and easy, be too tired to do my own projects, go to sleep feeling lazy and depressed I have to go to work again. 
My fiancé is also depressed as there isn’t really anything in his field out here and he works a job he hates, this feeling similar emotions to me.
We also have been here a year and haven’t made any friends despite trying. We just aren’t like the people here having come from the Midwest.

So we have a choice, stay and make it work for money / security. Pay off my student debt for a little more freedom later (be almost 30 having worked at a desk my entire youth).
Or, we thought maybe moving back home/somewhere Midwest that’s cheap as hell. Where rent is $600-$900 for a house. We could work part time, I could try a different career while freelancing art and my fiancé could do the same. The downside to this is haulting paying off debt, going back to having to save forever to get things, and we both have a weird sense of failure if we go back.

Staying here feels like the responsible thing to do, even if I may have to find a different job in the same field. But we’re both a little miserable (but working on trying to find happiness with what we have)
But moving seems like the ballsy “follow your dreams” path, even if it’s risky, expensive savings draining move...

I’m just stuck because both have good and bad, and I need an outside perspective that has a similar experience or less personal emotion about it

I think he is reaching an emotive climax which will eventually explode in a breakdown. 

He has been in a relationship for 3 years, but two years ago he broke up and he's acting strange since then. 

He has begun to work last year and now he's in a sort of power position in his family company. I think moneys and the responsibilities has gone to his head.

Few days ago, he went with my brother's ex girlfriend (they broke up a couple weeks ago) and my brother is devastated (he's his friend too). My mind is overflowing with thoughts. 

It was him that let this girl know my brother. My friend and this girl knew eachother before he let her know my brother. He said multiple times that this girl was just a friend, he wasn't interested, not a bit, in her. When she broke up with my brother, he changed attitude towards her. They seemed to be closer and closer, under my brother's eyes.  

One thing that he swore was that he would never go out with a girl that was his friend's ex. 

We've been together like brothers for 8 years, but now he's acting childish, irresponsible, recklessly and incoherently. 

I had red flags some months ago but I didn't give it much thoughts. But, now that he has done this thing (saying he's in love with this girl), I don't know what to think anymore. My trust in him has gone a little bit down and I don't know what to tell him. 

Although he has done this thing to my brother, my feelings are a mess now. I don't know what to do or what to say. We're friends, I don't want to lose trust in him, I don't want to lose my friend.

498,"I’m an 18 year old white chick. I was in a relationship with a biracial guy for a year and a half and I would have him over all the time and he met both sides of my family and everything was great, they even invited him over for Christmas! I never sensed anything wrong and my family was always kind to him but when he was gone my parents would always say they didn’t really like him and I thought it was because he didn’t treat me well. Long story short, the relationship didn’t work out and I moved on. 
More recently I’ve met someone else, we’ve only been on a few dates and are in the process of getting to know each other but things have been going well. When my parents asked to see a picture of him, they called me into their room the next day to have a “discussion about my choices”. They told me they didn’t like him and I couldn’t see him anymore and immediately I knew it was because of his skin color. I asked them why and they told me it was embarrassing for them, and everyone in my family talks behind my back because of it. I don’t know if that part’s true or if she was just trying to make me feel ashamed. They said black guys don’t treat their women right and used my ex as an example. I didn’t know what to do or say so I just started laughing in pure shock but they were VERY passionate about this and even went as far as to threaten to take my car and my phone so I could never see this boy again. They went on to say they “didn’t want black grandchildren” and saying things like “if you date him you don’t care about us” to guilt me. They even told me that my ex was a little better because his skin was lighter. Everything started to click in my head; why my dad wouldn’t look my ex in the eye, how much they loved my two brother’s CAUCASIAN girlfriends and didn’t care for mine, and every little comment they’ve ever made before this. After I gathered my thoughts after like 30 minutes of them going on about it, I told them that they’re entitled to their own opinions (even though racism isn’t an opinion but what else could I say) but I was going to date whoever I want to date. 
Since then I’ve still been talking to this guy and hanging out with him without my parents knowing. I’ve been acting like a good kid because I really don’t want to have my car taken away and be stuck in this house. I just can’t believe that the people I love and trust the most have finally shown me their true colors and it’s honestly heartbreaking. I’ve heard a few racist remarks here and there but nothing ever like this, and it makes me sad for my friends and the people that I allow to meet my family because now I know what’s going on in their head.

506,"Okay I really need opinions on which house I should rent and move into THIS weekend. I’ve talked to my mom and best friend and boyfriend and I still can’t decide. Here are the opinions. 

So I legit have two house opinions to move into this weekend. They both have pros and cons. 

1st house: deposit (would have to ask my mom for help) and pet deposit when I get one. it’s a nice big house awesome backyard, I would live with 3 guys. And share a bathroom. But it has a door to the shower and a separate one to the toilet. They love GOT and football like me. The lease seemed strict but he’s pretty easy going. It’s a nice house and in a great neighborhood too with a community pool and park. Technically signed 1 year lease but I could give 30 days notice. I think I would share a wall but don’t remember. 2 sinks. Big kitchen. He’s also getting a hot tub and pool table. 

2nd house: No deposits at all. No signed lease. Nice house. Shared bathroom but with a girl. He’s making a movie theater room and there’s a pool in the backyard. It would be 2 guys 1 girl. The two guys seem really cool and easy going and easy to get along with. He also has a little dog who is adorable. They love sports. They are super chill and would be month to month. Only one sink in the bathroom. Kitchen is medium. Then backyard is huge. And it’s in a nice neighborhood. Bf and Mom thinks to go with this one. 

Both are really close to my current job and the one I interviewed for today. If I pay cash for the first one it’s 675. Second one is 700.",25Apr2019,1
507,"For three nights I've had sexual dreams / fantasies about my brother. Now, let me get this straight cos this is where ""seriously weird"" manages to get even weirder. I'm a guy, 18 years old. I have two big brothers, one is 21 and the other - the one in the dreams - is 24 years old. However, the dreams / fantasies take place when I'm about 5 or 6 and he's 11 or 12.

Yeah... you read that correctly. I hope you don't downvote and then run away and hide from my strange post.

The disturbing thing is (I mean, it's all a bit disturbing isn't it...) I was actually sexually abused as a kid, when I was six y/o by my year 2 teacher and when I was nine y/o by one of my coaches at tennis club. But I have no memory of my eldest brother (or both of my brothers, for that matter) abusing me like that at all. And these dreams / fantasies feel incredibly real. Yet, I have a decent relationship with him in real life. I've never avoided him or anything. I'd say I'm definitely closer to my 21 y/o brother but that doesn't really mean anything. I still love my big brother.

But these dreams / fantasies are pretty graphic and feel pretty real. And he isn't just molesting me or something, he's full-on penetrating my anus.

510,"I met this girl a couple of months back and we hit it off very fast. Almost immediately we got very deep and personal with each other. We confided in each other more than we have with anyone before. We were also very intimate and active in that aspect of the relationship. She has many insecurities most of which are physical so I do everything I can to respect them and help with them. We got into our first argument recently which was a result of her not wanting to have a serious talk about where this relationship is going. She explained that it made her uncomfortable so I apologized and told her that I understand things are uncomfortable but need to be talked about. After that I left the subject alone for about a month. Now I am getting ready to ship out for the army and have been bringing up the topic quite frequently. She has said that she wants to commit and have a relationship with me but I haven’t seen proof of it. I tried to sit her down and talk to her to tell her how much I cared for her and wanted to see this through but I needed her to actually commit with her heart and not just say it. I tried to talk to her for 3+ hours and she didn’t say a single word, she only shrugged. I understand it’s not an easy decision especially with me leaving for the army. I don’t want to go to basic thinking that when I’m done she will be waiting for me when she’s actually with a new guy or just not interested in me anymore. Through all of this I never said anything harmful or insulting to her but she has said some pretty rude and uncalled for things. She also told me that she doesn’t want to be with me anymore just to see how I would react to it which tore me apart. To her I am the bad guy and she doesn’t think anything that she has said or done is wrong. Her friends, family and even her all say it is my fault that this relationship is deteriorating. She is too prideful to admit that anything she does is wrong and I feel like that is how we got to this point. It’s almost to the point of hubris. I really don’t know what to do anymore so I would appreciate some advice because I care for her so much and would hate to see all the time, effort and emotion I put into this go to waste.

511,"I’m going for my 20 week anatomy scan today for my first pregnancy. We’ve been to ultrasounds before but apparently this is a biggie for pregnancy. Tbh I didn’t think it was but I’m very wrong according to everyone else. 

My SO fully expects me to ask for multiple ultrasound photos to give to his family and mine. 

I want no part of it. I do not feel comfortable doing that. If they want to see the pictures we get than I’m fine with that but I’m not okay giving anyone a copy or an extra print out of my baby.

Interestingly enough, I apparently don’t compromise enough cause it’s not like I gave up everything to carry this child right? I also compromised on how to tell the families which didn’t work out right but hey I still gave everyone what they wanted at my own expense. I gave up things I enjoy because of this baby as well as doing things I don’t necessarily like because of it too. 

I have horrible anxiety and bipolar depression issues and being pregnant unable to take meds for baby’s safety, on top of the psycho hormones from baby, I’m losing what little of my mind I have left. And what little control I have in my life I’m grasping on to for dear life and rn not giving away pictures of my baby is one of those tiny pieces of control I have left. 

My issue is that my SO knows how horrible this pregnancy is for me and how awfully I’m dealing with it and how shit my emotions are and what triggers the 30 minuets of balling my eyes out and what causes a screaming match. 

Yet he’s decided that this one thing I won’t budge on is rude and stupid and how can I not be fine with giving pics to our families and why can’t I understand that this is a give and take thing and that I have to compromise sometimes and why can I not just be okay with it?

I’m far from okay with it and I’ve read online that there’s lots of other women like me but I just don’t know how to handle him and how to appropriately and calmly (well as calmly as I can) talk about this with him because he gets super defensive if I even seem to not agree with him.

525,"My mom took my son to visit relatives yesterday while I had other plans.  This morning she informed me of his bad behavior, and I am absolutely at a loss.

My grandmother and aunt had toys out in the kitchen that they were preparing to take to donate. 

Apparently my son saw them and this was the cause of the poor behavior.  Though I could not get my mom to describe my son's actions she did use words like ""shameful"" ""selfish"" ""horrible case of the gimmies."" And that he embarrassed my mom and mom says he would probably not be welcome back if I don't go apologize for his behavior. 

But after asking my son about the situation he seemed a. Ashamed of his behavior.  He couldn't look me in the eye when we talked.  And b.  Like what he did wasn't that bad.  

He tells me he didn't touch the toys. He didn't ask if he could have them.  And he didn't cry when he was told they weren't for him.  I will of course be following up with adults, but I do believe him.

So what did he do that was so bad then?  He's a 5 year old boy.  He literally just had a birthday less than a week ago.  To me, thinking the stuff might be his wasn't a stretch. And it sounds like he wasn't rude about it when he found out it wasn't.

From what I do gather he asked a lot of questions about the stuff.  But I can't understand why he's been barred from family visits because of curiosity.

Honestly I am at a loss.  If the adults think he was bad enough behaved for punishment, I want to discipline him appropriately.  But I just don't understand what he did wrong, and I can't punish him for being 5, can I?

So I need advice from people who aren't his mother but have as much info as I do. What do I do?

However, we have been hanging out multiple times as a group with our mutual friend. But things got spice up when we just come back from recent trip. We did not sit near each other on the bus but whenever we laugh at some jokes we tend to make eye contacts a lot. Plus he's been trying to get my phone lock password multiple times.

530,"Just looking for someone to give some advice here about my current situation..
Been in healthcare for 8 years now and have been looking for a way out since year 3 or so but was burdened with school debt. After year 4 I moved to the Middle East to make some tax free salary (paid off my loans in &lt;6 months) and travel (8 weeks of vacation here). The benefits have been great so I've stayed in the Middle East for 4 years as well. Been able to help my family out a lot, save a good bit of money for future education, house, whatever, and have just freed myself up. 
I'm single, no kids, debt free and can do anything I want right now but I'm having a hard time leaving the Middle East to pursue 'other interests.' and it's taking a toll on my mental health I think.
I'm tired of being 'so responsible' with my money and my life and I just want to go out there and fuck up, make mistakes, and live a more spontaneous life. 

Some history of me. My parents are both broke. My mom lives in US, doesn't have health insurance, works two part-time jobs making $9/hr. My Dad gets social security and moved to Mexico to improve his quality of life. Recently had massive surgery down there but is doing ok now. My bro, sis, and I all graduated college and are doing well in our respective careers. 
I've always been fiercely independent and don't mind making sacrifices and doing difficult things. My main reason for staying in the Middle East now is just the money..as I don't really feel the interest to travel anymore and I'm pretty sure I've been steadily falling into a pretty deep depression where I don't want to do anything, see anyone. The only thing that makes me happy is going to the gym and watching football. I barely even cook anymore...something I loved to do. 

So I'm thinking of staying here a few more months and then going to live in Asia for a few months and get my mental health back. From there...I don't know.
 I'm jealous of those people who just 'know' what they want to do and have always stuck to it. I've been almost ADD and interesting in so many things. I used to love aderrall in high school because for the first time I could really focus on just one thing. Having a cell phone and constant access to the internet hasn't helped my ability to focus at all. Maybe I need to meditate more and quiet my mind because right now I feel like I'm all over the goddamn place as you might have guessed if you read this whole post.",25Apr2019,1

537,"Hi, thanks in advance for reading, and help would be appreciated. I’ve been getting my medicine from my primary doctor for years. It’s adderall, I know lots of people have different opinions on this medicine but I wanted to be up front, I’ve had ADD for as long as I can remember and work a very demanding job where it helps me a lot. I don’t abuse it, I use it as intended.

Because it’s adderall I need to get a written prescription every month. A few days before I run out I usually call the office, the doctor writes the prescription and I pick it up and drop it off at a pharmacy. Yesterday I called and the secretary told me that he was retiring and wouldn’t be in anymore, all of his patients were being transferred to a new doctor down the hall. She gave me the number and I called their office explaining the situation, but apparently the new doctor cannot fill a prescription for me until they see me. The earliest day I could get an appointment was May 9th.

This means that because my doctor decided to retire and not tell anybody (his secretary said they were going to alert his patients “in a couple weeks”. Why.) now I will not be able to get my medicine for 2 weeks until my appointment. So for 2 weeks at work I’m going to be struggling.

What if this was a life-or-death medication that I needed a refill of? Would I still be shit out of luck? What if this was something I had to take every day?

Is there any way possible- any way in hell I can get this? It just seems like such an unfair screwed up system of doing things. Please let me know what you think. I already tried calling new offices around the area to see a new different doctor but they don’t have any openings until even further away.

My mom has been dropping hints of wanting me to get a higher degree or double major, and while I'm not opposed to getting a master's, I have no idea what career I want.

I only have vague dreams of connection people and developing discussion in the world. That's it.

I feel like I have to support everyone and figure everything out and pay off college and be successful. It is all so much.

I don't even have friends. It is so hard for me to reach out to people because I can't imagine why they would even talk to me. It stresses me out. People are constantly partying and I don't want any part of that. I'm not stupid. I'm not going to waste my time just to STILL have no friends and fail a class.

I don't know how to cope.",25Apr2019,1
540,"I’m currently finishing up my second semester of my freshman year at college. I’ve decided to drop out. School really just isn’t for me, it never has been, but I hoped college would change my mind. It didn’t change my mind, and now I’ve wasted over 17k of my parents money only to have somewhere around a 1.8 - 2.0 gpa. 

My relationship with my parents has never been great, especially with my dad. Sometimes we get into pretty heated verbal fights, but really, we don’t ever talk. We see each other every day, but neither of us ever say a word to each other. It’s sad, really. I can’t remember ever having a normal conversation with my dad about anything. During some of our arguments he’s mentioned he can’t wait for the day I leave the house. 


My relationship with my mom isn’t great either, although recently, within the past year, we’ve both been making an effort to be better to each other. That doesn’t mean we don’t fight often, but at least I can talk to her about some things. 


I’ve just about made my mind about dropping out. But I’m also considering transferring to a community college to at least get some level of higher education. I just really don’t know what I want to do with my life, and I don’t know where my heads at, but I’m definitely not in the right mindset to be going to school. I really just went to college to try and make my parents proud. But now I’m more worried about myself, my own mental health and my own future, more than whatever my parents will think of me.


The biggest problem is that I have no money, and I don’t really know what to do. I don’t have a real job right now, as I made an agreement with my mom to focus more on school after my poor grades in the first semester. That plan didn’t work out. My grades are even worse this semester than last. My only income is from helping me mom at her job (she runs a housekeeping service) but it’s not much and I don’t work often enough to make a significant income. I have a little over $3,000 saved up as of now. I’ve been looking everywhere for jobs for the past few weeks, and now I’m just waiting for any replies. 

I really don’t know how my mom will react if I drop out, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all of this is what tips my dad over the edge and I get kicked out of he house. 


I just need some advice about whether dropping out is really a good choice given my situation, and in the likely event that I get kicked out, what next? I’m prepared to work multiple jobs to keep myself afloat. I’ve considered joining the military, but I’m unsure if that’s the direction I want go in life.

551,"Basically I became friends with this girl and decided after a few months that I didn't want to hang out with her any more. Our hang outs ended up becoming her dumping all of her negative shit onto me and I would leave feeling drained and worse than I did before.  She was depressed and was seeking help for it, but it didn't stop our hang outs becoming 4 hours of her criticising everything about herself and everyone else we knew etc. I also have mental health problems and was becoming triggered by hanging out with her as it was bringing all of the not so nice things I think about myself up.

So I decided I'd do a slow fade, and she would hopefully get the hint.

555,"At the beginning of February, my husband and I decided we wanted to look into adopting a dog. We lost our senior dog the beginning of this year and were ready to try and open up our home up to a new guy or girl. We found a family in our neighborhood that was looking to rehome their lab because both the husband and the wife were working full time and had 3 children, so they didn't have any time for their guy anymore. We talked for a while and decided we wanted to meet him, and we ended up taking him home that same day.   


Once we got him, we realized that we were a little in over our heads. He is terrified of cars and whenever we get in one he throws up almost immediately. The issue with this is that my husband and I move often, we've lived in 4 different states within the last 3 years. We move a lot because of his job, and we also have to travel a lot because of his job as well. Sometimes he has to go to a different location for a month or two and I go with him, so that's even more driving. Basically, we go on a lot of road trips and it would be hard on our new guy.   


He's young so he's very playful, he always wants to play with other dogs. He cries when he hears our neighbors dog because he wants to play with him so bad, so we felt a little guilty taking him away from his home because he had other dogs he could play with and kids. Not only that, when we take him on walks he overpowers me. I know training takes a while, but it's been tough because I don't want something to happen and I lose grip of his leash and he runs into the street.   


With all that being said, my husband and I thought we weren't a good fit for him because he needed more space to play and other dogs to be around. We knew our lifestyle would be tough on him and if we found him the right family before we got attached, it would work out better for him in the long run. So, we contacted a rescue that works with his breed to see if they were interested, which they were, but the problem is it took them two months to find him a foster and now my husband and I are really attached.   


So, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should contact the rescue and tell them we've changed our minds, because if I did that then he may miss an opportunity to go to a great home with more space and possibly other dogs to play with. He most likely won't have to move around every year or go on long road trips, but I can't help but wonder if he could get over his fear of being in a car. I don't know, what would you guys do if you were in my situation? If I tell the rescue I've changed my mind, I don't want to make them angry with me because they have been trying to help us out. I'm just so torn on what to do. At this point, he feels like our dog and if we gave him to another family I would feel heartbroken. Please give me some advice,  I'm truly conflicted.",25Apr2019,2

17 m. I took shrooms and my for some stupid reason talked to my mom. She thinks I’m on marijuana. That was over 2 weeks ago. Since then, she’s accused me many times of being high when I haven’t been. That was only my second time being high ever. 

It’s gotten so bad she thinks I’m addicted and plans to drug test me monthly until I’m 18 (~2 months) and kick me out for using drugs.

My eyes apparently look bloodshot but I don’t think so. I don’t know what to do, if I get kicked out I’m definitely going to have to be homeless for a few months and I don’t know if I could do that.

I have tried talking to her that I wasn’t high those nights but she doesn’t believe me and when I try to convince her everything is ok she makes it really get intense and starts yelling and on the border of physically hurting me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m already super stressed as I’m at work every night right after school and I don’t have the capacity to deal with this.

She’s a therapist and knows I was really depressed last year to the point of suicide but didn’t do anything to help me.

So. I live with my aunt and uncle and it's not the best situation since I came out but things have been fair as of recent. I just have a lot of things being thrown on me. My aunt is having me play caretaker to her son, who is in his 30s, my uncle and all of the animals. While she and my sister take a nearly 2 month trip to Arizona. 

I've been wanting to leave for a long time. Years, honestly. But I cant shake the feeling that I'm doing something wrong by leaving, while they're away. I'm looking at moving out next week, and that's before they fly out. Everyone has been telling me it doesn't matter and I just need to go. But I'm confused and torn. My aunt is very controlling, very confrontational. I know that there isnt anything that they can do, but shes threatened the cops on me and my friends sometimes, if they come to close to the house to pick me up. No one I talk to is understanding that I'm really fucking scared. 


I'm trying to come up with an excuse as to why I leave to try and lessen the blow but I cant even bring myself to talk to her to say it. Every time I build up to go do it, she tells me another thing that I ""have"" to do and I lose the courage. I dont know why. 

I'm ready to move out. I want to move out. And I know I can pick myself and walk out the door right now, because I'm not a child, but I feel so pressured to not do it. Like I have to do what she wants. And because I dont know the consequences I'm just too scared to even think of leaving. I've had friends tell me to just pack up and go in the night. When everyone is asleep, but I'm scared of that too. It feels like I'm stuck even though I know I'm not. I know that she'll make me out like this awful villain to my family, do everything to make them hate me, but I love them. And I dont want them to see me like that. But I'm going crazy here. I have been for years. I dont want to live somewhere with all the judgment and lies. Yet I still feel like I cant leave. 


My friends arent understanding no matter how hard I try to tell them. I know I can leave. I know I am 20 years old, so what can she honestly do if I go? But I feel so much pressure. I'm paranoid and anxious. And I dont know what to do. I feel pressure from my friends to just go, but I feel pressure from my aunt that I cant. And I just feel really lost.",25Apr2019,1

I'm young, but I don't think I have a single friend who hasn't been alcoholic, anorectic, bulimic, clinically depressed, drug addicted, suicidal or otherwise mentally ill in the past 5 years.

I study in a college and have an upper class life to be honest. I'm not rich but my country, Mexico, is poor as shit so I have never had to struggle for anything and it makes me feel worthless.

My girlfriend has been in the shitter in the past and she sometimes does things that worry me very much. She has problems with her family and it's all sort of ""in balance"" but she downplays her problems all the time. Either way, she's done things like getting blackout drunk a couple times, she used to do drugs in high school, all her friends are kind of the same. She's very smart and doesn't want to be that way but sometimes she just is and I don't know what to do.

I feel like the career I'm studying will push me into a path of loneliness, where the only way of staying ""on top"" and earning money is to be a Tyler Durden with no friends, family or attachments.

I've gotten into politics time and again and I feel the most utter disappointment.

All my colleagues and classmates treat sex like they don't care about themselves or their bodies, I feel everyone my age is trying to self-destruct and no one know what they are doing.

I feel tired of being composed and centered and responsible. I want to be like my girlfriend and do stupid shit and then have other people fix it for me. I want to be like my friends and ""struggle"" and just die quicker. I want to get blackout drunk and cut my veins and do all the drugs. I feel like every single cultural tendency around me is pushing my generation towards some form of suicide and I feel like there's no point to trying to fix it.

Sometimes I feel like no one wants to get out of their own cesspools. I feel like we are in a competition to see who's more fucked up. I stopped eating two days ago because I'm fucking angry and am taking it out on myself. I feel like maybe if I starve myself to death someone will give a shit.

I've never given into anything. All my friends always pressured me into drugs and the like but I always said no. I've always been responsible and centered. I've always been a perfectionist. I've never given into it but right now I want to be part of the human race and I don't think there's any other way. I don't know if I want to be at the margin of everything forever or if I want to just collapse into it.

565,"TLDR at the bottom 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a bio and psych major in my last semester of college. I needed to take an extra gen ed this semester to meet the requirements credit wise for graduation. My boyfriend is a computer science major and we've been together since freshman years so along the way i've learned some things and have always found it to be interesting. I figured I would take an intro/easy level class to try it out and well the whole world is moving towards all technology so if you cant beat it join it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend recommended a web development class so thats what I am taking. I love it and really do find that I can understand more of it than I thought I was going to be able to. Now my school is small, but the CS department is VERY small, as in about 50-60 students at the school are CS majors. There are also only 4 professors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so in the very beginning my boyfriend kind of gave me all the essentials to know (my teacher didnt go over anything and i am so not good with computers) he was showing me literally how to open the terminal and get to files and he showed me (and stressed how important it is) the proper way to format/space the code so that it looks nice. That was pretty much all he helped me out with at the beginning. I'm pretty anxious about school work so of course since its his major I asked him to look over all my code before I would hand it in. He would say it looked good, pretty much never making changes, and it ran through a validator to show there were no errors. Well the first test I got a C which I wasn't shocked at. I'm a terrible test taker but I thought lucky for me this class is mostly projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well not to make it too long but I had been going the same way the whole semester. Doing all my work, having my BF look through it once and sending it in. I thought all was well if he was always saying it looks good. Well three days ago he handed us all pieces of paper in class with our current grade, everything up to the final. I have a 64%. The only thing I have left to take is the final. I started panicking. If I fail this class (that I took for fun!) I won't be able to walk and I'll have to tell my family sorry not graduating. 

&amp;#x200B;

After class I go right to our SI (like a teaching assistant) and ask her if she could look through my stuff with me cause I'm freaking out. She's super nice. We go through all 600 lines of code for my project (this is a semester long one broken into parts) and she started getting so confused asking if this was actually what I handed in and I said yes. She double checked on my email I sent him. She asked me to explain my code to her so I did. She kept saying ""I don't understand how you don't have an A or at the verrrry least a B+"" and then all of the sudden she went ""wait, does he know Adam is your boyfriend?"" and I said ""yeah why"" and she said ""that's it. he thinks adam writes all your code."" she explained that there is nothing in that code that is wrong so there is absolutely nothing he can be giving me off for (except some spelling errors in the paragraphs and grammar) she said the things that make her think this are 1. the formatting is correct, and I am the only one in the class who has it done correctly 2. there was one line of the code (out of 600) that was written in HTML4 when we do HTML5, but my boyfriend learned before HTML5. and 3. my code is formatted exactly like my boyfriends and with so few students it is easy to pick out someones style. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, my boyfriend taught me how to format this and has helped me out very minimally here and there. He is smart, but he is definitely not a person to do an ounce more of work than they need to. I do not want to accuse my professor, but I can't fail this class. The thing is I can prove I did it and say ""I can explain and defend every one of my lines"" but the thing is I don't think a professor is ever going to admit to that if it is the case, and he he is ultimately the one who gives me my final grade. Do I just stay quiet and study really hard for the exam? I really want the grade I deserve, I don't care if another professor looks and says Yup thats D work at least I will know it's what I earned.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW: i'm not a native speaker, so i'm sorry if some sentences/words are not correct!

&amp;#x200B;

So,

First of all, i'll explain the situation in my class; i study arts and we're with around 17 people in our class, 12 girls, 5 boys. The girls hang out the most with the girls, the boys hang out the most with the boys. So we're kind of a tight boys friends group. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this 'friend', which i will call ""John"". He's been in my class for over 2 years now and in the beginning i didn't think too much of him. We weren't good friends and that didn't bother me since we are 2 different types of persons anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year:

&amp;#x200B;

We start talking more and more, until finally we become good friends, he comes over as a cool and funny guy. Until my other friend (which i have known for longer) starts pointing out to me that John does do some weird shit and tends to do things that i do. For example, i buy something, he buys it too. I do something, he has to do it too. I say something, he will repeat it, but louder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think much of it, cause for me personally, i thought it was pretty cool, having someone that might look up to me. UNTIL...

&amp;#x200B;

I started discovering that he's been lying about ALOT of stuff... and i'm not talking small things, i'm talking lying about full blown stories. Lying about situations where we (the boys group of our class) were actually there when stuff happened, so we would know when he was lying! Like full on lying into our face.

&amp;#x200B;

For example (so you guys know how bad it is):

&amp;#x200B;

\- New years evening: i get full on punched in the face by a random guy, resulting me to get driven to the hospital by a ambulance because the guy was drunk, bla bla blaaa. Anyway, after that John starts acting all big in class about how he punched the guy back, in the face. Which we knew was bullshit since we were there at the time and didn't see all of that happening. (Btw afterwards he even said to me, ""woaw the class is worried about you, but not about me? Like i have a whiplash too because of it!"", which we also find odd since he was able to do everything without any worries and we didn't see him getting punched at all.)

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""The other day i was talking to this random band in England, they're actually becoming really big right now! I sent them a demo we made with the band and they liked it! They sent the demo to fucking BBC and BBC thought it was dope!"" Which we didn't believe shit of, so a friend of mine said ""Oh for real? can you show me the message?"" Which he replied to: ""Ahh, nah can't right now, i ran out of data..."". So we knew it was a lie. Fast forward 1 day, my friend sends him a message: ""Yo can you send a screenshot of the text now maybe?"", which he replies to: ""Hahahah mannn, i was so wasted yesterday, that was all a joke!"", Okay, fair enough, atleast he admits it, right? Nope, wrong, 1 hour later another friend of mine asks: ""Yo what's up with BBC now, have you heard of them?"", which he replies to: ""Ahhh nahh, didn't get a reply...""

&amp;#x200B;

And these are only 2 of the lies he's been telling us for over a year now, if you guys want, i can post more in the comments in case you really wanna see how bad it is, just dont wanna make this post too long.

To add to this, he's been acting like a dipshit to us too, acting big, punching us as a joke, making us look like fools in front of the girls to boost his own ego, etc.

My question now is, after all this time, he finally admitted his wrongs, and feels sorry about it. And i must say, he is indeed truly sorry about it. He asks for forgiveness...

My point is: it is indeed sad for him, but man, honestly? I kinda hate him right now and do not want him around me anymore, he built a whole friendship on lies, which bothers me alot.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, please tell me, am i being a douche for not forgiving him? Or should i be upstraight and tell him to just leave me alone?

Thank you so much for anyone replying!",25Apr2019,3
570,For context I’m M17 and she’s F17.  I’ve had feelings for this girl since the moment I met her at school.  The highlights of my day are just saying hi to this girl in the hallway and whenever We hang out outside of school (only in groups) I love life.  We both make bad life choices and do stupid shit. Neither of us has had any real relationship but she talks to a ton of guys.  To top that off she is a spontaneous liar.  I know making a move on her would be an awful idea because if it fails it would mess up our friendship and tensions in our group. I sometimes dream about this girl and can’t seem to shake these feelings I have had for months.  Looking for advice on what to do. If I should drop these feelings how would I best to that?,25Apr2019,1

My home was flooded just over 6 years ago and recently we've had a lot of heavy rain. The drains in our street can't hold said rain and it overflows into mine and my neighbours gardens as well as the road.

I filed for unemployment after a few weeks of not being able to even get out of bed.  I applied for food assistance.  I have a child and support payments are due soon.

           On the night I found out I was using his phone and I snooped around to see what apps he had. I found something called “photovault” and the password was 4 of the same numbers. I was surprised I even got in. My heart sunk as I went through the pictures. I should have taken pictures for evidence but I was in shock and threw up. 
         It took me a week to confront him. When I did he deleted the evidence. I kept him around for 3 more weeks because I’m just an idiot. I’ve been keeping a close eye on him. .The female he took pictures of was one of my family members.  She’s 40 and has been through so much in her life. She was sexually abused as a child, had cancer and life hasn’t been too great to her. I just can’t seem to gather the courage to tell her. Why? Why can’t I?

576,"A little background information: I grew up in this church for as long as I can remember and I've always served faithfully especially in the worship band. I've always thought that one day, I would be a youth leader in my ministry because I always had the heart to serve this community. Up until recently.

I've been dating this guy for a few years now and I really do love him. I bring him to my church quite a number of times and my church friends seemed to be okay with him. And yes, he is mot a christian. I am aware of that. My church friends are also aware of that, I didn't see the need to hide this fact from them. 

As I got older and reaching closer to the age when I thought that ""sooner or later, I'm gonna be a youth leader!"" and that I was able to serve in a larger capacity than I currently can. But that day never came. I am already in university and in 2 years' time, I was going to transition out of the youth ministry into the adult's. I was sort of devastated. But at the same time, I thought maybe this wasn't God's plan for me. I thought maybe I was made to serve Him in other ways. As disappointed as I was, I continued to serve in worship and hoped that I could serve in this ministry as much as I can before stepping down.

One day, I was having lunch with a much younger youth (6 years younger). She was an innocent and cheery girl. She asked me, ""(my name), I've always thought you were going to be a great leader! I'm so sad that they didn't choose you."" I just laughed it off, saying that it was alright and I am happy with what I am doing for the church. And then, she said something that stung. Her intention wasn't to hurt me, believe me. She was too young to know and also, she didn't know how much being a youth leader meant to me. She said ""I think it is because your boyfriend is not a christian! ___ told me that it was one of the factors that made them not choose you. What a bummer, I think you could've been great etc."" 

Yeah so... turns out I wasn't able to be a youth leader simply because I chose to love the wrong person. At that point, I felt disappointed. Betrayed. Let down. I just... suddenly didn't want to do anything for the church anymore. I don't know if it seems stupid to you guys but.. it broke my faith. I've always thought us christians should be love one another. I thought we shouldn't judge each other. And yet, here I am. I am condemned by the community I grew up in and I feel my faith dying simply because I have a growing resentment for this so called ""loving"" community.

What do I do? Do I pretend I don't know anything and continue with my life? Is it wrong that I am dating a non-christian? Or do I have leave this community that I grew up with my entire life and migrate to another church community that would accept me?",25Apr2019,0

581,"When people heard about my way of life, they'll say I'm not a decent guy and got away from me, which is weird. I just wanna hear you guys' opinions and find out what's really going on, and tell me rights and wrongs. 

My ""3NH"" rule: NO WORKING TOO HARD. NO MARRIGE. NO TAKING CARE OF PARENTS. HAPPINESS FIRST. 

That's what I decided towards my whole life. I'm undergraduate and gonna do this July, and the way I see the society(I'm Chinese and living in CN), it doesn't allow me to live a normal person's life because I'm too lazy to work hard (it doesn't mean I don't wanna work at all, just stop working if I feel tired). 

Before I made my ""3NH"" rule, I calcucated what I need if I wanna marry and taking care of parents, and turns out it takes my whole life, both on time and money. 

First of all, I need to work hard after graduate for hard cash, then meet what parents need, it takes almost half of my hard earned cash; then get married in my young life, then I need to keep the relationship between TWO families (mine and hers), which could almost toast my brain and heart, then have child(s), and babysitting them, help them until they graduate and get work, of course it take tons of cash to send my kid(s) to from kindergarten to collage, and still need to work hard to make him(her/them) marry and have my grandkids. 
By then, I almost take my whole life in this b******t, almost nothing for my own, which I don't wanna be like this. 

I wanna live for my own, and only for my own, so I can basically rent a small apartment, have a job that offers reasonable money, and in my free time, play games (I'm a gaming geek), live an easy life, isn't that great? 

This is how I planned my whole life, and how exactly I get isolated by people (maybe), I don't know how my lifestyle has offended others or they just hate my being lazy.

582,"As an adult my social deficits are my biggest issue, I'm 36 and I've no friends but also I've never felt I've had friends or felt loved by anyone.

As a child I was the bottom of the social ladder. I had a few friends, and I do consider them to have been friends, but often they'd disown me if the opportunity to hang out with more popular kids came up. As an adult a friend who was practically my sister blanks me on the street, I've done nothing to deserve this and we're friends on Facebook but she shows no interest in friendship. Another childhood/teen best friend isn't really a friend any more...we don't see each other, she had a post today praising her current best friend, I see a lot of posts between her and someone on my friend list I introduced her to (someone who lives abroad but I met via my ex) where they talk to each other via PM and phone or send each other gifts...it's just weird my old best friend is now better friends with a stranger than me.

As an adult I made friends at work, after months of being on my own at work I finally made friends - we'd go out to bars and clubs a few times a week, we had a big group I could be myself with. But I had to move to a new job so we started drifting apart, I got my boyfriend a job with them but of course when he and I broke up it meant he maintained a stronger connection with my friends as he was working with them (some friends even stopped being my friend after the breakup). I still see my old friends are friends with my ex boyfriend years on, but not with me, I see they go camping or have house parties together.

I've never had friends I can just hang out with, call up to go to the cinema with, who just pops round for a cup of tea, who calls for a chat, or who regularly messages with me. I'm struck by the fact that often when I've spent time with adult friends it's one-on-one, I've had friends who'll arrange to catch up at a bar or café but it doesn't occur to them to invite me to something with their other friends. I'm an afterthought. 

I find it distrubing that someone can mean something to me and I'd want to establist a friendship but they don't feel the same way, people I'd call friends barely consider me a friend and will move on as of I'm absolutely nothing. It's a one in a million thing for me to meet someone I can connect with, but then to the other person this connection may be the norm for them so it's not a big deal and doesn't mean friendship.

I'd like to think I could make a good friend given the opportunity, I'm loyal and non-judgemental. Due to depression I'm not the most fun person in the world right now, but then that's due to the fact I'm so lonely and socially isolated so maybe finding 'my people' would be the key to that.

I don't think I've had friends for maybe a decade. 

I'm long-term unemployed so don't get to meet people via work or have money to find new hobbies. I volunteer, when I have spare money I try to go to free events or join classes, but I still don't make friends or even connect with anyone...everyone else has friends, meanwhile I always find myself standing around like a freak. 

I went to Meetup which was great for a while, I didn't connect with anyone but at least I was going out socializing and meeting new people, but then I met someone I got on with better than anyone I'd ever met before. I ended up dating this guy from the Meetup group I went to, it was all like a dream at first but he became abusive and so we broke-up...this meant I could no more go to Meetup groups, furthermore it meant I also can't go to my normal haunts as this ex and the Meetup group often go there. This break-up was around ten months ago and I've made no progress meeting new people or making new friends since then. I've ran out of ideas to meet people, and I'm not sure I can even make friends. 

Having friends, going out to clubs or exploring new things, finding love...all these things mean so much to me but I don't get to have them.

Aside from struggling to meet new people in my situation, and not knowing how to go from meeting someone to making friends, I feel like there's just something so fundamentally wrong with me that I'll never have friends... certainly not real friends or a big social group as I'd like. 

I'm not sure what to do.

587,"I broke up with my ex last year. She was feeling insecure and anxious  throughout our relationship (feelings that were present from the beginning). These issues caused her to feel jealous without reason and afraid of abondement, which in turn lead to a push and pull dynamic. A long story short: I never felt she trusted me and it broke my heart.

Some background information: We are from different countries and met online. First I went to visit her for three months. Later she came to my home country (her first time ever abroad). After three months here we traveled to stay in another country because her visa ended. After three months there we returned to my country. Things didn't work out and she went back home. We were still together, and she returned as a student 5 months later. Finally we were in what I thought would be a stable situation. 

My ex longed for stability, but at the same time she self-sabotaged any chance of it through her worries. Her worries were of course to some extent justified since our life together was not settled. In the first part of our relationship she had the habit of threatening to leave me. This happened when I had done something that triggered her fears. Once I didn't tell her right away that I was meeting a female friend of mine for a coffee. I didn't say anything because I was terrified of her reaction, and I knew from past experience that she would not be okay with it. I ended up not going. Another time she got upset with me because of a bad dream she had, and because I got up earlier than her in the morning. There and then she basicly accused me of cheating. Or another time, for smiling at a cashier. Her reactions could be extreme and, to be honest, quite frightening. She would keep me from sleeping, follow me around the house, leave me alone on the streets, lock me out of the apartment and even kick me out of the bed. Obviously I got deeply upset, I begged her several times to please believe me that she was the only one for me. She did apologize, and she was also loving and caring towards me, but then she would say I was being evasive and dubious and that I put our relationship at risk. And yes, I think I was evasive, but I was walking on eggshells and I tried to avoid conflict. 

After a particularly bad episode she went back to her home country and started therapy. She really wanted to make amends, improve herself for me and for us. I hoped that things would turn around. But at this time I felt resentful and angry. How could she, if she loved me, treat me so badly? Since she was on the road to improvement I shared my thoughts with her. In hindsight I know I handled this situation in a destructive way. I should have gone to therapy myself and not unloaded all my anger on her. But I didn't and I had no one to talk to but her (I could have talked to other people, but I didn't because this was the kind of things I had been punished for by her in the past). Once I hung up on her on the phone because she was suggesting that I could move to her country. I felt that was no option at all because she had hurted me and the trust was not rebuilt yet. I got pretty mad at her because I thought she didn't understood how her actions had affected me. I was really not doing well emotionally, and I had lost motivation for life and I could not be as strong as before. I asked her that she had to give me time, and she did, but she also struggled with her own issues and guilt. She did tell me that she thought it would be better for her to stay in her safe environment where she could continue therapy and have stability. I don't think I really understood how important this was back then because I was to focused on how mistreated I had been. In the end she traveled across the globe to be with me and I could not offer her all that she needed financially. I was also a student with limited resources. But I did try to make it work, and I really wanted it to work and I helped her with practical things, tried to find social activities for her, language course etc. 

Sadly, the accusations continued. This time she said I was being emotionally unavailable, withdrawn and avoident. My experience was that I did my best, but that my best could not be the same as before. I had to set some limits, but I do think I felt resentful still. But this happened also because she would not give me time, and in a way needed the drama to continue - or that's how I felt it anyway. Stupid things became problems, such as me relaxing and watching TV after a long work day. She felt that I was being withdrawn and that I should talk to her instead. This reaction I can understand since she had been alone for quite some hours in a foreign country where she didn't knew anybody. But she didn't tell it to me like I've written it her, instead she got upset. At times I could snap at her when she picked a fight with me or when she - once again - accused me for trying to make her jealous. And then when Christmas came her anxiety went sky-high. She suddenly said she didn't wanted to visit my familiy for Christmas, hours before the bus was leaving. We had a fight, she said she hated me and in the end I went alone. When I was on the bus she regretted the whole thing and wanted to come after all, because, according to her, it was important to me. She came on Christmas eve, everything was fine, but then a few days later she started to act hostile towards me and my family. Not participating in conversations and giving me the silent treatment. I had enough and I broke up with her.

This was so hard. I loved her, I still do. We still spent time together which went a lot better than in the previous months. We weren't living together, and so I manged to be energetic and engaged with her during those times. I think this confused her, it confused me too. Eventually she went back to her home country, she saw no point in continuing her studies. After that she wanted to return again, but then her mother died and she stopped talking to me. Some time later she sent me a letter wherein I was painted black as the person who had spent a year using a ""formula"" to destroy her: to guil trip her, humiliate her, abuse her, take revenge etc. I wrote her a reply wherein I apologized for the things I had actually done, making sure not to defend myself, but wherein I also avoided to address the things I disagreed with. For example she wrote that I talked about me feelings to guilt trip her.

Now I'm a bit messed up. I don't know how much I contributed to her pain. I know for sure I never intentionally wanted to hurt her. But did I do something subconsciously to take revenge? Did I keep my love away from her, and in a way trigger some of her reactions. I feel guilty and I want to talk to her. We recently messaged each other, and she still feels this way and she says I'm lacking self-awareness. I know it would be unhealthy of me to take the blame for her actions, which I'm not going to do. But if there's anything I could do or say to help her heal, I want to do it. After all, she did sacrifice so much for me and she really did try her best, although it failed. Even so, I can't stop thinking if deep down I just want to talk to her to eliminate my own pain. Am if so, am I actually just being selfish?

I live in a building with 3 other families, my mom and sister went to the laundry and when they came back they left a bag with the jackets and our family tablet inside, in the staircase while going to the supermarket, we always leave stuff there cause its safe, no one from the outside can see and only people from the building have access to the staircase.
Is there any way to track the device? The WiFi is always off, and the location too.

596,"*For context, I'm not that old, nowhere near the age this thing commonly occurs. I may or may not have ADHD or ADD. Both my brother and father had it so I wouldn't be surprised, but I've never been properly diagnosed.* 

Hello everyone, over the past couple of years I've realized that my memory is (and probably has been) terrible. I used to think that it was just normal and *""humans are just naturally forgetful""* but recently I've been talking with my father about past family experiences and it occurred to me just how much I *don't* remember. Whole family outings, major life changing events, and day to day memorable moments are just absent from my mind. I forget a lot of things! Both big and small. I'm not sure why either, sometimes I feel like my brain just *isn't* recording anything and not *deleting old footage*. But whatever it is, it's starting to take a toll on me. I feel saddened by just how many experiences I've had but cannot recall, it scares me. 

*here's some information about how I think my memory works, I am not a professional but maybe you are, and maybe this means something to you*

So to start off, what can I remember? Well I can remember important information about myself, name, age, occupation, birth date, as well as other vital information. I can sorta remember some childhood memories like my old childhood house, the school I went to, where I was, and *some* childhood events. I would say I remember 10-20% of all major childhood events (but that number is what I *feel* like, obviously not an actually statistic)
As an adult, I basically only remember highly memorable moments, like vacations, tragedies , and other memorable events. 

That brings me to things I can't remember. Not only do I not remember most life events, I can't even remember *when* the events I do remember even happened. I always have to work out when I graduated or when I went somewhere memorable. I also don't remember most day to day events. This actually messed with me quite a bit recently, I had accidentally misplaced an item of someone's and caused them a lot of trouble in the process. But not only do I not remember where I put it, I don't even remember what that thing was, what I was doing with it, or that I had ever had any contact with said item begin with. It's definitely troubling in every day life. I can't remember events I've signed up to, I can't remember the name of half my friends. I don't know who I've lost contact with. I can't remember most of what I've learned unless it's something I remind myself with often. I forget thoughts, ideas, people, places, events, news, stories, things I've done, and countless other things. 

So I've basically turned to Reddit to help me out. I really only have a couple questions. Is this fixable? I live in America, where do I go to get help? What professionals do I need to see? Is there anything I can do myself to help my brain out? Is this a sign of earlier onset Alzheimers? 

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",25Apr2019,1
597,"Using throwaway account.

 My best friend (F/17) is overweight and has recently opened up to me about her struggles with losing weight. Basically, she wants to starve herself so she can lose weight fast. As a result she's started a five day ""fast"" where she doesn't eating anything, only drinks water and Mountain Dew. She has lost five pounds in two days and she seems really happy.

598,"Sorry for any errors - I wrote this on mobile.  

About two weeks ago at work, I was going through Boss’s desk to try and find a file that another department had questions about. (this is not out of the ordinary - on weekends or evenings if we need something, we will usually look through Boss’s files to see if they have files we need. Boss has told us before this is okay, just be neat and try to keep everything in the same order). Boss had left early that day, it was late afternoon/early evening, and few employees were left in the office. So I was thumbing through files looking for the one the other department had asked about and happened to see my name flash across one of the files. I probably shouldn’t have, but I thumbed through until I found the file and read it. 

It turned out that it was an email exchange that had been printed out by Boss with our company’s manager administrator, aka Big Boss. Boss was emailing Big Boss about our quarterly reviews and was talking about how my performance has suffered and I’ve docked up a large number of errors since the beginning of the year. The line that sticks out to me the most was “sudokusalad’s already racked up 20 errors this year. Their decline has been coming for a while.” Big Boss replied by saying that Boss should issue me a verbal warning and, if my errors continue, a written warning. 

I was really stunned and actually very hurt by this for a number of reasons. Number one being that I do not consider myself to have a “decline coming.” In 2017, I was one of the only employees of our company to have minimal errors and be recognized for high performance each quarter. Secondly being that I have had an extremely rough year so far, and 2018 was also rough for me. I had to borrow money from my 401k plan to help prevent my mother and sister from being evicted from their apartment in July of 2018, and my longtime (almost 9 years) partner lost their job. In December my mother and sister were officially evicted, and I had to call out of work to help them. Currently, my partner has still not found a job and the negative effects can be felt by both of us in a number of ways, especially mentally for both of us. So if I am on a “decline” then the decline has only been coming for less than a year. 

Third, Boss also speaks with me closely and considers me to be a friend. Boss often confides in me and tells me things they are annoyed about with other coworkers, Boss will tell me new things and memos ahead of time, and Boss and I have spent time as friends during work engagements and outside of work.

I am not looking to make excuses for my work performance. I know my errors are my fault and my fault alone. However, Boss knows all of the things I am going through. I confide in Boss about my problems and troubles because I really view Boss as a mentor, and I value their advice. I guess am just hurt that Boss would word the email the way that they did. You would think Big Boss would be the one commenting on my “decline” and other negative aspects about my performance - not Boss. I know that this is probably what I get for being “friends” with Boss, but it still hurts.

Since I found the email, I feel that I am not enjoying my time at work and I have also received two errors alone this week. I really do love my job and the people I work with and the things I do. However, I’ve found myself now taking everything that Boss does at face value. I’m constantly worried Boss is upset with me, I get stomach aches worrying about my performance and if I’m going to get errors, and I feel unhappy. I’m trying not to make a big deal out of it, but I can’t help it. It’s probably just an overreaction because I already have so many other problems on my plate, but trying to calm myself down isn’t helping.

I really don’t know what to do. Should I confess to Boss that I found the email and how I’m feeling? Should I wait until we sit down for the quarterly review and just re-affirm with Boss that I am not a bad employee, just dealing with bad circumstances? Am I unjustified feeling this way at all because I read an email I shouldn’t have? Please help me out Reddit.",25Apr2019,1
599,"I’m 22 years old, just got into bitcoin gambling online. I heard about it last week, and deposited some money. Two days ago, I won $75,000. I was ecstatic and stopped, swearing that I wouldn’t gamble again and just go with my winnings. I withdrew it all and closed my account.

Ever since, I thought about how easy it was to win. So I opened a new account and deposited again. This time, I turned that $75,000 win into a total of $110,000 in winnings in just a matter of 1 hour. In just under 2 hours after that, that $110,000 went down to only $45,000. 

I immediately withdrew the $45k and closed my account. I just blocked access to the site on my computer and mobile. I am unable to access it without going through a few step process. I’m shocked at myself, I regret returning to the site and not leaving with my $75k in profit. I essentially went from $110k to 45k. I’m 22 years old and was betting between $15k-25k per round at times. I didn’t treat it as real money since it was so easy to gamble with a few clicks of a mouse. 

I know I have still made $45k which is definitely a large amount to me as a 22 year old, but I keep thinking back about how much I had made at my highest, and how easy it was to make. However I know that it is even easier to lose the money. I just can’t keep my thoughts off of it.

Firstly, I’m big on the importance of honesty and trust with every relationship in my life, weather that’s romantic or not. She new this and for the most part valued it. We were also in a long distance relationship. 

Recently, I think about 3 weeks ago now, she moved into a flat with two of her male coworkers. I had absolutely no problem with this because I trusted her with my life. 

Last night she seemed real off when I called her to catch up, so I text her afterward and I asked if everything was alright between us. This is where life went a bit off the tracks. She said she couldn’t hide it from me anymore and that she kissed her flatmate the night before. Her reasoning was because she wanted to at the time. 

I’m crushed. I feel completely alone and I have no idea what to do. We talked things through and she’s said she’s genuinely sorry and wants to stay with me but she thinks we both need a bit of time apart, I agree with this but the part I don’t know about is what do I do in the long run.

608,"So, I have a reputation of being shy, innocent (for some reason), kind and smart. I don’t really like that that’s how everyone sees me because they know I’m more of a passive person. 

I hear people in my class talking about me often, but I pretend I don’t hear. It’s mostly one particular group. Other classmates I hear talk about me occasionally and it’s normally a suggestion to ask to borrow a pencil or something but I heard someone say “well (*my name*) has depression” weird assumption, I thought, but didn’t say anything. This group though, seems to talk about me quite often. I can’t always hear exactly what they’re saying (I half block everything out when I hear people talking about me as I don’t want to know or I’d be concentrating on school work) but they seem to be talking about how innocent I am/act or how ‘smart’ or what a teacher’s pet I am.  I have the feeling they think I act this way for attention or something. Yesterday they said loudly that I’m “such a nice, good, kind girl” and when I looked away with an uncomfortable smile they started laughing. Whenever they borrow something from me they go “thank you so much, I LOVE you, you’re so nice”. One time one of them (and they’re friend) was in the band room when they weren’t supposed to and I told him the teacher would get mad, and then he shouted “I love you (my name)!” And proceeded to skip out into the hallway saying “I want to date you” and they started laughing. 
I often hear them talking about perverse things too. I’ve never heard them talk about anyone outside of their friend group in a perverse way, but today I heard my name pop up. 
“Imagine this: Imagine (my name) t-“ and they started laughing. I don’t know what they were saying because I tried blocking them out but then I heard one of them say “I wonder if she does that though” another said “Ask her then!” 
“ *No! I’m not asking her if she touches herself* “ (also, I was sitting right next to them). I tried to block them out by concentrating on my work but one of them called my name. They were all looking at me when I slowly turned around to face them. He paused and asked what team I played for in basketball (I know for sure he already knew). One of them shouted out something as I was trying to answer (it was something dirty I think but I wasn’t listening). 
I don’t know why, but I feel disgusted with myself because they talked and thought this way about me. (The answer to their question would have been no, but I still feel like I did something wrong). I wish they would just leave me alone or at least treat me like a normal human being, but I’m not sure how to make it that way. I’m already awkward enough and especially around that group, now it’s gonna be harder to talk to them now that I’ve heard *that* . 

I’m not really sure how I should feel about this and I don’t really know what to do. Hearing people talk me makes me uneasy but I’d never guessed they would say anything like that.

609,"Ok so first off I'm using a new throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So recently I've been running into a lot of problems with a neighbour of mine in a college apartment block.  She lives in the apartment across the hall from mine. I first met her at the start of the year and we hung out a bit as I didn't really know anyone else and she seemed quite nice but over time certain habits started to become more and more apparent. For simplicities sake I'm just going to bullet point the worse problems.  
\- She frequently borrows things; cigarettes, alcohol, money and rarely if ever pays it back. When confronted about it she always claims she's ""had a really tough week"" and will pay it back next week but never does.

\- She constantly invites herself into my apartment regardless if me or any of my roommates are home, our lock isn't full functioning unless you slam the door so she has occasionally just straight up walked in without knocking because she was ""bored"". My roommates confronted her about this and she apologised but has done it several times since.

\- Whenever she's hanging out she will try to shift the focus onto her by bringing up a problem she's having but then refusing to elaborate on it until the attention has shifted away again.

\- She dropped out of college and so has a lot of free time and constantly badgers my roommates and I to hang out or go drinking despite the fact that we all have exams and assignments due. We informed her of this yet I still receive messages daily asking to go for drinks etc.

\- Lastly she is quite stubborn and rarely if ever admits to being wrong, this is one of the main reasons I'm making this post.

So recently this came to a head as my roommates and I were quite fed up so I ended up muting her on messenger and attempting to just ignore her (not the best idea I know). Usually I would gladly tell a person like this to just get lost and attempt to cut contact however she lives right next door and I'm likely going to see her around a lot which would be really awkward and uncomfortable. On top of this I am a bit worried that she may be going through some legit problems (she mentioned recently that she had stopped going to her therapy sessions) I feel that if I cut her off completely it could be really bad. Basically I need some advice on how to approach this in a way that hopefully will resolve most if not all of our problems, I really don't want to do something damaging to someone who may already be in a bad place.",25Apr2019,0

611,"One thing that has plagued and doomed me for many years is my desire to love passionately and be loved in the same vein, to have someone who loves me as much as I love them. Analyzing all of my experiences, though, shows that this desire, this everlasting yearning has done nothing but be an icicle in my chest and I need to be done with it. 

A friend of mine who has overcome that drive has said to realize what I want (in this case, romantic love), realize it'll never happen, and use that to make me stronger. He has also said he kills the things he loves from within. I have also started using exercise and music in an attempt to steel myself. I'm also putting my all into writing stories, among other things.

I moved last year and I haven’t seen them since then. Me and my friend message eachother from time to time. Anyways I’ll get on to the girl. About 6 months ago she said she has these “visions” which is out of her control and when she has them she gets extremely terrified. One of them is that she is getting robbed and my friend doesn’t help her when she’s begging for him to help her. Then she got in trouble at school for drawing pentagrams all over her desk. Then she was talking about death and “how great it would be” and she has a fascination with death, satanism and demons. Last Friday she had a meltdown screaming and crying over her teddy bear that my friend took it from her so deal with his anger. (He has Aspergers so he took her teddy bear and when he gets mad or sad he squeezes it and it helps with what he’s going through.) but the day before she said that he can use it for his anger.

I honestly can not take it anymore and it is driving me absolutely up the wall. I’ve tried to ask her to stop with the  unnecessary noises but she says that I’m to sensitive. I’ve asked her to reel in the negative attitude and comments but she tries to tell me that she’s right and convince me that I feel the same way. I can’t avoid her as we are required to work together and no matter how hard I try, she manages to bring her problems to me, whether she comes to my office, stopping me around the office to complain, or just being so vocally loud that I can hear her from anywhere in the office.

I’m at my breaking point and if she continues to work here I’m going to snap. I’ve encouraged her to quit if she’s unhappy and she agrees but then continues to come to work. It’s been years at this point and I’ve tried all of the basic techniques to deal with difficult people. We don’t have an HR department and my boss refuses to fire people unless they try to kill or bankrupt him basically.  

I’m desperate. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on how I can deal with Elizabeth?",25Apr2019,1
624,"Warning: long post 

My roommate used to be my best friend and we would let each other borrow our stuff all the time. The dynamic was kinda like “don’t even bother asking, I’m gonna say yes anyways”. Ever since we had a falling out (more on that later), we never addressed that policy. I think she’s still borrowing some of my stuff so I use her things, but I don’t bring it up in case she actually doesn’t want to let me and it’ll bother her. (Yes, I know this is really shitty of me. I don’t have an excuse,) 

So the fuckup: I borrowed her highlighter and makeup brush for five minutes and was planning to return both as soon as I was done using them. However, she walked in right as I was going to her room to put them back, so I had to hide them in my room and act normal. I was praying that she would go to the bathroom or something so I could just slide the stuff into her makeup bag and carry on but she didn’t. In fact, she did exactly what I hoped she wouldn’t and went to put her makeup on 😰

She was rummaging around a bit and said she couldn’t find her highlighter brush, so I played along and told her to look around for it, asking if she took it somewhere or something like that. Then she basically went through her whole bag and realized the actual highlighter palette was gone too. Then she was freaking out and trying to look for both, retracing her steps since she last saw and used them. She kept saying it was weird and confusing and I just had to play dumb. I tried to be as normal as possible but in my panicked state I’m not sure how “normal” that actually was. 

I was planning on hiding them between the wall and  the dresser where her makeup bag is and maybe suggest it had fallen/rolled away. The thing is, she’s basically torn apart her whole place and Idk how to return it to her and act like I had nothing to do with it. Unfortunately I think she may have an idea of my involvement because I think I was acting weird when she came in. 

Also, we have some weird history that makes things really tense between us. We used to be best friends in high school but she suddenly became very mean and distant when we entered college. I was so excited to room with her and be close but she started cutting me off and replacing me. I was really hurt but didn’t know why she was doing this. According to what she’s told people, she’s tired of me and doesn’t like being compared to me because she feels inferior. This was never really an issue before and she never addressed it with me, and if I’m going to be honest idk what she’s talking about. She is in many ways the better one between us, so I’m not sure why she would feel jealous. I had almost no friends due to my social anxiety, which led to some really bad depression last semester. I would vaguepost about how I felt on my finsta hoping she would reach out to me but she never did. Anyways, she stopped talking to me and also did a couple mean things including: making a secret Instagram and Snapchat group where she would complain about me to others; calling me a bitch roommate and saying I could catch her hands when my boyfriend slept over (she forgot that I asked her permission for him to come over); and when someone asked if I was doing okay, she said she didn’t care and didn’t want to talk about me. 

After all of that she finally confronted me. I tried to talk with her but I was just mostly crying and she was mostly yelling. I think it was supposed to be reconciliation, because she asked me if I still wanted to be friends and I said yes, but all that changed is that we make polite conversation now. 

So I’m still fairly certain she still doesn’t like me and probably put two and two together. Missing makeup+weird roommate = culprit. Also, she never got rid of that other Instagram account and I’m worried that she might be telling everyone that I’m basically a thief. Idk what to do with her stuff  and I’m freaking out. 

I have no justification, really, for what I did but in my defense I didn’t mean any harm. Also, I feel like borrowing her stuff sometimes is like revenge for her treating me bad. 

SOOO all of that to say: wtf do I do now because I’m panicking and I need to give her stuff back without incriminating myself. I absolutely will not give it back openly and tell the truth because I dug myself too far in this hole and don’t want her to hate me more than she already does. Again, I know I’m a shitty person and I don’t need to be reminded that.",25Apr2019,0
625,"Straight gonna dive in. I am not a social person and most likely because I cant perform in ball sports or f2f communication. I always felt weird from how people behaved me and I was always in a search. I just lost my trust to most of the people near me.. I just wanted to know how could I be sure if I have autism or not. Didn't ever talk to my parents about this and I am 16. I also can't seem to attract any girls since I never had a girlfriend.

626,"It's too late for her to back out of the move.   
Brief breakdown of reasons I am worried.  

-She's complained in the past about this roommate being a bad roommate with not picking up after herself, be it dishes, trash, stuff she puts down that has a place, etc.  

-She does not like roomates cat because he is a sphinx that roommate does not properly wash often so he gets kind of smelly and sticky. 

-The rent will be higher, but there will be less utilities to pay for, but that means *everything* is jurisdicted by roommates parents. My sister was struggling with the rent price in their previous apartment. 

-Roommates parents own the house they are moving into and while likely won't be involved in much house-goings-on, they in general are very strict people.  

-Roommates parents won't let their child (22 y/o) have her boyfriend over night in their house they (sister and roommate) are paying rent for.

-Roommates parents are renting a u haul for them to share, but are (in my sisters words) ""very strict about only moving roommates things and not my own"".

The entire situation just spells disaster to me and I'm worried shes going to go insane with roommates bad habits and over bearing parents who probably will frequently drop by. Roommate is an only child with a ""let me speak to your manager"" mom and a strict traditional dad, and I know this for a fact as my fiance was close with their family growing up. 

She's going to want a way out eventually and I won't have any advice for her and I don't even know what advice I need but I just know she's gonna have a mental break down.",25Apr2019,2
627,"Hello! I am 19 Male and have troubles of myself getting obsessed with a friend. This is my first time posting here on reddit so bear with me please.

I am obsessed with a male friend of mine because we were hanging out for like a few years now.. but everytime, I am SO desperate of having someone to talk to (Messenger).

We had our convo back then that whenever we have difficulties, We actually could help each other out. (We actually did!) then all of a sudden. When we played a game, I told him that I was sad about something. How do I get rid of being emotional and stuff. The way he told me is like this ""Emotions is our responsibility to control them, but it is our responsibility to take control of it"" (and there's more, etc). I immediately began thinking does he even care or not?. I know that he is right but all I wanted was a support or just a friend to be there for me. I don't even understand anymore...

After all of that, He told me that I should look for a therapist because of my emotions being like this.

It actually hurt my feelings when he said this, it sounded like that he does not really care.

I even looked at him like my brother or a close friend to me. But this just hurts... This happened like almost every week. We had a fight, then whenever we play games, we pretended that nothing happened. (This is continiously happening for like 5 years)


Am I in the wrong here? Should I just get rid of him but I'll just hurt myself? Was he right? I am confused...

I guess I am just stupid enough to think that I looked at him like my close friend, but not thinking if he actually thinks that way too..

So sorry if my post is confusing and if you have any clarifications, feel free to ask...

Please give me an opinion on this and How can I actually deal with myself being emotional...",25Apr2019,2

For those who read the full thing, thank you and all of the details, no matter how small they seem, pertain to the actual question or serve as backstory. 
 

Context: 

My boyfriend, our dog and I just moved into our place last June. It’s kind of set up like a townhouse/duplex where we are sharing a wall with another unit and there are two across from us that look identical, and then there are four more set up the exact same way next to us, separated by a walkway and the mailboxes. 

Before you can get to our place, you have to walk through a big cement area where the four garages are and then to the pathway. I hope this makes sense and I'm explaining this because it's not just one neighbor issue, it's multiple. 


Now, I know what you're thinking; if multiple people are having issues with just one person then don't you think that that one person is the issue?? 


And usually, I'd agree with you, but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong in this situation. I am doing everything in my power to keep in line with the rules and such, and I feel that I'm being mistreated. I'm getting ahead of myself, though.   

The story: 

The day we signed the lease, my direct neighbor (B), who I originally thought was a sweet, old woman, greeted us with smiles. I pet her small dog while she chatted with us about how much she loves living there and how her grandson (also living with her) has lupus, and how she's glad the old tenants had moved out because the husband was just *awful*, with one of those *killer pit bulls* and just went on and on about how much she despised him. 

I thought it was a really weird thing to bring up the same day we met, but shrugged it off cause she's old, y'know? 

I explained to her that I work nights, so connecting with me is pretty difficult. I didn't want to hand out my number quite yet (and glad for that), so I told her to please, if she has any issues just leave a note on my door and I will get it when I wake up around 8pm for my shift and deal with it accordingly. [she never did]


A couple of weeks go by and I never have any issues with her, or anyone else for that matter. 

Incident #1: One day, I was talked to by B and she explained that there was a gardener coming to take out all of the vines that were in my backyard. She said that they were ruining the fence, and that the owners wanted them gone. She is apparently the president of the HOA in control of our property, (which is true) so I didn't think anything of that, either. [i found out later they only gave her that position to get her to shut the hell up about it]


So I let the gardener come to our back yard and take down my absolute favorite part of the entire property and butcher everything in the process. 

It was like someone told him to ""take it all down, but make sure you leave it a mess"". He didn't clear any of his debris, left piles of dirt along my fence and only did as much as taking out the parts that prevented others from seeing into my yard. I have spent hours and hours clearing bags of what he left. 




A few more weeks pass by and I was leaving my house in the late afternoon to run errands before going to work. 


Incident #2: I opened the door and a business card, with my areas non emergency police number and a claim #, fell to the floor. 


My initial thought was that it was for the previous tenant and they must not have changed their address yet since this move was relatively new. 


But when I called the number the next day and gave the woman the claim # she said that the officer was responding to a call from a “concerned” neighbor who was ""complaining about the feces in the backyard"" and the ""tenants are away or home for long periods of time"" and this worried her because she thought I was neglecting my dog I guess?? 

My boyfriend works out of town a lot, she knew this and I work nights, she knew this too, but maybe because she never sees us and her memory is bad or something that means we must have abandoned our dog? 

I don’t know. 


I asked the lady on the phone about the feces, and she said that when a cop went in my backyard to look at it (which, r/ legaladvice is that even legal in oregon??? Is a complaint justifiably probable cause? ) the cop said that it was *nowhere* near a public safety concern, but he promised this mysterious ""neighbor"" that he would talk to us at the very least. I called him twice to clear up the matter and left a voicemail the second time, I never heard back and took this as him not giving a flying fuck. 


But BF and I were livid because 1) this was only *two* days worth of my dogs shit in our backyard, and 2) it’s *our* backyard! She couldn’t have known about it unless she looked over my fence and saw it, you can’t smell it! Unless I’ve just got a fucked up nose


but anyway we shrugged all of this off and carried on with life because there are more important things to be upset about, right? 


Well, a month or two pass by and I checked my mail on my day off. On my way, I finally run into the girl across from us, (S) and her dog (not on a leash) and we chatted for a minute and she told me the real story about the last tenant. 

How B is racist and hated him because he was black. That the old tenant never caused any issues and he was actually a very nice person and kept mostly to himself. That B can be a pain in everyone’s ass and she’ll like S one day and hate her the next. 


We parted ways and I continued on with my day, checking the mail. 

Incident #3: Bills, letter from mom, bank statement and oh, what’s this? 

**A freaking letter from the police department.**


I didn’t even open the damn thing for a few days, because fuck man, I had been busy and missed cleaning up after my dog for a couple of days again, but what the heck! This was getting ridiculous. 

Sure enough, when I opened it, same thing. Feces complaint, but this time the cops never went into my backyard. (Because I locked that shit up real nice after the first time!) 


The thing I’m most upset about happened a couple months ago. I try to avoid all of my neighbors as much as humanely possible on my days off, but I guess I effed up this day. 

First, I want to say that I usually have my dog on a leash. The walk from my car to the house is all on our property, and takes less than a minute, but I do keep my dog on a leash out of respect for other pet owners. 

The other tenants... not so much. 

So this day, I didn’t have a leash because I just picked up my dog from my boyfriend who left the leash in his motel out of town. 

As I’m walking down the pathway, my dog right by my side like the good boy he is, I walk through the gossiping group of S, B and another lady we’ll call L. They were all out chatting but stop immediately as I walk through and just stared at me. 

L was standing on the pathway that lead to my front door, essentially blocking me from getting past. 

Incident #4: L starts scolding me, almost yelling, as if I was her child and I didn’t clean my room when I was told. Right in front of everyone else. 

I stood there, taking it all in and trying my best to keep calm. I could feel and hear my heart in my ears as she raged on about how...

 1) I’m not supposed to have my dog off of a leash and it’s against code and the law (which is true) 

2) my dog barks all night every night, she said she was going to write a letter to the owners and my landlord about everything and also threatened calling the cops.  — my boyfriend has our dog the three days he’s out of town and I spend every second with my pup on my two days off- 
so if he is barking, it’s at most 2 nights a week, and even then, if he does bark over night he will keep up until the morning when I get off and walk through the door to tell him to knock it off and it’s something we are working on. He has never, until we moved in here, spent time away from one of us. He has always been accompanied by someone. he’s adjusting and we’re trying to help him with his separation issues 

3) the shit in my backyard 🙄 😩 

4) my trash can cannot sit outside of my fence (even though that’s technically my property). It has to be inside of the fence.

Well, she must have had this bottled up for weeks because jokes on her - someone stole my fucking trash can a month before she came at me like this, and I hadn’t had the time to order a new one yet. 

When she finally gave me the chance to get a word in, I took a step back and stood up for myself. And mind you, while this is going on, I was being stared down by S and B the entire time. 

I felt like I was in high school again, and the mean girls were standing in front of my locker so I couldn’t get in and they were looking for any and everything to get me to lose my cool.  

I didn’t, I calmly and respectfully told her, “I understand that the issue with the barking needs to be taken care of. It appears that what I’ve been trying to do for him isn’t working so I will look into overnight sitting. As for the leash, I apologize for breaking conduct, but this is a one time thing. If you’d have looked at the fence, however, you’d have noticed that my trash can has been missing for a couple of weeks, and I believe it to have been stolen. If any of you know where it is or what could have happened to it, I’d appreciate it, otherwise I will cancel that service and get a new one. I’m confused about the poop complaints though. If you would like to check out my yard right now you’re more than welcome to. You’ll see a pile of rocks that I plan to add to that small shrub I’m sure we all have and one, maybe two, piles of shit.” 

Of course I didn’t say shit, but I remember everything I said because I rehearsed what I wanted to say while she spat in my face and this was a high stress moment for me, those usually get engrained in my memory forever. 


After I went inside and cried like a baby for about 20 minutes I got smart and sent this to my landlord 

“Good evening. 
I just wanted to let you know that I have been spoken to by a member of the complex here about our dog barking from time to time (when I'm gone for work at night) and I have had a lengthy discussion with my boyfriend. 

The concerns have been addressed and the two of us have made arrangements to ensure that he won't be home alone anymore, and that he will no longer be going out in the backyard. 

Given this member had said she was preparing a letter for you and you'd probably have wanted to connect with me upon receiving it, I thought it to be the right thing and address you directly in letting you know that we are actively taking part in finding a solution to these concerns with a plan in place.

I also wanted to say that we truly appreciate the chance you've taken on us so graciously to stay here. We're doing everything in our power to tread as lightly as we can, and keep peace here in our community as best as we can. I think it can be unsettling for people to live next to someone they don't know very well and as I work nights it makes building relationships difficult. 

Anyhow, thank you again and I hope you have a good night
-My Name” 

He called me the next day and was LIVID, asking who said all of this to me and has been by my side since then. 

Incident #4: I had a public safety officer (the ones that do parking tickets and such) knock on my door and ask to take a look at my backyard and you want to know what he found? 

Fucking nothing!!!!! My dog had shit once that day and I had just woken up so I didn’t clean it yet but all he said was “yeah, just be mindful about it. Now that summer is approaching you’ll want to clean it at least once a week or it’ll smell” 


Like, dude. I clean it *more* than twice a week. 

So, I call my landlord and talk to him about it. I told him that I’m at my wits end and I don’t know what to do, he suggested a restraining order because he feels as though B is harassing me at this point. 

he even said he will go to court to back me up 100%. I’m lucky and grateful to have him on my side but I don’t have the money to file any lawsuits. 


I also asked him about the vines and if it really was the owners idea or not and he said he hadn’t heard anything about that, so no... it came straight from B. B just decided one day that she didn’t like the vines in my backyard and they should just be chopped. 

If I can attach pictures to show how beautiful they were and what they look like now I will. 

Incident #5: And as I was writing this out guys, I can not make this shit up, I get a knock on the door. 

I had to sign for certified mail and it’s another freaking warning to “clean up dog feces”. It has the “scattering rubbish” check marked and says “this penalty assessment would have been 495$” 

There’s also a box stating “if this box is checked, it has been determined that these violations are a health and safety concern....” and it is **not** checked. 


Good thing it’s just a warning, right?


I just got off the phone with the secretary lady. I want to know if a cop went in my back yard or peered over her fence and actually saw the shit or if they’re just going off of what B is saying. If it’s the former, I want picture fucking proof because I have been walking him this week instead so there was none out there the date of this supposed incident and if it’s the latter, oh man..I already feel my blood boiling. 

I don’t know what to do, you guys. So much more has been done, too. We got yelled at by L a different day for having our car parked for “too long” (3 days) in the shared parking space and that we need to “share with B and her grandson because he has lupus and can’t walk the extra 3 feet to the street”. Whatever, that was dealt with, we moved on. My car has been spit on. And I can’t prove it, but I think they poisoned my dog (rat poison), and I’m just... ugh.  

She has been asked repeatedly to leave me alone by my landlord and myself, so do I file a restraining order? Do I sue her? How tf do I get this to stop?

639,"So, I met this guy about a month and a half ago. At first, I thought I might be interested in him, but then as I got to know him, I realized he's way too immature and not my type. (I'm 20, he's barely about to turn 19.) 

Yesterday he admitted to me that he's liked me since we met... and that he has been driving by my house every day. (I'll go into more detail about this.)

When we got to know each other, we actted more like siblings than anything else. He told me that I was like an older brother to him, called me bro, etc.

When he asked me out, I told him no because I don't see him that way. I've now told him 3 times. Once in person, twice over text. Yesterday, I thought we were clear that I wasn't interested before I went to bed, but this morning, I woke up to him blowing up my phone. 15 messages on Facebook, and more to follow over text. All of them were at least a paragraph long. He went into detail about how this whole time we've known each other, he's been trying to figure out if I would date him. (I am bi, so it isn't weird for me to date guys.) 

When I thought we were just friends, we got to talking about where we lived. I live in a house off of a main road, not in a neighborhood. I told him that, and he told me in one of the multiple texts he sent this morning that he has been driving by my house every day, even on days when he doesn't work. On days he doesn't work, he will come into the store and hang around my area for hours just to talk to me. It got to the point where my manager had to ask him to leave. His reaction was getting mad and thinking that I talked to her about it.

641,"I am a nursing student with only one full semester left of graduation. I have great friends, a wonderful boyfriend, a (mostly) supportive family, and am doing fine in school. However, I have been struggling with bulimia for over two years and recently, depression has been getting the best of me. I have done therapy and had weekly appointments with my doctor, but now that I have gained a couple pounds, I am losing myself.  

I have struggled with depression since high school, but now it has gotten out of control and I have zero motivation to do anything.  I also can’t workout like I used to to release endorphins due to a bad knee post ACL surgery from two years ago.  

As of the last month, it has been 100x worse and my nights are filled with anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts.  My family and boyfriend are aware of this change and I have never had any intent (let that be clear). I just lay in bed and have zero idea how to help myself.  

I have been struggling with my body and my self worth and nothing else seems to be helping me.  I don’t have any confidence and I need ways to find happiness or else I don’t know how I will be able to get out of this. Any help is appreciated :)",25Apr2019,3

644,"Here’s the next chapter in my never ending relationship issues. Those who read my last post are already caught up, but to most of you who aren’t let me explain. A few weeks ago I and this girl got intimate and she ended up giving me a bj in the middle of the park (this was my first time). As nice as theirs was, I was still unable to cum. 

I thought that this was due to nerves (with it being my first time and me being in A very public and cold space) however I went to hers yesterday( for round two if u will) and it didn’t go much smother. We where in here room (her parents where out), we had been talking before hand and thus we weren’t awkward or anything.   But despite this (and me being very into it) it still look me a solid 30 mins to cum. 

Is this normal or should I be worried. I really don’t think that it should be this time consuming, especially when I hear my friends stories. I didn’t jack off or do anything the week before hand, I’d slept enough and ate well, so I really don’t know why this happened.

645,"Male, white, 27. My family doesn't have a lot of money, and I have expensive medical bills, but I saved up years worth of money, minus bills like car payments and medicine, (I have about $12,000 right now) and I want to move out to go to college. Well, college is fifteen minutes away.

I have a helicopter mom who doesn't let me do things outside of work, the grocery store, the gas station, etc. I *was* in band in high school, but that's the exception. She says that if I want to move out, I should have a full-time job that will pay the $750 minimum rent, but I can't find one that's $15/hr because I wasted my life with porn, video games, and unemployment until I was 23 (yeah, really) and so I have no skills except factory labor and lifting boxes. (I'm learning copywriting now, but that's beside the point. Currently, I load trucks for FedEx part-time.) If no full-time job, she says I should be married and then move out. The problem with that is she is extremely picky and we like different things in a woman. Any woman I pick, *if I wanted to ruin my life with marriage this early*, would have to be chosen by her.

But here's the thing. Yeah, it's selfish, but I swear I'm going crazy being a 27-year-old virgin. College will be great-- I want to study horticulture-- but I won't lie, my second reason is to have sex. But since the only apartments I can afford are ten minutes away and will gradually eat into my savings until I need a loan, my only argument is ""it's a rite of passage for people my age to move out!"" If I don't have a better reason, it ain't gonna happen. She has to cosign for me, after all.

So, I live in an area of scotland that really has NOTHING on, and i've recently ran away from home to get away from a narcisstic mother (would Destroy your self esteem infront of others to make herself look good, also constantly guilt trips and makes you feel like you are nothing but an errandgirl) and currently am living with my sister temporarily in the same area, 

&amp;#x200B;

i've asked my sister a few times about where to move to and shes saying ethier stay in this area of scotland or move to edinburgh as it'd be closer to my dad, and she worries i'd become isolated, but to be honest seeing as this would be my first move, i really want to maybe move somewhere like dundee or glasgow where i can start my own life anew, and to be fair is i dont mind a little bit of isolation, as i really want to start my own life, and reapply to go to college and help out at art studios and maybe volunteer at the gardens as thats a thing i really would love to do, but my sister is very like ""please dont"" and i get what she means but, i really want out of this area as there is very very little to do, and i like edinburgh but i feel like i maybe just want to move a fair distance out, and i kind of want to go somewhere where nobody will know who i am and not know what my name is, basically a fresh start. 

&amp;#x200B;

her worries stem that if i end up something bad happening to me, if i live far out it'll  be hard to reach me as quick where as if i live in where we live or edinburgh my dad or her can reach me in person much quicker

669,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I actually dont know if this is this right place to ask, but oh well. I have a history of things which I get obsessed about, I research anything about this topic the whole day and get very depressed about it. For example, a year ago I thought I was autistic, despite there being almost no evidence for that. I was really sure that I have apergers until I went to a psychologist, who told me there wasn't a single sign of autism. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 3 months, I've been obsessed with looks on people. I've read stories on reddit or quora of people who are extremely handsome and their experiences with women and life in general. They all tell how women basically throw themselves at them all the time, not even in clubs but in the middle of the day on the street. Not having experienced this, and probably being average or below average looking based on my own experiences, I getf very depressed about this.

&amp;#x200B;

This escalated in spending much time on [lookism.net](https://lookism.net) and looksmax.me , which are two forums with threads about any topic that has to do with looks and aestethics. I know many people there are delusional, but there is certainly some truth behind it. Also, there is this channel called FaceandLMS, who makes videos about scientifically proven facts about aesthetics and looks. Seeing how important looks are to attraction, it makes me really sad and depressed. I actually already thought about taking my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I go to the bathroom, I look at myself at every angle and every pose. I take about 50 photos and videos of me talking and making different facial expressions with front and back camera, just so I can see how others perceive me. After each time, I am really disappointed at what I see. I even posted on the various rating subreddits, from Rateme to truerateme (who have a real guide and rate based on objectiveness.)

670,"Okay so this is really hard for me to share cause i feel like im overreacting but i needed to get this off my chest and hear others opinions on this. Also im so sorry this is ALOT to read, but just bear with me.

I dated this girl for a good solid three years, from the beginning of 8th grade to the end of 10th (we are in 11th grade right now and go to different schools). We were both our first loves and first well everything. Towards the end of our relationship we would argue alot and whatever and she ended it.

We both still cared about each other alot and she would have me sneak over her house so we can just have deep conversations about life or whatever. This happened for some time and even when she would date other guys she still would invite me over to talk. 

And these talks KILLED me, i would always leave so depressed and lost and not knowing how to feel about myself, cause she still cared and loved me but it felt as if she didnt in a way

I would normally never really intrude on any of her relationships or whatever, she would always tell every detail about them on her own free will, but this new guy she was seeing she was different. It was like she was not telling me something in an obvious way so i would ask her about it.  (I know our relationship is stupid)

I finally did ask her about this new guy and she said she really loves him blah blah blah... and then she revealed how he was... 24 years old. Now keep in mind when they started dating she was 16 and she just recently turned 17 beginning of April. At first i was in complete SHOCK. Like oh my god thats illegal as hell and also really gross. But then she was going on about her family knowing how old he is and her friends knowing, as well as his friends and family knowing the age gap.

Okay here is where i need advice and im sorry for that long backstory. The first day of knowing this i would keep trying to tell her how what she is doing is so wrong and gross and ILLEGAL. But she just kept saying i didnt understand and how it didnt matter cause they are in love. And she was also begging me to not tell anyone about this cause she didnt want her bf to get in trouble. Which is exactly what i wanted to do, cause i mean this guy is a pedophile right???

After a couple days this information was eating me up and i didnt go to school cause it just hurt me physically knowing this was happening. I finally told my close friend about what was eating me up inside  and he agreed with me letting someone know about what was going on. 

very stupidly though, i told my ex what i wanted to do and now she hates my guts and doesnt want to talk to me ever again. And i am heartbroken. Should i do the right thing and tell someone or should i just leave it be and try to forget about it. 

Is telling someone even the right thing to do?
Also i still love this girl and just pretending like she doesnt exist anymore is gonna be the hardest thing i have ever done.

675,"My roommates were a nightmare. We’ll call them Shore and Kelby. Shore worked at the homeless shelter, had a history of assault (unknown to me), and when I moved in, she was kicking her husband out for infidelity. They argued over the phone for weeks, and then they started sleeping together again, bringing him over and then he eventually stopped leaving. My room was the size of a closet, to fit my daughter and I in. The other room was moldy and the windows were nearly shattered. Their dogs had caused significant damage to the house. She had two, had taken in her mother’s two dogs, and three cats. Her mother’s two dogs pissed and shit all throughout the house, and they used my bath towels to clean it up before discarding them in heaps on the floor. The two cats scratched the doors to shreds, with the exception of the one I kept. All of her animals were neglected, and had frequent complaints up about them with the city. Shore was a heavier set woman, and broke the plumbing and the fixtures frequently. She left rotting food all over the house, and discarded her garbage wherever she used the garbage. I was constantly cleaning up after her. Her husband Kelby was useless. He sat around the house and smoked weed and cigarettes with windows and doors open, letting the smoke come into the house. They yelled at each other every morning for weeks on end, waking my daughter and I up. They ate our food, stole our belongings, and took as much money from us as they could.

Fast forward to yesterday. Her dogs got loose while I was out, and she called me to tell me it was my fault. She put 4 applesauce, some baby cereal, a thing of peanut butter 5 diapers, her car seat, and my makeup kit outside and told me not to come back. I broke into the house, grabbed as much of my belongings as I could, and then ran. I am about to be homeless. I contact every housing market in town and in nearby towns, including the landlord for the place I was staying. What do I do? Truth be told, I’ve been there for over 6 months, and I want her kicked out to move back in. I did no wrong there. I fixed up the place, cleaned up after the animals, her, and myself. I don’t deserve to go homeless because her dogs got loose while no one was home.",25Apr2019,2

679,"Today I learned about Hedonic treadmill theory - which is the tendency of a person to remain at a relatively stable level of happiness despite changes in fortune or the achievement of major goals. As a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.

This made sense, but also made me incredibly sad (which is pretty ironic since according to this theory I should get over it). I've been fluctuating between being depressed to just being unhappy for a long time now and I'm starting to wonder if that is my ""baseline happiness"". It makes me a bit hopeless, makes me feel that whatever I do to try improving my happiness (which is what I'm actively doing right now and I'm making a bit of progress) it's not going to work and is going to knock me back to my ""baseline happiness"".

This makes me feel as if I will always be unhappy and chasing my goals is pointless. I know that's a bit irrational but that's what having diagnosed health anxiety does to me, I'm afraid I will never get out of this situation.

What's your take on this theory? Would love to know.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)",25Apr2019,0

681,"Hi. I hope this doesn't offend anyone. I personally suffer with anxiety and depression so I'm very catious with conversation revolving around mental health.

But, I had a friend that a few years ago was an out gay teenager who was very kind and loving. 

Now, he has been posting on FB claiming he is a prophet for God, he can destroy demons, and just other truly alarming things. He keeps claiming the rapture is about to happen and that he will assist God during it. He believes he talks to God every day. 

He is in his early 20s so it feels like religious delusions...possible a Schizophrenic break? He lives with his parents and they refuse to listen. They are religious so they support and encourage these delusions. He won't listen to anyone's comments on FB and I guess I'm just terrified that he may harm himself at some point or someone else.

The reason I'm so scared is being one of my close friends died from a psychotic break. He suddenly thought he was Moses and swam out into the river cause God told him too, and he drowned. I wish I could have done more to help.

Maybe I just need to mind my  business, but it's really been worrying me lately. Every day the posts get more intense.

So I'll start from the beginning. I've never been a happy person and I've always felt kind of depressed but I just thought it was pretty normal growing up. I had a handful of friends that I loved very dearly whenever I was a teenager and I did have a rough home life due to parents being pretty terrible and abusive, so I confined in irl friends and online friends. So once I turned 18 I moved 1,500 miles across the ocean to get away from my family and be with a guy I met on the internet with the excuse of going to college. Lived with some distant relatives while I went to college and I had a terrible time living there for the next 2 years of my life. The man I adored with all my heart ended up breaking up with me and it was the worst time of my life. My depression became worse, I had no one to talk to due to living in this new country I never been to, I had no friends, no money, my relationship with my distant relatives became sour and I ended up dropping out of college. I used self harm as a coping mechanism and I attempted to find affection in strangers I'd meet on the internet by sleeping with them. I ended up going to a psychologist and was officially diagnosed having borderline personality disorder and clinical depression. I finally felt like I understood what's been wrong with me all these years and everything made sense. 

Fast forward to 2 years later and I ended up meeting someone on the internet again and moved in with them 1,000 miles north from where I resided at the time. Im still with that person and they make me extremely happy, I have a job that I make decent money at and I thought I was happy, but I've lived here so far almost 6 years now and yet I still feel extremely lonely. I have 0 friends and most of the time I don't know what to do with myself. Every day I have a day off or I'm home, I just feel bad. I constantly miss talking to my old friends and I've tried to do so but they have moved on with their lives, I've tried to make friends in the past with coworkers but they just don't see me as nothing more as someone they work with. I never have anyone to talk to apart from my boyfriend. I also started having terrible impulse control. I constantly buy things and never use them ever again. I attempt to find new hobbies and I just give up after a few days . I always lose interest in everything I do and I don't know what to do with myself. So not sure if this is the right place for this or not but anything would help.",25Apr2019,1

One of my friends and class mates passed away in October 2018. She has a little sister in second grade and I make sure to check on her every now and then and take her out with me for pizza or ice cream or something. Recently, I have heard from one of her teachers that she is doing very bad mentally saying that she wants to die to be with her sister who has passed away and that she will kill herself to go see her. She is only in second grade and this will damage her forever so I want to help but I am unsure what to do. I would try talking to her mom but I am afraid it will be taken the wrong way as she has recently lost her sister to suicide and her daughter as well.

A couple of months later my friend and I are out for dinner and she was looking on her likes from a picture she posted and said A liked her pic and started to giggle and stuff.

695,"Me [25F] and my fiancé [25M] are having a dilemma of what next step to take in life.
We currently live somewhere where it is on average $1400 a month for a small apartment. I have a nice job that MIGHT not become permanent (currently contracting, but contract ends soon and company may not budget to make position permanent). But if it were permanent it’s a high enough paying job to justify paying the rent price.
I could just find a similar job in the area, but to be honest even though it’s not a bad job it makes me depressed. It’s just not something I’m passionate about, even if on the outside looking in it’s a lot of people dream job. It feels like I go through the motions of day to day life like a robot. Work, traffic, eat something quick and easy, be too tired to do my own projects, go to sleep feeling lazy and depressed I have to go to work again. 
My fiancé is also depressed as there isn’t really anything in his field out here and he works a job he hates, this feeling similar emotions to me.
We also have been here a year and haven’t made any friends despite trying. We just aren’t like the people here having come from the Midwest.

So we have a choice, stay and make it work for money / security. Pay off my student debt for a little more freedom later (be almost 30 having worked at a desk my entire youth).
Or, we thought maybe moving back home/somewhere Midwest that’s cheap as hell. Where rent is $600-$900 for a house. We could work part time, I could try a different career while freelancing art and my fiancé could do the same. The downside to this is haulting paying off debt, going back to having to save forever to get things, and we both have a weird sense of failure if we go back.

Staying here feels like the responsible thing to do, even if I may have to find a different job in the same field. But we’re both a little miserable (but working on trying to find happiness with what we have)
But moving seems like the ballsy “follow your dreams” path, even if it’s risky, expensive savings draining move...

I’m just stuck because both have good and bad, and I need an outside perspective that has a similar experience or less personal emotion about it

TL;DR Stay somewhere expensive working corporate jobs to have a savings and pay off debts but be relatively drone like or move back to where it’s cheap and try really hard to forge new paths and put off debts and money",25Apr2019,1

We stay up a little late, but it's always quiet activities, and neither of us walk heavily (I'm actually kinda proud of how nobody ever hears me coming when I walk up to them). However, with how often our neighbor bangs on the ceiling, you'd think we wore lead shoes with built in heavy bass speakers. At first I thought it was a coincidence, something unrelated, or maybe an accident, but no, he hears us and he's angry. He will bang on the ceiling for me fucking *rolling out of bed* to use the bathroom at night.

Yesterday though, we got verbal confirmation that it was very much purposeful and meant to be telling us to quiet down. He was very polite sounding to my fiance and said ""Hey can I talk to you for a second? Can I ask you guys to try and keep it down, and walk quieter at night? You woke up my daughter last night. It's gotten to be very frustrating. There's been a couple times my wife has had to stop me from going up there and giving you a piece of my mind. I got anger issues. But I wanted to talk to you while I'm calm"" And I do appreciate that he told us in person nicely. But I can't help but feel like that was a bit of a disguised threat.

Granted the only time I'm really out clubbing I'm too drunk and starting off talking to a girl sober is something that will always prove impossible for me, so I use Tinder. I get a couple matches a week maybe but most girls cannot hold conversations and it gets boring and dry fast, even when I have started talking to a girl on Tinder for longer than 4 days maybe, nothing ever comes from it! I don't understand why as I am a super nice guy, funny and am not bland and have some good interests, I also like to think I am quite good looking too (I assume from what people have told me). I guess perhaps that I am not very confident, my confidence has been knocked too much from the past and it's something I struggle with and I feel weak.

713,"So i(18F) have been unemployed for a few months.

I had a couple of interviews that were meh but it's all experience right!

Well anyway this job popped up for a local factory that was what I wanted to do, close to home and good pay as well, and I got a qualification out of it.

I tried my abosulte best, and aced the first interview, then i spent weeks preparing for the second round. I was funny, witty, professional and they really liked me 

I found out yesterday they chose another person over me because they had more experience, even though this was an entry level job.

I was devastated, ngl, and to say I focused all my energy on it. And wasted about 2 months doing presentations and interviews.

Now I did get good feedback that I was a good personality, but I just feel so deflated. All the other jobs seem to have dried up and I'm in a rut, I put SO much effort and I was really confident afterwards, but obviously it was not meant to be and I'll get over that.

Throwaway, obviously.

Now, before anyone goes off for falsifying victims, I’d like to preface that I know the girl in question was never assaulted. Without getting into too specific of details to protect identities, I’ve heard the same facts from numerous witnesses, and they’re all consistent, along with the fact that it was never brought to court or even her management at the establishment it supposedly happened. She claimed sexual harassment, then it hyperbolized to a full blown rape 6-7 months later.

For the past several months, she’s been claiming PTSD. So much so, that even her therapist, parents, and psychiatrist believe her. She wrote a letter about *somebody else’s* assault claiming it as her own to back herself up to these people.

She has everybody so convinced that she’s prescribed a powerful benzodiazepine for her “PTSD”, and she’s fighting to get a service dog for her disorder that doesn’t exist.

She’s manipulating everybody around her to her will because of this so-called incident. Only a select few people know it’s bull, including her best friend and that friend’s mother.

Is there anything I can do to get her to stop this abuse of the medical system, drugs, and friends? I would go to the school counselors, but she even has them wrapped around her finger.

Now, please, I hate discrediting anybody whatsoever. I myself struggle from a multitude of similar illnesses, so this isn’t me being all “PTSD isn’t real” etc etc. The reason I’m outrageously irritated by this all is that she’s the type of person invalidating victims everywhere because of her bullshit.

I’m not looking for any criticism, I’m seeking advice to help legitimate victims and patients be taken seriously. She is a cancer to society.",25Apr2019,3

I'm a 22 year old Bricklayer, I have been doing it for the last year and its completely destroying my body. I knew in the construction industry your body ends up degrading but not at my current age. I am in costant pain at work, with pains in my hands, elbows, knees and my back, the pain is also there when I'm at home too, I cant even pick up my 3 year old nephew for more than a few minutes without the pain becoming unbearable. I have decided to go back to university, but I don't have the right qualifications but I applied anyway and I actually got accepted into one of the unis due to my self-taught knowledge of the course. 

Anyway I brought up the conversation to my mum and dad, and my mum pretty much didn't care about how its destroying my body and when I mentioned returning to education she just said no, asking how I would support myself through it. My dad wasnt happy either and said he didn't want to deal with it at this moment as hes dad passed away last week, which I understand. They both told me to get a check up at the doctors to see if it is my job destroying my body and then if it is carry on doing the job and work a night course at the same time. 

I never mentioned university specifically because that would have caused another argument then and there.

730,"So this is my first time posting something, but I really need advice.

I have made some decisions in my life because I was meant to make them by “untold words” from my family. 
A little background about me and my family. 
I have an older sister but I was always the good kid. Had good grades, knew how to behave and always looked after my sister and tried to keep her away from trouble. That’s exactly how I spent my “best”years 14-17 running after my sister and looking out for her while keeping my parents expectations. 
Fast forward: I applied for college and went to my chosen one, which was expected of me. But I really wanted to do an apprenticeship. So my problem is that I am a loser at college I can’t keep up with anything and already had to switch my major, without telling my parents the real reasons( I had failed an exam trice).
My parents are supporting me with an “monthly allowance” you may call it. And they are supportive in other ways but they don’t want to hear about problems and such. I also work in early mornings and go then straight to college to have at least a little bit of money to spend. 
So the real problem started this Monday when I went to the doctor to get my ears checked because they tend to get infected when I have a cold, which I did.  And they tell me my insurance is out of order. So I go to the insurance company and they tell me, some errors have been done and now I have to pay 450€ fine. Which I don’t have. So I tell my family and they are just like “Sorry to hear that honey.” And that’s it.
I didn’t expect them to pay for me but at least to offer.

Now I am in debt and hate every decision I have made to stand we’re I am right now. 
I am stuck with a tiny debt but one nonetheless. And attend college without seeing a future in it. I am 23 years already and achieved nothing and without experiencing anything ( parties, going out, getting into trouble). I fell like I have missed out on so many opportunities and am “too old” to catch up. 
So what am I supposed to do to move on in life?
Has anyone experienced something similar?

Advice would be appreciated and also sorry for any errors :)",25Apr2019,1
732,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I fucking pray nobody I know sees this.

I've been self-harming for around 4 years. It's always been something that I've kept very hidden. My parents knew when I did it sparingly in high school (and probably thought it was just an attention thing), and bc I do it on my shoulder it's just super easy to hide. I'm bad at keeping secrets, but the fact that it's something I do semi-regularly is something *nobody* knows.

A few months ago my boyfriend and I were cuddling and he saw my shoulder and asked about the lines. I told him it's from when I used to self harm and he told me if I ever had any thoughts like that he wanted me to tell him.

Well, obviously I've had thoughts like that and obviously I didn't tell him. I've since been studying abroad (I know I'm an entitled spoiled brat for feeling the need to self-harm when I can afford to fuck around in a foreign country) since January, and am heading in around a week.

I've been in sort of a slump since mid-December, but it's taken a severe turn and now I've been self-harming a lot abroad. I keep thinking this is something I need to tell him but I wouldn't even begin to know how or if I should. My reasoning is:

**1.)** I think by the time I get back, all my cuts will be healed, assuming I don't do it again.

**2.)** It's already been said and done.

**3.)** When I get back, he's graduating, looking for a job, and entertaining his family who'll be in town.

**4.)** I'm not really comfortable with the idea of stopping right now. I don't really feel like I'm sick enough and even if it isn't healthy, I'm fine using self-harm as a coping mechanism.

The last thing I want to do is burden or bother him with this information. I'm really good at keeping a facade and being happy and funny. So as long as my cuts heal on time, he will hypothetically never know. I'm scared he'll think I'm doing it for attention or be really overbearing and ""parenty"" when I get back to make sure I don't do it again.

But if the tables were turned, I'd want him to tell me even if it has been said and done. I'd also feel even worse if I came home and he found my cuts minutes within us being reunited after 3 months.",25Apr2019,1

747,"I got kicked out of housing a couple of months ago and in desperation reached out to a distant friend. Let's call her Tara. Coincidentally, Tara was also looking for housing under duress too. She had no money and an old friend she reconnected with (Jay) offered to put her up rent-free. She asked Jay if I could move in too and he agreed after she gave a good character reference of me and assure Jay I could pay rent. 

Tara is unemployed, has no savings, and just recently got out of rehab. I'm unemployed too, but have enough savings from my last job to live comfortably enough. The first few weeks we were here I had to pay for our groceries with cash, before we both got on food stamps. Jay didn't have much/spare food in the house because he's not a big eater (or so I thought) and poor because he's bad with money. The first time I bought groceries for Tara and I, Jay helped himself to one of our frozen pizzas without asking myself or Tara (I only found out after the fact). I wasn't overly bothered, I figured it was a one-off and he must have assumed Tara okayed it.

A few nights later, I was cooking a home-cooked meal for Tara and I and as Jay was leaving for work Tara blurted out ""there will be leftovers when you get home!"". I was mildly irritated and said so; I didn't know how much food was going to be leftover and would feel like a dick if there was only a little/none left, since she'd told him to expect food. As well, I told her, it might set a precedent where he's always going to expect me to factor him into food shopping and cooking. 

Coming from a big family and frequently hosting dinner parties in the past I almost always cook more, rather than less, and there's almost always leftovers when I cook a meal. I just leave it out on the side if either of us want seconds, and for Jay to himself to when he gets home from work. On a few occasions he's not only helped himself to a bowl/plate worth, but packed the rest away for himself to take into work, not bothering to ask if Tara and I wanted anymore. To save any confusion I tried packing away my own leftovers for the next day, but Jay sniffs it out and helps himself to it. He also has an irritating habit of picking the meat out of stews/sauce-heavy dishes and leaving the rest on the side for me to clean up the next day.

Then he started complaining about my cooking to Tara, saying it's ""too spicy"" or he hates seafood. He's also gone after Tara's soda too. She gets maybe a glass worth from a 2 liter bottle before he drinks the rest. I only drink diet, which he seemingly has an aversion too. On the assumption that it was Tara's he even asked her ""next time you buy soda can you not buy diet?"". On a paranoid hunch I wondered if he'd been helping himself to our frozen food. I've only ever seen him bring home groceries once (after I paid him) and the non-perishables he has never seem to deplete. Lo and behold I was right: any boxed frozen food we'd opened - taquitos, chicken nuggets, fish sticks etc - he'd been skimming from. The other day Tara asked me if I ate one of our pizzas...Jay strikes again.

I think it's crossed the line now. Tara and I have never discussed, nor agreed to food sharing with Jay. It would *maybe* be ok if it was reciprocal, but he has no food. He's literally living off of ours. I try not to be a selfish person, and I don't mind Jay having leftovers every now and then. But assuming it's *all* his, sniffing out leftovers packed away for Tara and I, and casually helping himself to our frozen food is beyond taking liberties.

Jay isn't my friend. He's Tara's friend. We have no relationship beyond ""hi"" and ""goodbye"". I'd feel awkward and out of place confronting him, since he's ostensibly doing Tara a favor by taking me in too. Tara doesn't know what to do or say since he's been eating our food for weeks already and I don't want to put her on the spot and damage her relationship with her friend, but she agrees it's wrong of him to just casually assume our food is his.

How can we, separately or together, broach the subject with Jay without creating any awkwardness in the house?",25Apr2019,2

749,"I (15M) am currently writing this at 00:31. I've been worrying about this all day.

My dad recently had a work function where he had a few drinks and a cab dropped him off. Nothing wrong with that, except when my mom and I tried to call him to see if he was okay, he didn't answer. He never has his phone off his person, so he was flat-out ignoring us.

Usually, when my mom gets mad, you can tell so, i.e. she responds with only ""okay"" or ""yes"" or something. But now she seems to just be hiding something. I asked her what was wrong and she just shook her head. 

My dad is currently sleeping in their bed and my mom is sleeping on the couch. 

I already had to go through losing my best friend on the 15th of March and I'm still having issues handling that. If my parents get divorced, I don't know what I'll do.

750,"So, I just got out of a really serious 3 year relationship that was very emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. A little bit of backstory, he constantly told me that I wasnt good enough and that no one else would like me except for him. He would remind me that I had lost all of my friends and family and anytime someone walked into my life that he viewed as threatening to us, he'd tell me they were trying to use me or hurt me. This went on for years, and finally he moved out of state and I was able to move back in with parents to get away. 

I recently started dating and early on I met this really great guy. We've been on a few dates and we talk daily on nights after work. He says he's really serious about me and that he's interested in something real. In general, he has a somewhat busy schedule. He works full time, and has a few hobbies he attends to daily - so we usually only talk at night for a few hours.  

We've hung out once a week (at least) since we started talking on his free days, but he seems really distant over text. In person it's super great and it seems real, but over text it's not the same. He hardly texts back - it takes hours sometimes (even when he's not especially ""busy"", like playing video games etc). At night he only texts me while he's doing other things, and even then it takes a while for a reply. We usually exchange 5-10 texts over an hour, which isn't really something I've experienced with guys who have liked me in the past. He kind of seems disinterested in conversation throughout the day.

So, is this something I should worry about? It bothers me lots and if he were busy I'd rather him tell me, than disappear for hours. Does it mean he's not interested?",25Apr2019,1
751,"Hello Reddit,

To keep it short I have a 6 year old niece who I love, but she already has some bad eating habits and is pretty big for being so young. She has already had 7 cavities, and I've tried talking to my sister about better eating habits and such. She usually responds positively, and then forgets about it completely. I've tried not to let it bother me, but I care, and my sister is very aware that we have a history of high blood pressure and diabetes on our side of the family, and her husband's side. Am I just supposed to stop caring and wait until something bad happens to spark a change? I don't want my niece taunted in school for her weight, but I'm at a loss. My sister's husband also has horrible health habits and I'm worried about him as well, but he has done nothing to change despite his love for soda resulting in gerd and other issues. Any advice at all is appreciated.

Thank you!",25Apr2019,1
752,"I have worked at a small business that repairs and sells farm equipment for a little over a year and a half. There are 2 departments: sales and repairs. I am in the repairs side and my job duties are 50% physical labor (moving equipment, carrying boxes up stairs, bending over, lifting, walking/working in warehouses) and 50% administrative tasks. (Talking to customers, ordering materials, taking shipments, invoicing)

I originally applied to be in a sales role because I have a chronic illness that makes physical labor difficult. I was open about this during my interview, however I was asked to fill a specialized role on the repair side when the managers saw my resume. I was told I was overqualified for the sales role and they wanted to use my talents to grow the repairs department. (I am the only one in this specific role and the only others who are currently trained to perform many of my tasks are managers)

For the last few months my health has been declining quickly. (My doctors think work stress triggered it, go figure.) I have had to request accommodations to perform the role. Even with all reasonable accommodations for this position, I am still performing at a level that puts a lot of physical and mental stress on me. My full job is getting done in 2/3rds the time, but it’s killing me. 

Recently, there has been a lot of shifting and turnover in the administrative staff. I’ve asked a few times if it would be possible to transition into that department for the reasons listed above and a few others. I have also offered to train my replacement and do whatever I can to transition the role to someone else, but it seems like leadership wants to keep me in this role because it’s easier than moving me. Despite that I’m in intense physical pain most of the time, my job is still done well and no complaints have been made with my performance.

Am I stuck in this role as long as I stay at the company? I like the company,  but I don’t like feeling like I’m being asked to compromise my health for a business that doesn’t offer me health benefits. Should I start looking for another job that is exclusively administrative and lose the time I have at this company? 

TLDR: I’m ill and want to move from a physical labor role to an administrative role within the same company- they don’t want to move me from my role because it’s shitty and no one else can do it. They knew I was ill when they hired me. What should I do?",25Apr2019,1

755,"I am on the executive board for my colleges club rowing team, specifically my job is to manage our equipment. there’s an alumnus of our school that has been deeply involved in our project of five years to build new docks for our team. when I became involved with the team last year I took over as our teams’ representative to work on the docks with the alumni. these docks each cost around 15k and as a small club team it’s been an absolute nightmare to afford them without help from this alumni and other team alumni. As of now 2 of these docks are done and, in the water, and they work perfectly. 

the problem is the alumni that helped us build the first 2 is very hard to deal with and honestly doesn’t take no for an answer. Our team has run into financial trouble recently and as he discusses making a third dock I very clearly told him the team cannot afford to make another dock, his response was that we would fund raise the money from local business and alumni and use the remainder to make sure our team is in the green at the end of this fall. I told him that our priority needs to be making sure we have enough to maintain the basic operating costs of the team rathe than funding another 15k project that’s going to take a 100+ hours of work and at least a year to complete. My problem is that I don’t know how to get it across that we need to hold off on building another dock until our team is no longer finishing each semester in the red, and that our priority cannot be building another dock. I also don’t want to damage our relationship with this alumnus, because he has honestly been an incredible blessing to our team.",25Apr2019,1
757,"This is probably going to be a huge mess and a lot to get out at one time but I am going to try.

I haven't seen my father since I was 6ish. I am 20 now. My mother divorced him when I was 3 and I saw him for a total of two weeks out of two years when I was 5 and 6. 

The thing about my father is that I've always known that he was physically abusive to my mom, horrendously so. I knew that he beat her real bad once when I was 3 and that's why she left him.

What I didn't know until a few weeks ago is that the reason he beat her-- tried to kill her-- is that she confronted him about the father/daughter incest porn of little girls my age at the time (3) on their shared laptop. She fled with my brother and I.

However... he faced no legal consequences for the CP. She divorced him, but didn't bring up the CP-- she was a teen mom, just barely 18, and scared out of her mind. Her divorce attorney in the middle of bumfuckass nowhere southern USA told her that if she told anyone about the child porn, since she used the computer too for schoolwork, she'd be held responsible for it too.

She told people he just got angry and beat the shit out of her. The only people that know about the CP, as far as my mom knows, is herself and her parents and him.

 He got supervised visitation of me for the 5-6 time period, but the ""supervision"" was just his gf at the time, a woman named Dee that was also really weird about me and my mom had to write to CPS or something about fondling my genitals in a truck stop bathroom.

My grandmother believes he molested me. My mother does (I snooped and found an old journal of hers that explicitly says she believes he raped me and suspected he made CP of me) though she told me that she ""chooses to assume the positive"" that he didnt; I don't remember anything. Literally at all. I have no memories of that time period of my life except for one or two. But I know in my heart that he did.

The problem is that he remarried a few years ago. This new woman has several daughters, one of which is very young. 

My mom was drunk when she told me all of this. I knew about his new marriage though, and I asked her, don't you think we should send them a letter or something warning them?

She said that she would never do that, because she knows how violent he is, and that if he found it before they did or knew they knew, he could hurt or even kill them.

I understand why she would say that. But I hate the thought of another little girl going through the hell I have been for these past few weeks, coming to terms with all of this shit. 

He isnt a registered sex offender, never did jail time, literally no one knows that he, at the VERY least, downloaded and consumed child porn of toddlers. I don't know who I could tell-- I don't have proof of anything either, its all long gone. She said that the divorce attorney took the laptop, though I don't know why he would have.

Should I contact CPS? Send the wife a letter anyways, message them on FB to warn them? I feel so lost. I hope this made some kind of sense. Any input on this is welcomed",25Apr2019,1

760,"I  have had a bad past, with drugs, alcohol, depression, anxiety. I keep  making mistakes, and can't let go of what I've done/said. I am still  capable of doing everything for myself - I have to be as I have no one  in my life. I don't trust anyone anymore and I don't want to see them,  but I do crave social stuff. I day dream a lot of the day away, about  going off the radar and leaving everything behind me.

My  mom was on anti-depressants and I watched as I grew up as nothing  seemed important to her. She was like a sort of numb, whenever anything  bad happened (i.e. me being molested etc.) she never took it as a big  deal, she was complacent about everything, and I made sure I never  wanted to be drugged like that. There's also the issue of not wanting to  have a prescription past, in case I want to become a police officer, or  forces member. The last part is not being able to afford them even if I  wanted to, I live in Canada. I don't have a family doctor and I go to the walk-in but they're always quick to dismiss my concerns.

Another  thing is that it feels like society doesn't like me. Growing up, the  majority of my friends were immigrants, and would brag about their  countries, i.e. Korea, Iran, China etc. I never felt part of anything,  my family has been in Canada for centuries. There's no groups for  generic white Canadians, and I don't want to associate with anything  white power-ish. It feels like I don't belong, but society keeps saying  how great my situation is, I feel like I'm wasting some great one-up but  I honestly don't feel like I have some great advantage, idk. I envy the States in how proud they are to be American, maybe I should move down South.

For my own dad to believe climate change is a hoax actually hurt me. I asked him what his proof were and said there's literally hundreds, if not thousands, of scientists out there, who dedicate their lives to studying this, and who all agree that climate change is very real and very dangerous.

His counter? ""Just as many scientists say it's fake. 200 000 years ago there was twice as much CO² in the atmosphere. Where did it go?""

In the last couple of months I didn't have a lot of money and every time I went out with my friends they payed for me and I wanted to repay the favor.

769,"Hello world, this is the first time I'm opening up about this because I honestly do not know what to do. I see this path of destruction ahead of her, and feel helpless. I should also preface that I'm trying to be there for this person, putting forward effort, possitivity in her abilities, and also being very realistic with her about what is going on. I do know she has mental difficulties, but I'm unsure of what degree of that is due to her upbringing, and what is actually a problem with her. (Nature vs Nurture, her father was abusive, her mother is at best uncaring, at worst an abuser and a user.)

I have known this girl since middle school, had classes with her, grew up near her and even dated her at one point. I left my home city and came back years later, and it has only gotten worse for this girl. I struggle to put this in unbiased words, so forgive me if something comes across too harsh - I will be blunt. Her mother is a hoarder, and taught her nothing about the world. She's 25 and still acts like a child, constantly asking questions like a toddler, which when confronted will die down - making it seem like it's an at home problem to me, and never being properly corrected. Her face is covered in acne scars, she doesn't know how to properly bathe (always smells), and doesn't even know how to apply makeup. At every corner it seems as if she's been left on her own with no outlet, not even taught how to take care of her self. 

I blame her mother for these things, and I can more than break down why. Her mother is a hoarder, only concerned about herself and leeching from others. Her mother has alienated her other daughters by asking for money at any opportunity, or for 'favors', or to do this or that. She treats people as stewards, while she never moves from her couch. Her mother is medically disabled, diabetes and seizures, but she does absolutely nothing to improve her situation. She sleeps, eats, and does everything in the same place and only moving out when an aide comes in to buy boat loads of high-sugar foods, microwave meals, etc. She does nothing to help her situation. Her home is a den of filth, long-since stacked items over every conceivable surface. There is only one un-covered chair in her house, and that is only cleaned when I come over - there is no dining room, there is NO spare room, and her daughter commonly has to sit on the floor (as an ADULT).

Her daughter, my friend, left school due to 'bullying', a teacher hit her apparently, and her mother pulled her out of school. People would call her stupid, inept, etc and make fun of her appearance and most likely smell. She has no education, and no desire to further it. Her mother has also forbid her from learning how to drive, meaning she cannot get around. Her mother also never taught her how to look for a job, where to apply, or even how to turn in an application. Her idea of 'going to get a job' is going down to the local library, the only place she 'wants' to work, and asking if they have any positions... Yearly. Once a year does she apply for a job, and only to one.

Her mother keeps a tight grip on her, and there's a specific reason why - her mother pulls social benefits off of her daughter. Everything offered to her daughter is instead rolled into her own wallet. Food stamps? Combined, her mother controls them, she can't have her own. Rent money, welfare? Her mother claims hers, meaning she gets nothing, and her mother gets to use them how she sees fit. To top that off, she uses her daughter as an in-home aide, keeping her severe medical conditions and 'independence'. She's abusing every loophole she can to keep her daughter under reigns, leeching off of her in every conceivable way, and my words to her daughter fall on deaf ears. 'Get out', 'She's using you for money', 'You should apply for a job and get independent', all ignored because of her mother's words of manipulation over years.

She's left this young woman, 25 years old, with nothing. No education, no license, no benefits, no job, not even basic skills just to fund herself, all keep herself out of a home for her medical conditions, and extorting welfare into her own pocket. What can I do to help here? I've tried extending a hand, getting her daughter out of there, but it falls to nothing. All her daughter does is obsess over TV shows, because she has absolutely NOTHING else. I'm at a loss, nothing works, and the only reason I've stuck around this long is because I know it's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A friend has been abused and extorted by her mother for welfare money, stunting her growth in education, health, and even as a functional human being by tying her back from aspiring to anything. What can I do to help? Is there anything I can do?",25Apr2019,1

773,"I (F17) was recently diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, and this is something I’ve known for a while but I never wanted to self diagnose on the off chance I didn’t. It was my senior year, and my closest friends had graduated the year prior. So I felt really alone, and my anxiety really hit me hard this year. My depression and anxiousness would hit me in the morning when I’d be needing to get ready for school because I couldn’t stand the thought of having to go to a place where everyone didn’t like me. I ended up almost failing out, missing a solid 25 days after just 1/4 of the year. This was the worst my depression has ever been, and the first time I truly acknowledged it, in my life. I was prescribed some medication, which I’m off now, I took them for a few months but kept forgetting to after I transferred schools. Even after stopping them cold turkey I felt okay, and no different, and I didn’t feel crazy; so I decided not to take them since I was lucky enough to avoid the hell most people experience when going off of them. I ended up transferring to an alternative school and opting for an early graduation program that I completed a few weeks later. And since then I’ve been feeling relatively good, and productive since I’m working full time and completing college classes; all before I was even supposed to be done with high school in the first place. I think the change in environment helped with the morning depression and physically sickness I would experience from anxiety. But I was still left with some bad anxiety.  

After this point of my life, I’ve been happy with almost all aspects of my life except for what I deem most important. My relationships/friendships. I’m still incredibly anxious. I feel so vulnerable and clingy when it comes to friends. So many have come and gone (as many things do) and rather than allowing the rational part of me  know that this is just how things go sometimes, I always take it personally. 

I’m always stuck in the middle of a thought, and having a conflict with myself. Because I am lonely, and I don’t want to be, but I am afraid of putting myself out there. I’ve been told before to try, and believe me I have. I’ve tried many times to reconnect with friends from school, and am always left hanging. And it hurts me, a lot. It makes it hard for me to not believe that it’s my own fault and that something about me must be off. Part of my rational self knows this probably is not true, but the anxious part of me sees that I am, after all, the common denominator. 

Anyway; all this being said. I made a friend recently, after going to me my old high school’s prom. We get along really well, but I am hyper aware of how I come across. I am incredibly excited to have another person reciprocate an interest, but after all the disappoint I don’t want to cling and push them away. So even wanting to simply ask them if they’d like to hang out with me, is making me feel too clingy and obnoxious. So I wanted to receive advice from any and all perspectives.
(I understand how oddly scientific this sounds, and this is just in my brain, I don’t really let all this overthinking come out and scare other people away. I’m just a chatty and slightly hyper person because I get excited at the prospect of a new friend)

My overall questions: 
How can I stop overthinking everything? If it is me that’s the problem, how to I pinpoint that, and what should I do to manage it and help my thinking patterns? Does something jump out at you that’s off about this that I should tackle? Overall, how could I make a better effort to become comfortable enough with myself that this doesn’t take such a big toll on me? Is the very literal way I’m looking at all of this what is making it confusing? Should I just try to go with the flow and think less? Just tell me what you think will help, I appreciate anything. 

TL;DR
Dealing with depression and anxiety. It’s hard for me to rationalize with my anxious self. I want to make friends and put myself out there, but all of the friendships/relationships failed make weary and afraid that I am the problem. Which leaves me sad, lonely, and afraid to initiate even simple small talk with a potential friend.

776,"Hello all, 
My partner (who I will call M) is looking for assistance breaking free from their controlling parents and how they can go about that with as little damage as possible. 

My partner's parents have always been incredibly overbearing. My partner and I met online about 4 and a half years ago. My best friend from elementary school went to university with M and she introduced us. M and I began talking on Facebook first as I lived about 2 hours away. M told their parents about me and their mom absolutely lost it, claiming I could be a murderer/predator/old dude. M never brought me up to their parents again. 

Fast forward years later, M is about to finish University. M has been staying with me at my apartment for about 2 years, their parents think they are staying in a dorm room. 

M's parents fully expect M to move home in about a week and M doesn't know how to bring this up to them in a way that might ease the mental and emotional explosion that could come as a result. 

As some background about M and their relationship with their parents. M has intense anxiety, especially in any situation regarding their parents. M's parents are incredibly emotionally manipulative and abusive in my opinion. 
Some examples of their behavior that has caused M some worry about telling them are as follows:

M has a brother, who came out as gay and having a boyfriend when he was 17. M's parents threatened to kick him out of the home. They also whined to M about how they failed as parents for having a gay son. 

M got their hair cut short one year. M's mom absolutely hated it and did not hide her feelings. In the middle of the night, M's mom barged in M's room while they were sleeping, woke them up and tore a strip off of M for the haircut. 

M's father has cornered M in the basement when M is down there hiding from their parents. He will corner M and while mom is not around, he will ask loaded questions and berate M for their choices. 

M has had some issues with acne in their life (I literally do not care about this) but M's mom has berated M consistently to the point where M is extremely self conscious about it. M's mom has said things like ""if your friends don't say anything about your acne, they're probably thinking it""

M is in school to be an elementary school teacher. M was accepted to the program to teach high school first. This distressed M because teenagers make them nervous. M refused to accept the Secondary program offer. M's parents (Mom has a doctorate, parents both work in a hospital lab) have always been concerned with school and pushed M to accept the seat in the secondary program. When M refused, they started offering to get M their own apartment, to get M a dog, they started being nicer to M. Incredibly dishonest and manipulative in my opinion. Do what we want and we will get you what you want. 

That's all the examples I will list for now but M has more, these ones just stand out to me. So confessing to the parents is going to put M in a really unsafe position. We are trying to figure out where to go from here. How do we cut the ties, at least until they can come to terms with this, as safely as possible?",25Apr2019,1

She shouts out bitch for at least 4 times at me which normally catches me off guard and shouts out to class that I have no friends and when I made an announcement she went, "" oh is someone talking??""

I’m currently finishing my Bachelors, but for financial reasons, I will be moving back back to my mom’s apartment for my last year. Her apartment is not hospitable for anyone to live in, not even for her. It’s not that she’s an extreme hoarder or anything like what they show on TV, but she’s sentimental towards her belongings too much at times and doesn’t like anyone else messing with her keepsakes. Since she also is sickly, it’s harder for her to keep up with daily chores, and as a result, the house remains a cluttered mess all the time. I’m normally not around to help clean, since I spend almost every waking moment away from home at school. But since I’ll be moving in, I’ll need a place to sleep, eat, and study, which I don’t have back at home due to the mess.

793,"I'm a 15 year old girl and since I was like 12 I was interested in the LGBTQ community. I read alot of BL comics and Manga and love books about boys romance. I'm proud to like these things. It wasn't an issue until I started to have this weird feeling in my stomach whenever for example two boys would Kiss in a movie. Everytime I think about that scene I get 'butterflies in my stomach?' I just feel really happy and wierd. I've never been in a serious relationship before and so I don't know what love feels like but from what other people tell me, it's basically what I feel. I'm confused because when it's two boys kissing I really like it and when it's two girls I don't feel the same. If I see a hetero couple kiss in a movie or something I think it's cute but it's not the same. It feels so nice when I see two boys kiss. I'm freaking out because i started to watch this boy in my class and I realised he is 'acting gay' so like he would put his arm around another boy or push him against the wall and stare into his eyes. I literally died right then and really wished for him to come out or something but then I started just thinking about him and something about him 'acting gay' turned me on? I then caught myself obsessing over male characters to be gay etc. My friends say it's because I read too much BL manga and tgat it's okay as long as I don't go overboard but I'm scared if I already did. I don't understand why I would be in love with 2 men that are dating but It just feels like that. I am scared that I might not be able to find a boyfriend because of this. I have been in a lesbian relationship but I didn't like it. Am I attracted to Gay couples? And if so why and what can I do? 

I would really appreciate some advice on this :)

795,"For the past year, I’ve seriously screwed up my eating habits.

I starved myself for ~5 months last year (from March - August-ish).

Since then, I’ve been eating, not properly, I still skip meals and when I do eat, it isn’t healthy food, or things that are good for me.

I thought of not-eating after years of my mum telling me that I shouldn’t have stretch marks because I’ve never been pregnant, my brothers calling me a ‘fat-pig’ or a ‘fat-fuck,’ and falling to the floor yelling ‘Earthquake’ whenever I walk past.

I made the definite decision of not eating after I saw photos of myself at a wedding we had gone to. I took hours to get ready, and for the first time in years I was confident. I thought I looked really cute; I did my makeup, I thought the clothes I took flattered my body, and I matched my rings to my bracelet, to my necklace to the metals on my bag. 

Then, I saw a photo of myself. I looked like absolute and utter SHIT.

My mum asked me for a caption for the photo, saying she was going to upload it on Facebook. I begged, I pleaded. I cried, asking her not to post the photo. 

She did anyway.

Comments on the photo were things like ‘look at how much weight she’s gained,’ or ‘she’s definitely put on weight since I’ve last seen her.’ We got calls from relatives overseas saying how much ‘rounder and fuller’ my cheeks were. 
I fucking lost it. I thought I’m going to lose weight, fast, and if I don’t, I’m going to kill myself. 

I also have Type 1 Diabetes, and this has seriously messed up my glucose levels, as I’ve been skipping insulin.

In PE class last year, we watched a documentary on sugar and the effects it has on your body. I learnt that insulin stops or slows down the fat burning process. 
So, I stopped taking my insulin shots, and I thought this would stop me from eating because I haven’t had my insulin.

It didn’t.

I would get so hungry at times, that I would eat whatever the hell I could find. 
I would then be so consumed with the guilt of eating, that I would completely forget ALL about my insulin. 

I’ve been trying, honestly. I swear. I’ve been trying to get my health back on track. I know this is a horrible thing to do. I know its bad for me, and even worse for my diabetes. I know that my BMI is within the ‘healthy’ range, but it’s not enough.

But I can’t help it. I fucking hate myself. I’m sick of comparing myself to everyone around me. Picking apart what makes them beautiful and makes me ugly. 

I’ve realised that even when I’m alone in my room, I suck in my stomach. Because even I don’t like admitting to myself that I’m overweight, and to the people around me, that isn’t enough. 

Last night, while I was asleep, apparently my mum went through my glucose monitor and saw all the high glucose levels.
I know I need to tell her. I need to explain why they’ve been like this, even though I know there’s no excuse. 

But she won’t understand. She never has. When I told her that girls can also get stretch marks through puberty, she didn’t believe me. When I showed her online articles, she said is was bullshit made up by others to make young girls feel good about themselves, despite being flawed.

I need to tell her, but I don’t know what she’ll do. She won’t believe me. she just won’t. 
I don’t know how to go about telling her. 
I’m at school right now, and will be home in about 5 hours. Im freaking out. 
i don’t know how to tell her.",25Apr2019,2

So I'm 23 M and this guy has been my best buddy for most my whole life and recently I have realised he has been stealing from me, it is not the first time something has gone missing and I was suspicious about it being him before over the years but I didn't think he'd do that but this time he has come into my home, my bedroom and while I went to grab us some food and he has stolen from me again and I know it was full well him this time no doubt as I had bated the shit out of him and he took it. 

I haven't called him out on it, just been completely ignoring him to see if he says anything I've got a few missed calls but nothing else, he lives 3 doors down as well so I'm gonna come across him again at some point. It's been about 3 weeks. 

Honestly I just can't get over him doing this to me and to make it worse I'm kind of on my arse rn, as I have no income and he knows I haven't got a lot of money left. While he has a job and doesn't pay rent.

801,"Hi guys, college sophomore here

I am currently a biology major looking into dental school. This has been my dream for a long time but, not so much anymore.

Since being a college student (since 2015, transferred and took a gap year), I have been absolutely overwhelmed and stressed due to the course work of biology classes, and I've failed chemistry twice. I have been told by 2 different advisors that I should switch my major. The thought of difficult classes and dental school makes it feel so far away and so unattainable. 

I lost my mother to cancer when I was young, and life has been rough for my dad and family. I always promised him that I would become a dentist and make him proud and pay him back with lots of money, and he always mentions how proud he is and how proud my mom would be of me for working so hard.

However-- I have always excelled in my history classes.

I absolutely love history and language, and I have for as long as I can remember. In elementary school, I was the first 4th grader to place second in our local Geography Bee competition (only 5th graders had placed that high before) and in 5th grade I won first place. My dad has been a huge history fan for as long as I can remember, and the fact that history related shows have always been on my TV has definitely rubbed off on me. 

Recently, while putting together a powerpoint for my history class, I just found myself so into it and loving every second. I felt like a professor teaching the class and felt so passionate about it. 

I know in my head that switching my major is the right thing to do, but my heart is telling me to stick with dentistry for my family to make them proud.

Any insight is welcome, please. Thank you

A little background to my situation: I have a mom, two sisters, and a niece that is daughter to my oldest sister. I grew up with my father for a while, but he and my mom were always fighting and I wouldn't know why until I grew older. He did many terrible things. He raped my oldest sister, who was his step-daughter, he spent all of our money on drugs, cheated and lied to my mom, and he has been living in Mexico for the past 5 years. My oldest sister has always struggled and she recently revealed to me the mental trauma that she had been silently enduring her whole life. She and my niece moved in with my mom and I (younger sister, who is older than me, is in college) and has been living with us since last August. She has tried and failed to live on her own for a long time. 

In the beginning of March, my oldest sister purchased a car with her tax returns, as she had been walking everywhere beforehand. Simce she got the car, she's barely been home. My niece really doesn't like her mom when she's drunk (she's an alcoholic, if I haven't mentioned) and her mom's boyfriend is also a drunk asshole. One day, in the middle of March, my younger sister came to our apartment to do a speech for one of her classes. I could not make it because I had to help cook dinner for my girlfriend's family. Anyhow, at the end of the speech, my oldest sister, who was drunk at the time, told my niece to pack her things because she was coming with her. My niece objected because she doesn't like hanging out with drunk assholes, which is where they were going. However, my oldest sister began berating and yelling manipulative and abusive things at my niece when she refused. My younger sister yelled at my oldest sister for being an abusive piece of shit, and my mom for being complacent with abuse. 

My younger sister called CPS to get my niece's custody reviewed, but she spoke to nobody about this. My mom currently works full time and does school full time. And she is really stressed out now because the case worker is discussing a transfer of custody. My mom is getting old and she doesn't want to raise another child. So basically, we don't know what the fuck to do with my niece. I'm contemplating raising her myself, but I'm 18 and financially and mentally unstable. I just signed up for community college in my state so my plate is about to be even more full than it already is. I'm just really tired of bad shit happening everyday. I'm sorry for this poorly written cry for help, I'm on mobile, and just really drained from life at this point. Would appreciate any advice, hahaha. But really, thank you for reading.",25Apr2019,1
