0,"Not long after moving in, I discovered a half-dozen fully-grown plum trees lining my back fence were ill and, in a couple of cases, infected with large, aggressive beetles. The trees were hemorrhaging leaves and posed a risk to nearby trees, so we opted to spend the money to have them removed and replaced with other landscaping. Since it bordered a fence with our neighbor and provided a significant shield privacy, I gave my neighbor a heads-up a couple of weeks before removing the trees and informed him I would replace them with young trees that would provide privacy again over time. For the moment, the trees barely clear the fence, so we both still have a clear view into our homes about 40 yards apart. He received a quote on fence lattice, but it would be $1,200/each, which we simply can't spend right now. As much as I don't want a clear line of sight, I'm OK with waiting a season for the trees to grow - he's clearly not. I want to be understanding, but not $1,200 understanding.",16Oct2019,1
1,"I was born in Utah and raised in the lds church. I knew very few people growing up that weren’t Mormon. My best friend and the only person I related to growing up molested me and raped our other friend in the neighborhood when we were barely middle schoolers. I decided for myself that none of the church was real, and I left the church when I was 13 or 14. Since elementary school I’ve struggled immensely with depression. As time goes on, it gets worse and I’ve recently slipped into psychosis a few times. I’m slowly starting to care less and less about people, myself, and the world as the years go by. Im done with playing the medication game, I flushed  all my antidepressants down the toilet. I’m only 18 now, and I don’t know what step to take next, or if I should proceed at all. I’m confused as to what is real and what isn’t, I feel like I’ve been tricked and lied to since I was born. I’ve spiraled into drug abuse, child porn addiction, lying, nihilism, I think about suicide frequently. I live in constant fear of myself. I don’t know if I’m good or bad, I don’t know if I care.

3,"....it’s a few weeks later and he’s recovering from serious injuries sustained from jumping from a fourth story window.

The nature of our work means that he can do his job with a laptop and phone. At the same time I’ve just found out my fiancé is pregnant  and we need both of us for this to business to work.

He’s said recently that he’s ready to get back to work, I’ve just checked and he’s done nothing at all - outright lying to me. I’ve just explained my situation (I.e. if you don’t chip in this isn’t sustainable and I’ll get a job elsewhere). 

The suicide attempt is complicated by the fact he’s registered blind and he has all his eggs in our business whereas I have more flexibility. I feel a responsibility to him but at the same time everyone is saying he’s taking advantage of me.

5,"I know this is very long but please read I really need help
My parents split up two years ago, but they technically aren’t divorced yet because my dad refuses to pay for it. I had been living with my dad on one side of the state and my mom and brother moved to the other. When they moved out, my mom left me with one of her cats because I love that cat. 
So I had been living with my dad for a while but he got a girlfriend who is a whiny, over sensitive bitch and she has three bratty kids. My dad started being very mean to me and his girlfriend hated me. The three kids were awful and violent and loud. It got to the point of verbal and mental abuse. They’d tell me that they hated me and wished I’d just go away. The kids would hit me and steal my stuff and I was forced to do all of the housework and not allowed to ever leave the house except for school. I got screamed out for the smallest things and my “step siblings” would eat all the food so I often went hungry.
Over the summer, I told my dad I was visiting my mom, and just never went back. I moved in with my mom and got enrolled in my brother’s school. The only things I had with me were the things I brought with me to visit.
I was forced to leave my cat behind initially. I planned to go back and get her and the rest of my belongings when everything calmed down, but every time I tried to get my stuff my dad wouldn’t let me. He doesn’t even like my cat but he won’t give her to me so he can threaten me with her. Every time I piss him off he says stuff like “Do you really want to piss me off when I have your cat?”  He’s holding her hostage and using her to get me to do what he wants because he’s mad I left. My grandma tried to reason with him and get my cat and my stuff but he won’t listen. 
I haven’t seen my baby in three months and I’m so scared for her. My dad has had animal abuse charges pressed against him and I’m terrified he is going to hurt, sell or throw out my cat. I care about that cat more than almost anything and if she gets hurt I don’t know what I’ll do. If I were to call the cops would they be able to make him give us the cat? Keep in mind my dad lives over 2 hours away and we live in Ohio.",16Oct2019,3
6,"I’m at odds right now, and in a challenging situation and need advice. I work at a large mental hospital on overnight shifts. I was the boss this evening (which consists of the supervision of 33 mentally ill patients and 3 staff)  

The registered nurse I work with is a real grump (Jim) He has a history of a explosive temper, and refusing to pass medications when it’s his turn to. He huffs and puffs, pounds loudly away at the computer, and curses under his breath. I usually do good at ignoring this behavior, but this evening he took it too far. There are only three tasks for the overnight shift: (Shift lead - boss) (the medication audit/pass, and the medical chart audit. 

Jim was passing medications when I arrived on my shift that evening, and I was the shift lead (boss).
In more words or less, he was implying that In the future, I am able to pass medications and be the boss at the same time. I told him this is against company policy. He became irate, loud and began shouting, saying that he is above passing medication.  He said in more words or less that I was lazy. 

As he was getting louder and angrier, the patients outside the nursing station could hear him. 

I said to him that he needed to watch his tone. 

He became more irate and said “Fuck you, Bosses don’t do SHIt” 

I said thank you for creating a hostile work environment.

We haven’t spoke since our last two shifts. 

I told my supervisor and he will interviewing him to get both sides of the story, in the meantime, what should I do? My boss gave me the option to not work on that unit for the next couple days until he interviews him. 

How should I proceed, how management proceed, this is an uncomfortable and hostile work environment",16Oct2019,25
8,"Not sure how serious this post will be taken as I’m currently 16 writing this but I hope I can still receive some advice:

My girlfriend and I are coming up on our 1 year anniversary and she has been the only girl in my life I’ve ever properly fallen for; myself being the same situation for her. We are still pretty obsessed with each other and she is still so cute planning our anniversary meal/already got me a present etc (it’s in approx 3 weeks). This post is not about whether to stay with her or not: I love her to pieces no doubt. However this post is more about getting advice on whether I give us a clean slate and put the guilt (I’ve given myself) behind me...

Being 15/16 and both of us having our first proper relationship: we lost our virginity to each other a couple months in and have been sexually active since. However because we live around 35 mins away from each other and she has quite strict parents, sometimes we have around 2 weeks average between having sex. Would obviously like it more often but that’s the logistics of the situation. 
However this is where I made a mistake. Around 6 and half months into our relationship she suddenly seems to really distance herself sexually and basically wasn’t horny at all, for the first few weeks I just presumed it was hormones with her period or something however it seems to persist. Long story short it Lasted over 2 months and so during that time I still had just as much of a sex drive but it wasn’t being able to be fulfilled (sounds selfish, not meaning it that way just don’t know how else to phrase it). Therefore I made the stupid stupid mistake of 1 day accepting the offer of nudes from a girl I’ve been friends with for years. She sent but I never sent anything back, only her.
As soon as I came I instantly had a huge wave of regret and realisation and I honestly burst into tears and felt like instantly apologising and trying to explain to my girlfriend. I was so disappointed in myself I can’t tell you. I told the girl, who sent, this and she said “no of course not, you’re just having a bad moment”. Anyway I felt really shit about it for the next few days and had such guilt: slowly it’s faded however I’m in all 3 subjects at College with this girl and so every once in a while i think back to it and it still hurts me that I did that and my girlfriend doesn’t know.

As you’ve probably guessed by now the question is: do I explain all of this to my girlfriend now and obviously apologise to fully clear my mind before we cross our anniversary... or not.?

For extra context: 
- My girlfriend and I often talk about situations with other people / how the person would react but all theoretical. She is not a really controlling GF but judging by her answers to theoretical situations, I think it’d really upset her and especially the fact I’ve hidden it for so long would worsen it. 
- My GF thinks the girl who sent the nudes, is really slutty and disgusting already because she sends to loads of guys literally most nights of the week still. 

Thank you to anyone who has read all this: some of you may think this is a huge overreaction if you have a lot more open relationships however I hope some of you can understand my situation etc.",16Oct2019,1
9,"So this is a two part question.

First, i just got my first job offer. The money is decent and i think ill really like the company. Some background; i had internships in college but mostly worked in the service/hospitality industries so my professional experience is minimal. I was a business major with a marketing minor at a state school (my grandparents set up a trust so state schools were 100% paid for) so no student debt. I went straight to graduate school from undergrad (MA in marketing communications) so again, not a lot of professional experience but lots of schooling. Anywho, meeting with the company tomorrow to finalize everything after searching for a job for 3 months. Any tips for me starting out? I’m a generally chill, professional person so I’m not so concerned about my personality but more about moving from an education-based life to a full time job. It’s technically my first real job and I’m 25 and am feeling insecure about that.

Secondly, the same trust fund that helped me pay for undergrad got dispersed when I, the youngest cousin, turned 25. I have quite a bit of money from it and my boyfriend and I have been living together for a while but we’ve been living in the apartment above my moms detached garage. It’s nice enough and there are two bedrooms so its spacious but its far away from both of our jobs (about an hour without traffic). We want to move closer since both of our jobs are in the same general area. I want to use the money from the trust dispersement on a down payment for a house. The monthly payment would be a little more than what we would pay for rent in the same area. He’s hesitant which i assumed was a macho thing about not being able to help with the downpayment much. We’ve been dating on and off for six years and have known each other since middle school and know were going to get married. He’s also an electrician with construction background so i know that anything that happens to the house he could either fix or know someone who could fix it for cheaper than a non-industry worker. I know that he would pay back the amount of the down payment in fixes/additions to the house over the years. He says he doesn’t want to rush into anything but also agrees that if we can pay our own mortgage instead of someone else’s we should. I have enough saved/invested that we have enough for a down payment and plenty left over for an emergency/6 months if one of us lost our job, etc. just looking to see if others agree with me, or him, and why. Or if you’ve bought a house what were the unexpected costs or any advice you would have.

Thanks in advance!",16Oct2019,2
12,"Myself and a girl, let's call her Silvia, started a graduate program around two months ago.  Both of us entered the program with long distance (I'm talking &gt; 1000 miles apart each) relationships.  However, since this program began, my relationship has come to an end (it was on good terms, mainly because of the distance and completely unrelated to this situation).  Our relationship of 2.5 years was already on a downward trend before I started school, and the busy life of a grad student was essentially the icing on the cake.

Now for Silvia... I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the day I met her I immediately had a ""crush"" on her.  I was still in a relationship then and felt bad that those feeling arose, but I would *never* think to act on it and have never cheated before.  I stand very firmly with that as it's a pretty fucked up thing to do (obviously).  

Now, since I have become single, this crush has developed into legitimate feelings.  You know how people will say that sometimes you just know right when you meet someone?  Well once I was officially single I essentially had that reaction hit me all at once.  Silvia is absolutely perfect in every way- she's funny, down-to-earth, brilliant, and, as far as I'm concerned, the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

The problem is that she is still dating the guy from her aforementioned long distance relationship.  It would be easier if this guy was a total shitbag, but he seems to be a fine person (even though I don't know why he would take the risk of losing Silvia by letting it go long distance).  She has mentioned a few things to me about prioritization issues between them and some times where he lacks communication since long distance began, but that's about it. She also talked with me a bit when my relationship ended about the perils of going long distance.  We've had moments of 'flirting'- a couple times in class she's started to play footsie when we were sitting next to each other.  You know, something that probably seems like nothing to an outside bystander, but something that I've dwelled on for weeks.  There have been other moments where she reaches out to me to attend events together, go to the gym, etc.  It's possible that she just views me as a friend, but I truly feel there has been some sort of 'spark' from both sides since we met (something which I could certainly be wrong about).

So my debacle-  on one hand,  I feel horrible meddling in someone else's relationship, especially when this guy isn't around town.  It feels shady and immoral, but I think about her *all the time*.  Thinking about her non-stop isn't a decision I make, its just instinctive.  I have butterflies in my stomach just from typing out this post.  I feel like if I don't tell her my true feelings and these feelings persist,  I will spend my twenties filled with regret and wondering what could have been.  

Any honest help is greatly appreciated- I don't usually take to here for advice but don't want to ask anyone in my grad program about it and risk blowing it entirely.  

TL;DR:  I am in love with a girl who has a long distance boyfriend and I have no idea what to do :(",16Oct2019,1

15,"So this is my first post and I didn't know who to talk to this about irl so here I am. So let me start from the beginning

I saw this girl on instagram and she was super beautiful so I dm'd her so I could get to know her, this was around halloween of 2018. So over the past couple days I get her snapchat and we do all that and about a week later I get her phone number. So im talking to this girl through text and we start talking more and more frequently as time goes by. I ask her to hangout sometime about 2 weeks after I got her number and she said she wanted to get to know me more first, which I understood because we were complete strangers a couple weeks ago. So time goes by, thanksgiving, Christmas, new years, and I'm still texting this girl. So its valentines day comes and I still haven't seen her in person but I know I'm not being cat fished bc she's been snapping me and just other factors that prove that she's who she says she is. Still to this point I've still haven't seen her, but I have asked her out again multiple times but every time its the same thing, she finds an excuse to not keep our plans. By this point I like this girls personality  and all I want to do is just meet and spend time with her but shes always finding an excuse. she says she likes me and wants to see me, wants to go on a date with me, saying this and that so I know im not in the friend zone.

Basically what I described before kept going on until still to this day october 2019. I just dont know what to do theres so much detail to this story I know im missing so much details. So ive actually called her out about 2 times throughout the year of how she said she wants to see me but never falls through with the plans and how I'm the only one trying to say something up to see each other. Now its literally been over 10 times ive asked her and the same results. she says she's busy and that is the reason but she wasn't doing anything for most of this year, she barely started going to school this fall and previous only had a job for a month. She says she doesn't have time but every month she always goes on roadtrips with her friends for a couple days and even went to Hawaii to spend a month there while im just here waiting for any opening in her ever so busy schedule. Through all this shes still texting me like all day everyday. Idk im all the place trying to explain the situation, it just makes me sad how id do anything to spend time with her and it seems like she doesnt want to. Like I said before I called her out on this and she keeps saying she does want to see me this and that, and im the type of person to not give up on someone so thats why when theres the slightest bit of hope I stick around. It just bothers me that if shes says the things she does how come she never puts her words into actions. Should I just give up on her.",16Oct2019,1

20,"Hi ok I've never used this before so I have no idea if this is where this belongs, but I don't really know what to do.

Basically im friends with this guy (21) whos kinda quiet and doesn't really talk much, and has ended up with very few friends, which is a pity because he's really sweet! However the problem is that he's kinda using me as almost his therapist? This involves telling everything that's bothering me, telling me about certain worrying thoughts he's had, getting me to stay up talking to him about things he's struggling with until 5 in the morning when I have an intense 9 hour uni day the morning after. 

And while I'm so happy I can help, I've got problems of my own that, while being not as bad as they used to be, still are quite difficult to deal with, and taking on a whole other persons issues will end up completely overwhelming me.

This has led me to try and encourage him to go to counseling numerous times, but he says he doesn't want to talk to someone he doesn't know, and that taking medication and going to counseling makes someone weak. (I've done/am doing both those things, which hes aware of) On top of that he says that he doesn't need it, and especially not if he has me. He doesn't seem to see that I really can't do this for him, plus I'm hardly qualified.

I just don't know what to do, I mean I've been struggling with mental health since I was around 13, so I kinda know what it's like to need someone to talk to about these things, but I also know the emotional weight that comes from carrying someone elses problems on top of your own. And I don't think I can manage it.

A bike is out of the question because they're too big, sadly. However if you've got an idea but aren't sure if it'd work for planes, let me know anyway and I'd just use it for the other one or two. 


I've tried rollerblades before because they're compact and faster than walking but they take way too long to get on and functioning, also they don't work that well on stairs. Furthermore since you can't just get them on and off, on top of stairs, hills and bumpy roads are a huge negative in the reliability department. The skill ceiling on them is also pretty high, I'd say at least 10 to 20 times higher than a bike but only 5-10 times higher than a skateboard.

30,"So a little background first. I've never been good in making friendships or doing anything involving other people since I was a kid. I was bullied and ostracized a lot when I was in middle school and ended up being homeschooled so I was isolated a lot of time. I'm in college now and while I've adjusted well academically, I'm struggling to make meaningful friendships or honestly just do anything involving other people besides for a few things in my comfort zone. I seem to do well at small talk and can get up to getting thier number or a vapid promise to hang out again, but that's it. I get too scared to call them and ask to hang out, and it's like I have go through a huge anxiety-filled hurdle to do so and it's so exhausting. I get this urge to push people away and just do stuff I can do alone, like studying and watching youtube or writing (my favorite hobby)

Like I was walking by the courts and saw kids my age playing. I wanted to so bad to ask if I could join them, it would have been a great way to spend the night and hang out with people.

37,"Here’s background to this. My dog is a barker, he barks a ton when he’s scared, and he gets scared a lot. We’ve had him since he was 10 weeks, and the entire year we’ve had him, he’s never bitten anybody. 
This park is a shut down school with a giant field, and houses are all around it. People (including me) have used this park for our dogs for a long time. 
Recently, there’s been a lot of soccer kids here and said park. And my dog’s been getting scared and barking once in a while. 
So my dog was playing with his friend and running around on a patch of grass away from the fields, and the dogs ran into part of the field (that wasn’t in the way of the kids) once. Then when we got them back onto the patch, an older man walked by. My dog got very freaked out and barked at him. He events stopped barking, and the dogs were playing without barking for a while.
Then the soccer mom arrives. I expected her to ask us to put the leashes on, or something like that. But instead, she proceeds to tell us that DOGS ARE BANNED from the park/school grounds. Because some people didn’t pick up dog poop and now it’s a hazard. And their kids are “scared” of the dogs. ( mostly puppies/ smaller dogs in the neighborhood)

So. What should I do about dogs being banned at the park? The soccer mom said all dogs in general, on and off leash.
Also, the park is the safest place for me to walk my dog without the risk of reckless and speeding sports parents.

P.S, these sports parents have caused a lot more problems. Blocking our parking spots, littering all over the field, etc.",16Oct2019,2
38,"A bit of context. I recently got my Masters degree in Teaching English which qualifies me to become a teacher of English and consequently have a career as that. This is career option number one. 

I currently find myself more in tune with photography more than I ever was. I've enjoyed photography for a long time but it's just recently I sensed that I got better at it and I took it as a serious career choice. I think the reason why is that I've been unemployed for a couple of months now which left a huge chunk of my time free. Photography filled that gap. The catch is that I take pictures with a phone as I can't afford a camera right now being unemployed. This is career option number 2. 

I find it hard to commit to either one because I haven't made up my mind yet. Photography is great and can be profitable and fun but most often than not it's just alot of freelancing. Meaning that you have to properly finance your life since there will probably be timea when there are no jobs available.
Teaching, on the other hand, is more stable. You have a salary for each month with some benefits. I understand even with a salary you can screw up ruin your life financially. It just more stable. This is a major factor as to why I am confused.

I really need advice here. I don't know whether to drop the career switch idea and stick with teaching or going full in and take a risk by chosing career option 2.

40,"This is a long story that I require some advice and opinions on so please buckle up. 

I was in a car accident when I was very young that left me paralyzed , in turn came a lot of other problems. 2.5 years ago I got hospitalized for being extremely sick and basically steering head on to death ,important to note I was trying to kill myself or rather that I had made peace with the fact that I would kill myself, I starved myself which quickly spiraled into many other problems due to my body not being strong enough to support everything that ensued,got pneumonia and a bunch of other shit stacked on top of each other that made it very hard to tell what the actual problem was. This went on for 2-3 months before I had a breakdown and asked to be hospitalized after going back to school and not being able to breathe properly anymore.  
My main physician in hospital was the same one I had had for 10 years now so you could say the man was trusted by me and my family we didn’t think a doctor would try to steer us to a worse circumstance. I was open from the beginning about being suicidal, it was hard to miss,and so began what I thought would be the journey to recovery. A lot of small blood test were done and they were pumping me full of meds for approximately 2 months before I started asking why I was getting worse,and had not gotten a clear answer on what was actually wrong or happening, my doctor refused to talk to me in person and would do his “ rounds” when I was sleeping which was quite often due to extremely strong psych meds and being weaker than when I was admitted to hospital. I had lost more than 30kgs I was losing all my hair at this point and I had developed some wounds. The wounds got worse,I got worse everything got worse and  this went on for months, in total 9months ish possibly more. I know this sounds stupid to stay where I was getting worse but at that stage I was 17 and still under my mothers guardianship so I couldn’t be released without her consent and unfortunately she had more faith in our Dr. than anyone else on this earth, every time I had a mental breakdown about my health declining the blame was shifted on me wanting to die and that I was “sabotaging” myself which was never a he case since I had been admitted.  Around August I had basically cornered my Dr. after over dozens of surgeries and had asked him if I was going to die anyway why can’t I die at home? Why am I here and getting worse? My Dr. then broke a giant bombshell in which he stated that I had bone infection in my hips , they had known since the he beginning of my stay,and that there is no easy way to say this but my legs would have to be amputated due to the level the bone infection had gotten to. At this stage I had just turned 18 and my Dr had given me no option besides death or amputation and possible death, and I had said I would never choose amputation and would rather die. Shortly after I got released out of hospital still extremely ill but at that point our medical aid had stopped paying for anything and they had no choice but to send me home. During the time at home my dr. Had given me a ultimatum for when I would have to decide on the amputation by, everyone said if the amputation would save my life then I should do it and that I don’t have a choice , but shit didn’t make sense to me and I kept denying. 
We ended up getting a call from someone working for our medical aid doing a check up on me because it had seem strange to them as to why I had just spent 9 months in hospital and wasn’t getting better, my mom explained the story to them and they had noted that something did not seem right and insisted/booked us to go see a specialist as a second opinion. I didn’t want to see anyone , I was afraid it would be a lot worse than it was , but agreed to go anyway. In the consultation room of the specialist I had told him my story and he looked extremely skeptical as if I had just thumb sucked everything out of thin air and that I was flying about more than half of the real story, he asked me how the DR. Had determined I had bone infection and I couldn’t answer because I legitimately didn’t know , I was so drugged up more than half of the time and I’m theater the other half that I had no actual idea when what was happening. The specialists examined me and saw my (basically now septic ) surgical wounds , and had found medical debris ? Left behind and grown into my wounds causing further infection , he immediately booked me into this new hospital to get the shit that had been left in my wound removed and clean out everything . I went for scans and test and everything and I came back with no bone infection , I was having a mental breakdown at this point because nothing was making any sense anymore nothing seemed real. My doctor had lied about everything and had worsened my situation tenfold and I was busy dying. I had nothing left in my body, not enough blood not enough nutrients ...nothing ,I had gone into shock a few times with a heart rate over 200bpm among other things.  My resting heart rate at this time was 170bpm without me moving , I was in the worst shape ever but the new specialist and his whole team managed to over the course of a year fix me. 

Now the opinion/advice part the old Dr. had forbidden my mother to take me to other doctors and had told her he would deny everything if he were to be questioned. They had never documented or put on record a lot of the stuff that had happened to me and basically made a lot of the torment  i experienced out as if it had never even happened. He has since then retired after having a heart attack after receiving a phone call from my New doctor who was left with the shit show he had managed to cause ( might be a coincidence might not) . It’s been a year since I have officially been out of hospital and it’s great but a lot of what happened has left me traumatized beyond anything I can accurately describe , I don’t trust anyone. I will not go near a doctor or a hospital if it is not the doctors that fixed me. I am insanely depressed and I have anxiety.I feel like my life had been thrown away for almost 3 years and now I have to try and scrape everything together again. I feel useless and worthless ....What should I do or opinions in general ? 
(I was offered to sue him but I feel so fucked up mentally and physically that I don’t know if I’d make it like even talking about the whole situation triggers me into suicidal thoughts and even some sort of ptsd episodes, I feel like everything that transpired was my fault for wanting to die in the first place and that it would be turned on me if I had to take legal action)",16Oct2019,1

42,"I used to not trust anyone. I've moved to being able to mostly trust people, but inconsistencies really rock me. I tend to really settle in with people at first and let my guard down hard. Everything is fine, it's all good, I don't imagine there ever being a problem. But no one is perfect, and the minute something pops up with that person, I have a hard time just solving the problem and moving on. For hours, days, sometimes weeks, I have a habit of asking over and over again for reassurance that the problem is solved and everything is okay.

43,"Hey just looking for simple advice on this matter, mostly just how to bring up how fucked up this is to my parents.

Long story short I go to college and am on a tuition payment plan. My parents usually pay my tuition but this semester decided they wouldn’t be able to and I would need to pay it my self. The tuition is paid in 3 installments, first one they paid, second one I was supposed to get my own loan for, third one I pay out of pocket. I had let them know I wouldn’t be able to secure my own loan with the low amount of credit I have, they pretty much just told me figure it out. Now 2 weeks later I obviously still can’t pay it and my dad is down my neck about it. 

Well my job messed up one of my direct deposits and had to send a check to me by mail. Problem is they sent it to my parents address but I live by my college now. I had told them my paycheck is coming in the mail and I would be picking it up. 

Today I get a text from my mom stating the paycheck came in but she opened it thinking it was something else (obvious lie), and that they will be keeping the check and putting it towards the tuition payment and I would have to pay them the rest of the tuition. 

I have already cancelled the check and had my job send out a new one to my current address. I haven’t responded to them yet but I’m just trying to figure out the best way to go about telling them that no matter the situation that’s an incredibly fucked up thing to do. I have other bills and shit I need to pay for so they can’t decide to take money that I’ve worked for, especially when I don’t even live with them anymore.

Just note they’re obviously more on the strict and hard headed side otherwise I would have already said something. But I’m honestly at the point where I don’t even care anymore. I’m 21 and don’t live with them, if I have to graduate later because I can’t pay tuition for now I don’t mind it.

Me and Alex has been a long time friend. 

We was at a escape room solving puzzles and finding clues with our friends. 

After that we went to the train station and he got angry because I did not tell him that we need to pay.

But what really happened was that I NEVER told Alex that my friend had free tickets. He might have misunderstood but kept arguing. 

However this is not the first time. I’ve met him 3-4 times this month and all of the times we have met had just been us arguing. I cannot remember what it was but even if it was just a small argument it is still causing a bad mood in the air.

Right, so back in May right after graduation I didn't wait around to look for a job, I was hunting online, going to offices and asking around, even my former teacher tried helping but nothing and I got super depressed, and anxious cause I just spent a few years and money and I'm starting to second guess my self. Now at the time and at the end of that semester is when I met my true set if friends, like I mean true friends and they've always been there to support me. And at the same time I was chasing after a girl and over that summer even though I was down, when I was around her I pretended my problems did not exist. At the end of the summer though a company I talked to said they would take me on as an intern and instantly I took it, it was one and only shot and a for sure ticket ya know. When I started my boss asked about my goals and I told her. The day I started she came to me and said ""we usually have two designers at a time, but since the other dropped I will not only train you as a graphic artist, but to be an director as well, and when the internship is done I will put in a referral for you to be a director."" And ever since she have truely been the best, but in the first two weeks I got an offer out of state, and ice always wanted to work out of state because where I live now isn't exactly the best for graphic design. Now the girl I mentioned before we were close to dating but when I told her my goals, she flipped and it turned to an argument, and we parted was, I won't talk about what was said because it no longer has relevance. Now we get to the part where I need help. So the same night, a friend of mine comforts me over what just happen, and I've known her for a while now, but never seen her other than a friend. And since then we've hung out like every day and talk all the time, and when we talk there's this energy and it's never negative. So for a while I just focused on my self, but a few weeks ago we were talking and she brought up the words "" her boyfriend"" and before that moment I never seen her other than a friend, but when she said that I got mad, because how she said he treated her and just uses her. We talked and got past it and things were normal, until Sunday. We talked again Sunday but this time, I couldn't keep my feelings inside, and neither could she. She didn't exactly say she likes me, but I think that is part in her being in a relationship, but we said all these things about each other, like how we are our true selves with each other, and how we want to spend more time together. And since it's been very different, and now it's good morning, goodnight, how's your day, what are you doing ect. And we went out last night and it's was soooo different we couldn't stop looking at each other, smiling talking or anything, but there was a moment and maybe I'm reading too much into this, but she ""compared"" hand sizes and hesitated like she wanted to hold hand or more, but she pulled away as if forcing herself.

Like this school is super hard and no electives the classes go by super slow and I have so much homework. In one class of you get below a 90 you have to goto tutorials for 3 hours just to earn a retake and if you get below a 90 again it repeats and I have to goto mandatory tutorials every single day after school because I'm not getting an 80 in that class. I'm only 14 I don't think I'm mature enough for this school if I do bad on the college class it stays on my record forever and I won't be able to get into a good college. Is it really worth it? I get so drained during the day from all the work and stuff to do. I miss all my friends at the other school even though they are 2 minutes away from eachother most of them are too tired after school or have foot ball so I don't see any of them often.  Il also miss out on the high school experience il be maturing so quick at this school and have so many responsibilities when thease are the last 4 years of my childhood almost because I wont have all the responsibilitys but at the hard one I will. I have friends there but not very good ones. I'm doing bad at this school and I just dont know what to do I know its free but to get into college it will be hard even if I do well because it's such a small school (68 in our grade) and 70 in others like sophomore junior senior so to get into the college I want it would be out of top 8 and I hate doing school work. And the normal highschool is rated poorly same with the overall school district but the college one is rated good but all the schools besides that was rated good but I went to the regular middle school and my teachers were supportive and awesome and I literally loved going to school even though it was rated bad but it was still awesome because I had my friends I did well there but I'm scared if I do goto regular it's not gonna prepare me for college my moms friend said it made college really hard for her and dropped out and she went to the normal highschool but others did normal please help me out.

•File for transferee for the hopes of getting accepted, if I get rejected then I will stop for a semester, help my family business(we own a little food place) while on the process of fixing myself then file again next semester on and on until I get accepted. I really don't want to get back at my current university. 

I still haven't consulted to a professional about my mental health state. I haven't been open to my family about everything, until this happened. It's the only time I opened up to them. What are your thoughts? Help me with some of your advices please",16Oct2019,3
65,"My (25F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been dating for a bit over two years now. We live together. Have two dogs together. Are currently planning to move to Colorado in a couple months after he (hopefully) gets a job offer with a company he's been doing small financial business stuff for. 

But my parents have shown zero interest in getting to know him. They've only spent time with him during major events like the holidays or my college graduation, and the few times I've brought this up to my mom.... Nothing happens. 

My mom started a new job about a year ago, and it causes her a lot of stress. She also hates having people over because she thinks the house looks messy; this in turn probably due to her being stressed she doesn't have the energy to clean as often. And recently, kind of told me she was unavailable for a couple months due to having to run a special election. 

I feel like I keep making excuses for her and my dad. I don't think I'm the outlier - when I look at my other three siblings, they are/have been the ones getting plans in motion for significant others to hang with them. And I don't know if I have an unrealistic expectation since my boyfriend's parents are ALWAYS inviting us to get togethers. 

I'm not even sure what advice I'm looking for? - How to get my parents to take this situation seriously? Am I overthinking the situation? I plan to marry this man and them not expressing any interest, especially when they live only an hour away, kills me. Thanks for any helpful thoughts.",16Oct2019,3

I did not contact the police as he is in a police family and he said they would do nothing and he would kill me. 

I did nothing. However when he went to shower,  took pictures of my face, my bloody covered phone and the strangulation marks on my neck. I sent them to myself on Facebook and deleted them. The next morning when he left for work (taking my keys too). I went to the neigbors and asked to use her phone. I logged into Facebook resent the pictures to the only coworkers full name i know and begged her to give our district manager the word. 

This past week I got out. Me and my daughter have been sleeping in our car and my coworker has been trying to help me find places to go. When I asked her what time did I work, she told me I needed to call HR. 

I did. And was told that due to HR policy, I no longer have a job there. 

I am devastated. Confused. Ive cried so much the past week I dont know what to do now. He advised me to contact another person and I did. The only thing I got back was, ""im sorry your having a difficult time. Let me know if there are anything we can do. Thanks! - signed her name."" I replied saying, so thats it. I just have no job now? There was NO WAY for me to contact anyone I dont understand."" I then sent the bloody pictures to her. I got back, ""unfortunately theres nothing i can do about the job situation. Ive already filled out the paperwork. ""

I messaged him on IG about it, we had a small back and forth, and I ended it with letting him know to keep my name out his mouth and blocked him. Pretty juvenile stuff, I know. Later, I hear that he apparently didn't have a beef w me at all. I decide to text him again letting him know I wish him well and to take care, and then I block him again just to end the exchange there; didn't really care for what he had to say in return. 

Pretty lowkey exchange overall. Didn't think much of it for a few weeks. Then, last week, out of nowhere, I suddenly get this voice in my head telling me over and over that I ended the exchange too ""nicely"", and that I should've been meaner/pettier because of the negative things he said about me during our exchange? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever; this guy and the convo we had have no impact on my life at all, yet I can't seem to shake that voice, which just leads to me overthinking the way I ended the conversation, thought spirals, etc. Any tips on what I can do to help alleviate this random anxiety over a non-issue that came out of nowhere?

77,"I'm currently in a moral bind, for lack of better words.  Also I'm on mobile so formatting is probably terrible.

And I would definitely like to say that I am not seeking legal advice. Just moral help on how to deal with a locally owned business employer.

My employers refused to schedule me due to a moderate to severe stutter. After my friends and family pushing me, and my bosses telling me they would schedule me when I was ""better I ended up contacting a lawyer who put me through to another lawyer that does non profit work for people in a situation like me.  The lawyer that was given my case was fantastic. I got a different job since then and its actually much better than my previous job. The lawyer and I decided to keep pursuing the case though because they can't get away with the discrimination.

Anyways my employers were given a deadline to pay me for wages in would have gotten if I was still being scheduled at least my regular hours. The deadline was Monday. I spoke with my lawyer this morning and she said my 1 boss called her, basically telling my lawyer that she is sorry this happened, I've know my one boss for 14 years as I am friends with her son. She also said that they don't have the money. 

Now I've got a few options. I could continue to pursue the case and let it go to the civil rights commission. That will take 6 to 9 months and end up causing my employer to pay even more to pay the group my lawyer is with so they can continue to do what they do, also my lawyer said that at that point she recommends that we go for emotional damages and medical costs as well. Up to this point we just asked for reimbursement for what I should have been working. 

My 2nd option is lower the amount we are asking. As bad as it sounds I'd like to avoid this because the amount we asked for would be just enough to get a $1000 used car since my car is going to pieces. 

A 3rd option my mom and I thought up was that they pay half now and half in about 6 months. My lawyer likes that we are willing to do this but worries my employer may just refuse to pay the other half.

85,"Today I deleted a very old friend from Facebook. We haven't really spoken much in past years (we have lived very far away from each other) so he's more like an acquaintance now. However, we were close enough that I think he will still feel confused and hurt when he realizes that I deleted him.

I had a thing for him when we knew each other. I never told him. I thought I was over it for a long, long time. I only thought about him when he would text me or invite me to visit him, so only a few times each year after I moved. He stopped inviting me to visit after his engagement. He got engaged a few years ago, married last year. Guys came and went in the many years since I last saw him. I'm now in a 3-year-long relationship. 

After his engagement, I thought I could handle it. But after the marriage, I kept seeing updates about his life on Facebook. I tried unfollowing him, but it didn't help. I realized that if it hurts to see these pictures online, I couldn't dream of seeing him again in real life. I told my current boyfriend about these unresolved feelings and he was very understanding, but suggested it would be best for me to delete my old friend from Facebook. I agreed.

Now, here's the problem. Should I tell the friend why I deleted him? I was leaning towards not saying anything, because he's married and it seems like all of reddit agrees that you should never talk about feelings with a married person to respect the sanctity of marriage. I get that, but I'm also not trying to start anything with him. I want to kindly end all contact forever, and I want him to know why I'm doing that. Again, we never actually flirted with each other, so I think he would not make assumptions about why I deleted him. I think he would be confused and upset.

I read this thread and most people agreed that it's never OK to ghost someone: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/del5lq/aita\_for\_deleting\_my\_friend\_with\_no\_warning\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/del5lq/aita_for_deleting_my_friend_with_no_warning_or/)

But is it OK to ghost an old (and married) friend? What is the correct thing to do in this situation? 

Please don't say stuff like ""you were never really friends"" or ""he won't care because it's been so long"" or blanket statements which assume things you don't actually know. I really think life and people are more complicated and nuanced than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I tried my hardest since an old friend's engagement to resolve my feelings for him, but I really just swept the feelings under the rug. I decided to cut all contact and delete him off social media. Should I tell him why I did this (he is MARRIED) or should I just ghost my friend and never let him know why?

I know there's not a great option here, but I really want to do the less wrong thing in this situation.",16Oct2019,1

I can’t do anything without affecting my husband.  Everything I do is a “joint decision.”  I feel like I’ve completely lost who I am.  I feel like my husband never even considered what I’d have to go through to change my name.  To him it’s insignificant.  To me, I changed my identity that I’ve had my whole life.  It took a lot of paperwork, I had to change my signature that has become natural, the connection with my family is completely different...Also, not to mention, I went to grad school and I am published, but under my maiden name.  I’m a lecturer, and I’ve had a reputation under my old name...but no one knows me under my new name.  I feel like I’m not a whole person anymore because I’m not really in control of my life...I’m not really doing the things I used to because all of my time is spent on work, chores, and things we do together.

We used to have different work schedules, so our schedules overlapped somewhat...I’d have time to myself and time to go grocery shopping, tidy up the house, and do things for myself (exfoliating, face masks, etc.).  Now, we moved about an hour away and commute together.  We work pretty close to each other, so it made sense to commute together.  But, now I have absolutely no time to myself anymore.  I used to see friends a lot more frequently as well, but now it’s much more difficult to plan.  I can barely take care of myself anymore.  I have a hard time just showering and brushing my teeth.  

My husband asks me what I get up to every day.  Sometimes I just don’t want to tell him anything...it’s not that I’m doing anything I shouldn’t.  I just don’t want to have to explain everything I do.  I just want to be able to be spontaneous and do things with no explanation like I used to.

Lately, I’ve been very depressed.  I just lay in bed all day as soon as I’m home pretty often.  I’ve been incredibly stressed and have been stress eating and drinking alcohol every day to deal with my problems.  My husband is trying to be supportive and is trying to help me.  I’ve talked to him about my problems, but none of us really know how to deal with it.  He doesn’t completely understand, and he just keeps asking me questions over and over again.

94,"We moved from Tennessee to Florida 3 months ago because my parents (really my mom) wanted to. We had a stable life in Tennessee until my mom got fired due to a crappy manager.

Anyways, they ended up buying a house here, but payed about $50K more than they should have because they were counting on my mom being able to find a job. She hasn’t. Nobody in our city is hiring (so she says), and she doesn’t want to work for a Doctor’s Office (really common down here). 

The last few days, she and my dad have been fighting and screaming at each other because she’s miserable about it and she’s making everyone else feel terrible. I get that she has her problems, but we don’t know what to tell her because she refutes any advice we give her.

This time I was Stern and said to stop doing that, it's not funny. He got serious, apologized, said he wouldn't do it ever again, and we moved on.

Now - why is this bothering me the more I think about it?

Doug is a friendly guy who everyone loves, he's a great coworker and friend, and he obviously didn't do it with the intention of harm. I wouldn't go to hr for this (but if this was someone else I 110% would).

I told him to stop and not do that again, but for some reason I still feel like I need to talk to him about it.

I'm not sure why it bothers me .. is it because my boyfriend has and will never do that to me? I have anxiety and history growing up with an alcoholic father - is that what triggered it?

How would you handle the situation if a male friend did that to you? 

P.s I did message him to say I want to talk to him about this. Not sure if this is the right approach but shrugs I feel like this will help me calm down before my vacation",16Oct2019,2
99,Hi! So I've been living in MN while in college for the past 2 years.. I'm going to graduate in the winter which means my parents are kicking me out( actually they are kicking me out in November) and I dont really know what to do. Living here is very expensive and the only person I could move in with is a guy I've been dating for like 3 months.. which seems a little sketchy. I've been looking for people who need a roommate on some apps and things.. but it hasn't been very successful.. I don't really know if even I want to try and make it here just because I'm not really in love with the area I live in but I recently got a pretty good job.. So I feel like I kind of need to stay here for the money. Honestly I don't have a clue as to what I should do.. or where I should go. Any tips as to where I should go or what I should do? Thanks.,16Oct2019,2

Anyways she recently told me she’s been dealing with suicidal thoughts and I don’t know what to do to help her. She always says how she hates life and it makes me sad to see her always so stressed and angry with the world. I want to tell our school counselor (which i have tried to tell her to go to the school counselor) but I feel like even though the counselor won’t tell my friend who told her she needed help my friend would know it was me and the whole thing would be pointless cause why would she tell everything to the counselor if she doesn’t even wanna go in the first place and all that would happen is she would be mad at me for telling the counselor. Her parents always invalidate her depression so she doesn’t like talking to them about it and so I feel like she doesn’t have anyone besides me and a few other friends to really talk to and I don’t know if that’ll be enough for her and I just want her to be okay so I don’t know what to do to help her.",16Oct2019,2

104,"So I have a best friend named Jake. He’s been my best friend for about 3 years now. Every time I introduce him to one of my female friends he immediately falls in love with them. The first time I was annoyed right off the bat. He started talking to her, inviting her to go smoke with him (I’m completely against his smoking or drinking, we’re in the 8th grade). Their friendship died out because he lost feelings really quickly, but she didn’t. Her and I fell off and things severed between her and us. She was a little bit of a whore. Now I have a new best friend. Jake has fallen in ‘love’. The thing is, when he falls, he falls hard. He stops texting me, or at least he texts in one word replies, and devotes all his time to her. They’ve been FaceTiming non stop, hanging out, etc. he’s taking her to spots that he’d take girls before having them suck him off or something. I really like this new friend, but I hate being left out of something I started. I don’t want a harem,   believe me. I’m happy with my boyfriend and I want them to be happy. But being ignored and having him not talk to me at all kind of sucks.

111,"My best friend, who is joining the military soon, has offered to marry me for benefits. She benefits from this by getting extra pay (she will pocket all/most of it) and getting her family off her back for being gay (she feels comfy enough with me to take a few romantic pictures to send home). I will benefit from this by being declared independent for financial aid purposes and getting healthcare. 

My parents aren’t helping me with college at all, which is partially understandable due to how much my health has cost them. I don’t wanna go into details, but I have an extremely expensive medical condition. My parents can barely afford it and their salaries should make us upper middle class. 

I’ve got scholarships for college that would leave me paying ~$7k a year, which isn’t bad, but when you factor in the costs of medical care, my special diet, interest rates (w/o a co-signer)  etc., that is unmanageable. Marriage would mean access to pell grants, other need-based aid, and good health care. 

We both think that this is a sound idea, for the most part. I feel kinda guilty about this, as it (in my opinion) is basically fraud. I feel like this is unfair to people who pay taxes toward the military - they want their money to go to actual families, not broke and disabled adults who are just tying to get a head start in life. I also fear the consequences for my friend if she were to get caught “cheating.” IIRC, cheating gets you in major trouble in the military, no? Then there’s the divorce problem.

113,"Hi, I'd like to clear up that this is actually my Wife's story. She has a manufacturing job with a very big Company. She has had troubles with people before, and this concludes my theory that race privilege is very severe in this case. 

There is no racism here, just a perspective from reality. My wife is white, very white, while I am Asian. Onto the point...

She works on a job where there is a ""Chain of Command"", the Section leader, Supporters, offline support, and workers.

Recently, a new girl was hired for the job, and she came in to the job all ""Sassy"" and back-talking, also says ""I don't F\*ck with White people."", you know, the overall. Fortunately for her, this manufacturing area is dominantly Black, with the exception of my wife, and maybe less than 10 other mixed races at most. 

This girl had caused trouble for my wife while training under her, and my wife is one of those ""silent"" working non-attention seeking people; she doesn't really fight. This really hurt my wife's performance on paper, while the new girl suffers nothing for it. Recently, this new girl got to go train under one of those ""relax"" jobs, which was usually reserved for the veteran workers or the more experienced people -  Which my wife is well qualified for. So now the new girl gets to jump ahead of my wife's career, because she is Black, the Section leader, Supporters, etc. all in favor of her because she is black? 

Many instances my wife has experienced racial favoritism, from getting overworked compared to her counterparts, promotions, etc. This new girl can back-talk and sass, have her hair out of OSHA regulation, but my wife can't let one strand of hair loose or she gets written up. 

I take it that it's not just favoritism for the new girl, because it happens for most the rest of the ""black"" people too, while the few other races among themselves admit that there IS racial privilege, and they can't do anything about it. I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but it is reality, and usually when anyone speaks up, it gets shot down as ""racism"". I know my wife's coworkers who are black, realize this too.

Obviously my wife isn't going to keep this job for the long run, but is there anything she can do legally? It isn't fair that her performance is automatically over-ruled by people, just because she isn't ""Black"". She just wants to go to work, do her time, and get paid. Not go to work, Flirt with all of the guys, back-talk, make everyone's lives harder, and ignore ""white people"" because she doesn't ""F\*ck with white people"".

I get it, racial preferences happen all the time, white, black, Asian, Mexican, Undead or Blood elf. It's unacceptable either way, and I know that in my workplace, race is nothing but words. We are all equal and we are placed in the chain of command based off of performance. I want my wife to feel the accomplishment I felt, because I worked hard. Not because I related to the race of my superiors, or even kissed ass. She doesn't deserve this. 

I am really asking for ANY kind of advice.

What are the legal steps my wife can take to equalize the benefits? Are there government outlines?

How can I assure my wife that working will pay off in the long-run? This job is well paying for our age, but with all this going on, it really makes my wife feel unaccomplished and work will be a drag for her.

Sorry if this is too much to read, I am only cramming 5% of the situation into little short paragraphs, I may get backlash, but I hope you guys will see the frustration. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen her in like 5 months, but I'm going to see her tomorrow, and I'm probably not going to see her again for a similarly long while after. We used to be decent friends (we could hold a conversation, but we didn't really actively seek each other out), and I liked her then too, but I never told her. I've decided to just go ahead and ask her out before we drift too far apart. I've been obsessing over the last month or so about what I'm going to say to her, and I've been beating myself up about not just telling her before. However, now that they day is finally nearly here, I'm starting to feel like I don't really want to tell her. Maybe that I don't even really like her in that way.

I'm worried I'll follow this feeling, not tell her, and regret it later. Here are the possibilities I've thought of for why my feelings have done this to me:

Case A: I'm just getting nervous, since the thing that I'm going to see her at is also a pretty nerve-racking event (Midterms), and I'm just shutting up my feelings until I deal with the other stressor, and afterwords I'll regret not having said anything. I've done this before, and the regrets afterwards suck.

Case B: Even more worrisome, I wonder if I don't actually like her, and instead I've fallen for some fantasy idea of her that my mind has concocted over the past months to fill the romantic void in my mind, and I don't actually like the real her anymore. The only reason I feel that this might not be true is that I've *actually* liked her for many years in the past. If I go ahead and ask her out, and my feelings turn out to be for the fantasy, I'll probably regret it no matter what happens. I've also done this before, except it was a lot more obvious because I had never really even had a conversation with the person I was fantasizing over, so I didn't ever ask them out.

I'm thinking I'll probably get some indication of what to do once I'm actually speaking to her, and my real emotions have a chance to show themselves, but I'm also worried that I'll actually like her, but I'll chicken out, and rationalize it as Case B.

I've been so frustrated over the last month about not being able to talk to her, but now that I have the opportunity to attempt to establish contact with her, the fact that I'm considering not taking advantage of it is making me question my sanity and my motives. In that order.",16Oct2019,2

When I do that, often times I can't manage my school work and my extracurriculars, and I get super stressed.

My best friend and I occupy the top floor, and the other two girls live on the main floor. My best friend, let’s call her Girl A and one of the girls that lives below us, let’s call her Girl B, and I are all really good at picking up our slack around the house. We clean up after ourselves after we’ve made a mess in the kitchen, had people over, etc. However the second girl that lives downstairs, let’s call her Girl D does nothing to help out. Yesterday she left a big box in our kitchen next to the garbage can after receiving a package. Okay, no biggie, “I’m sure she’ll discard it sometime over the next 24 hours”. Nope. So Girl A sends Girl C a picture of it and asks if she can move it because there’s no reason for her personal belongings to be residing in our commons space(s). Girl C gets pissed off, and begins to ignore Girl A. This, by default, upsets me because Girl A is my best friend and one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. So I call a little meeting, I tell everyone I want open lines of communication and I want everyone picking up after themselves, it’s only fair, right? Well Girl C screams at me, “IT’S A FUCKING BOX!” Okay. Girl C does nothing to help out; doesn’t take the trash to the curb, doesn’t empty recycling can into recycling bin, doesn’t empty dishwasher, leaves a mess in the kitchen every time she cooks, etc. At one point during our discussion, she actually said, “I just think you and I have different standards of cleanliness” ???? Clean is clean, end of story. After the conversation, where I said all I needed to say, she continued to be defensive and honestly just rude. I asked if we’re all good and she said “yup” in a super annoyed tone and proceeded to walk away. I don’t know what to do at this point. If things don’t get better (it’s not looking too bright), I genuinely don’t know how to fix this issue.

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don’t initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can’t even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can’t afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn’t even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can’t stop, like how he can’t stop drinking and smoking. I don’t understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me. He also only fucks me once a week. It’s like he only fucks me cause he remembers if he doesn’t initiate them I’ll be hurt. 

Edit:
He also is really into naked women art and said he kept a list of women he has fucked and a secret file full of nudes exes sent him and said he kept them as trophies.

I’ve discussed all these issues with him. It’s frankly pretty demoralizing to have to ask someone who supposedly loves you to pay attention to you. If we were really meant to be I wouldn’t have to feel so shitty about this because he would treat me like a human being

WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE? I DONT WANT ALL THE BLAME TO FALL ON HIM, WHAT ACTIONS CAN I CONTROL? Am I truly boring? Am I unworthy of attention? 
Am I asking too much of him? I am so fucking bored of him.

I’m afraid to leave my bf because he says he keeps nudes of exes on his phone because they’re trophies and I’ve sent him nudes before knowing this",16Oct2019,2

134,"My friend, Mike has been living with me and my family for about 3 months now. 

At the initial phase, one day his mom had started seeing her ex boyfriend (who she was and still is married to, never got a divorce.). This guy is trouble. He manipulated mom to kick him out before, so he let me know and kept me updated, but only as a friend to friend encounter, not looking for a place to stay. 

A few weeks later, my mom and I helped him move to his mom's other ex boyfriend's house. We'll call him M2 because he's also named Mike. 
M2 is a military vet of some type and a really cool down to earth guy. After Mike living with him for some time, I was able to note that M2 seemed lonely. He had a nice house, a simple two story with a nice open living room. He even took Mike's dogs in to his house for the time being. This lasted for a few weeks before Mike moved back in to the apartment under the impression that mom was gonna move back in. 

He lives there for a few weeks on a shit host job at a local restaurant paying him minimum wage for a waiter which is like 7 dollars an hour plus tips which he didnt normally get as a host. I constantly check up on him. He's skin and bones, living on an empty fridge because mom is never home. His car is a piece of shit with no brake pads, and he's hardly getting by. He had been sleeping over a lot because his mom had also let one of her friends and that friend's daughter around Mike's age to stay in the apartment for a few days without consulting Mike. I had him stay over a ton because it pissed me off that mom let them in without telling him despite not living there herself. 

A few weeks later we moved him in. My mom moved her office downstairs, and we all moved his queen size bed upstairs and situated him. His car went... somewhere, and a couple days later my parents met up with my uncle who is a car salesman and got him a nice car for about 8 grand (i think). They paid for the whole thing, and got mike a new job at my neighbor's local business so that he was making a better wage. He would owe money on the car to them and pay them over time as part of his paycheck (just like how I pay them for the half of my car that they paid for)

Life goes on. Recently, he's been all caught up in this girl named Caitie. I havent really seen or heard much. She sings duets with him, watches movies with him, all that gooey stuff. But she also has freakouts at nothing, is a sophomore in college (a year older than he) and doesnt have her own car, and her mom even told her that she couldnt come over to our house today for dinner despite meeting Mike and being cool with him. 

That's a secondary problem. Here's the primary, and god bless if you've read this far:

His mom is back. She's living at M2's house as of now. Yesterday, he went out to dinner with his mom. Tonight, he allegedly upped and left and spontaneously went to dinner with her again today, unannounced until he was one foot out the door. 

My mom was checking in on him due to these frequent visits. She's been in contact with Mike's dad (who lives in long island, parents are long divorced) and is trying to get the child support money to Mike now that he's 18. It seems that every time my mom and Mike go to court for this it backfires or something stupid like Mike's mom doesn't show up. 

After dinner tonight, my mom got a lengthy text from Mike's thanking for buying him the car (she just learned about this tonight) and all this yadda yadda about how she'll pay if dad pays the child support (which he did, she just probably blew it) and blah blah. 

My mom is telling Mike about all this and her view on this and to make light of the situation on her way out, she mentions his concert for school on Thursday. He says ""oh yeah, ive gotta come home, change, then go pick up my mom."" 

My mom came in my room crying and now he might any minute. Also because this took forever to type out, my mom went in there and told him something along the lines of ""i dont want your mom in the car we bought for you"". I dont know what to do, how should I go about this? I want to resolve the peace at home first, then get through Mike's stupid head that his mom is bad for him. 

Ive been as empathetic as I could try to be, and Ive let him take his chances with girls from school and fail inevitably because they were all bad for him. I know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink. But there's gotta be some way. This kid has come in my room crying saying all he wants is a family, after living with us for a month and a half. Its breaking my heart that he feels outcasted yet loved and his behavior is as wishy washy as his mother's which I dont want him to adapt. 

Please help. God bless. &lt;3",16Oct2019,2

This story is from a few weeks ago. 

Let’s call one of my (24M) best friends Alistair, my girlfriend Lucy, my friend’s girlfriend Emily and my other friend Ryan.

Last week everything seemed to be okay, however I went on a night out last weekend and as we got home, I got a call from one of my best friends saying ‘Why did Lucy say that Emily cheated on me with Ryan? Emily is in tears after hearing this’. When I heard this I had no recollection of anything happening, so I went to speak to my girlfriend about what he’d said to me and she was crying her eyes out saying she didn’t say anything and showed me the messages Emily had sent her. Emily was very blunt, as if she actually had heard bad news and upset Lucy with insults through text. This didn’t add up to me, as Alistair said to me Lucy told Emily, but Emily said in messages to Lucy that she told Alistair. Before this, my girlfriend and his seemed to get along really well, so I’m surprised my girlfriend would’ve said anything accusing her of cheating. After I talked to my girlfriend, I rang my friend and he said there was probably a communication error and they misheard each other. 

Now, my girlfriend Lucy doesn’t want to spend time with Alistair or Emily because she feels she was falsely accused. Lucy is adamant she didn’t do anything. I’ve tried explaining it was probably a miscommunication but my girlfriend won’t have it after the messages Emily sent her. 

What do I do? 

TL;DR: Friend’s girlfriend accused my girlfriend of saying she cheated on my friend. I have no recollection of this happening so I don’t know who’s right. Both parties were upset. What do I do?",16Oct2019,1
140,"I'm a male high school student and I have a few friends that don't make the best of decisions. I'm a freshman and they are seniors but they arent always aware of the consequences that their actions will have right away. I don't want them ruining their lives for a stupid reason just because of it. (This post is mostly going to be about one of my close friends who we will call L) So, to start, L is a Senior in Highschool, a Female, and they participate in the band with me. L, when I first met her, had a boyfriend we'll call K. K isn't a good person. L and K have been off and on in their relationships. L sometimes sneaks over to K's house when she isn't supposed to and has one of her friends hold her phone so her parents cant track her. Well, even as a freshman, I know that it isn't smart to have sex in Highschool because things usually just don't work out and that people aren't ready for things like that. But Last week, apparently L and K had sex for the first time. They haven't really been on talking terms, so hearing that today was quite surprising. K in the past has had sex with multiple other people and has told 1 or more of them that if they were to get pregnant that they need to get an abortion. As it turns out, K wasn't wearing a condom and L has only been on birth control for 2 weeks. *Something that I am worried about is that L* ***might*** *have gotten pregnant and that if she is, K will hurt her if she doesn't get an abortion.* Something I want advice on is how to hopefully separate them because K isn't a good person and L doesn't need to be hurt by him anymore (There are a lot of other things that he has done that I can specify more if asked and by hurt I mean emotionally as far as I know.) I'm not just trying to separate them for no reason. L and K have been off and on, and L seems to go back to him eventually every time. But each time they seem to hate each other or at least L doesn't like him and is clearly hurt. She has said so herself. ***I want to know what I can do to hopefully convince her that she doesn't need him and that she really needs to stay away from him.*** (Something that I didn't mention is that K is also in the band with us and is intertwined in friend groups with a lot of L's friends, as well as the fact that L is also friends will a lot of K's Friends.) L is a strong person but I think that as long as she isn't pregnant, that she really needs to exclude him from her life.

&amp;#x200B;

  Another thing that I want advice on is how to hopefully get people to realize that vaping and doing drugs is not good for them. I don't want any of my friends, including L and unfortunately K (we aren't really friends but still), ruining their lives with those types of things either. They vape during school, even though the punishments are harsh for getting caught, and they waste quite a bit of money on those types of things and they really don't need it to be happy. They are fantastic and they need to know that.

142,"I received an email on the fourth of October entitled ‘recorded you -‘ followed by my password. I’ve only just seen the email as it was put into my spam and I never check the folder. I’ve not opened the email but I’ve been able to read the first few sentences.


It states that they’ve recorded me and know my password and installed malware on my laptop through RAT (which apparently stands for Remote something, looking at the email gives me the creeps so I don’t want to go back and find out what exactly). It does state my password that I use to log in to the laptop. However I have had tape over the webcam of the laptop for the last few years so I doubt they’ve recorded much of anything. And the email was received on the fourth and I’ve used it in the last week for uni stuff and watching tv shows. 


What do I do? It’s three am here and I’m freaking out. The password luckily is one that I don’t use much anymore. I began to use a different one, with numbers and capital letters and shit over the last few years, but in the last two weeks I’ve changed my email passwords to ones Apple has suggested and signed Dropbox out of my laptop and my old phone. There’s not any new (like in the last two years or so) photos on my laptop because my iPhone won’t connect to it so they’re all on the family computer at my parents. I do all banking on my mobile. The most that is on that laptop that i would like are uni documents and stories I’ve written throughout the years. 


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",16Oct2019,2
143,"I’ve had a crush in this amazing guy for a whole year now. Ever since the summer of 2019 I’ve been noticing that he gets extremely touchy toward his guy friends (he’d touch their thighs, rest his head on their shoulders or thighs, give them both regular hugs and back hugs etc). The more I observed, the more I noticed how he never did this to any of his friends that are girls(I have never once heard him show interest in any girl before either). So, I thought he was gay (ik I shouldn’t assume sexuality but I really thought he was). Afterwords I started losing feelings for him. After completely losing feelings for him, we actually start talking to eachother(we have only talked to each other a few times). We got each other’s numbers and snapchat accounts and have been talking for the past 2 days(in person and through text). We’ve gotten to know each other a lot more and turns out we have a lot in common. I started getting feeling for him again after a day of talking with him. Today though, he had gotten a little touchy with me. While we were on our way to a award assembly at school I had said I looked fat whenever I wore white. He elbowed my arm and said “No way! You look good in whatever. Don’t worry, alright?” Then when we were in the actual assembly, he noticed that I hadn’t gotten an award so he had patted my thigh and said “You’ll get one next time!” I guess he did that to comfort me?? When we were leaving to the next period I had asked him “so are you going to text me later?” He replied with “sure” I turned to look at him and he was smiling super wide. I’ve seen hi look at me a couple times during class too. Do you guys think he likes me back or am I overthinking this?",16Oct2019,3

146,"I'm just sitting here unable to stop thinking. I went to college right after high school and finished about a semester and a half before I just quit going. I waited about another three-ish years before I decided that I wanted to go back. Once again, I went back with no real purpose. I think I thought i would go and then transfer to a four year and become something that probably never would have worked out. I did really, really well at first and then the stress of living on my own, working two jobs and going to school FT just got to me and once again, I quit going. 

Now, I am a  stay at home mom of two beautiful children and I am so, so mad at myself for quitting. I'm mad that I don't have a great job to take care of them how I would like to, I'm mad that I wasn't more motivated earlier in my life and I messed things up at a time that I would just love to have everything going right. 

So my current issue. I'm trying to go back to school...yet again. This time I have a goal and more determination that I've ever had in my life. i want to go back and get my RN degree. I'm not sure if the same school will accept me for a third time, or how long the probation I'm certain that I will be on will last. I can't get accepted into the nursing program while on probation.

147,"So I've dated this person for a few months, she's a lovely girl, I've had a great time so far. 

I know there'll be some lads that say things along the lines of ""lucky bugger"" or whatever, you don't understand bro, I used to think I was over sexualised, but this is killing me. 

(I'm going to describe some crude details so don't read on if you're squirmish) 

It's gotten to the point where I only want to go on traditional dates, I somewhat worry about her inviting me back or coming back with me. Because I do enjoy spending time with her but I don't enjoy being alone in the house anymore. 

If we have a lazy day in bed watching films, I'd be expected to have sex at least 10 (ish) times a day, and then to provide foreplay in-between. It's never ending, she gets aroused just by saying words a certain way, or just simply brushing her leg accidently, or in a moment I'm trying to be innocently affectionate by holding hands, it sets her off, so to say. 

It's gotten to the point where there's no pleasure for me anymore, I try to just focus on pleasing her enough to an extent that she'll be ""finished"" for at least an hour so I don't have to do anything anymore. Just the other day she squirted (sorry for being crude, I did warn) so many times that the entire bed was sodden and I had to flip the mattress just to sleep that night. Within about 15 minutes of the intercourse that she achieved these climaxes, she wanted more. Now I've been in relationships in the past where women have had this kind of climax and they've always been satisfied or even tender to a point where they wouldn't consider anything else for the rest of the day, so I know this isn't the norm. 

Just to say, before anyone gives her a hard time in the comments by saying it isn't fair or whatever, I haven't confronted her about my issue yet so I couldn't expect her to change what's normal to her so far. But that's why I've come here, how on earth do I address this without making a bad situation, I can't imagine her taking it too well because what I consider a healthy amount is an entire world away from what it currently is. Are there any alternative ways I can help, or external help for what I'd consider a nymphomaniac, IE. Therapy or something.

149,"So, I've had this book idea in mind for a while now, I don't want to give away to many details but my issue isn't the plot or story.  


I imagined it kind of like a Dairy of a wimpy kid book style, where the story is told through the main character, and you get little drawing they've drawn up to aid the reader in understanding their scenario.  


The issue, is that...well...my art skills aren't really that good, and yes I am aware art is subjective, but to put it in perspective, oftentimes appendages are different thickness's then before, sometimes a character's outfit may have X amount of things and then in another picture be only Y amount (Like Bart Simpsons hair in the older seasons of the show of the same name.)  


I could always excuse this by saying: ""It's just how Character draws"" but that kinda feels lazy to me.  


I'm not sure what to do, I could just not have visuals, but that could make parts where more then 2 Characters are interacting with each other confusing. I could keep them and just deal with people talking about how childish they look. (Assuming people would do that, which I'm fairly sure they would.)

152,"Hey all,

So I have a best friend who has issues with lateness, overbooking and blowing off plans. This is the 3rd time in a row that she's invited me to do something and flakes out without saying anything. On top of it when we go out to nightclubs she drinks to the point of stumbling and becomes obnoxious. She has a penchant for dating losers just so she can be upset and unload on me about it, blowing up my phone with texts and calls. I tolerated these things throughout our 5 year friendship but I'm at the point where I'm tired of her lack of consideration for my time and needs.

I have spoken to her repeated times about how I don't appreciate having to be on top of her when we have plans and that she needs to communicate if she's running late. I've also repeatedly told her I don't appreciate her making plans with me and then blowing them off without communicating. When she has invited me to nightclubs I have been declining and flat out told her I don't want to go out to places with alcohol since she can't control her consumption. I pretty much cut her off from talking about men. Letting her know that she chooses to be in toxic relationships and if she has a problem with her boyfriend she should communicate her issues to him.

So lately we don't talk as much, we used to talk every day. Mostly because her boyfriend is very possessive of her time. She says she hasn't seen me in a long time, about a month or two. Which is mostly her fault because she flakes out on plans and I told her this. And since this last flaking on our plans I am thinking I should decline any further plans she tries to make with me, since she will just flake anyway.

I guess I'm not sure how else to approach this since talking to her hasn't made her change at all.",16Oct2019,2

I (22 F) have been dating my boyfriend (22 M) for well over a year now. His older brother (24 M) has been dating his girlfriend (23 F) for 6 months or so, if that. My boyfriend lives in the town I go to university along with his parents and brother. My parents do not live in the same city, I live with 2 roommates. 
Long story short, my boyfriend rarely invites me to his family home and everytime I’m there, his brothers gf walks through the door without knocking, sometimes she’s there home alone, she’s there for dinner nearly every night. His mom treats her like they’re friends, has her on social media, texts her. I do not have this bond and I rarely see them. On his moms birthday, I came for dinner but he told me prior that his mom had said that I was NOT to bring her a gift or card so I didnt. Then I get there and the brothers gf has bought her a gift and a card and made a cake. I was mortified.
I feel really sad that they very obviously know her much more and love her so much but I’m practically a stranger. I try to go over more often but my boyfriend always wants to come here because it’s easier that I have my own place. I know it sounds dumb but I actually really care what they think of me and I feel like they’re comparing me to this picture perfect daughter in law and I look like a deadbeat lol. What should I do? Or am I overthinking ?",16Oct2019,0
161,"I feel incredibly alone even with “friends” some people don’t try to include me in conversations or just straight up ignore me when I talk to them. I found a pattern, people only talk to me when there is nobody more “cooler” to talk to. I realized this and started to research ways to be better at talking and to be more likable but it hasn’t worked too much. I would normally stop trying and hang out with different people but I don’t have many friends because lot of people are going through the subconscious jerk phase when you gossip and make fun of others(I’d like to believe  I got past that). Other people talk about things like their new water bottles and people are interested and listen, but my story about chasing my cousins dog 3 times in one day is not as intriguing as I thought. I find myself being the only person putting effort into a relationship and it hurts so much to realize your best friend doesn’t value your friendship as much as you do. I realize this has turned into a rant but please help me I am so alone and therapy is expensive so I don’t have anyone to talk to this about.",16Oct2019,2
162,"  

Recently when I have been texting my two friends to hang out at lunch, they have been saying they are busy. I haven't talked to them in like 2 weeks and it's been kind of weird in class. Today I messaged one of my so-called friends to hang out at lunch and I got no response. I assumed that she wasn't at school, however, when I was sitting alone in the cafeteria, I saw both walking in with McDonald's. One of my friends can drive so I know that they went out for lunch. Anyways when they came into the cafeteria, they decided to walk past me and sit on the other side of the cafeteria. When they noticed I saw them they started to whisper and then eventually one of my friends called me over. I saw her phone in her hand and at that point, I knew that she saw my message and just ignored it. But even when I was sitting there with them, they were just talking about things they want to do on the weekend, basically making plans without me in front of me. 

I really don't know if I'm just overthinking it or if they are just being shady?",16Oct2019,2
163,"I moved out of my dads house and across the country to get away from my dads new wife in May. I didn’t think I had to worry about my sister because she had never been as bad to her. But now, my 16 year old sister is stuck living with someone that seems to hate her. My step mother was verbally abusive to me, but I wasn’t a minor so I just picked up and left. Now, she’s carrying it on to my sister. I got a text from my sister today saying that she’s “done” and wants to move out. She doesn’t actually mean that though, she’s happy at her school and living in the city she’s in now. But the fact that step mom is making her feel this way makes me so incredibly angry. I don’t know how to get her out of this situation. I regret leaving her alone to deal with it. My dad cares, but doesn’t stand up to his wife. He lets it happen. He let it happen to me so often over the course of a year that I left. And he didn’t even try to stop me. He encouraged it.

164,"Hi, I'm a formerly homeschooled high school student looking for some advice on dealing with an extremely extroverted and talkative classmate who makes me want to rip out my own hair. Please don't upvote this post because she uses Reddit and if she sees it on the front page, she might know it was me. (I'm serious, if this gets over a certain amount of upvotes, I'll delete it).

I'm a bit of an introvert, kind of shy and awkward, and no one knows me all that well yet. So my first day of school I met my homeroom class and they all seemed nice. I didn't really know anyone well, but I recognized a boy (we'll call him Tom) who I knew a while ago, so I sat near him. There was a girl there too and she sat on my other side. I knew her from a very long time ago, and all I remembered about her was that she was nice enough. 

Well, turns out this girl (we'll call her Miriam) is very talkative, way more talkative than I remembered her. That's okay, I need to come out of my shell a bit. She loves classical music, history, video games, D&amp;D, and other nerdy things, and she LOVES to talk about them. At first I thought it was cool that she was so passionate about her interests. I'm a bit of a nerd myself, I love anime, writing, creating original characters, and browsing Reddit and TVtropes. Besides, she didn't have a lot of people to talk to, just Tom, who's in band with her. So I figured she probably was excited to have a friend of sorts.

Yeah, it's been two or three months now and I swear to god she never shuts up. Every day she has something new to tell me. Every day a new topic. She'll ambush me as I walk into school and try to tell me some random thing. If I don't look busy enough in homeroom, she'll show me text-to-speech Reddit videos (many of which I have already seen), or show me memes--even if I'm clearly studying and bogged down with homework. She's gone up to me in the hallway when I'm changing classes and walked up to my locker to tell me things. I'm tired of her shit. And when I try to tell her about something I'm interested in for once, she interrupts me and quickly changes the subject back to her interests. It's annoying as hell. I'm the only person who will listen to her and she knows it.

I just want some advice. How do I distance myself from my annoying classmate without being an asshole? I've been avoiding her as much as possible, but at this point it seems like I might just have to deal with her until we graduate.",16Oct2019,2
165,"So my friend, let’s call her Josie, is 15 years old. My cousin and I were dealing weed to her (for her grandma) and we were dropping it off. After we exchanged the money with the goods, my cousin drove me home. Afterwards Josie texted me saying that her and my cousin ended up driving around. I didn’t think anything of it, as Josie was probably trying to kill time or something since she disliked being at home.

However, a few weeks later, Josie ended up texting my boyfriend (18M) and confessing that her and my 22 year old cousin had sex. 

*side note* another thing i’d like to mention is that Josie often times texts my boyfriend out of the blue, asking him if she wants a drink from the gas station or something; she is always flirting with him in the most subtle ways.

i genuinely don’t know what to do about the situation, as i was sworn to secrecy by my boyfriend, as my cousin could get in huge trouble + get his kid taken away. we don’t want that.

so i’m conflicted, and pissed at them both. what do i say? i can’t mention it to either of them but i wanna hear the full story, as i’ve yet to hear my cousin admit to it. i’ve been clinging on to this hope that she’s possibly lying about it, but why would she?

my cousin has had previous run ins with a minor (another friend of mine, 15F) where she got drunk, got completely naked, and unknowingly crawled in his bed and began touching him. this situation scared the shit out of him because he was terrified of getting his kid taken away, and ashamed. he knew nobody would believe him on who do what.

so now i’m wondering; is she really telling the truth? should i find out?

166,"Hey guys. I know this may seem like an unusual post for this subreddit, but I’m honestly not sure what to do anymore. Let me know if there’s another place I can direct this to.

First things first, let’s start off by saying I absolutely adore my mother. She has been my idol for a very long time, and has always been someone I looked up to. She is honest to god one of my very best friends, and I couldn’t ask for a better mom. We have our ups and downs, but she’s the reason I’m still alive.

My father left me before I was born, and my mom had a few boyfriends before finally settling down and marrying somebody **decent.**
He has a very short temper, and they have a bit of an age difference. (She’s older, he’s younger.) and this usually leads me and her to believe there’s a sort of maturity difference.

Now sometimes me and my father get along, but I think we might fight more often than not. He thinks just because he’s with my mom, that he has full control over my life. I don’t allow that.

He constantly buys me stuff, that I would’ve bought on my own, just so he could take it away. At least, that’s what I think. He seems like he’s been on such a high power trip and it honestly blows my mind.

Now, they’ve split up only once that I know of, before quickly getting back together. I know I care for him because I was begging my mom not to leave him cause he’s the best father figure she’s brought into my life. 

But we have a sort of... strained relationship. As in, anytime he tries to be nice to me, it usually ends with him screaming at me. And I tell my mom. She talks to him, and then things are quiet.

He likes to act up with me in front of her though. She’s told us multiple times it stresses her out, and each time we tell her it won’t happen. While I rarely bring up stuff around her anymore, my dad still consistently does it.

Like just yesterday. 

So, my dad had just made food. He quite literally screamed at me to come eat, after practically whispering for me to come outside my room. Whatever, it ticked me off a bit but I’m used to it. No big deal.

I bring my phone with me out of habit, and settle it down right by my plate. It was off and I wasn’t on it. We were waiting for my mother to come out of their room, (she had just came back from work) and we had started to eat. He got on his phone to begin texting my friend, so I got on my phone as well.

For a small amount of context, I’m an incredibly impatient person. I find it hard discussing things without getting bored, especially eating. I need to have something to do or it basically bothers me a lot.

I opened up Reddit, and was looking through some posts and reading some memes. By this time, my mother had come out and sat down at the table with us, in a relatively good mood. She knows I like to read posts from Reddit while eating so I don’t get bored. My dad hates this.

He asks me to please get off my phone. Honestly? I turned it off. I think I said something in protest, but turned it off anyways. 

This really pissed off my mom.

They got into this huge screaming match against each other about me. Where she was telling me she was tired of the way he treated me, telling him that “She doesn’t care in the first place if she gets back on her phone, so why even bother her about it?” 

I’ll admit this made me feel guilty, but there’s more.

They were arguing about how he treated me. Which frankly? Was like shit. Constant verbal and emotional abuse, and seeing him get chewed out was satisfying.

Until she started sobbing and sobbing.

So we were still eating, and there was this particularly tough part of the steak I was eating, so I was attempting to cut it very quickly. 

This I guess... made my dad mad? He told me “stop trying to eat fast so you can go run off to your room, you’re staying here and talking with us. You’re apart of this conversation.”

Now, not only was this not my intention, but I hadn’t added a single word to the conversation since they started.

This made my mom see red.

She was SCREAMING at him, telling him to leave me alone and that he doesn’t know what I’m thinking. At this point, I’ve finished my steak. So I get up and thank them for the food, before hiding out in my room to talk with some friends.

They continue to fight for about 30 minutes, before it eventually died down, and they went back to normal. My mom came into my room to wish me a goodnight, and to tell me she loves me.

I thought all was okay. But just now, I took a nap. And there was another shouting match. Full on screaming, enough to make me wake up. I’m not stupid. They were arguing about me, and she was defending me again. This went on for a while, with me listening in, until she said she wanted to kill herself.

She’s said this in front of me before, to which I’ve kindly told her to stop- which resulted in a fight between us. 

It was resolved, but it still affected me heavily. She hasn’t said it in a while, and hearing it again was almost enough to make me burst into tears.

I’m so genuinely worried that she might do it. Reddit, if she kills herself, I will kill myself too. I CANNOT live without my mother right now. I need her and she needs me the most right now. 

I’m so heartbroken and confused. I think they might get a divorce if this keeps up, and I don’t know what to do. I need both of them. They’ve become the two most important people in my life and I don’t know what I’ll do without them.

Please. I need to know what I can do to help both of them and myself. Just to clarify, I’m still a minor who’s in therapy for a few things right now. Which is why I’m reacting sort of strongly.

TLDR; Mom wants to kill herself. Dad and Mother have been fighting for the past two days, some of their worst fights ever. I’m worried they’ll get a divorce.",16Oct2019,2
167,"My fiancé has recently been doing voice acting/voice over classes and has said how much he is enjoying, how much his teachers enjoy working with him and directing him, and it’s amazing to see him in his natural element.

168,"Hello, I’ll cut straight to the point.

My professor is a masters student who’s in his 50’s/40’s who is a pretty big douche. He has the mentality of “been there, done that.” 
The class he’s teaching is supposed to be one of the easiest classes for my major, yet he’s making it as hard as he possibly can. 

-This is by marking assignments incredibly hard, harder then the syllabus grading criteria.
-not allowing you into the class after the starting time (which I don’t have a problem with, yet today I was late and he didn’t let me in so I then waited outside the entire period and was marked absent/was given a 0 on the quiz.)
-and more but I won’t bore the details.

171,"So I’m 20 now (female) but I’m reflecting on my past traumas that all occurred around the time I was in my first relationship around 15. He was the same age.


My boyfriend and I had just started having sex and I didnt really know how to feel about it since I was being continuously taken advantage of by my mums partner around that time. I really loved this boy but sex just reminded me of how uncomfortable being molested was (I didnt speak up and had no idea how screwed up it was at the time that I was being groped by an older man). I was much more comfortable with just cuddling.


My boyfriend would initiate sex often but I never wanted to so I’d tell him no over and over, but he’d complain and whine and persuade me saying “but I can make you horny!” even though when he touched me I never got wet down there, and was obviously not aroused, but he wouldnt listen to me. This happened countless times. I ended up giving up and going along with it even if it physically hurt because I wasnt wet enough.


I remember one night he had asked me if I wanted to have sex. I said no, laid down and turned my back to him, then suddenly felt him pulling my underwear down and forcing himself in me from behind. He kept going even when I remained silent.


There’s this loud voice in my head that tries to justify his actions by saying “he was just young and didn’t understand consent” but I know this isnt right.


Typing this all out is making me realise that I think I was raped, but I just need some validation from others so I know I’m not being irrational about this. I hate that I find it so hard to believe my own brain and feelings.",16Oct2019,2

Normally I wouldn't think much of it, but I'm always the one who asks to spend time with him and this is the first time he's been interested in doing something with me first. I don't want to bring it up and seem too eager or anything like that since he already knows I enjoy spending time with him, but I would really like to be able to plan my week instead of sitting around waiting.

174," 

I was raped.

I (mid 30s male) was raped when I was 12 years old, by my older male cousin. He took me to the attic to show me playboys, and then insisted we “practice”. He penetrated me.

I’ve been increasingly suffering anxiety around sex. I dont know why it is manifesting only now after so many years. I feel the walls close in on me, my heart races to the point it hurts, I tremble and break out in cold sweats. 

It has taken me 20 years to tell someone. I told my wife today, who I have known for 15 years, dated for 10, and have been married for the last 5. When I told her, I still couldn’t show emotion, I couldn’t feel emotion, and only once she hugged me and then took our daughter to take a bath did I break down crying.

I dont know what to do. I dont know who to talk to. I am a strong, beardly, tattoo’d man. I know my outward appearance shouldn’t effect how I deal with this…. But the stigma around being a male victim of rape is… daunting.

I think I am finally ready to talk to someone. But I dont know who. Who is qualified to deal with this? What type of therapist? Shrink? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?

Sincerest apologies if this is not the thread for this kind of advice.

175," so uh I came to Reddit for advice.. fun. Anyways. I've got this friend who I see once a week because of a Saturday school I attend. And we talk in class n stuff. But during the week he will seem to send me tons of messages. Some random, about mutral events we are attending or things we have in common. It's fun chatting with him sometimes, but it's gotten to the point where it's getting a little excessive. He'll text me 5-7 times in a row through various messaging platforms.

Recently it's gotten a bit worse. We found out that our schools were going to be versing eachother in a big football game that many people are going to. I sent a message out of kindness, letting them know that I was going. I didnt mean it in like a date or hangout sorta way, just telling them. Now he is making all sorts of plans and texting more excessively. 

He keeps asking if it's okay if we bring some of our friends to hangout together. When I CLEARLY never said that I was going to be hanging out with him the entire time. After I told him nicely that I didnt really want to hang out and wasnt sure what my friends wanted to, he proceeds to assume that its okay if my friends dont tag along it can just be US hanging out. After I RESTATE that I'm still not sure what me AND my friends are doing, he is asking what time and place we are meeting up.

 I'm honestly just kind of fed up at this point and tell him for the 3rd time I am making plans with other friends and we haven't worked out the details. He apologizes for being annoying and I thought everything was fine. He messages me 10 minutes later and tells me where we are going to meet up. WITH or WITHOUT my friends. 

I've given up at this point and I tell him I'm not coming till later (which obviously I'm not) and he is offering to come at whatever time I arrive.

Honestly I'm not that used this kind of behavior and I'm a bit confused. He's clearly not getting the message and I'm not quite sure what to do when this event comes around.

I'm a 18 year old college student, I work at a fast food joint that pays me okay.  I live with my mom and stepdad, under an agreement that if i go to college than I can stay rent-free.

I have a decent work and family life, i hit a bit of a rough patch i'm not gonna go into but it's opened my eyes up to things.

I've been realizing how irresponsible i've been with money, college, and my general time management.  I've been staying up for hours and missing my college classes and procrastinating on work which i'm certain is going to ruin me.  I've been spending money on nothing but garbage and just not caring about saving money for things like emergencies and what not. 

I keep having these thoughts of how i can flip myself around, and i have a solution that's really fucking big in my eyes. 

To start, i have a coworker who is actually one of the best people i've met, and has taught me how to handle issues in a good way and learn some anger management skills. he hasn't directly done it and doesn't really know i've been picking up on it but i can't thank him enough.  if you're reading this jacob, thank you so much man.  

He's been having problems with his now former roommates, which i've kinda gave him advice on since he's had to leave work to deal with things they're doing.  

to not go off on a tangent, I feel like what i need to have is a whole environment change.  I need to be put in a position where i don't have many hands to eat from.   I want to force myself to be more responsible.  

My first course of action if i go through with it is to ask jacob if i could live with him and help out with rent and such, it would work out well because he'd have 1 extra ride to work instead of his girlfriend having to take him.  

hugest problem about this, my mom would be absolutely pissed.  I've wanted to move out before but she did not like the idea at all.  she didn't feel like i could do it by myself.  and i don't know how to bring the idea to her.   i live about twenty minutes away from college and me being in the town that jacob is in would increase the distance twenty more minutes.

I really want to do this, or at least try it out.  that's what i wanna tell my mom that it's temporary to help me get my life on track.

180,"Well I don't want to go extremely into detail in this post because I dont know how to give a short version without telling you everything that's ever happened to me since I came out of the womb.  if you have more questions I will gladly answer in the comments. But my most recent issue is my debilitating anxiety and depression. Though they're not new by any means, but they have gotten extremely worse. I've not left the house in 3 years, including for work and we( me and my boyfriend)also spray painted the house windows black.  I feel trapped. Trapped in this house, even though it's all in my head.  What started this for me is the fact that my boyfriends whole family and friends all live directly surrounding us. Dont get me wrong his family are great people and all, and they would constantly try to buy me things or take me places or just invite me over for some food. And that lead me to start feeling guilty, and that's on me too. I have mommy issues, I dont need a therapist to tell me it's the stem of all my problems. she never cared about me or did a God damn thing to help me so I cant let anyone else do that either because I feel undeserving. Dad ditched when I was born too. Anyways. Having it being my boyfriends family adds more pressure for me instead of just some random strangers because I can just tell myself I dont know them. They really do mean well, but I cant put a toe outside of the door without them trying to approach me or talk to me, or even just with them pulling into our block, there's a pothole so they always drive reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaal slow and it damn near gives me a heart attack. our house is at the opening so there really is no peace for me. Am I alone in this? I mean sure maybe it wouldnt effect you the way it does me, but is that relaxing to anyone?? Not having a moment to yourself unless you just lock yourself up in the house?? I feel like a dog on a shock collar and every time I see one of his family members, it's going off and teaching me not to go out past that point. 

Another huge issue right now is the lack of activity I'm getting. I used to be pretty fit and super active, my diet was never great though.  It's not that I wouldnt eat my vegetables, it's that I would eat everything and all of it. I never had any self control and my mother would call me a human garbage disposal. It's crazy though because looking back at my old photos I was like damn, If i just ate a little less I could have had abs.  Flash forward to now, I eat way less than I used to, only for budget reasons, still have no control. Only difference is I can control what I'm buying now and it's all almost completely plant based. Except my boyfriend likes to bring home pizza and taco bell way too often. I've gained probably 40 lbs and extremely insecure about it. My boyfriend doesn't mind at all and is still extremely attracted to me, and I know that's all that should matter but nine times out of ten it leads to me screaming at him when he tries to touch me, lifts my shirt up, or walks in while I'm changing. I really dont mean to do it, it's a reaction and I hate that it spooks me so badly. I just feel vulnerable and exposed. 
Okay, last bit. Yesterday, for the first time in a long f-ing time, I decide to sit out on the porch with my cats and coffee. Not even all the way out, still sitting in the doorway in a feeble attempt to keep myself out of view from any passer bys. And ofcourse my boyfriends two female friends pull in that lives on the other side of us, they decide to stop their car to stare at me and then proceed to text my boyfriend, ""yo girl got fat what happened""

So I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point. I do try to work out, but I never make it more than a month consistently and that's the current record since I've moved in here 3 years ago. We want to move out of this neighborhood but my boyfriend can't afford it without me working. I am also depressed and even my hygiene is lacking. If I didnt live with my boyfriend i dont think I would shower.

 So, I don't know what to do, I dont know where to start, but it would have to be small and baby steps. If anyone read this whole scatter brained cluster fuck, I'm sorry.",16Oct2019,5

I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal?

185,"I am a 4th year university student, and I would really like to be friends with a fellow classmate. We've taken multiple courses together, always sit next to each other, and always work on projects in pairs. We usually walk together and chat on our way to point B after class until our paths' split. We are both passionate and quite nerdy about our major, we don't tend to run out of things to talk about, and we have a really similar sense of humor. We have sort-of inside jokes (related to class only) and laugh often. I'm shy though, and so are they. They also seem anxious and like the type who doesn't really mind being on their own.

I'm hesitant to reach out for a few reasons. Firstly, what if they're totally content just having me as their fun classmate? There's not a lot of time before we graduate anyway, and we're both quite busy too, so they might see making a new friendship as a pain.  I don't want to ruin what little there is now, or make our classes together awkward, and a rejection would be quite crushing for me. 

The other thing is, **how do I communicate that I want to be their friend?** What would we do? I don't have a lot of friends, and the ones I do have I met in high school, so I'm clearly not good at befriending people. I also have the impression that they're like me in this regard. This classmate and I, we have similar interests, but they're all related to our major/books/movies/internet stuff. Meaning we're not both into anything that counts as an activity. So **if I were to try to become their friend, how would I go about doing that?**

I generally like most people, but it's quite rare for me to click with someone on the level that I click with this person. I'm so interested in getting to know them \~for real\~, but at the same time, I would really hate to make things weird.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr; There's a classmate who I get along with well and whose company I really enjoy. They seem to enjoy mine too, but I'm not sure. Do I try to become their friend, or leave things as they are? If I try, then how?**",16Oct2019,2
186,"I need to explain a little backstory for any of this to make sense.

I have a YouTube channel with almost 2k subscribers, and with it I have a private discord server my fans can join.

I've been on a private friends discord server for a while with a few people that are important for this. Andrew is the owner of the server, CJ is Andrew's Cousin, Tyler is Andrew's friend, and AJ is CJ's friend. Travis is my friend, Dominic is my friend, and Liam is my friend.

Me and Andrew started arguing months ago. He would insult my hair, my body, my YouTube channel, my friends, etc. I basically told him to fuck off and that was that. We consistently argued for months. Skip to Sunday, I'm in a call with Dominic. We're talking about video games and he decides to go onto my discord server. He tells me that everyone except for Andrew, Tyler, and then moderators. I checked the log to see what happened, and saw that Andrew and Tyler had banned every single person from the server.

What.

The.

Hell.

I immediately call up Andrew and ask him what the fuck is wrong with him. This asshole just starts laughing after deleting every single person from my server. I tell him to get mental help and find something better to do. (Maybe not the right thing to say but I was really pissed.) It was 12 in the morning at this point so I didn't call Tyler. I just banned them both from the server, left the private discord server, re-invited everyone to the server, and called it a day.

Flash forward again, to a couple hours ago. Stuff had been going smoothly since then. Nothing bad had happened since Sunday. I'm working on a science project when I get a message from my friend Liam. (He's an admin on my discord server.) He tells me that two people are sending hentai and KKK propaganda in my discord server. I'm really confused so I go to the server and I see CJ and AJ spamming my server with what Liam mentioned. I ban both of them and delete their messages, thinking this was the end of it. It was not.

I see someone named eevee_lover in my discord server freaking out because people are sending bad things, so I explained that they're just raiding the server and that I had it dealt with. I get angry at them, and so I rejoin Minegang to ask Andrew if he knew what was going on. Guess what I see. I see eeve_lover saying that he's going to ""attack me from the inside"" like some shitty spy movie. It was Andrew ban eveading to harass me. He also created pikachu_lover. I confronted him and banned him

He’s always talking about how perfect he is at all the things he does but then manages to make it sound humble and, while I don’t believe he’s a bad person, I just simply don’t feel like he’s a person I should be around at the moment until I get my life together.

193,"so, it’s october 2019 and i’m a 17 year old gay guy in high school (a beginning senior now), but earlier this year, in may (when i was a 16 year old junior, and i mean towards the end of my junior year. like one month of school left) i started really liking this guy whom i’d seen around many times and thought was cute, but i never rly thought of speaking to him. one day, i told my friends i thought he was cute (i had never told them before), and kept saying it to them everytime we’d see him. i would always tell them, “i wonder if he’s gay..” (he seemed like it to me based off looks and stuff. and i know you shouldn’t assume someone’s sexuality off of that, but when you’re gay, you know) and eventually they decided to ask him if he was gay (btw i left when they did this i left cause i was too embarrassed), they told me he turned around to see if his friends were looking when they asked, and that he replied, “..a little..”, so they proceeded to asking him if he knew who i was, and he said he’d seen me around. they then told him that i was into him and asked if they could get his number for me (i really only wanted to know if he was gay. that was it. i never told them to ask if he was into me. i could’ve asked him myself and could’ve asked for his number myself as well) but anyway, he gave them his number. they then called me to make me aware of the fact that he had given them his number for me, and i was honestly in shock because i thought he was way out of my league and just wasn’t expecting it. well anyway, i texted the number and asked who it was, and he told me it was him. i then asked him what he meant by “a little [gay]” and he told me he was bisexual but no one really knew (i.e. no one knew &amp; he wasn’t out). we texted for a while, but honestly, something made me feel like it was my friends pranking me (at the time, i had SEVEREEEE trust issues), so i decided to ask him in person if that was his number, and he told me yes. after that interaction, we never really spoke, other than me saying hi to him in the halls &amp; shit (but he would never really say hi first. ever actually.) and i did ask him for his birthday (to see if our zodiac signs were compatible, which we were, but i realize now that it came off super creepy and btw i honestly don’t believe in that astrology shit anymore).  anyway, my friends had his number  (cause he gave it to them, obvi) and they began prank texting him (while school was in session) saying i got a new phone and shit and that i loved him, and just really embarassing shit like that. i found it kinda funny but also i was like, “nah. i REALLYYYYY like this guy and you’re fucking my chances with him”.  after that, i began to get a different vibe from him, like he thought i was weird, but i was like, “maybe he doesn’t care..?”, so i texted him one night asking how he was, and he left me on READ. obviously something was wrong here, and i felt really guilty about it all. like did the texts my friends sent make him think that i just wanted to play w his feelings ? (or were those feelings never there in the first place?) like i said, i felt super guilty about it all, and i was putting this off for a little, but in june, during our summer break, i decided to text him an apology for all the weird messages my friends had sent and for ever weirding him out, and he replied (almost instantly btw. no that it matters haha) saying it was fine but that there was something he needed to tell me.. THAT HE WAS “KINA” (yes. “kina. not even “kinda”. like he’s illiterate or something) TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE. like, what the fuck?? it’s so obvious that he doesn’t like me and never did, so why even give me his number?? was it because he felt pressured by my friends? honestly, he could’ve easily said no and that would’ve made me feel a thousand times better, because now, i thought i had a chance with him that was never there. or maybe, there was a chance there and i just fucked it up? like, did i overdo the texts .. was he never into me .. or what??? idk but the sad part is that i still think that maybe it’s because he’s too afraid to come out, and that maybe it’ll all work out one day, but truthfully, that just seems unrealistic to me and i think the chances are astronomical, therefore it won’t be happening ever. i need advice (duh). i’m not sure what kind. maybe even just your thoughts/opinions, or maybe just advice on how to get over the only guy that’s ever made me feel valid.  anything will be greatly appreciated. thanks",16Oct2019,2

So I started a new job about a month back, and everything was all good int he beginning but now the real face of my boss is coming out. So it takes a little while for me to get used to doing things a new way. I'm an introvert and and overthinker! 

So things at my previous job was Avery very monotonous but my boss was the best!!! He was extremely motivating and encouraging. But here it's different. Like yesterday my boss asked me to call our stationary guys for some stuff, but his phone was busy when I called. So she tried calling him and he picked up and she told him stuff. When he finally delivered the stuff she said ""I had to call him once in 5 years yesterday, and see he already delivered the stuff"" I'm so sure that was meant for me cz I couldn't get such a small task done and she called him once and it's done. This really really demotivated me! 

These remarks keep coming, she puts in nicely and says them while smiling but I know they are snide remarks meant for me! Also she doesn't want me to change/improve anything the girl I replaced did, so technically I'm not even doing the job I was hired to do. 

Also I sometimes feel like I need to step out to take a break, this is a start up and I've never seen anyone take a breather to go outside which I find weird!

208,"Recently things have happened in my life that made me think things over, and I'm sure others need to read this. Suicide is never the answer.

Have you ever attempted suicide but were unable to go through with it? Put the gun to your head and thought you didn't have the guts? It's not that you dont have guts, it's that your instincts and subconscious desires are stopping you. Your body has an innate need and desire to survive. 

If you manage to go against your body's will to survive, and manage to do it, it doesn't mean you stop the pain. You only pass the pain to family or friends. Push past the pain. Stand up and reach out. Your mind shouts to hide and that you're alone, but you scream back.

Tell your brain you know better. Get help. See a therapist. See a psychologist. Never take the end route without shoving with all your might. If your family is hiding you grab them. Drag them kicking and screaming into rehab if you have too.

210,"I'm 17 and I recently had a job tutoring a child, and on two occasions I completely forgot that I had to go.

I profusely apologized the first time, promising it will never happen again, until a month later I forgot.. again.

The family of course wasn't happy the first time, and the second time was just a week ago and I just received an email telling me I wouldn't have to come anymore. 

I curled up in my bed the first time I did it, and the second time I did the same, having to be convinced to go to dinner that I was planning to go before. Now that I've received the email I feel even worse, and I don't know what to make of it as guilt is really a first thing for me. It's the first time I've made someone lose respect for me with the fault being 100% of my own. I enjoyed tutoring but I couldn't redeem myself.

On a side note, I always held myself to a high standard and integrity and the people I've encountered seemed to appreciate it, but recently I've been bombarded with tasks, family problems, administration problems and they're really a toll. Right now I'm not being the person I wanted to be and my then-high confidence is dwindling fast. 

It's obvious that not everyone would like you or be forgiving and it's also obvious that you can't always not slip up but as I'm experiencing it first hand I really do not know what to make of it or what to move on. I find myself being rash, always wanting to go to bed to avoid responsibilities, wanting to be alone (in daily life and in prospect), although to be fair these thoughts aren't just because of this incident. 

Friends have told me it's ultimately not a big deal, and I want to believe them, but I can't convince myself to. Would someone be kind as to dissect what I'm going through and help me do something about it? It's deserved, of course, I don't even have the excuse of ""I tried everything I could"", because I clearly didn't. But I received this email minutes ago and it mentally froze me and I can't do anything. I have this pitiful look on my face and I hate it. I don't have it in me to go ""That was a harsh lesson but I can learn from it"" or something of the sort. I can't manage to assess if I'm exaggerating or downplaying my deserved guilt and my thoughts are all over the place.

215,"(TLDR in the end)

First off, I know this seems a bit high-schoolish (and it is), but I’d still like advice. 
Second off, I don’t know if this makes any difference to you, but I really like her. 

They broke a little more than two months ago and they had been together for about six months. 

It seemed had a thing going with her before they started dating but she eventually turned me down because one of her friends had feelings for me. A couple of months after that she started dating my friend, let’s call him John, though, at the time, he was just an acquaintance, who I occasionally talked to at school.

Months passed and I forgot about her and kind of became friends with him.

After their break up she tried to get with me twice and I turned her down both times, in respect to their relationship.
The second time I had an honest talk with him and he said he was over her (which I believed because he rejected her a few weeks after the break up), but it would still be weird, so I respected that.

He been with a lot of girls since then, having a relationship with one of them for a few weeks. 

After those rejections, we became closer, not best friends, but still friends. 

Things started to change, as I came to the realization that I actually like her, she likes me back, as in this is not a one time thing, and, after talking to his closer friends who are also good friends of mine, concluding he wouldn’t do the same for me.

To make things short, we kissed a few times at a party, which he also attended, he saw it and he’s not happy.

I should have handled the situation better, by, for example, talking to him and explaining everything before and also being somewhere he wouldn’t have to see it. 

I feel bad for betraying his trust, but I also really like her. I know there is a sea of women out there but it’s not easy to find a smart, pretty and cool girl like her, plus what are the chances of that hypothetical also wanting to have anything to do with me?

TLDR: I kissed my friend’s ex because I really like her and now I feel guilty.",16Oct2019,1

Two weeks ago I went and applied for a job in my community. I ended up getting the job, and received the acceptance letter today. In order to get me into training, they need to validate my identity and run background checks on me. I filled out the form giving them consent to check me this morning. I (very luckily) thought, why not send me a copy of the background check report? For the hell of it. I just received it about 15 minutes ago. When I opened it, it said my SSN trace had failed. When I checked all the reports they had my name, and some other random persons name below mine. I was like what the fuck??? So on every report, it says 

*Primary name*: LickinNosr

*Alias (AKA)*: This fat bastard using my SSN

I get to the results of the report and it says my SSN trace failed because they were unable to validate my identity.

While I’m typing this my mom got onto Real ID or whatever the website is called and tried to validate/connect me with my SSN, and it failed. They were unable to validate that I am LickinNosr based on my SSN. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out a little too. I don’t have any credit, and have like no money in my bank. I keep it in cash for this reason. But regardless, I’m scared. My mom says we will go down to our Social Security office tomorrow. What did I do? Someone please help.",16Oct2019,2

The way that works for me is like watching one of those boring scenes from a movie where the main character is just sitting there and not doing anything like if he was driving in his car and talking to his friend that is next to him but now imagine that scene with no sounds and small 3 second clips of that scene. That is what my thoughts are like, short snippets of an scenario either in the future or the past. Not to mention soon as this happens I will lose my train of thought and forget what I was PICTURING in my head like just now I was trying think about what else to say after that and I stared in a blank space just looking at my carpet and nothing else, I’m not even realizing that it’s white!

I am interested in the school for their academics and want to use my sport to aid me in the admission process). 

Here is some background on the two schools:

Team A:
- highest-ranked sports team in the division
- great academics
- across the country 

Team B:
- terribly ranked in division
- great academics
- one state away 

I have to choose whether to move across the country to be on a good sports team or to stay closer to home and play for a team that is really lacking in their abilities.  I have been playing this sport since 8th grade and it’s a big part of my identity. I do not plan to play this sport after college but I am looking into coaching. If I rowed for Team B I do not think I would do the sport all 4 years because being on a bad team would be frustrating and (mentality-wise) not sustainable (in other words I hate losing). 

Also, I have a boyfriend who I have no intention of separating from. I am struggling with the influence it has on my decision. I don’t want to be far from him but I am also confident that we will be fine after 4 years and it will just be really hard.

237,"Hello, I am totally desperate since I feel like I've been put a table with different torture devices, and they are asking me to choose between one of them:

First of all my mom has schizophrenia, and she doesn't take her medication, because of this she is extremely violent towards me. She abused me physically... But now I'm almost 17 and she's almost 60 and she can't really hit me for obvious reasons, but she does abuse me mentally... I can't study, I can't be with my friends, I can't anything... She doesn't even let me go to school, because she says I'm gonna die if I go (completely crazyness). She puts loud music, screams and abuses me verbally, says my girlfriend and friends are horrible, calls my gf a whore, etc...

Recently I called the cops (I live in Portugal btw) cuz I wanted to go away from her, DEFINITELY. What happened was the worse outcome, first they couldn't do this right away, which is understandable, it takes weeks even to process. The important thing is, they gave me 3 options, thus the metaphor to choose from torture devices:

Option 1: Stay with my mom and suffer till 18
Option 2: Go to a ""child support home"" (idk how they call it in English)
Option 3: Police will go there every time she has to take the medication ad make her take it

1 &amp; 2 Seem pretty neat right? No! Let me carefully explain each one

Option 2: they told me those building are 90% children who are unstable and violent... That's why they put them there, they basically said the reality of it, and that I WOULD get beaten up every day there...

Option 3: the health delegate would come to my house and see my mom is rly schizophrenic, then they force her to take the medication... So my neighbors know the situation cuz they listen and see it sometimes, and they already called the police... She just pretended she was fine and she didn't get anything, it will be the same this time...

So I've been made to pick between being fucked up in school cuz I can't study or, sometimes I can't even run away from her to go to school, cuz sometimes she doesn't let me (option 1 &amp; 3) or getting fucked phisically, quite literally.

There is option 4: someone else take my custody and It would be my new home, but no friends of mine's parents will do that... I talked with them... What should I do? What can I pick? I'm desperate and out of options...",16Oct2019,3

We literally had our lives planned out. But he cheated on me. For 6 months with a girl I worked with at the time. He repeatedly lied about what happened and I’m still not sure if I have the whole story, but after I found out about it, he never lied to me again. He was loyal and honest with me after that. We stayed together for 7 more months until I decided I couldn’t be with him anymore. The pain from his cheating wasn’t going away and I felt like our relationship wasn’t fun anymore. I started talking to one of our mutual friends who I always talked to when things were bad with me and my boyfriend. Eventually we started dating and we’ve been together almost 2 months. Sometimes he can be rude to my friends and other people we work with but not to me. He does things my ex never did and I know for a fact he wouldn’t cheat on me because he was cheated on multiple times so he knows that pain. He always tells me my ex never treated me right and he just wants to love me the way I deserve but sometimes he can be overly sexual and push me to do things I don’t really wanna do and makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me for not doing it. My best friend says she’s worried he just wants to get in my pants and I’m kinda worried about that too but I don’t think he would do that to me. Anyway, I just recently found out that my ex might be dropping out of college, doing drugs, and possibly joining the military and I can’t help but think it’s all my fault. I want to help him and I genuinely miss him. I miss being at his apartment and cuddling and hugging him. I miss him coming to see me on his lunch break. I miss watching our tv shows with him. I miss his smile and making him laugh so easily. My point is, both of these guys are really important to me. They always have been and I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I want to make the right decision for me and my life. If I’m not with either of them, I probably won’t be with anyone else. Getting to know someone else just sounds so exhausting and I don’t want that right now or maybe ever. Some people have called me desperate for not letting both of them go but I think both of them are great guys and I don’t want to hurt both of them. It’s not like I’d be jumping right back into a relationship with my ex. A LOT of things would need to be worked out first.

I ended up meeting and dating a woman off and on for the following two years.  Looking back, we should have become friends instead of lovers. I have never been one to be successful in relationships due to plenty of factors, but for whatever the reason I continued in my attempt to make this one work. 

Early on in our relationship she revealed to me that she has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.  I spent months researching it and really attempted to learn how to separate the person from the diagnosis.  There would be weeks where it was truly pure bliss and I questioned why I never fully committed myself to this person yet something would always come up in her life that caught me off guard and didn't seem to make logical sense (i.e constant car wrecks, two suicide attempts, various hospital visits, getting fired from high paying jobs because she was ""too depressed"" to go to work) .  I wanted to but never fully gave myself to her because of the fact that I would find out or catch her lying about multiple things. 

On paper she is everything I wanted in a person.  She is the most talented, beautiful, strong minded, capable person I have ever known.  But emotionally  I couldn't deal with everything that was happening in her life.  I was dealing with a plethora of my own issues.  Sometimes I would ""ghost"" her solely for the fact that I needed some mental breaks. There would be times where I started to feel crazy, where I just needed space.  She has a son and things like giving him Melatonin so he would go to sleep, or keeping him out late at night on a consistent basis (we pursue hobbies that go late into the evening) would just break my heart.

She is now pregnant.  She told me it was mine, but the two ultrasounds she showed me don't seem to make sense.  The first one she said the end of her menstrual cycle was a week prior from what it showed on the ultrasound (she said she has the paperwork to prove it, but she won't show it to me), the timing doesn't seem to make sense, but there is a legitimate chance the baby is mine.  She told me in prior conversations that she is considered a high risk pregnancy, that she is throwing up blood, her uterus is detached and the doctors she has gone to put her on bed rest.  Then when I ask her what hospital she has been going to in case I don't hear from her she's told me she doesn't remember.  She has recently been fired from her most current job because of being put on bed rest, yet I find out she is still continuing to get involved in things we pursue that someone in her situation shouldn't be doing.

 She has over the years accused me of physical abuse, emotional abuse, rape (twice, and then recounted it to multiple people) and even though she backtracked and apologized for those things, I constantly have been the one that tried to patch things up and get to a mutual understanding that potentially we could work out as a couple.   It just never happened. We kept in contact after she told me she was pregnant for a multitude of weeks after determining it would be mutually beneficial to get a paternity test due to the fact that there were others involved between our ""breakups"" then suddenly a few months ago she stopped answering my calls or texts.  I don't want to get involved in a relationship with her again and I am exhausted by the drama, but I don't want the next 20ish years to be unnecessarily ridden with conflict and drama. I have done everything from reach out via phone/text, message her parents, leave groceries for her and her son, mow her lawn, yet she continues to tell mutual contacts of ours that I'm not trying to be involved, that I'm not reaching out, that I want nothing to do with this child but it can't be further from the truth.  I want you all that realize that I am not a Saint and I have done some questionable things as well, but I'm looking for answers here.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I continue to approach this?  As a man.  As a potential father?  Should I keep fighting this fight?  I just wish we could talk like adults.  Am I fighting the BPD or the person?  Should I just wait out the next couple months?

r/advice.  If anyone has been in my shoes before, or even if you have an opinion reach out to me.  I am going bonkers here and I can't keep showing up at her house because it's making me feel kinda creepy.  Thanks for letting me ramble",16Oct2019,1

243,"With a couple friends, the topic of college came up as we are high school seniors. They made fun of a couple of majors like psychology and communications by calling them easy and not likely to get you anywhere. 

I unfortunately still have no clue what I want to be but I did make somewhat of a decision to major in Journalism or Linguistics or Foreign Languages. Since I’ve always found news reporting and traveling exciting. I know the job outlook is not so good and the competition is tough, but am I really making a stupid mistake?",16Oct2019,1

245,"I’ve maintained a regular spot on a live tv show for the past few years and have slowly gained responsibility along the way. However, I believe the host, who is on various medications for paranoia/depression is cutting my opportunities. For ease of reading I’ll refer to this individual as Josh. 

Last year, I was approached about taking over the host position upon Josh’s retirement. Originally, Josh was in full support of this and gave me multiple opportunities to film specials and even host live episodes while he was out of town (I won multiple national awards for two special segments during this time). Everything seemed great, but things started going downhill when Josh’s contract can up for renegotiation...

Our Big Boss decided not to fully renew Josh’s contract and instead granted a one year extension until a final decision was made on a replacement host. This was when Josh’s behavior became erratic. Right after getting the news about his contract, Josh came straight to my office to tell me how there was no viable option for a new host in his eyes and how he wouldn’t go down without a fight. I knew he had an ulterior motive for having this talk with me and fully expected some form of BS from him. Little did I know how easy it would be for him to achieve this...

Our producer is very timid and is often bullied by Josh through constant insults and demands. Next thing I know, my planned special segment projects were dropped wayyyyy back on the filming timeline and I was being cut out of special live events (I.e. live shows with audiences, meet and greets, etc.). In facts, Josh actually stole one of my ideas for a special saying “I should do this one so I can justify my job, you have plenty of other great ideas.” This has been a huge kick in the stomach given the time I’ve invested in this project (over a year).

My question is, how do I overcome Josh’s ability to censor me from our audience and bosses? Do I avoid him and guard all my ideas? In my mind this a double edged sword since It could signify a lack of creativity on my part. I just need to make a decision one way or another... to leave, to stay, or to call Josh out on his BS. 

Anyway, I apologize for the novel and appreciate your feedback.",16Oct2019,1
248,"My Bf told me he has a friend who is cheating on his wife with three kids. It frustrates me because on social media he flaunts that he’s this fabulous father who loves his family, yet clearly he isn’t. I don’t know his friend personally, nor do I know his wife, but I feel compelled to tell her. My Bf told me he has tried to tell his friend, but his friend does it anyway. 

When I told my Bf I wanted to tell the wife of the cheater the truth, Bf got upset Bc he says I’m going to ruin their marriage. I said it was already ruined Bc his friend was cheating on her. Mainly I wanted to tell the wife Bc if I were in that situation I would hate to continue being with a cheater and would be grateful for someone to tell me the truth, even if it were a stranger. I felt if the cheater and his wife really want to work it out they could see a marriage counselor and he could get help, rather than sweeping his actions under the rug and avoiding any sort of consequence. 

Is it wrong for my Bf to be mad? He insists it’s not Bc of the bro code that he doesn’t want the wife to know, but because he doesn’t want the family to split up. He insists I’ll be the one to ruin their marriage if I tell the wife the truth (it’s already ruined though?). 

Also, obviously I think it’s the right thing to tell the wife but Bf also made the comment “it’s none of my business poking my nose in their marriage”. Reddit fam, What do you guys think? Also, should I still be with this guy? 

TLDR: Bf tells me his friend is cheating on his wife. I want to tell the wife, but Bf doesn’t. Should I tell the wife, and should I still be with Bf who doesn’t agree with my moral standards and point of view?",16Oct2019,2
249,"So I’ve just transferred universities and am in a dorm like situation where I have a roommate since I applied for housing so late. He’s an okay guy I guess. Not someone I would be friends with if I wasn’t forced to because of the living arrangements. The main issue lies in his personal hygiene. It absolutely doesn’t exist. We’ve lived here for about two months now and he hasn’t washed his cloths/sheets once. He has a container of tide pods out that hasn’t even been opened yet. Between me and my two other sweet mates, we’ve only seen him shower 3 times in these 2 months (only when he is going out to see whatever equally smelly girl he met on tinder). His side of the room and his closet absolutely reek. I’ve have to buy 3 different types of air fresheners just to combat the smell from reaching my bed and desk. The problem is I think he’s completely aware that he smells like a dead possum. He attempts to spray himself with some citrus spray air freshener but that only makes him smell like citrus ass. He also always opens the window when he gets in which is incredibly annoying because 1.) winter is closely approaching and it gets under 40 at night and 2.) We are in downtown of a big city so all we hear are horns and construction all day and all night. Whenever he even comes near me I want to run as fast as I can and I get super short with him just so he hopefully gets a hint to spare me of his unrelenting stench. I am just genuinely curious as to why someone refuses to shower for no reason at all. We have our own shower that he only has to share with 3 other people and he has ample time to do it. Do any of you know of valid reasons or are one of the people like him who just can’t be bothered to shower?",16Oct2019,1
250,"So I have one friend (Who I'm not going to give out their gender just in case they ever see this. But I think I've made it more obvious) who I think is bi-curious. They only had a same-sex relationship online and not in real life. Anyway, they recently went to talk to somebody about their church and went to confession. They revealed that they were “bi-sexual” and had a relationship online. I don’t remember exactly what they told me, but I remember that they said the priest asked them if they were okay to kiss the same sex in real life. Which my friend said that they were afflicted/disturbed by the thought of it. They never really considered having a relationship with a person of the same gender in real life. So they felt confused. After telling me this, they told me that they were going to force themselves to be “straight” so they could be accepted, pure, or something like that. At the time, I was about to tell them that they might just be bi-curious, but after hearing them saying they were going to force themselves to be a heterosexual stopped me. 

Are they bi and attracted to the same sex, but not **physically**?

Are they straight and just **curious** about the other gender?

Are they actually full-on bi, but just **stopping** themselves from **accepting** it because of their religion/what people say about it?

All I could say was that they’re still that same person, and no matter what they will still be loved. I’m very conflicted about this, and I don’t know what to tell them. On one hand, I want to say that they might be just bi-curious and that's all. But on the other, a small part of me wants to say that they should just test it out.

This might be off-topic but, they also say secretly depressing things. Like how they just want to ""die right now"", how they ""don't want to exist"", or how ""they could barely smile that day."" I don't know if this is just from our generation's (gen z) dark humor, and the internet just influenced it, or she's dropping hints about how they are feeling. But just in case, I want to know how to keep them going. It's ~~pRobAbLy~~ because I feel like this, and I don't want her to go through what I felt.

Always stressed, thinking they were a waste of space, bringing everybody down, disappointing people, I don't want them to feel like that. Because it hurts. ~~(lmao tearing up like a little baby.)~~

Tbh, I think I'm just being dramatic, but it's better to be safe than sorry. (I just realized that I have another friend like this, but they're getting professional help, ~~so one less person to give advice to from reddit lol.)~~

254,"Hi, strangers. 

It was 5 years ago, after I finished pre-med, I was reviewing and doing practice questions for Mcat and GRE and preparing to apply to medical school and PA school as plan B. I was confident and passionate young man. At the time, I loved reading. I tutored my classmates during premed, killed every classes, and crushing every other competitors. I was confidence that, at least I would get accepted to PA school, if not medical school because my resume and recommending letters is stunning and appealing in my measures. However, series of events happened in short period of time that knocked me off my course. My whole entire world, my mom got accepted to ER. She was confused and she was nut. She freaked me out and imprinted that events deep in my memory. After that she has to take a bunch of medications, her supportive of me going to medical school changes, her behavior kinds of change, and it seems she won’t make it until I graduate from PA school or medical school, which is my goal to pay her back for the nurturing and raising me. 

During that time, I worked in a kitchen at a restaurant. The working condition was a shit hole. Everyone’s yelling at everyone else any chance they can get or out of nowhere, it more like a zoo, and as a young men, I didn’t know any better. I was shocked of how a human can be that low and terrible to each other, as I was raise as a catholic and my mom always told me that human are good and I did believe her up until that period. I ended up quitting that job and on top of it, the hatred of my mom who I loved so much build up. I hated her for how come she lied to me and not teaching me a practical knowledges that I can use in life, I hated her for tell me to let it go and not letting me punched the shit out of the guy that I work with in the restaurant and also hated myself for listening to her. Many thing built up that threw me into major depression. The signs and symptoms are classic textbooks descriptions that I read during premed. I was isolated my self, avoided social interaction, done nothing but go to work and come home to my apartment by myself, and sleep alone. It felt dreadfully lonely. I thought of dark thoughts many time and even think of doing it, but before the depression, I have 2 principles that under no circumstances that should be violated. 

1- never hurt others

2- and hurt yourself. 

After whole years of being useless and suffering, one of the promising treatment for depression is social support. So I pushed myself out there despite whatever my heart may feel or hurt, I pushed my self to talk and make friend with people again. During this self treatment, I found out that paramedic takes much shorter time to complete. So I applied, got accepted, and finished the program and working for 1 years at an emergency service now. Back to present, I got accepted to higher education for healthcare career, which is more challenging then EMT and Paramedic school. It need focus, read a lot more, and memorize much more, and I still have not much support from my family. I couldn’t get my self to sit down to read as long as I used to be. I lost my edge and it frustrates me that I’m not good as I used to be, I’m losing it to other competitors, and the feelings are sucks.

So for medical profession and other highly competitive fields, how do you get your shit together after a major set back? After a betray of your love one that now distracted you and fragmented your mental health?

Thank you.",16Oct2019,1
255,"I quit my job about two weeks ago because my boss was harassing me. I even spoke to HR about her which ended up being a meeting about me! I got coached for being offended by the rude way she talked to me. I got a verbal warning for not doing what my supervisor wanted me to do which makes absolutely no sense. 

Later, she once again took me into HR and had me sign a paper saying that I will never disrespect a coworker. We had a disagreement about something we were doing and we emailed each other about it and used a few foul words. Nothing came of it and it wasn’t bad in anyway. Someone told our boss and she took me to HR. There is so much more. Trust me this was way worse than I’m sounding. She used my shyness and lack of action to put me down and target me every chance she got. I’m not smart enough to get the words I need to explain it well. 

I worked there just shy of two years. This woman publicly humiliated me in front of customers and during our crew meetings. She used our work place team app to do it as well. I kept all this proof in my work email. My coworkers even started getting upset. 

I sent emails to HR and to her boss and nothing ever came of it. Right before I quit she sent me another email saying she needed to meet with me. I knew it was going to be one in HR. I snapped and quit that day. I couldn’t take it anymore. 

However in my haste I forgot to email myself all this proof I had that she was doing this. She locked my email account in the time it took me to drive home. So less than 10 minutes. 

I applied for unemployment and I don’t have any proof but one email of a screenshot. They put my status as “under investigation”.

256,"I'm going to keep this short and to the point.

A girl ( F Grade 12 idk her age added me (16 Grade 11) off quick add on snapchat in August. We didnt know each other prior. We talk on snap alot and she goes to the school that's a 10 minute walk from mine. I tell her about my life and struggles and she does the same, you know, casual shit. She has a thing with someone but never mentions it. She's cute and kind so it's all cool to me and being friends is all good.

(She just snapped me as I'm typing this.) So I occasionally go to her school at lunch because I have homies there. I took a snap of the school, sent it to her, and she's like ""whoa you're here?"". I said yes and all that but we ran into each other. I then took a step to ask her if she wanted fo meet up that Friday and she said yes. The next day (it was Thursday) she ghosts me ENTIRELY. No snap, no contact no nothing. It lasts till about the following Tuesday.

I didn't think much of it till I got hit with the surprise that I was transferring to that school mid year. I got there and all my friends freaked out cause I hadn't told them I was coming. 

That was two weeks ago.

Up till today, I still haven't talked to her in real life even after asking to hang out during lunch which the response I got was ""I can't"" or ""I'm busy"". Very vague shit right? 

And this is coming from the same woman who I sent a snap to saying ""Sorry for my ugliness"" and she replied back with ""No you're ok why do you think I send the pictures I do to you. And she's RIGHT! She really does send really appealing photos to my phone!

Anyways, I've seen her around the school but I'm starting to think that:

A) She has cripling anxiety and doesnt think we will click irl or feels she's being fake online and cant make up for it in person.

B) Her now boyfriend who goes to another school might find out and break up with her. I have no idea if he's abusive.

C)  She just wants my attention online but doesn't have my time in person.

258,"Alt account. On mobile. Heavy topic. 
I’m dealing with a lot of crap here, and I don’t really know where else to turn for advice by now.  The short version is that my (M16) long distance gf (F15) has so much going wrong in her life that she’s desperate to die. She’s mentally ill and not wanting to get help, and I’m unable to get in touch with people who can help her. 

I met a girl some months ago online. We only planned on being friends, but it sprouted into a relationship. Since then I’ve found her to be absolutely incredible in just about every way, and I want her in my life more than anyone. 

She had a very bad home life. I helped her escape it, but she had an array of issues because of what she went through. She has an eating disorder, seems to have something like borderline personality disorder, and might even be schizophrenic. She experiences severe hallucinations (auditory, visual, and tactile).  She’s also constantly bullied and attacked at school. She’s stuck in the foster system and at this point, I’m the only person in her life that she actually cares about. Because of all of this stuff though, she is very suicidal. It’s getting worse by the day. 

The problem is that she has been careful not to give me her address or the phone numbers of people like her foster family, because she knows I’ll do something to help her. I have nothing more than a full name and a very large city. This means that, so far as I know, the only way I can help her is by convincing her to seek help. Unfortunately, she’s very resistant to it. She’s scared that she won’t have the option of suicide, she won’t be able to self harm, they’ll make her eat properly, and she’ll be treated like she’s crazy. And that probably is what would happen if she sought help. 

So I have no idea what to do. She’s been the only light in my life in years and I can’t lose her, but I don’t know if there’s anything else I can do. She’s desperate for a way out and I don’t know what more I can do to stop her. There’s no immediate danger at the time of posting this, but I don’t wanna wait until then.

260,"So currently I am in High school and I’m a pretty good student, I always get As on all my tests &amp; quizzes, I finish all my homework in time, and over all this has translated into my grades giving me either an A or A+ in all of my classes except for one, “Get Focused.” Now I’m assuming most people reading this are not familiar with the course seeing how it was recently added to my school’s mandatory classes for my grade, and none of my friends that are in other high schools have it. A basic run down is it’s supposed to be a college/life preparation class. It covers things like what occupation would you like to have after high school, or at what age would you like to be married and how many kids are you planning to have? Personally I think it’s nobodies business what I do after High School and overall I think it’s a useless class which is the general consensus with my peers and the majority of my school’s teachers and staff so the class will likely be discontinued in a few years. Also It’s absolutely miserable in the class because none of my friends are in it with me right now and most of the people in the class are people I don’t want to associate with, so most of the time I just do my work and just start reading a book when I’m done (which is the majority of the class period.)  However after a few controversies I had with the teacher he now has a personal vendetta against me and is failing all my work no matter what I do. This is very easy for him to do because they work we’re assigned has no real guidelines or right answers so he basically decided whether or not he likes our answers. One thing I did that ticked him off is that for “my lifestyle surveys” I closed the most minimal life style possible and set it up so it could be easily supported by minimum wage. I thought this was okay, but a week later he would tell me to change some thing like “oh you can’t but 50 dollars as your monthly clothes budget, it must at least be 150.” And “your rent money is too low!”(the reason why he thought it was low was because I live in an area where the rent is too damn high. When I tried to explain to him I don’t plan on staying in this state an plan on moving somewhere else he just wouldn’t hear it. So I did change the stuff, but then once again a week later he told me to change more things right before the deadline.(which I quickly completed.) But that didn’t stop him from giving me an F anyways, on another one of the useless surveys we had to take I was kind of in a bored mood so I answered the survey like I was a mafioso(which I know is something you shouldn’t do for a serious assignment but he never read the other surveys anyways so I didn’t think it would matter[also it was ungraded anyways.]) Well, after the Teacher started getting ticked off at me he decided great a week after I had already turned in the survey(which was online) he would actually read it. On one part I put for something I would like to do in my work environment or whatever I wrote “Whacking People” which at the time I thought was funny especially when my Teacher started to lecture me on why “killing people is bad” I was just like “what are you talking about, whacking doesn’t mean killing people. I mean, people get whacked all the time. Kids get whacked when the piss off their parents and college kids get whacked with batons all the time.” He did not like my sense of humor and decided to report me to the counselor’s office. But that didn’t go anywhere because I didn’t actually break any rules and it was clear that I was just joking.  

Okay now I know I have been rambling, and yes I know  I haven’t been taking the class very seriously especially a few weeks ago. But now I’m in a situation where even if I do my very best and try not to make any jokes or anything like that my Teacher will still fail the assignment and claim it didn’t meet the requirements when it most certainly did. Now I would normally be fine with failing this class because I’m not learning anything and I don’t even think it gives you any credits. However if I don’t pass it I’ll have to retake it next semester and if I don’t pass it again no matter how good my grades are in my other classes I’ll have to repeat my grade!

I’m kind of stuck here and don’t really know what to do? Has anyone else been in a similar situation or might have any advice?",16Oct2019,1

262,"We are learning this software called GIS.  The format of the class is as follows:
You are assigned a set of exercises each week.  You do readings that teach you about concepts that are involved in the exercises, but not directly how to do them.  The reading is extremely sense, and hard to retain, but it is clear.

The class is just 30 minutes of lecture purely on definitions and terms per week (2 two hour classes per week), and the rest is lab hours to work on the exercises (with instructor present.)

My problem with the course is they expect you to learn basically everything from the book, but don't teach any of it in class besides definitions that have little to do with the actual homework.  The teacher is just there in case you need help.  When I inevitably ask for a lot of help, the teacher seems to become frustrated.

To me it seems like the class is set up lazily by the instructor, when he should be actually showing us how to use the program.  I would guess most people learn better by demonstration as opposed to only reading a book.

Am I crazy or does this class seem to be poorly structured?",16Oct2019,1

I didn’t want to believe what happened when I took my phone out my mouth and saw a huge ass CRACK in the middle of my phone from my jabber jaws.

My question now for everyone/ anyone who can answer : where do I get a good screen replacement that’s solely for cracks ? I can’t afford to get a new phone right now &amp; im kinda sentimental to my 6S that I’ve had since forever lol. Another question: is there even an option to only have a screen replacement ? Because I’ve seen a few videos regarding transfer of a home button , camera, etc- and it seems so tedious to do. Should I pay someone to fix instead ?  How easy is this process since I see a lot of people just fix these up with no issues . Thanks a lot !",16Oct2019,1
264,"Hello!!! title is weird and confusing so let me better explain!!! Sorry if this is rambly, or all over the place or anything like that.. i am very new to posting lengthy posts. 

So HELLO i am 25F. When i was 12, my sister would frequently have large groups of her older friends over. They ranged from ages 14-16. This particular creep was 16. Let’s call him Tom. I never hung out with them while they were all over. i was shy and awkward(still am). For some reason Tom asked my sister for my number and for some reason .. she gave it to him. 

He began texting me weird stuff. Asking me, a 12 year old, if i had ever kissed or touched a guy. I was really weirded out and confused and just didn’t know enough to speak up or understand it. He told me next time he’d come over we would go to the pool house and practice on each other. I don’t remember what i said or anything i just remember really feeling like i did not at all want that to happen. 

It didn’t happen. I think i hid in my room whenever she’d have friends over, or stay in my parents room with my mom or just do anything to avoid him. I think he wanted me to meet him out there or something and i just ignored his texts and stuff. they weren’t friends for very long and eventually the situation just went away. (actually at one point during this he and my sister dated...) anyways phew 

so fast forward literally 13 years. I think the last time Tom and i interacted was then. just had no reason to cross paths. Now he is in a band with a friend of mine. That friend is also dating a very close girlfriend of mine. This band often has shows in restaurants , bars, small venues nearby.

I recently in the past 2 years unfriended Tom on FB. Just felt weird that we even were friends.. he also posts like an idiot and very annoying. Tom took notice and reached out to me many times since then about why i did that and how it’s really bothering him.I believe my friend who is in the band with him told him he had done something to make me uncomfortable. (what happened when i was 12). he did not tell him exactly or anything.

The reason i don’t just block him is this. i want to so badly be able to come to my friends shows to support him. my whole group of friends go and invite me and i just can’t. they all know what happened and support me and understand. 

if i block him, it will be a bigger deal. and i believe he will confront me if he recognizes me at a show. This is a small town everyone knows everyone. Most recently a few days ago he sent me another message saying it’s “eating at him, that something happened that made someone uncomfortable”. like he really can’t seem to get over this. i don’t really care. he is making it about HIS feelings and seems entitled to hear from me or is trying to make me feel bad. I am so over the situation. he is making himself the victim here because i haven’t responded. because this situation is so irrelevant to my life. 

also, i have a BF. he has a GF. so i don’t think it’s that he’s trying to initiate anything like that. only when i was a literal 12 year old lmao. 

I could reach out to my guy friend that is in the band with him and he would immediately tell him to leave me alone. apparently they all hate him and he gets shitfaced at shows. and is just a dick. But i don’t want to involve them or make it a big deal or anything. it shouldn’t be in the first place but he continues to make it a big deal. 

i really don’t think it even matters how i approach the situation i believe he will confront me at a show anyways, especially considering he gets hammered at every show apparently . i think i’m just going to message him and take a chance so i can finally see my friend perform. and my friends all know and will step between us and have my back if he tries anything stupid. Honestly everyone dislikes him a lot in the group. 

i know it seems obvious to just block him but that resolves nothing about the main issue that i can’t seem to go to the shows currently . it will make it worse. so either i need to confront him or have my friends do it. which i really don’t want to involve them 

I don’t really know what i’m asking except maybe how to respond to him? and tell him to leave me alone. or if anyone has experienced anything similar just to understand . 

IM SO SORRY THIS IS SO LONG !!!! thanks for making it this far if you did!!!!",16Oct2019,1
265,"hi ok so i hooked up with someone in my friend group a month ago and ever since they’ve treated me like garbage. Just really disrespectful behavior and it’s really taken a toll on me. We still hang out but i either get too nervous to talk or get short with them. Problem is, they asked me to hook up again (last week) after treating me so badly. I really want to resolve the issue since we do see eachother often, but I’m not sure if it’s too late and I don’t want to seem like someone who’s obsessing over it when in reality i just want closure and to stop being in such an awkward situation.",16Oct2019,1

My entire life, I've been teased about the name. On paper or through emails to people I haven't met in person yet, they naturally assume I'm a female.

268,"I'm a female, 23yo. I feel like in my entire life I'm very toxic. At first I didn't notice it but since my ex bf told me that I am suffocating, I realize that I actually am. At some point, I didn't really care since I felt like I'm always alone anyway. Now I found some nice people that I would call friends (online, i dont really have any irl friends) and I start being toxic again. I wanted to talk to them a lot (my ex told me that he got no time for others because of me and he didnt wanna spend time with me) but I know I shouldn't. I like talking a lot, even if it's about nothing much but what I do today etc. A lot of the time tho, it went to negative feelings that I talked about and then felt bad about it later on.

Long time ago, I kept everything to myself and I was scared to talk about all my feelings but I've changed since then and I realize that I quite enjoy talking about it (via text). It wasn't exactly good for me (maybe) but I think it's better for people around me. Lately I've been thinking about it a lot, how toxic I am and I'd rather be back to how I was before than suffocating people around me. I appreciate them being around for me, I don't deserve any of this kindness towards me especially that I am very toxic but I also want to keep them around since they are here already. I like having people around me as a friend. I like having friends. I wonder if I'm being selfish to want to keep them but they can leave me whenever they want to, and they know that. I won't text them first, so if they don't want to text me ever again, all they need to do is to stop texting me and I'll be gone.

My main issue would be keeping my problems to myself. I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna even hint about it to anyone. Any advice on how to do it? It happened before but idk how to trigger the fear of talking again.",16Oct2019,1
269,"1. Hi, I am a young photographer in the OC/LA area looking to get experience with concert photography. Besides the issue of me being 17 and not being old enough to get into most shows, I have another issue. I have been to quite a few shows (in the interest of the artist, not taking photos) and noticed all the venues didn’t allow cameras with detachable lenses (I have a shitty Canon Rebel T3i with a 50mm 1.8 lense). I was wondering if any of you have had experiences with venues (in my area) which had no problem with this, or what you have done in the past to have the rules overlooked (i.e. calling the venue ahead of time or contacting the performer).

2. Any general tips for concert photography? I’m pretty inexperienced as it is (only started using manual mode this year, no equipment except for lenses and a dated camera body). Is just a lense and a camera enough, or would I need to buy a better flash? I figured lighting at concerts might be bright enough to get a good effect without flash. What ISO/aperture (approximately) do y’all use when at concerts? What types of lenses? Thank you!!",16Oct2019,1
270,"So, I wanna keep this nice and short. So basically I like this girl and she said likes me. And I’ve been making moves such as: holding hands once, giving her my sweater/hoodie, hugging her, walking with her to class, putting my arm around her, and hugging her from behind once. 
Anyways, I’ve been the one who starts the conversation and/or interaction. When we first admitted our feelings for one another, she said that she wanted to take things slow, which I understood. She’s only been in one relationship and that was back in middle school. But I feel like I’m the only one putting in effort. My friends say it’s because she’s scared/nervous. I am too because she’s like this amazing girl that I don’t wanna mess things up with, but I’m still out here trying to put in moves. 
My friends say I should be “less interested” it’s a bad way to explain it but I don’t know how else to explain it. Not put in as much effort as I am not, try to make her start conversation. She recently went on vacation and she didn’t text me at all today...which I understand to a point. I just need advice on what to do? What to say to her and just advice in general.",16Oct2019,1

276,"Is this even the right sub to post this? It just happened around an hour ago.

Background: There is an annual cheering event at my school. The university is divided into academic organizations based on their courses and these compete against each other. They are allowed to have themes and costumes and the goal is to make catchy chants with choreography while throwing jabs at each other and praising your own theme. People take it seriously. The people joining are freshmen, so around 17-18 years old.

This year the students all unanimously decided to remove the insult portion of the chants and instead turn the whole event into a platform for bring awareness to social issues. Which is good because our country right now (Philippines) is under a lot of shit and people are restless. My university in particular hosts a lot of rallies and is general more liberal.

What happened was one of the competing teams showed up dressed as concentration camp prisoners. They wore bald caps, over sized ragged shirts, chains and make up was used to depict them as starving and pale. They carried a sign that said ""Concentration Camp"". The cheer leaders were dressed in military uniforms and gas masks. In the end they were gassed and the ""prisoners"" died.

I wasn't even able to understand what social issue they were trying to portray because the Holocaust imagery was really disturbing. But the crowd seemed to love it because they were clearly applauding.

Am I missing something here? They really paid attention to details so I doubt they didn't know what they were doing. The consensus as of now is that these kinds of presentations should be disturbing and should make the audience uncomfortable, but did they really need to mock a tragedy like that to get the shock value?

I'm afraid I can't articulate my words properly when I talk to other people about this.",16Oct2019,2

280,"How do I move across the country?

I (18M) am having a bit of a problem. I moved from Washington to Virginia over the summer and I want to move back out to the pacific north west to start my own life. 

My parents are cool and are willing to pay for a higher education so I decided that I would go to a university in the west and major in writing and filming. The problem is that my parents don’t want to pay for “out of school” tuition because it would be a fortune. I’ve thought about doing community college here for a semester, get straight A’s, and maybe they would only have to pay for half of the tuition and the school would pay the other half. 

However, I would feel bad if I had to make my parents pay all that money just so I could “live the college life” for 4 years, meet new people in a new town, and just have it as a excuse to start my individual life, because although I would like to increase my skills in writing and filming so I can be an author/movie maker, that’s not really the reason why I want to go to the university I pick (still deciding). 

My parents are going to move to Tennessee in 2 years, and I would like to move out in the fall of next year. For right now I’m just saving up money I’m making from my part time job.

What do I do, how to I move across the country by next year? I don’t want to move with them again and I would like to start my own life.

I'm 17F and I am bi, I've never been in a relationship but I do know im attracted to both genders.

My brother is also bi, and when he told my mom, she was okay. But when time went on, when she would talk about it she'd refer to him as confused. She would ask me randomly ""is he still confused?"" She still is very hesitant to even accept the fact that he could like guys. 

My aunts, uncles, and grandmother are also EXTREMELY religious and dont really support lgbtq+

My aunt once said to my cousin (who asked what my aunt would think if hypothetically she was gay) that she wouldnt be mad, just disappointed. God made us a certain way and we'd be going against his will.

286,"My apologies if the title is a bit out of context, the situation itself is... bizarre.

Ok, so a little backstory. My wife, son and I moved from the East coast of the USA to the West Coast just last month. Hard times have seemed to plague our family through 2017-2018 as is an occurrence for most in life and this is our fresh start, a chance for new opportunities in life. I honestly love it out here and do not miss it back home. The road trip was beautiful and the spare time we've had to see the sights have been amazing, but one thing stands in the way for me and it's starting to take a toll on my mind... my wife and son haven't caught on and I honestly want to keep it that way for now.

So we've entered into a transitional housing program as our finances were limited due to the circumstances before we started our trip from coast to coast. I had set up our appointments to get into an apartment here weeks in advance to ensure we had a smooth transition and a roof over our head when we arrived at our destination. Over the phone and online, the environment here came off as accepting, understanding and very friendly. This was the case when we arrived as well, it's nice and everyone here is welcoming and inviting. Except one, the head of the program, we'll call him ""B"". B oversees everything that is done around the property. I have had limited interactions with B but they were just like everyone else, always asking how the day is going, greets you anytime you pass by and asks if you need anything on a routine basis. Normal enough right? Well, fast forward two weeks in and everything is going as well as can be. Or so I thought.

So my wife returns home from her shift at work only to find out that her keycard to access the building had de-magnetized as the cards are very sensitive and seemed to react to the magnetic nametag she wears with her uniform. The way the building had been constructed was in a typical hotel style where all the units are accessed solely from the inside. I was busy with my son at the time and hadn't heard my phone ringing as she was going to have me come downstairs to open the door. When she'd finally gotten back up to our apartment, about 10-15 minutes of waiting around, she'd told me B let her back in. She told me that he had been a complete asshole about it, which pissed me off and I contemplated going to look for him but decided against it. Basically, B had come from around the backside of the building while on maintenance duty and found her out front. When she explained the situation, he argued that she should have waited at the side entrance as the front door was for employees only and the side entrance was residents only. Well... we both knew this anyway and she'd come up to the front since there was no one in sight at the side door and residents are not allowed to open the door for anyone outside in the first place. B basically rambled on about it like a parent and just wouldn't let it go, leaving another staff member to overhear the conversation and intervene to divert B's attention from pushing the matter any further and so they could get the keycard re-activated.

After a while, we forgot about it all together and continued about our day as we chalked it up to B simply having a bad day. All of a sudden though, from that day on, B just avoids us altogether. What's strange is that B will act just as he was when we first arrived to all the other residents, that friendly, bubbly personality. We thought maybe B just has a problem with people who don't follow rules to the exact T and we just stopped giving a fuck about him honestly, things happen and I felt his expectations of residents to be unrealistic at times. Until he started a renovation project in the apartment right across the hall from us. This is where things really take a sharp turn, for seemingly no reason at all, it just doesn't make sense. So here it goes...

It was a Friday afternoon when B started the project as new residents were expected to move in the following Monday. It was your typical project, getting new appliances, new locks, new materials for the bathroom and all that good stuff. In and out, in and out and B wouldn't so much as speak a word in our direction or make any eye contact whatsoever. Whatever, until the evening comes around. About 9pm is when everyone and everything is quiet so B will do what he can to finish up for the day without making much noise and disturbing the surrounding families. I was browsing Youtube around 10pm when I hear a tap at the door... odd I thought. I walked over to our front door and checked the peephole. Nothing. Weird but I thought nothing of it really, as some kids were typically still awake this late on weekends and were probably just screwing around. At 1030pm I was in the middle of checking emails when I heard a distinct tap at the door this time and I know someone had to be there. I checked the peephole again and nothing. I could see B was still across the way, packing up for the night. I saw his cart filled back up with tools and material sitting by the door but he was nowhere in sight. Maybe B hit the shitter. I had decided to head to bed after that as we had an early start the next day for a trip to explore the town on our day off and forgot about it.

Saturday afternoon was quite relaxing, everyone was in bed early after a long day in town and I was back on the laptop doing my thing when this time, around 9pm again, I heard someone at the door. It wasn't the typical tapping from the previous night, more like someone was pulling at the door handle to come in. ""What the fuck?"" I thought as I crept over to the peephole. B was again across the way, working on the apartment. I had a clear view inside the apartment across the way and didn't see B anywhere, just his cart. No noise, nothing. I was a bit put off at this point and ruled out any of the kids as being the culprit, it was just too quiet. I closed my laptop, threw on my jacket and quietly slipped into the hallway to make my way to the balcony where I could have a smoke. While I did, I kept my eyes peeled for the person fucking around in the hallway. I waited to no avail only to see B return to continue his work and he hadn't gone near our door. I decided to have another smoke in the hopes that if I waited long enough, I would see someone come to our door as I can see it from the balcony. Still nothing. It was too cold to sit outside any longer and I returned inside to my apartment. Around 11pm I was finally ready to call it a night. I decided I would check the peephole one more time just to be safe. B was just now leaving the apartment as I looked out and as he was pushing his cart out to leave, he stopped, eyed our door for what felt like an unnerving amount of time and he had no idea I was looking out from the other side. He then sharply turned away, wheeling his cart with him as if he knew that someone was watching. ""Fucking creepy"" I mumbled as I walked to bed. I avoided telling my wife the next day as not to cause any discomfort for her.  

Finally, Sunday night arrives and I continue my routine. Everyone is in bed and here I am, wondering what the fuck is next? I felt it had to be B, but why? What's the purpose? Tonight was the last night before the new residents moved in and B's last night working on it and there seemed to be little left for him to do, I figured he'd be out of there early tonight. All the meanwhile I had been contemplating a camera but there is no way to post one discreetly enough as we are not allowed to install them anyway. All I had was a peephole and my ability to get to the door quick enough if anything else happened. At first, I had planned to just ignore it, it wasn't worth it, until around midnight when I heard the lock on the door actually fucking click. When the lock clicks, it's because a keycard was swiped. The only reason I didn't immediately grab a kitchen knife and prepare to stick someone was that the lock lit up red upon the keycard being swiped. I knew it wasn't one of our keycards due to the fact both of ours is where we left them earlier this afternoon. For just a moment I thought maybe a new resident got mixed up on which unit was theirs, crazy but it happens and thankfully they couldn't get in anyway. All of a sudden I froze, I heard a male voice mutter ""Fuck it."" That voice, was B. Even with the limited interactions, I knew it was him, his voice is very distinctive. It took all my willpower not to open that door and stick him. I slipped over to the peephole and found him walking to the stairwell, no cart in sight, no tools, nothing. The apartment across the way dark and the door shut... I didn't sleep at all that night, for obvious reasons.

A week later and I still have not come out to anyone at the complex about this, not even my wife. I have been thinking it over constantly, as B is the director and I fear retaliation and losing our housing if I put him on the chopping block. Strangely enough, I found out that B is on ""vacation"" as I have not seen him lately and the timing is too suspicious as he took off after that night. I do not know when B will return but I felt that I need to do something before that happens, but what?

288,"I got a very disturbing Facebook message from Stacy. I just want to tell you. We are not quitting. This is terrible and hateful. She is 12. She has autism she isn’t perfect. The very least you should be able to expect from people is human decency and kindness. So my sweet wonderful girl dressed up today so that the girls in DND group would talk to her. Jessica and Kate completely ignored her! I mean to say when she talks to them they say nothing. They act like she isn’t there at all when she tries to engage. That’s just mean. 
Well now the texts from Stacy about autumn mom agreed that autumn does  not want to be friends with Lydia. Is this social bullying? 
How can I fix this?",16Oct2019,1
289,"I'm looking for advice in navigating a situation between me (F28) and my friend Jay (M33). TL;DR will be at the bottom. 

Jay has been staying in my guest room for just over 3 months. I'm trying to be patient and understanding of his situation, but I can't help but feel a little frustrated and want my space back.

Jay was desperately trying to get out of our small hometown (less than 5000 people), and coincidentally looking at the city I now reside in. That small town is out in the middle of nowhere, with not much available. Jay also got out of a bad relationship and sticking around there was not good for him. 

I offered my guestroom for a few weeks to help with the transition. But it turns out he did little in the way of preparation (i.e. lining up interviews, viewings, etc.) Or even being aware of the markets.

He came in with a very blas attitude that things would just line up for him. That he would have no problem getting these things, which frankly annoyed me. 

Housing is a HUGE issue in this city. It's an extremely competitive market. Above ground 1 bedroom apartments easily go for $2000/month. Needless to say it's not unusual to have roommates here, but Jay wouldn't even consider it at the beginning.

Side note: I seriously lucked out with my place and will never find anything comparable. But I work 2-3 jobs and adjusted my budget to afford it. 

So far Jay has only found part-time work. I know he is struggling and frustrated so I haven't said anything, and tried to be a supportive friend. 

I let him stay free of charge for the first month. Midway through the second month I informed him I was going to start needing some kind of contribution. It's nothing outrageous, it works out to less than 1/3 of the rent. I've already checked with the laws in my area and no he is not considered a tenant.

I should mention that he's not a bad roommate, I just never planned to have one in the first place. At what point is it enough? I feel horrible because I dont think he would have anywhere else to go. But I cant have him staying here forever.

TL;DR

Friend has been crashing at my place looking for work and an apartment. Was meant to be a few weeks. In three months there has been little progress. 

Staying in his hometown is not really an option (no work, messy past relationship). As of the middle of the second month he has started making minimal contributions to rent (I checked and he would not be considered a tenant yet). 

Housing is a super competitive market so I have tried my best to be a patient understanding friend. I feel horrible but I'm at the point I want my space back; he doesn't have anywhere else he could go. But I dont want him having the impression he can just stay here forever.",16Oct2019,1
290,"My ex told me that I'm the first person he's ever felt for before. He told me that he thought he was a sociopath before he met me. He told me about the times he's tried to kill himself and told me that I'm the only light in his life. I have a connection with this dude and he understands me in a way that I didn't know was possible, he's the only person I truly trust in this world. I've told him things that not even my best friends or my family know about. I'm not in love with him, but I do love him. He makes me feel whole and real. I recently started dating someone and when I told my ex he was happy for me. But he treats me differently now, he treats me like he does with everyone else, this isn't bad but he used to be so different around me, he seemed more genuine, and I just don't see that side of him anymore. I don't know how he feels about me, were still friends but I feel like I lost him, and now there's this huge chunk of me missing and I don't know what to do without him.",16Oct2019,1
291,"I'm 22 F and recently started working as a medical assistant at an Urgent Care clinic. I've been there for almost 4 months now.  I don't have a lot of work experience. Prior to working at Urgent Care, I worked in a grocery store. Graduating as a medical assistant is easier than being a nurse. I only needed one year of the college course and I'm certified, after passing the certification exam that is. However, my current job hasn't been very kind to me. As you can see, I'm very new to this kind of role. Sometimes I feel so incompetent at work and I feel unfulfilled. I get my mistakes called out somewhat frequently which hurts my job confidence a lot. I feel like my work environment isn't very ""new friendly"" either. I have a coworker who is very passive-aggressive and sometimes I feel excluded at work. I'm a very big introvert and my coworkers are very clicky since they've been there for a long time now, I'd say 5+ years. I don't even have a friend at work, like at all. I love it when our float staff cover shifts for the clinic because they typically know as much as I do and it's a group learning effort. The only person who made me feel included was my trainer who resigned a few weeks ago. I remember how she mentioned the work environment is so clicky there and I was so damn happy to realized I wasn't the only person who noticed. I was so damn happy when she spoke to me regarding her personal life and showing me some personal pictures. I'm not getting that from any of the girls. To be honest, I think I'm doing a decent job for a person who doesn't have a lot of experience, it's just this work environment. For the most part I can keep up with the pace of the busy clinic and I can somewhat handle the demands of the job but when I have an obstacle, it takes a toll on me because idk who to ask for help. Other areas I don't enjoy about this job is that sometimes I get tired of talking to people and doing clerical duties, but I still do my best. I also hate the drive to work. I get stuck in traffic a lot and it takes me almost an hour to get to work/home. But this job pays $22 at a state with a high cost of living. I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for but at least just posting this is helping me.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually cried in the restroom today at work. I had enough of my mistakes today and in general. I made a phone call to a patient regarding some results and my passive-aggressive coworker called her back again, not realizing I had already done that. My passive-aggressive coworker turned her body to the coworker sitting next to her with an attitude like I had done something wrong and that just hurt me so much. I had to go into the restroom and cry a few tears. I have so many incidences but at this point, it would turn into a rant. Thanks to any strangers who ready this.",16Oct2019,1
292,"It feels like my sister (33F) just treats me like a babysitter and if I (22F) wasn’t helping her with her kids that she wouldn’t care about me or want to talk to me. She keeps telling me that I need help and to go to a therapist but I have no insurance nor the money to even get an appointment. 

She has struggled with depression all her life and so have I, but in different ways. She thinks she can just tell me to get out there and do it, but I have no car and no license and she takes advantage of that by going out to drink and spend time with her boyfriend while I’m stuck babysitting. Next to her kids and her boyfriend, I’m nothing. 

It makes me hate her and I told her I’m never babysitting again. I told her a few days ago that her kids don’t listen and how they are (they lie and steal, can be bossy and don’t listen) and she said “well I don’t like criticizing my children” and I heard her behind my back tell them that I’m crazy because I was crying because she called me fat  (I was trying to make one of her kids eat all her food because she wouldn’t eat a bite of it and she told me that she doesn’t make them eat if they don’t want to because she doesn’t want to make them fat like the rest of us) she’s never told me how she has raised them and now I’m the bad guy because I told her daughter to eat her food. 

They get away with a lot and it’s exhausting to take care of them. I don’t have children and I never want children so I don’t know how to take care of them. When I told her to stop criticizing me because she was talking crap about me to her kids, she became livid and told me how dare I say that after I criticized them in front of her the other day (I told her before that some criticism is good, as in recognizing that there is a problem and working on it with them. Like them lying and stealing is not a good thing and it’s something to be criticize so they don’t think that it’s okay to do) 

I just can’t handle that she thinks she’s better than me and that I’m nothing to her, I told her that I hate her but really I can’t seem to feel anything for her anymore. When we didn’t live together I thought the world of her. It now I see her for who she is and it sickens me. She’s my sister but how can a sister treat another sibling the way she treats me?

When I was 8 or 9 years old, my cousin who was 12 or 13  at the time sexually coerced me into exposing myself to him and performing sexually provocative moves.

He was much larger and stronger than I was and I didn’t feel like I had any choice but to comply. I’ve never like had any sexual attraction towards anyone and the idea of having sex has always terrified me and I think this is part of the reason why.

My roommate is abusive, not physically, but in every other sense of the word. She obsessed with one of my other roommates, for the sake of confidentiality we will call the crazy one Andy and the one shes obsessed with Anne. 

Andy will fake panic attacks and other illnesses to manipulate anne to do what she wants. 
Example: 2 weeks ago anne went to walmart and andy freaked out, faked a massive panic attack, and texted anne that she would kill herself and that anne is a bad friend. Anne called me and asked me to check up on andy. I find andy pretending to be passed out in Anne's bedroom and she was unresponsive. I called the police and as soon as the EMTs came in she got up and pretended like nothing happened. 
This is just one episode. 

We have reported her to the apartment complex as she has violated the apartment contract. The apartment is doing NOTHING. 
We then reported her to the schools honor code and they did NOTHING. 

This isn't okay. I don't feel safe with her here as she has been diagnosed with multiple personalities and I dont know to what lengths she will do to get what she wants. She needs to be kicked out of school or moved to a different apartment.

302,"Hello people of Reddit, I never thought I'll be making posts such as these but here we are , I'm Male 23years old and I live in a third world country, the situation is so dire it could become the next Venezuela.
So English isn't my primary language, it is my third, English is a very useful language that I picked from surfing the internet, as neither my native language or the country we were colonised by language (second language) are useful when it comes to internet surfing. It's a sad thing really, imagine you were born in a country, where its language is practical useless even in academic learning, it's only used to speak with your country people, mostly lower class or mid. The higher and mighty class use the language of the country which colonised, it is also uses in Enterprises and Academic Teaching, but nonetheless I got my Economics bachlor degree at the Age of 20, which was more of a living conditions struggle than mental struggle, just imagine you live in campus with 16ppl sleeping in one room, almost like prison you get the picture, plus the University isn't in my hometown which made it even worse, had to take care of everything myself BTW Age 17 and 20 but that's fine, struggle is fine along as its meaningful right? Some of the higher class that attended my school, had a better academic life style, they'd have cars already presumably using their parents, they had relationships they'd party often etc, and then there's me, wearing the same clothes for an entire week. But I wasn't the only one. Anyway when graduation came I ranked 3rd in my class. I thought after all it wasn't for nothing I still came atop most of the burgois kids but then when the next year came and I wanted to enroll masters. I got rejected, not once but twice. And guess who got it instead? The rich kids I'm assuming most of them got masters now, while I got rejected along 99% of ppl. A country infested with corruption, I'm being pressured to look for a job. The city I live in has exactly 0 enterprises, only hard labour ppl working for 150$ monthly, meaning if I have to look for a job I'd need to rent, the real estate is at its highest, especially in cities with somewhat slightly moving economy, the pay for a bachelor is 300$, the rent is 150$ if you are lucky. I've gotten mad with my situation, insecure. I went into depression but still maintained hope, because although I considered suicide I still wanna live, I feel like I can give more and do more, but then again what if I'm unable to due to my shitty circumstances, what point there's to life if even suffering is meaningless and you don't enjoy it because there's no point. I studied TOEFL and wanted to immigrate, I'm dumb because I didn't look up requirements for host countries to allow to enroll, I got TOEFL without enrolling to classes because they were expensive, just self study and determination only to find out I'd need to deposits 10000$ as guarantee so I don't flee in the host country and become an illegal immigrant, which translates to if you're poor your stuck. Let me give a background of my family, my father married 2 women, I'm the one of the two sons of the second woman, my mom that has passed away from cancer in 2011 (she also had depression prior being diagnosed with cancer, I was little and didn't know what depression is when she would lock me outside the house to avoid harming me, as she too I believe considered suicide at one point which has been confirmed to me by my aunt) with moms being sick, I had to take care of myself and as kid I really didn't know how I'd go to 8th grade with shit in my pants and it would smell badly, I'd get bullied, my grades dropped but I redeemed myself in12th grade. I think im a nice person or was but I learned to hate and became very aggressive at such a young age, my father is merchant. He's illiterate but wants us to study, because everyone else is sending their kids to school, good plan but badly executed due to the lack of guidance. I have 9 step brothers, dad 1st wife kids. Dad had to feed 11kids and 2wives. As a kid I felt no emotional connection from dad, guess after 11ths kids i became ""just another kid"" I feel like I was born in the wrong place, wrong era. I didn't chose to be born but then again who did. I guess my luck shit even at gods lottery.
Anyway after my TOEFL degree picked dust for two years which cost me 250$ for the test, I gotten angry and enrolled to an English Class at the University, I got the degree three years later, but it's no good unless I'm outside this country. But in spite all of this I have a sense of belonging to this country, I wish things were different and it were developed and had opportunities for me to exerce my creativity but my country doesn't love me back. Corruption is at all times high, wherever you go
I'm also a kissless virgin, I don't go to prostitutes but I understand the ones that do, I just find it is the same as jerking off as it lacks emotions, I can't afford dates because I barely afford myself. Women are attracted to successful men, I understand they can't build a future with an insecure guy, it just is depressing to live in solitude, and to think you'd live like this forever, the future feels grey and rigid. I wish I could fine certainty and peace of mind but at the moment I can only hope.",16Oct2019,2
303,"Ok I’m a 20 y/o guy and there’s this girl who’s not getting any hints who’s been talking to me for awhile, from the very beginning I’ve tried to make it clear I don’t see myself in any relationships anytime soon, I’ve known her for a bit and I’ve been friends with her friends even longer, so ghosting or telling them flat out would result in a lot of problems in my social life. This girl really isn’t my type, along with the fact she’s very cold hearted, and makes a lot of offensive jokes, she acts very childish and has handled multiples situations poorly.

311,"
I meet this amazing guy on Bumble over a month ago. We messaged, texted, and talked on the phone for hours for about two and a half weeks straight from the moment we woke up all the way until as late as 1 or 2 in the morning. Sometimes even longer. We had our first date towards the end of September and it was by far the best date I’ve ever gone on. We talked about how we where both looking for serious relationships and that neither of us are looking for just a hook up. All the right signs. 

I’ve never felt so lucky to have met someone before. He has already told his family a lot about me and he has even spoken to his mother about be as well. I actually got to meet one of his sisters when he took me to a concert for one of dates. Everything has been going well - That is: Until this past Sunday. This Sunday, we decided to have a dinner and movie date at his place. I went over to his apartment and one of his roommates was there (We had already met and he is extremely cool!) as well as his roommate’s sister. 

We all sat down and had dinner together and joked around. I talked to his roommate’s sister and she ended up asking for my social media information. We all ended up following each other on social media. The guy I’ve been seeing followed me and I decided that later on I would sneak a peak at his profile. When I got back home and I went to his profile, my heart instantly sank. 

Half of the pictures on his Instagram account are of his ex girlfriend and of them together. The captions expressing how much he *loves* her. Curiosity got the best of me and I looked through his ex’s profile. Oddly enough, she has one or two photos of him still on her profile towards the very bottom but nothing else. I even went ahead and found his Facebook account and saw he still had a picture of his d on there as well. The red flags in my mind instantly starting popping up. They have been broken up for almost a year now, yet her photos are still on his profile. 

I’m not jealous since we just started seeing each other and I’m not trying to instantly jump into a relationship and I understand that everyone has a past. BUT I find it odd that you would still have pictures of your ex on your profile after a year and especially when the girl you’re seeing now starts following you on social media as well. I also noticed that even though he’s not as active on his social media account, he is very active on his ex’s social media account since he has liked all of her most recent photos. I feel uncomfortable, and to add more smoke to the pit - His roommate is also his ex-girlfriends brother. The girl I met at Sunday dinner was the other sister to his ex. 

So she is still a part of his life - even if not ‘directly’. I’m trying to be understanding since after all, they had been dating for 4 years before his ex had cheated on him but I still can’t really wrap my head around it: especially since I figure when someone cheats on you, you would want them as far out of your life as possible, which doesn’t seem to be the case here. I haven’t really spoken to him and we sent me a few messages and I left him on read. I finally answered him today and made up an excuse that I had been studying. We talked a little bit here and there, until I finally decided to ask the question that had been pulling at me for the past 48 hours. I asked him if he still had feelings for his ex and he responded by saying: 

“That’s a complicated question lol but I think I will always love her but I don’t want to be with her and we won’t be back together bc she is a different person and I’m okay with us going separate ways but part of me will always still love her but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to love another person someday and it just takes time to heal.”  

I can’t help that something still rubs me the wrong way. Am I over thinking things? Should I just go ahead and end things with him now before I get any deeper into this or am I just worried for nothing? I keep getting the impression that he really is still in love with his ex, since it took him over an hour to reply. I do admit I will be sad if I do go ahead and end things with him, but I feel like for my own well being that maybe this isn’t right and maybe I’m not just creating red flags in my mind. But I rather not get hurt down the line. 

Any advice? Thoughts?",16Oct2019,2
313,"My mother, a couple months ago, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is living in another country, so it's not very easy for me to get to her. She recently had surgery, but I was unable to go, since I wasn't able to get my passport book in time.
Fast forward to yesterday, when she told me she's having her quimo therapy, and she's going to need help, since she's going to be bedridden for a while.
I immediately started looking for flights, and found one in my price range that was a round trip. It was on the 23rd of this month, and the flight back is on the 20th of November. 
Once I saw this, I called my manager, and told her what was going on. I told her that I was going to need a month off, and she told me that she understands, and she told me everything is fine, work-wise, so I then bought the tickets right afterwards. 
Today when I got to work, she pulled me aside, and told me that she is only able to give me two weeks off, and if I need more time, I'd have to resign. She said that she may rehire me once I return, but nothing is for sure, since we're fully staffed, and if I leave, they would get someone else to fill my spot. Tomorrow I'm supposed to bring in my note of resignation. I enjoy my job, and don't want to leave it. I just need to see my mother.

She told me that I had the time off, so I bought the tickets, and now she's telling me that I can only have 2 weeks off, and if I need more, I have to resign. I'm not sure what to to. The flight is next Wednesday, and I am not able to refund my tickets.",16Oct2019,1

Junior year I decided to join once more. I was really nervous but I did it and it was pretty fun. The program was substantially not as good as the last one and I found myself bonding and enjoying myself a lot more. I also did not finish the season though, this because I would get extremely anxious before a match so I would make an excuse and leave early. This same problem happened to me occasionally in some track races. 

Now it’s my senior year, I love fighting and working out and training for a goal. Sadly, even thinking about wrestling somebody else puts my stomach in some intense knots. I also work and would have to quit if I do decide to dedicate myself to the sport. If you have any questions I’m happy to answer.",16Oct2019,1
315,"I am in my first semester of junior year at college. I currently take five classes and am on track to graduate on time. I have always had a bit of trouble with motivation, but this semester I have had absolutely no will to attend class. I try with my other ones, but this one ceramics class that starts at 5 pm I keep skipping. I think at this point, I’ve missed like four classes in a row. At this point, it’s clear I should just drop the class. 

Problem is, I feel so shitty about it. If I tried harder, if I remembered this, that, etc. I just cannot get my ass up and off the couch to go. I am struggling with grades in other classes and feel like I’m wasting my time with pottery, but I can’t help but feel like I’m a loser because I can’t even go make pots for two hours, which is so easy. But at the same time, I just don’t have the will to do it.

316,"Hi all, not sure what to do.
I have a partner who I love very much. They are funny and thoughtful and arguably the most attractive person I have ever come across, most of the time they are the most amazing person, I’ve never loved anyone so much. We currently live together, he works a high intensity job but has weekend off, I’m at uni 9-5 every day, and I work Saturday and Sunday.

But they have this side where they can be shouty, and sometimes come across aggressively. They shout at me whenever I do something wrong (mainly accidents) for example I burnt their dinner (I have to do all the household chores and cooking at the minute as they’ve started an intense job, which alone is causing a lot of problems) they went away for a weekend and asked me to do their laundry, while both my parents were sick so I went home to help them and I forgot the laundry, partner woke me up on the Monday shouting at me, made me get out of bed and sort it. This is one example of many, they once tried to stop me from leaving to go to my mums, and blocked me into the room, when I got out they sat on my car so I couldn’t go anywhere, and when I did eventually drive off smacked my rear view mirror so hard it folded in on itself. He once followed me all the way to my friends house after I begged him to leave me alone bc he was being intimidating and I was going to get mad. He also has smacked walls, my dashboard, doors really hard (but probably less than 5 times) I’ve explained I had an adverse childhood, witnessing a lot of domestic abuse, fighting, shouting and screaming, and that when they carry off like this it brings up a lot of trauma.

They have gotten better, they’ve stopped standing in the door so I can leave to go to my mums, and they’ve not smacked the walls etc in a long time, but the shouting and saying things I’ve done are disgusting and/or dumb persist. A few days ago I spent 2 hours crying after they shouted at me and shouted disgusting (not sure if at me or the state of their hairbrush after I borrowed it, they hate my hair in it) 

They says it’s because of their stressful job, they’ve never experienced anything stressful before and they’ve never been like this, they come from a lovely family who never raise their voices, with the most patient, calm, laid back parents, and no traumatic events to happen to them in their childhood. So I’m not sure where this comes from. He says his job will calm down soon and he is convinced it will stop. I myself am working hard,  I’m at uni or work 7 days a week, and quite stressed but I’ve never raised my voice at him. As I said I love him so much, this is the man I want to marry and have kids with, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea anymore. I’m staying at my mums a few days to figure out where to go from here

317,"For the last four years, I have worked pretty much alone on my laptop as a freelance writer. I am getting depressed lately when thinking about all the young professionals who have normal office jobs and colleagues they socialize with all the time.

In terms of my background, I got a degree from a reputable university in actuarial science when I was 23. I didn't particularly enjoy the degree or the college experience in general but I continued studying because I didn't really know what else to do with myself. 

I went travelling alone for 6 weeks in Southeast Asia when I was 23 and then I found an office job in January 2014. I worked at that job for a year. Some aspects of it were nice; I enjoyed nights out after work and being around people to a certain point.

However, I didn't enjoy the actual work. It also started to grate at my self-esteem that I was retreating into my shell after 6 months working there. I began to eat at my desk and kind of isolate myself. I was also exhausted every evening from commuting 1 hour each way to work and being in a confined space with people every day. 

My contract ended in January 2015. I then went to Australia on a working holiday visa. I was in the throes of social anxiety at this point, but I was kind of trying to do things in spite of that anxiety. I guess I was also escaping my problems, or trying to anyway. 

I found work on a farm for a couple months in Australia. I enjoyed the physicality of it and the being outdoors. I liked the feeling at the end of each day; I felt like I worked hard. The end of day beers went down very well too. 

Eventually, it got too hot on the farm and I was hired as a sales assistant in a supermarket dairy section. I did that for around six weeks or so. But I wasn't making any friends; I was too socially anxious and I lived in a super sociable backpacker hostel with lots of loud Italian and French guys, which intimidated me. 

When I arrived back from Australia having only spent like 4 months out of a planned 12 there, I decided to try work as a freelance writer. This was despite the fact I had zero writing experience.

Since late 2015, the story of my career has been me working alone on my laptop writing and editing. Sometimes I work from home. Other times I work from cafes. The nature of my work has enabled me to live for 6 months each year in Thailand since 2016.

But my earnings are paltry; just enough to survive really and have a few luxuries like going out drinking once per week and taking some trips abroad each year. 

I am not on the corporate ladder like most late twentysomethings. In fact, most late twentysomethings are likely quite advanced now in their earnings and career progression. 

I don't have any colleagues. Co-working spaces are expensive. I feel like the world's biggest loser. I know I've got to live in thailand and stuff but that pales in comparison with the majority of people who work around colleagues they like each day. 

I still see pics of ex-colleagues on social media and they are going to each others' weddings, taking trips abroad etc. I have none of that.

It was the worst 8 weeks of my life and my experience still haunts me every day. I stayed out of hospitals and pretended to get better out of fear I would be forced to go back.

It’s been almost 2 years and I’m mental hospital free but I somehow feel worse. My diet has gone to trash, I hallucinate daily, am very paranoid, think I have DID, and yet I don’t feel anything. I am failing ever subject in school and my attendance is awful. 

I can see my life all falling apart yet I just sit and watch. I know I’m failing school and this is seriously affecting my future, but I just don’t do anything about it.

322,"Throwaway account because of obvious reasons. 

My relationship with my coworkers are quite superficial. We sometimes hang out on Fridays after work and seldom have lunch together. As I don't really hang out with them during lunch and also very bad at socializing, I'm always out of the loop and treated as an outsider most of the time. 

So one of them are having a birthday party next Sunday and he invited most of us to attend. I'm still hesitating to attend as his house is situated in the other side of the city and is almost a 50mins drive away from my house. With me not knowing how to drive, I would have to either take an Uber or take a two hour public transport to his place. 

On top of that, one of the people (let's called her A) who got invited suggested to pool a fund and purchase him a gift together. We all agreed on it. However, when she told me the amount that each of us have to pay yesterday , I was a bit suprised of the amount. Even though the amount wasn't really high, it was still a lot , considering how many people were sharing. When I asked her why was the amount that figure, she literally just replied it's okay, you can buy it your own. What can I reply to that? I was just simply asking why, she should have just answered back by what did she buy with that amount, instead of telling me to buy it myself.

325,"Honestly I'm 18, he's 20. Been together 2 years long distance, and we have a really deep connection. At least, I believe so. But I love him. 

I have this fear that keeps coming back, and I think it stems a lot from childhood because my mom and dad chose drugs over me, leaving me at the hands of fate with possible foster care. But luckily my grandparents stepped in, and adopted me before any of that happened. I was only an infant, but while I was in my mother's care I apparently almost died from neglect.  

But this is my first serious relationship, and I had no idea this fear was driving most of our ""fights"" (even though really it was just me freaking out at him and him not understanding what he did) until recently when I started re evaluating my behavior. 

I realized I'm scared he's going to leave. Like, one day he'll just up and decide I'm no longer good enough and that he'll drop everything and leave. That he'll suddenly realize I'm not who he thinks I am, that I've been lying, that I'm actually crazy or something and just metaphorically pack his bags and ghost with little warning. 

The fear always comes back over things like him not texting back within a certain timeframe. Or if I think he's upset, or ""seems"" like he's acting different (which he's really not, just me interpreting things that way) and when it comes back it makes me feel like I want to die. It's really complicated and I'm kinda scared that by telling him... I'm opening myself up to the possibility of him actually leaving because then I'm *actually* crazy, if that makes sense.

I (m, 29) just moved to a flat share aparment with 4 other random people, I didn't knew before. 

For the past 2 weeks I've started eating dinner with one of my roommates. After we are done eating, we just sit there and talk for an hour or even longer.

And now I'm at this point where our dinner really makes my day and I'm really looking forward to talking to her. 

Don't get me wrong I don't intend to ask her out, because I'm not that into her to compromise our current relationship, after all she is my roommate. 

She recently said to me she wanted to go to see a movie because she hasn't done this for a long time.  I'd really like to go with her. Not just because I like spending time with her, I also don't know anyone else in town and my other roommates don't have much time and I don't connect to them this much.

But I'm a little afraid that she gets the wrong impression if I just ask her to spent more time together.

Hello,
To explain this I have to give some context. Last year I was in a CTE class with a different teacher. generally, we didn’t do much in this class and joked around with the teacher and just chilled out. 

This year, I decided to take the next level of that CTE class but the old teacher we had left and we got a new one. This class is like roughly 15/16 people ish and to be honest, it’s kind of a mess. The class is mixed, she doesn’t seem to know what she’s doing with it and just gives us random things to do and splits up our class. Along with that, she’s starting to enforce us to join the club for that class which is completely optional but is heavily insisting we do it, almost for a grade, and it’s $25 on top of that. 

Now, coming from the first class last year which was just a goofy teacher and chill class to this second level class this year with a different teacher that doesn’t know really what to do and is just mixed on things, me and my friends always joked around talking about the old teacher and how the class was just fun, which when we mention our old teacher to our current teacher, she gets pretty uncomfortable and kind of mad. 

Today, she was talking about how much money the program/class started with to build on (the class is like a student store for context) which was like roughly $2K. I made a comment saying “Our last year teacher worked pretty hard last year” just joking to my friends, because we didn’t expect it from how chill the class was. She overheard us, and she looked at me and just flipped me off, not like to my face but in my direction while looking at me, not saying anything. 

She didn’t seem mad while doing it, or didn’t say anything on top of it, just sort of did it. she was kind of smiling to, it was just very odd. But I saw it as a bit unprofessional, and kind of just stared back, as a couple of my friends noticed it as well. She didn’t say anything about it afterward and just approached our group normally talking about the assignment after that.

Now, I’m not really mad or anything, but I do see it as unprofessional, especially with a comment like that I made which really wasn’t mean to offend her. I told my parents about it, they think I should tell an admin, but I’m just sort of afraid she’ll get away with it after I tell an admin and like take me down for the rest of the year as I like told on her. Not only that, she also tries to force us into a club I’m not interested in, despite me saying that I was busy with other activities. 

Overall, I just don’t know what to do. I’m not mad but that class is really annoying me now, with just weird assignments, an odd teacher, and thinking that I could’ve signed up for a different class this year that would’ve helped me better in life. it’s sad from the last year class with a different teacher that I enjoyed. Should I tell an admin about this? Or am I just overthinking it and I should just not do much.",16Oct2019,1

I’m a woman that has constantly struggled with self esteem and how I see myself and even though this is his personal preference, I find myself personally attacked by it. He doesn’t do it intentionally and I’m aware of that, but it still hurts to think about.
Another is he admits he thinks I’m fat, but he likes it. He says that’s the biggest thing that attracts him to me, which as much as I know he thinks that’s a compliment, I just feel insulted whenever I hear it. Whenever he says he loves my body my brain says “he loves my fat” or “it’s because you’re just fat and gross and he loves it”, whenever he compliments me on an outfit I assume it’s because I look fat in it and so I change. I now wear outfits that he never compliments me on because I mustn’t look fat in them.
I’m aware I’ve probably taken this too personally for something that is an innocent preference but I can’t help but feel really hurt by it. 
Is there any way I can cope with this? I have tried talking to him but he tells me that I can lose weight and he’d still be attracted to me.

Fast forward to a year later...

***\[2017\]***  
We're still in the same Tutor Class and figured out that we have to stay in the same **Tutor Class** until we graduate. So we still kept talking but however, circumstances changed. I ended up not being in the same classes as her again (Excluding Tutor Class.) I ended up having feelings for this other girl named Claire (again another name that is relevant but has been changed due to security reasons.) So me and Claire tried to hit it off and start being friends. I became quite attached to Claire and we later find out that we both had a crush on one another. So this kinda blew up within our year group. I was suddenly on the spotlight and became a famous person along with Claire.

Meanwhile, Melanie stayed being just your average student, she didn't wanna join and be a part of the social hierarchy at school. I ended talking to Melanie on the bus around June, I asked her for some advice about what I should do since I liked Claire, well Melanie gave me some advice but however I didn't know that she \*might have liked me too (Take it with a grain of salt.) The more I mentioned to Melanie about Claire, I guess she began to be annoyed and disinterested. I couldn't take a hint because I was infatuated with my love for Claire.

I went to a School Zoo Trip and Melanie was there, she didn't want to talk to me for some odd reason.

Again I went to a School Movie Trip and Melanie wasn't there but I got into a bit of a conundrum with Claire wanting to sit next to me at the movies. Melanie heard about this.

Sadly, me and Claire never really got far in attempting to get our friendship to the next level...  We both knew that we had to go separate ways in terms of subject choices etc. (Btw Claire and I are still good friends to this day.)

* I didn't really notice that perhaps Melanie was trying to get my attention.

***\[2018\]***  
Still in the same **Tutor Class**, except we just got some newbies because there was some reconsideration of merging other Tutor Classes with other Tutor Classes. By this time I had just realized that I really missed out on the fact that Melanie was trying to get my attention but I was busy focusing on someone else. I tried to re-establish the friendship with Melanie, we're on and off and all that. Then I had mustered the courage to finally tell her that I liked her and she just said that she was flattered and it really got silent for the next 5 mins of the conversation. (Probably the longest time of my life.)

We drifted away and never spoke for quite a while.

***\[2019\]***  
Again still in the same **Tutor Class**, except we just got some newbies because there was some reconsideration of merging other Tutor Classes with other Tutor Classes. Keeping in mind about what happened the year before, I asked Melanie if we can start over, with a clean slate, in terms of our friendship. She agreed. And so we started again... It was plain sailing for about 3 months and then I really got serious about my feelings and told her that it was true, that I was being genuine about it. So to be sincere I even wrote a letter about how I really liked her and such... She read it, I don't know whether she still has it... But within a week of that I was mobbed by her friends and we're protecting her as if I was doing something (or did something previously.) I didn't understand what was with the aggression. Towards me, I didn't do anything wrong and didn't deserve any of it. And then they started framing me for being a stalker when I have never stalked Melanie ever. I've always been a book worm and an art fanatic and stays in class either drawing or reading into a good book during recess.

I managed to talk to her one time about the situation and she brushed it off as if nothing happened I don't understand what or why or how it even happened. But she gave me an opportunity, to really come clean about every feeling I had for her. She listened. But she said that now she doesn't like me and that we're not friends even though she said that we were like 5 months ago.

I had just learned then that she was about to leave and I said farewell. She said goodbye too.

***\[May 2019\]***  
Only to learn that she isn't leaving and has lied about leaving.

***\[August 2019 - To Present Day\]***  
We don't talk at all, we pass by one another quite a few times, and we both act like neither of us exist to one another. I still catch her glancing at me when I'm not looking and sometimes I'm going to admit I do glance at her when she's not looking. I still have feelings for her but not as intense as at the beginning of this year. There's a side of me that isn't willing to let go but to keep on fighting.

Help please I don't know what to do. My friends have been pulling me towards different directions, but I still really do like Melanie. I can't decide though.",16Oct2019,0

350,"Hi all,
Long story short, this advice is not for me but for what to tell my friend. 

She's in a situation where her other half is depressed but won't admit it. 

She's had terrible luck in relationships and thought she'd finally found Mr Right with a new man. 

New man has a great job, absolutely adores her and they're very happy together. 

However, recently, he won't open up but frequently tells her how happy he is and how he's looking forward to the future. 

Last night, she got a text from a friend of his. The text details how Mr Right is showing signs of depression and doesn't ""see the point in living anymore"". 

What does she do now? 
He won't talk about it. 
She hasn't confronted him about the texts yet, but should she? 
If she confronts him about the texts, how will that make Mr Right feel? The one person he could talk to, betrayed him. 

I'm leaning towards confrontation, but in a safe loving way, as I feel the possibility of depression far outweighs any fleeting feelings of betrayal, especially for his own good. 

What do you think?",16Oct2019,1

355,"Okay. So I rent a basement. I have a lease and everything.  First and foremost however in the development I live in,no one is allowed to rent out basements. It's supposed to be family homes. 

When I first moved in here I was told that I would be allowed to park in the drive way. And that I did  all the time, until the landlord decided to move ANOTHER person (which is some chick he bangs and she pays no rent). I must also mention prior to me living here there is also two people that were here before me living here.

So, there was just enough room for parking until this lady came here. I now have had to park on the side of the road since then, which I didn't care about until a week ago when I decided to buy a new car. 

Here's what's fucked up. They still are making me park my new car on the side of the road AND I just read in my lease that the landlord is no responsible for any damage to any of my personal property. So that means if someone comes around this turn and slams into my car, its my problem!

Here's what's even more fucked up. The landlord has a 2 car garage, and a 4 car driveway. In the garage he has a banged up car, which he never ever drives (he only works once a week), then in the other half of the garage is a bunch of crap. In the driveway we have the lady hes screwings truck, which she never drives, then you have the two other people who park in the drive way (ones an old lady, one only lives here at night and gets up bright and early and goes to work. 

Then in the last parking spot in the drive way you have his little beat up truck, that is what him and the lady use all the time. 

The MOST screwed up thing out of all of this? I pay more than anybody else who lives here. 

HERE IS THE ADVICE I NEED. I'm going to present an argument. If he kicks me out idgaf I'm already looking to move. In his very own lease he gave me, it states that all vehicles must be parked in the drive way in an orderly fashion. 

I'm going to argue that he is putting me and my vehicle at risk by forcing me to park on the side of the road, and that his own lease states that I must park in the drive way, so by default, he HAS to let me park in the drive way.

Did I mention this neighborhood has a rule where NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO PARK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD! They have signs up with a number to call to rat people out for it. They will come and tow you away. 

Do I have a valid point for concern? Should I just bail and report him to the HOA?

Hes a really rude guy. He drinks like a fish from sun up till sun down. He included internet in my rent but it doesnt even work, I had to end up buying my own internet. He forgot about fixing it for me literally every time I mention it he acts clueless. 

The other day when I got my new car, I was so excited. I just had to park in the driveway I didn't wanna get my tires muddy. So I did. I left a note upstairs next to my keys saying if you need to move it you can, or just bang on my door.

I talked to the landlord about the note the next morning, he said oh it's fine no big deal. Literally a week later he comes in from work in a bad mood and is like ""what was that piece of paper on my table, that paper I could hardly read because of who wrote it?"".

He belittles people. He puts them down. He hardly fucks with me to be honest because he knows me or my girlfriend will go off on him. When we first moved in washing 3 loads a week set that man off big time until I finally was basically like yeah what are you gonna do about it dude and he stopped. 

I just need to vent and seek advice is all.

357,"Hi, my mum has been dating this man for 7 years, around 2015/2016 he started to act very inappropriate toward me, I was only 18 at the time and was often left alone with him, which is when he would do these things. It never ended up getting to anything extremely serious like assault or r*pe, but it was still uncomfortable. For example, Id be washing my plate up and he'd come up behind me and push up against me, wrap his arms around me and rub my sides and stomach and rub very close to my bum too, when he'd push up against me it was often so close that I'd feel his penis against my bottom too and it was awful. He'd talk is this very low voice and I guess tried to sound seductive? That's the only way I can describe it, and I felt so uncomfortable in my own home that I ended up staying in my room if my mum went out or just went to bed for a few hours. One of the last things he did was ask me to make him a coffee, so I did, and as I brought it over to him I had to bend down to put on the surface he was using and he looked down my shirt and said ""very nice"" and I just wanted to lock myself in my room and never leave again. I eventually told my mum and she made him move out, but he only moved about 10 mins away, and she was still seeing him romantically, he eventually moved back in (almost a year later) because he was having surgery and he's never left since, he apologised to me and kept saying he did those things to make me feel more confident with myself...... I certainly don't believe that. Anyway, he's stayed here ever since. To this day, I still feel uncomfortable, he hasn't tried anything anymore, but he and my mum are in a toxic relationship and he won't be sexual with her anymore and claims it is because of what happened with me and him, and that annoys me because he wasn't the victim, I was, I hate that he used that with her. I also feel hurt because he and my mum argue all the time, and he said something to her about ratting her out that he has been living here without being on anything (bills, rent, all that stuff, he is lodging) and she said that's unforgivable, and whilst I understand how that is, surely what he did to her own daughter should've been too, and when that situation gets brought up she will lowkey blame me and say ""well, you used to wear shorts all the time"" or ""you would always bend over and ppl could see down your shirt"" and it hurts me. Anyway, this ""unforgivable"" talk has made me want to write this because I still feel uncomfortable, I never wanted him back here but I didn't feel I had a choice, and everyone now acts like it wasn't a big deal, and I guess it shows to me how my mum really felt about it and feels about it?

However, for quite some time now, maybe even two or three years, Claire’s been struggling with mental health issues. I don’t pry-I remember her saying that she didn’t want to discuss it through mail, and to discuss this depressing topic some other time.  

What I really want to do? I want to give her a hug, tell her everything’s going to be okay, and everything does become okay for her. But I know that’s an unrealistic scenario for now, so it’s only something I can hope for. 

So, how does her health issues affect her? She sometimes skips class, for a week as well, is often tired, often doesn’t have the energy to do her hobbies. Her mind keeps her trapped. I don’t know too much about depression etc..., and I only know what she tells me, but what I do know is that I desperately want to help her, comfort her in any way I can.

To make a long story short, two of my friends (Bill and Clive) dated for a while but split up on very messy terms. Bill developed a hatred for Clive, vowing to never have anything to do with them ever again. I fully respect this decision, however here is the main problem. Clive was given an item that means a LOT to them. By a lot, I mean a LOT. Clive gave Bill this item before they split (by “gave” I do not mean Clive transferred ownership of the item to Bill -&gt; it is comparable to letting your SO wear your hoodie), but after the split Bill decided to keep the item to show rebellion against Clive. I disagree with this decision. The item, in my opinion, belongs to Clive whether Bill likes it or not. Clive has asked Bill many times for the item back, literally begging for it, but Bill refuses to give it to them. Now here’s where I play a part. I am the only person who has the ability to possibly convince Bill to give the item back to Clive, which Clive knows and has asked me to talk to Bill about. While I fully believe that the item belongs to Clive, I don’t want to cause a rift in my friendship with Bill (as it may seem I am siding with Clive). I have been thinking about this for the past month and I really do want Clive to get this item back, especially knowing that Clive will never get it back if only they ask for it, and my god it means so much to them.

I dated someone in my class. She seemed to have issues around intimacy, would distance herself whenever we got close, then she’d gradually come back. Because of this, my mindset has been operating in this on/off way for two years - she’d always come back, so I never really viewed anything she did as ‘final’, if that makes sense.

Went back to uni last couple of weeks and saw her. She didn’t speak to me, but she’s done that before after break ups so I thought that there may have been a chance of speaking at least. 

I messaged her, and straight away she blocked me. I only said “hey, how are you?” And I was blocked. I feel hurt because she’s acting as if I hurt her, I didn’t. She knows she is the person responsible for all of this.

I don't know if I'm just overthinking things or not. 
I'm just in a position where I'm extremely uncomfortable and low-key kinda scared of him.

I am a bit of a class clown and enjoy impersonations and am a bit of a goofball, but would never mock anyone or be racist. The accusation of racism hurt me because I am so far from it.

387,"I recently moved to a different state and was having a hard time finding a job. I finally landed one as a front desk receptionist. The tasks are doable but my boss and work protocal complicates the position. 

Not only does my boss micromanage our tasks (she has cameras everywhere. She screenshots us and sends us messages in the group chat about what we're doing wrong), she treats us like dirt. She is very sarcastic, impatient, and makes rude comments towards us. My boss also requires that at least two people greet her in the parking lot (to help w/ her bags) everyday while a third person holds the door open for her. I was instructed to never speak to her unless she speaks to me.

At first I was not bothered by her behavior but the more time I spend there, the more anxious I feel.  When she speaks to me I feel inadequate and useless. On top of that, the protocal of the office literally changes everday.

I won't go into details about the protocols but everyday the front desk team is reprimanded for not doing something that was non-existent the day before. We are always in trouble. 

I thought I could wait out my 90-day period but I plan on quitting soon. The pay isn't that great either. The firm is aware of how many people come and go so the payrate is a bit above minimum wage. The idea is after 90 days if the boss sees that you're doing great, she will bump up your pay ( I was told ""your raise depends on you,"" meaning the raise amount is unknown). I don't think the pay is worth the stress of working there.

394,"What are some good jobs (pay) with really minimal human interaction? I got a job at a call centre while on break from uni recently, and although it's not like I can't stand it, it's not permanent and  I would rather do something else with the rest of my life and I've come to realise that not interacting with people constantly is probably a very big positive.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even hate people, I actually like people. I take extra care when dealing with people who call about safety guide related things because I sincerely don't want them to hurt themselves, I feel really nice when middle aged women calling are nice to me and gushingly tell me about their kids or something (melts my heart, I dunno why) and men, who don't enjoy talking to random people about their lives nearly as much as women, are honest but polite about the impatience and desire to get off the phone they almost universally experience when being called by some asshole randomly  (I would do the same in their position so I enjoy relating to them and hanging up as swiftly and courteously as possible). I don't think of myself as a terribly servile person but I do enjoy being in situations that are in some way positive on both ends. My coworkers' niceness towards me, which I'm 99% sure is feigned, is still something I appreciate and I hope there is a nugget of genuineness in there. 

However, it is all incredibly tiring. Whenever I am speaking to a person or am even in the room with another person and they're watching me, at work or at home (except work adds 8 hours a day of this), I feel like they're busting my balls. People observing me makes me feel tenser and I start doing everything manually like I have to carefully observe my behaviour. I want to be observed by and interact with people at little as possible, I absolutely detest how tired even mild amounts of it makes me. I have no real enemies but also no real life friends, and I have a nasty habit of literally never messaging my online friends first even though I really like them (which makes them message me once a month and have a chat I enjoy but that also makes me feel tense and tired). Conversations feel like games of volleyball, and I have dyspraxia. 

I'm not a fake person who adjusts my behaviour a great deal when interacting with others and feels the need to act, I am for the most part pretty sincere (the only act I put up is being less retarded than I actually am, and I'm probably too retarded to do that as thoroughly as I think I do). The one time I remember not being sincere was during training where another new hire asked me what I did with my time, and because shitposting on imageboards and forums along with playing paradox games are not socially acceptable explanations for why I seem so boring I told him I played CSGO, which he noted he couldn't bring himself to enjoy the repetitiveness of, most likely cementing in his mind that I am boring in a roundabout way with a conclusion that still isn't wrong. Being new there I am rather awkward and I'd imagine a few people think I am a piece of shit dumb retard to some extent, but none of them try to fuck me over or aggressively talk shit about me behind my back so I don't think I am that contemptible. Two of the supervisors were calling somebody a retard in a conversation in front of me and I thought it was me for half a second but it was obviously somebody else. I try to spend a lot of my breaks in the bathroom on purpose, but it was only ever commented on by the new hire that asked me what I did with my time on the first day. I actually like a lot of these people no matter how insincere the personas they present to me actually are, but if I had the choice I would never been seen by or speak to another one of them ever again. I don't even think I'd appreciate talking to my parents more than weekly or monthly because they are loud and me being emotionally invested in the fact that they exist because they are my parents makes the encounters with them very tiring as well. Even speaking to strangers on public transport (takes about as long as you'd expect, for getting up from seats and such) is very tiring because I end up spending a long time afterwards mulling over the encounter and their facial expression towards me.

1. It's our last year of school and we finish in 3 days
2. I have no excuse to interact in a one on one basis (obviously I can just talk to her, but I don't have any way have frequent interactions without it seeming forced.)

398,"Some backstory
This girl who I am friends with, let's call her Sophia, recently came to my school. Although she can sometimes be a jerk she is usually nice. I am also friends with another girl (Georgia).

Using an app called Tellonym Sophia supposedly sent anonymous hate messages to Georgia. In a private instagram message, Georgia told me this. I said my friend Sophia was acting like a immature f**k to Georgia. I later realised I got the situation wrong and Georgia had actually been bullying Sophia for a while. I apologised to Sophia and told her what I had said. She accepted my apology and understood where I was coming from. However she was already going to the school principal with her mum to stop Georgia. Somehow my text ended up with the principal as well and I now think he believes I was bullying Sophia as well. Even though I misunderstood a situation, I still swore at her behind her back. I am expecting to be called to his office tomorrow.

I am still in Year 7 and am super stressed out as my parents hate me getting in trouble and expect A's for every subject I take which has led up to an intense amount of pressure on me. I really don't want to disappoint my parents and hate getting in trouble. What can I do to best manage this situation and reduce my stress?

399,"So... I basically cried in front of my manager at work last night. 

To preface this, I'd already had a really stressful day at university. I had loads of deadlines and I missed an important feedback session because I got lost and couldn't find the right room (which was also really embarrassing...). Then on my way to work my dad phoned me to tell me he'd had to call an ambulance for my mum that morning and she was in hospital. He told me not to worry and she was okay now, but I turned up to work freaking out.

Because of all this, I was really distracted and off my game at work. I decided to just tell my manager what had happened so he didn't think I was acting weird or being rubbish at my job. I didn't expect to get emotional at all - I hadn't had a chance to tell anyone about what had happened to my mum and I thought I'd also worry less if I got it off my chest - but halfway through my story I was suddenly about to burst into tears.

It was soooo awkward.... He seemed very confused/surprised that I was telling him this and suddenly getting really upset. I was equally as confused/surprised. He started asking me all these questions but I could feel my bottom lip wobbling and knew if I spoke I'd just start crying. There were also still customers around at this point. 

I think I recovered pretty quickly and did feel waaaay less stressed after I told him. He was also pretty nice about it and said I could take any phone-calls I needed and offered to make me tea. But I'm so embarrassed that it happened and keep having flashbacks of it. Does anybody have advice on how to move past this?

About three (3) years ago I just stopped talking to them and stopped letting them meddle in my life. So at 18 I moved in with my grandmother on my moms side. Lovely woman helped through a lot of stuff like college, first girlfriend (yes I know I was a late bloomer being 19 at the time) breakup. She even helped me decide to join the military when I was in my 20s. I spent many years growing up spending weeks with her during the summer. We had a good relationship. A few years ago she moved in with an uncle down in North Carolina because she had Alzheimer’s and dementia. I would send her cards on her birthday and Christmas. So I was having some thoughts about grandma in the last few weeks and tried getting in touch. Well my family wouldn’t respond and with a little internet search I found out she passed away this year and they had a huge family gathering that I was not informed or invited to. And I was only 12 hours away during that time. 
The more I think about this the angrier I get because not a single person in my family even the extended family thought I was worth even informing about this.

Although i know it is completely illegal and unethical, i believe that it was a very important time of my life that demonstrated my entrepreneurship, passion to learn new skills, and innovation (I created my own cost-effective techniques to create better quality cards for less). I would like to talk about it in my college essays but obviously i cannot reference it explicitly, how do you think i should go about talking about it?

Around 24 hours ago I got circumsized because of phimosis. After a long day from excruciating pain and finally getting the gauze off, my foreskin is retracted back, bruised and totally swollen. The color of the head is light pink and white/ light yellowish in some areas. The head is also very very very much sensitive, like an eyeball is, I couldnt sleep and I was holding my penis the whole night so it doesnt touch anywhere. I can't even put water on it. Lastly, the area of the foreskin that is facing my body is just a bit UP of where the head ends and it is attached to it tightly causing severe pain also.

They definitely saw a look on my face and the Spanish guy said that they grew up in the hood in Queens and that's just ""the street talk"" and ""they're all ghetto"". I got even more confused. Because even if I call him out and he'll stop using it in front of me - it's so accepted and heavily encouraged in his friends circle, (like the black guys call him that and he says it back, and I'm just there like WHAT) that I doubt he'll remove it 100%, which also puts me in the awkward position - now it feels like I'm being offended ""on behalf"" of black people, but his black friends are not only not offended, but also actively encourage it...... is it even my place to ""check him""?

Before I tell you about the 3rd time, which is the most shocking to me, let me tell you about our relationship - it's great. Mature and very healthy. We talk about EVERYTHING, if one of us does something dumb - we talk about it, take responsibility and work on fixing it. We've been together for a while, and he's been nothing but sweet, caring, supportive, loyal, respectful and he genuinely loves me (I do too obviously). He wants to start a family and we were talking about getting married and maybe having a baby in 2-3 years. 


And then I met his 28 y/o sister and 21 y/o brother 3 days ago (all obviously white). He refers to his brother as ""my n***a"" and his brother does too. His sister also calls them that. I just kept giving them looks, and didn't say anything because schooling his family, all 3 of them, on the first day I met them felt.... I dont even know what word to use. I was kinda scared to say something. And again - confused as hell.

Now this kinda reached critical level and I'm definitely don't want my future children to be exposed to racist attitudes in the family and to be raised by people who feel like they get a pass for using racial slurs, because they're from Queens. 

Now I feel like I'm losing my marbles. Is everyone around me ignorant  or am I being a SJW and it's not my place to check him? (And apparently his family and friend circle). Since I'm also not from USA and immigrated here from a place where racism is not an issue (because everyone is white) - am I not getting something?",16Oct2019,2

428,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting here. I wasn't sure where best to post but from the posts I've seen on here in the past there seems to be a lot of support in this subreddit so here goes.

I (M23) have just moved into my first property with my long-term partner (F22). Her family have been incredibly supportive whereas mine have been notably more reserved - especially my father (F57). My partner and I took my family out for dinner to tell them of our exciting news (that we had found a place to move in to) and since then he has been frankly horrible to both of us, so much so that I am now starting to cut him out of my life. I won't go into his behaviour but suffice to say he has driven me to therapy through his mental abuse, and has had plenty of chances to make amends but has rejected all of them.

The problem I am posting about is that he owns my car. A few years ago (before I met my partner) I was working for his company and received a company car. I eventually moved on to another job but I kept working for him at weekends so that I could keep the company car. Fast forward to now and he still owns the car. Due to the financial depreciation I believe there is another 3 years before the car has zero value where I could effectively buy it off of him for a cost of zero.

I think the advice that I'm looking for is basically whether I should suck it up and pay the larger payment now to buy the car off of him, or risk him continuing to own the car whilst I wait for it to depreciate. Alternatively I could also hand in my notice to his company and just try and find an affordable car of my own. I'm quite lost and confused at the moment so I would be very grateful for any and all advice. Thank you.",16Oct2019,2

436,"So this summer, I officially moved into my first apartment with a roommate. Although we moved all our stuff to the apartment in June, we didn't start living there until August due to us both being college students and needing to go home to work during the summer. Apparently, August is when the ""problem"" began... 

When we moved in, I brought everything, including the medical devices that are used to treat my illness. One is a chest percussion therapy tool while the other is a small air compressor. Of course, these are the devices that the super has a problem with due to them being ""too noisy at night"". These devices are done while I sit on my bed, with the door closed and lifted off the hard wood floors. The air compressor sits on my nightstand, which is also made out of wood. Now that we got the background out of the way, we can move on to the story. 

So the Super comes up to the apartment one morning in early September, complaining about a strange noise coming from my roommate's room at night. I think it's his chair because he's a late night gamer and plays on an old, crusty chair. I say I'll fix it and boom no problems for a month. I thought it was over, but I was wrong. 

Two days ago, at 11 pm while I was doing my medical stuff using all the machines and such, the power in the apartment just completely goes dead. There's no storm, no real reason for it to go out in a NYC apartment. It comes back on 5 minutes later and my roommate and I don't think anything about it. Then the next morning the hot water is off... once again we dont think anything of it. Then again, the Super  comes up in the early afternoon this time to tell us to quite down again and says he'll redirect the power again if we don't stop, citing his kids as being unable to sleep due to the loud noises. He complains about both a chair and a machine this time. We promise to look into it and put a rug down below my roommate chair. Then at 10:30, I'm in my room doing my treatments again and low and behold, the power is shut off again. And then I go back to doing my treatments when it gets turned on five minutes later and then it gets shut off for ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. Fast Forward to this morning and the shower is literally ice cold after being on high for 5 minutes and unable to reach a hot temperature. 

Basically, what I'm asking here is for advice on what I should do. The Super is trying to not let me do my treatments by literally turning off power and water to make a point. It's making me feel isolated and bad while also hurting my roommate. Anything you got is appreciated.",16Oct2019,1

440,"Hi Reddit.

So i have this friend and i love talking to her. We're on opposite sides of the country so our contact is largely via messenger and dms with us only seeing each other irl once a year. Thing is she has depression and when she's going through bad phases of it she becomes really snippy and short. I will send her memes (which we love sharing to each other normally) to try and cheer her up and end up getting replies like 'I don't like that' or 'why are you sending me this.' If she's going through a bad bout of depression and I tell her something bad that's going on in my own life, I get told to ""do something about it then."" Just overall a very dismissive, I-dont-care-stfu attitude. It oddly becomes a one way street where she will actively message me first and engage in those conversations, but the moment I bring up another topic or message first it's like I've done something wrong and I just get dismissive answers like 'So?'.

I get depression. I have it too. But I don't think it's fair for her to suddenly be rude and then when she's fine, act as if she wasn't just completely rude to me a day ago.

They all said I looked perfect though. After asking a second time, my husband told me to please stop picking myself apart because it would ruin the memories for him. So I stopped. I eventually convinced myself I looked fine. -

446,"I was sitting in my finance class minding my own business. Sometimes my classmates engage in class discussions and for the  most part I enjoy them, they usually talk about interesting topics and share a lot of jokes which I find myself laughing a lot at. Overall I usually enjoy the atmosphere of my finance class. Well until today, a guy from another class was walking out and we could see him through the door window and a class mate said ‘he walks bare straight;(bare is British slang for a lot). I didn’t think anything much of this comment as my school consisted of  typically judgmental and close minded people so gay jokes are expected. Although I didn’t find that joke funny,  my humour generally is pretty dark and offensive and I’ve been told that I go to far sometimes however my intense humour does not reflect my views and opinions AT ALL. (Jus to put that out there). And my humour is only shown with my close friends because they would already know this.

Anyways, after that comment was said a girl said ‘gays are disgusting, they all need to get beaten up. Later almost every single classmate started pitching in with comments like 

‘Gays should die’
‘God didn’t make them that way’
‘Parents are too open that’s how people turn gay, (I can smell the ignorance and lack of education on that comment)
‘If my son was gay I would murder him’
‘Stab all the gays’

I was completely stunned and shocked, I genuinely didn’t know how to react. What made things even worse was the weakminded, timid ass teacher that was afraid of disagreeing with a bunch of 17 year olds. She said ‘I’m I uh agree with you guys and I’m glad you’re passionate but uh some..some are born gay . Right after she said that everyone exploded on her. Then the bell rang, as we were packing up ready to leave my classmate who I actually talk too a lot, took my pen, usually I’d step on his foot or laugh or do something as playful but I just yelled at him and told him to give me my fucking pen back, everybody was really confused and kinda realised that this class discussion wasn’t something I was very fond of. The few people kinda giggled and whispered while another classmate said ‘dude don’t take what they say seriously’ and I just nodded not saying anything. I was still so shocked, that people could be so rude and so uninformed about another group of people. I knew that if somebody was being racist or sexist they would pop off but for some reason homophobia is okay.

Anyway as the day went by that group of people started being really werid around me. I frankly couldn’t give a fuck, this is my last year with these people before I head off to college/ university next year to be away from this toxicity. (7 months left)

What if there was a classmate in that classroom who was struggling with their sexuality and to be told they deserve to die or be killed like I jus have no words. I can understand people can have uneducated views on certain things like gays being ‘ill’ but to flat out say that they deserve harm is so insane to me I’m still trying to process it.

- Me, I'm going through some phases, sometimes I feel shit, sometimes I feel less shit.
- I'm constantly surrounded by anger, if my sisters arent angry over something as little as food my mother would be angry for us not doing chores
- Even at school, for whatever reason, the teacher gets angry at one student and the whole class gets it
- I feel scared but I want to let it out and try to ""fix"" my family so I can go on with life and try to succeed in life
- I feel sorry for my youngest sister, he had never done anything wrong
- My sisters are so arrogant and prideful it hurts my mother.
- My other sister hardly ever goes out or contribute to the family but is the one that complains most




My mother isn't the one in the wrong here. It's my sisters and I but what do I do? I have the power to dominate and control over all my sisters (even if I'm the second youngest, but I have the loudest voice when I scream and strength(I think)) if I wanted to, but, what would happen next?

I was recently looking at job openings again for something close to home and saw they had the job I interviewed for open again.

450,"Pretty much every day at some point throughout it, my family gets into a problem about something meaningless which always results into an out of control heated argument. All the issues regarding with the arguments source from my stepfather, he is the start of all problems as he is a stubborn minded individual thst loves to be right, No matter what you did, you wouldnt be right, even if you are. 

From the way I wear my clothes, the way I eat, the way I do literary anything, it has to be the way he thinks is right. For instance, I'd never pull my phone out in his presence unless I'd want to be interrogated for what I'm doing and why, there is no real privacy for me as he'd take the phone and inspect it. Other times, I wouldnt be allowed to close my bedroom door because ""privacy is not a right, it's to be earned"" I could say the same for the one time i was talking a shower and because the shower room doesn't have a door lock on it, you could just walk through. Well apparently he didnt hear the shower water running and so he just proceeded to open the door before i instinctively yelled at him to get out, well he didnt like that, so he just stood outside the door while repeatedly telling to me to stop shouting. Well the more I yelled at him to get away, the more he persisted to stay. He just stood outside the door with it still open as he would repeat over and over that I cannot shout at him, well it went like this for around 30 seconds before he'd finally go.

He loves arguing. How can I combat some of the words that he says, if I ask him to explain why I'm doing something wrong, the answer I'd always get is ""because I say so"" 

After countless family therapy sessions, arguments, problems that have been going for years, nothing has changed. He is controlling, condescending, irrational and isnt willing to change. Other times before, he'd ask my mum whether or not it's going to be ""me or him"" (referring to who's leaving the house) and other times he made statements saying that if he leaves, he'd put us on the streets with nothing, just like what my previous dad did to the family.

I'm really struggling to know what to do, he wont change  and I'm just an average 15 year old kid, I dont drink, smoke, do drug, or anything stupid. So the way he treats  me and my sister is completely irrational. I'm probably going to have problems in the future if I go to college because I wouldnt be able/allowed to return home after it.

Since then, every letter I get she will open or when I open it she'll be hanging over my shoulder. She'll watch every message I send, put her ear to the door when I'm on the phone, follow me into a room. It's like me booking the doctors appointment without her knowing made her have this realisation that I have a private life and she doesn't like it. I've tried talking to her, telling her to back off but she won't. A few days ago I got a letter from the doctors saying I need a scan and she wouldn't stop asking questions, she still hasn't.

About a year ago, he told me that his mom was diagnosed with cancer when he was really really drunk and we talked about it at length, but never ever since, because he told me the next day, that he doesn't want any pity and that I should treat him as if I didn't know it.

So for the last two weeks he's been looking very sad, acted different and it sometimes feels as if there's an elephant in the room when it's just the two of us. At first, I thought it was because his girlfriend moved abroad recently, but we talked about it and apparently he's ok with it and it hasn't really changed much. Today I talked to his brother about it, because I thought it was weird and out of character for him and he told me, that their mother had passed away. Furthermore he told me, that they talked about me, and that my friend said he wants to talk to me about it, but doesn't know how to bring it up. 

Which leads me to my question: How do I make it easy for him to open up and feel comfortable while doing it? We usually don't talk much about our feelings, so I get why it's hard and I wouldn't know how to bring it up either.

They made it out like being able to make a speech in front of my 9th grade English class was the absolute most important thing in the world and that I was just an absolute shame to the family just for not being able to do it. Looking back as an adult, it was incredibly strange how much emotional weight they put on me doing public speaking assignments and I believe it was honestly borderline psychologically abusive, even if I wasn't officially diagnosed with the autism and selective mutism yet. Would you consider it to be emotional abuse what I dealt with? I feel like it's part of the reason why it's gotten worse over the years.

I, like most people, do not like confrontation. I don't know if it is because I am a mid 20's female and have felt (more often than not) that my opinion is disregarded because of that.

 I get told  ""That's life Shaqfan101."" a lot which I totally understand but it makes it difficult to stand up for myself.

Earlier this year I was given an opportunity to create a new roll within the company I work for. I was skeptical at first because I really did not want to put a lot of work in to something and not reap any benefits. It was incredibly stressful as I was creating this roll AND working under my regular roll during our busy season. 

Almost 3 months ago I had finally started getting the hang of everything when they introduced the new supervisor, he would be the guy I report to when my title switched. I didn't mind him at first, he was very scatterbrained and talked over me a lot but I just chalked it up to being overwhelmed by the new environment. He would forget things I told him, dispute processes unless someone else agreed with me, he would say ""We had this conversation Shaqfan101"" when we did not have a conversation, he would ask other people for assistance instead of asking me, the list goes on.

468,"Hello everyone, a little backstory:

My parents have always been homophobic and hated LGBTQ people, they always told me ""never be like those sinners, or you'll go to hell"". I never really understood why they thought that but I just learned to live with it..

about 6 months ago I discovered that i'm Bi, and I was really scared because I didn't know how my parents would react, so I decided to keep it a secret until a few days ago...

I told my mom first, she laughed at me and thought I was joking, after that, she realized I was serious.. She started swearing to me, saying that i'd burn in hell, and that she can't even recognize me anymore because of my sexuality. She said much more but I don't really wanna say exactly lol..

After my dad came home from his shift, I could hear them arguing back and forth blaming each other for some reason... Around 30 minutes later my dad came in and told me to pack my bags. at first I thought he was just kidding.. but he wasn't, currently I'm staying at my best friends house and i'm most likely going to move in and live there until i get a job... I want to call them but they've blocked me on everything, messages, calls, etc...I even tried calling them from another phone.. they hate me now.. I'm just really down and I can't really talk to anyone about it because all of my friends are straight and can't really relate..",16Oct2019,8

470,"I love my partner and he is great and usually treat me well. But I can’t help but think we aren’t compatible nowadays. We’re very different and we have used it to our benefit before. But I always feel like I am boring him. I try to talk to him about various things such as TV shows we watch, a podcast I listen to (he got me into the podcast), my day at work, books I am reading, my goals for the future, cool new recipes and health tips, and try to show him how to stretch (his back always hurts). I’m a very relational person who cares about health. I’m very fit and enjoy cooking healthy and eating healthy. 

On the other hand, my partner is overweight, drinks daily, smokes daily, plays video games till five am (on days he works even), and loves fantasy things. I try to share my interests with him and have light conversation after we get home from work but he seems to not hear me and won’t respond to what I say unless I get upset with him and repeat myself louder and ask if he can hear me. 

He regularly plays video games and I ask him if I can join or if we can play a game we can do together while I am over and he says you can watch me play this game and tell me what to do! So I try to do that and he disregards everything I am saying and doesn’t even acknowledge me when I talk about his game with him, so I end up reading. I try to tell him some fascinating things that happened in my books (about the holocaust, corruption, segregation, other political/moral issues) and he doesn’t respond. 

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don’t initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can’t even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can’t afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn’t even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can’t stop, like how he can’t stop drinking and smoking. I don’t understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me. He also only fucks me once a week. It’s like he only fucks me cause he remembers if he doesn’t initiate them I’ll be hurt. 

Edit:
He also is really into naked women art and said he kept a list of women he has fucked and a secret file full of nudes exes sent him and said he kept them as trophies.

I’ve discussed all these issues with him. It’s frankly pretty demoralizing to have to ask someone who supposedly loves you to pay attention to you. If we were really meant to be I wouldn’t have to feel so shitty about this because he would treat me like a human being

WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE? I DONT WANT ALL THE BLAME TO FALL ON HIM, WHAT ACTIONS CAN I CONTROL? Am I truly boring? Am I unworthy of attention? 
Am I asking too much of him? I am so fucking bored of him.

Fast forward about a week and she's grabbing me, leaning on my shoulder, playing with my hair, etc. This is the most contact I've ever had with a girl and so as you can imagine it meant something to me.

He lets me have his facebook and Instagram passwords (I also let him check my accs whenever he wants but he doesn’t really care) and he’s fine with this as he has nothing to hide. Despite him being okay with it I feel really really terrible about it but it’s almost like an addiction I can’t control. I’m often checking his accs and even through I don’t ever really find anything questionable I still feel the need to check quite often.

I don’t want to be this jealous or possessive but every time I try to let my guard down, log out of his accs and not check I get this creeping feeling of him messaging and hitting up other girls, hitting it off and forgetting about me. 

I know the source of my insecurity, he has never been unfaithful to me and it’s not that I don’t trust him but it’s that a while ago in the past I saw some messages between him and female friends that were kinda flirty and I knew that he enjoyed the attention. I also found out quite a few months ago when we were in rocky spot (considering breaking up but still together) he started messaging this girl who was clearly interested in him with the intention of getting to know her better. It felt like he was messaging other girls to create “back ups” for me and he later admitted that this was indeed sort of the case.

478,"It’s been a good 5 years so far.  My boyfriend (26M) and I (32) got into an argument today. He is a going to med-school and everything he lives off of is provided by his parents.  

Just a bit of backstory. My boyfriend takes Kratom, smokes weed, and buys these pills off the internet that simulate the effects of benzos. 
I just smoke alot. I told him I’m not okay with the pills or kratom, but that if he takes them and it helps I won’t complain, he still tries to hide it when he takes them.  I also caught him getting into my vyvanse prescription bottle, opening a capsule and pouring some out for himself, which was the most disturbing thing to me. He’s an addict without a doubt. 

Now we both have the venmo app so we can easily send money to eachother.  However, he has accidentally sent me amounts of money three times now.  He can’t pull cash using his parents card. I know he can pull money using his venmo card so I made him pull his phone out and let me see him put the money back where it belonged and he got mad. We argued a bit which led me to say, ‘I just don’t think now is a good time for you to have cash on hand given what you were doing to my medication last week.’  He took it as a huge insult. He told me I think so little of him, but I pick scabs off his back at night and massage him regularly so I figuratively worship the ground he walks on. 

Was I in the wrong here?  His parents could have asked me about the money so I made sure it was back where it belonged rather than in the hands of someone I caught taking my medication two weeks prior and has other known drugs he is trying to hide the consumption of. 

So sad to see so many people that let addiction break their past relationships in other reddit threads. Maybe they didn’t truly loved the person they were with.  It’s not supposed to be easy and no relationship comes without it’s intense hardship.  I’m not being physically or mentally abused. I can’t just leave over something this stupid.

When you love someone, you shouldn’t  give up on them so easily and I’m tired of seeing such lazy advice given on reddit.  To those that will make meaningful suggestions to what we could do to make things work, I really appreciate it. I bought a tamper proof locking pill bottle on amazon and am going to keep it someplace safe for starters.  

Is therapy a good start. Should I stop smoking to not seem hypocritical, even though it hasn’t been brought up?  

Tldr:  i called my boyfriend out for using me to launder his parents money for his drug habit and he got upset.  Not breaking up with him and i think you’re lazy in your relationships if you think that is an appropriate response.",16Oct2019,1

My mom was beyond upset. Fake crying, guilt tripping, making me feel awful. My dad was also extremely upset. He said that I could move out, but that it would be extremely rough and I would fail and end up coming home. They want me to live with them until I get a husband and have a child, which is absurd. I know I could just up and leave and I'd be okay, but I'm worried that my dad will pass soon after they move to the east coast and I wont be there to spend that last bit of time with him.

Last night I took MDMA while drunk and high and today I am truly realising what I have become.

I feel like I've never been happier and my social life is filled with excitement and I have amazing friends. I've never felt more myself but at the same time, sometimes I feel like I'm staring at a stranger in the mirror. The past year I've had my lowest moments, mostly related to heartbreak, but also my happiest moments, like falling in love (we've split up, he was addicted to pills).

I am a senior in highschool now, and I still get straight As at school, and plan to study physics at a good university. Is this a normal part of growing up or am I heading down the wrong path? I don't know if I've lost myself or found myself. It doesn't feel like my life is derailing, but if 1.5 years ago me would have seen who I've become, she would be shocked. Please, I need advice. Has anyone gone through this?",16Oct2019,1
489,"So recently, over a month ago, I got out of a year long relationship. The reason being was because I had a family death and I wasn’t in the greatest place mentally, I was stressed about school because if CE (college course classes), and overall just wasn’t feeling the same about this relationship.

Before the break up, we’ve been dating for 6 months, and I cheated on her, yes I know an asshole move, but it was with a girl long distance. That affected the relationship a lot, she accepted me back surprisingly, but there would be days where she would send me long paragraphs about how horrible I was and how I never cared or that to me she meant nothing. This went on for some time, but then it didn’t get as bad in until the break up. What really sparked it was that she said that I never put any effort into the relationship, never took her out, or tried to make her happy. Even though I did take her to the movie countless times, I tried my best to hang out with her everyday over summer break, even had her go to a family reunion for the 4th of July. At that point I was starting school and was honestly loosing feelings in the relationship. While I was loosing feelings I guess I was talking to other girls but not actively trying to be interested, if that makes since. But eventually I did gain feelings for this one girl soon after the break up and I am actively trying to get her.

I should also note that when I did break up with her she basically called me a shitty person and boyfriend, all she did was to make me happy while I did not thing for her to be happy. And also said that I should give good luck to my next girlfriend because she’s going to need it.

I try to text me ex to check up on her because she is homeschooled but I always get left on read, and sometimes I do feel down about the whole being “alone” thing.

What I’m trying to ask is if this is normal? Is it normal I moved on so fast? Is it normal for how she reacted to the cheating? Is how I handled the situation ok or normal?",16Oct2019,1
490,"Ok guys so here’s a sticky situation for ya. This past weekend I started snapping to this girl 2 days after I had met her at the same party I was at. And the first day she started sending me hearts, and my stupid ass thinking those are friendly hearts send hearts back. And now during these past days I’ve noticed that she’s been flirting with me, so today I just accidentally said yes to if she wanted to go see a movie. And I don’t. Know. What. I’m. Gonna. Do. I don’t wanna hurt her feeling but I also don’t wanna do anything with her, she’s really sweet and hurting her feeling are not an option.

491,"Im on mobile, and English isn't my first language. My aunt(35f) has 2 little girls, lets call them Older(6) and Younger(3). Since younger was born, my aunt showed preference for her over her sister, this came to the point of her saying ""this one is gonna turn out better"" when Younger was born. Over the years it got worse but it also got better from time to time. Lately its Older crying while her moms yells at her over things like ""you're laughing too loud"" (all of this happening at the table when the family gets together for dinner, usually twice a month). The other day she yelled at her and grounded her for a month because she lost a hoodie at school (she's six, for fucks sake) she never gets physical but the abuse is clear and Older is obviously getting traumatized. 
The worst thing is that everyone in my family thinks that she is being abusive but won't say anything other than ""don't scream at her like that"" to which she responds (literally in both their daughters faces) ""she's not as good as she makes you all believe"". Imagine being 6 y/o and hearing your mother say that stuff about you. I've also heard her comparing Older to Younger in their presence, like ""you should be more like your sister, she's good unlike you"".
The thing is, I can't take it anymore. Nobody is doing anything and telling me I shouldn't interfere (I'm 21f, one of the youngest). I'm thinking about telling my aunt that she is causing irreversible damage on both of her daughters's mental health and that if she doesn't plan on changing it I'm not going to visit their house anymore (she lives with my grandparents so that implies i won't be seeing them anymore too) I'm hoping this will start a spark so that all the other people in our family will come out and say the truth too. I don't know if im being to aggressive or if I should be even more agresive. What should I do? I don't want to make it worse for the girls.",16Oct2019,3
492,"My niece just turned 9 and she is really smart. While talking to her I asked what she wanted to be when she grows up and she said a scientists. This surprised me since usually this seems to be the age most girls transition from ""I wanna be a princess."" To ""I wanna be a singer or actor or i wanna be famous."" (This is all in my own experience by the way). 

She doesn't exactly come from a community that produces scientists on a regular basis. And the odds are not in her favor statistically. Low income, Single parent home with three children ect. I also know from the ages of 10 to 13 most girls lose interest in math and science. I live almost 600 miles away and dont get to see her often other than video chat or calling. 

I myself am not mathematically or scientifically inclined. I am more into literature and art. I want to make sure she has a fighting chance to do something good in her life even if it isnt being a scientists.

 I want to make sure she stays interested in math and science for as long as possible because it will be a good basis for later on in life. How do I do that?",16Oct2019,2
493,"So my partner (24f) and I (26m) of 4 years have had a bit of a dwindling sex life of late (I say of late, it’s probably about a year or so). Basically, whenever we have sex, I always end up in a bad way down *there* in terms of infection and general pain, y’know? It’s proper shit. I’m not going to go into deep detail about it, but I have recently been thinking about getting circumcised in the hopes that it may help as I’ve heard it’s cleaner and reduces risk of catching this, that and the next thing. Are there any males out there who have been circumcised later in life that could shed some light on it? It’s really starting to take its toll in the other aspects of our relationship, the closeness is disappearing as we’re no longer having sex anywhere near as often as we used to. She thinks I should go ahead with it, and I want everything to be fixed, but I’m scared of the outcome of the procedure, I mean...guys, you get it.

495,"I’m 23 years old, male, and getting ready to gear up to graduate college come December. I have had a riot in college. I’ve made lifelong friends that I would’ve never thought, I got some partying in, I’ve done well enough in my classes to graduate, I got an internship over the summer in the city I most love and ended up staying with that company when January comes around. College has been great...but I still can’t help but feel like this is all moving so fast and I don’t know how to cope. 

This may sound weird, but this week I feel like life has been throwing me subtle hints about how great it used to be when I was a young child or in high school. I had a really vivid dream about old high school friends and what it was like to go to high school, I finally realized that I was 18 when I started college (actually calculated it lol), I saw an old 2012 Facebook memory that had the most comments I’ve gotten on a picture and as I was reading through them there are all these people commenting that I haven’t talked to in 8 years or so. I can’t explain this phenomena that I’m feeling. It looks like everyone else is completely fine with growing up? Or maybe they just don’t talk about it. 

I’m looking for advice in: How does everyone cope with getting older? How does not looking back to the past make everything today now seem much worse? What are some tips to make you “forget” about the past and realize that this is all a part of life? 

Because don’t get me wrong, I understand this concept. We all get old, we all die. But while I know I’m still young, I can’t help but feel like I’ve already had my best years.

We do not have much money right now, she is a student and I just graduated and am applying to jobs so every bit of the budget needs to go as far as it can go.

I found a wonderful wedding dress for myself and was actually able to also get a relatively expensive veil and new shoes for half of the amount she budgeted for my attire. But she tells me this morning she has found the perfect dress that she really really wants and it is 6x as expensive as mine and thats just her dress, not her veil or her shoes or anything. It's so expensive it uses the entire combined budget for the both of us and then add on top of that the cost of everything I picked out for myself and you would barely get to her dress's price...

I was worried about this- I'm generally much more high maintenance and I would put money on me becoming bridezilla far before her. But if she really loves this dress I really want her to have it, she deserves to love her dress, it's her wedding dress and thats so importiant.

508,"Long story short, my father made me apply to law school, which I hate. I failed the exam( I didn't want to get in to be honest) because I feel like my meaning is to be a doctor. I started studying for next year's admission to a nice medical school( I'm in Europe btw, Romania to be more specific which has one of the most corrupt legal systems) 

In this country simple things like getting your driver's licence involve bribing someone. Thankfully I dared to fight the system and refused to pay a bribe and the police officer who was in charge of driver's licences gave me a pass. I'm the only one from my former highschool classmates that didn't bribe their way in. I mentioned this in order for you to get an ideea of what I'm facing. 

The fact that I live in such a decrepit, corrupt country has also taken a toll on my mental health. This part is tought to describe. 

What I cannot handle is the continuous stress that my parents subject me to. After they come home from work they unload all of their garbage on me. I am the family's therapist, so to say. Nobody gives a crap about my feelings or anything like that. I'm not complaining, I have never been, but how should I handle this? I don't want it to affect my studies. 

Also, what if I don't get in? I don't know what other university I could go to. I am honestly concerned for my future because I cannot find another professional field that would satisfy me. I stay at home most of the time, when I'm not studying I am exercising and reading stuff that I enjoy, mostly old books. I don't have that many friends. I'm the quiet guy who keeps to himself. 

To recap, my questions are the following: How should I know if I am right for this field? I was really good when it came to biology in HS. I got myself a nice tutor and she said that I'm doing very well. I am really good at handling stress, except when I have to deal with my parent's work issues. I just feel like I am being unloaded a truck a garbage that I have to dispose of. How should I deal with this? Also,should I work on expanding my social skills? I'm pretty content to having a small pool of people as my so called ""friends"", I'm a guy btw and I only dated a few girls. I feel like relationships are a waste of time at this age. Also, I'm really concerned for my future regarding university so getting a gf is out of the question.

510,"My roommate &amp; friend, A, has talked down about the kind of music I like, shows I go to, even movies and tv that I watch. She’s one of those people who will generalize not liking something because she doesn’t like one song from an artist, or one movie from an actor. We are also roommates, which is kinda toxic to our relationship right now, but I am unable to move out on my own and usually my activities are my escape. Our friend group is fairly large and I usually don’t have trouble finding people to do stuff with, and I often plan large outings to concerts/sports events in the city.

Now A has been struggling with some depression and hasn’t planned her own style of events lately, so she has been piggybacking on going to some of the squad events (concerts and festivals mostly). She likes to kinda be the alpha in situations, even though our friends group has been doing festivals for 3+ years together and we all know how to have a good time together. She honestly doesn’t look like she’s having fun in big crowds with EDM music bumping, and she’s even told me that she doesn’t like those kinds of setting before. My bf and I are the type of people who end up taking care of someone not having a good time and it seems like, lately, we’ve been taking care of her/ trying to get her to have fun, over having a good time. 
There’s a show we’re going to tomorrow and I was really looking forward to it. This morning I found out someone in our friends group bought her a ticket, and I’m bummed. I’m trying to manifest positivity, but when I think of what that looks like, it’s her not being there. I think part of it is that my escape for a tense home environment was going out with friends, and now that she goes to every event, I can’t escape anymore.

How can I be supportive of a friend branching out, without having to really be on her radar while we’re at a show? I’m debating on wearing earplugs (which I do sometimes anyway).

511,"I had an interview for a grocery store that my friend(he works there) recommended me for.  

Without me calling the store twice and him being my connection to the store, I wouldn’t have gotten the interview because I don’t have much job experience, especially not in retail. 

The interviewer starts asking me questions about my old jobs,
“Oh who was your preferred boss to work with and why?”
I responded with something like “Probably when I worked briefly in the hospital because the supervisor there kept me busy, and I like completing tasks, there’s a certain satisfaction within it” 


“What problems have you had with other coworkers and how did you solve it?”
I said, “When I worked as a summer camp counselor I worked with a lead head counselor that was lacking leadership and we had to all step up and assume leadership roles” 


“What task would be your least preferred?” 
I said, “ probably stocking, I’m not very strong but I’m willing to learn and try” (this question I think I could have answered better but I looked up supermarket interview questions and it asked if I was able to lift 50 pound boxes so I got nervous) 

“What growth do you expect to see here”
I said, “I hope to get more customer service experience because I’ve never really gotten any but I believe I would be good at dealing with varieties of people” 

I remained calm, I didn’t stutter and I probably got red but I retained eye contact and smiled a lot. I didn’t think I did great on the interview, but I called about two weeks later and they said they weren’t hiring. My friend, who works there, said that the boss told him, “I’m going to be honest, she did very bad” and he told me. 

I was floored and honestly, very pathetically holding back tears. It wasn’t that I didn’t get the job but I thought “very bad” applied to people who didn’t even try to seem right for the job or crazy people.

513,"Hi all,

I work part-time. I used to have fixed work hours, but now my boss changes them every day and it's draining the life out of me. Like e.g. she says I should work in the morning and I get the morning cleared up, but she then messages and says to work in the evening. So I never know when I have any time of my own.

And here comes the best part: I haven't been paid in 2,5 months. 

Today she changed my working hours again and said I need to be more flexible with my schedule.  I'm a college student and I'm forced to look for a second job because this one doesn't pay me regularly, but she claims I need to work more hours and be even more flexible.

 I snapped and wrote to her that this ""flexibility"" wasn't something I agreed to and that if she wants someone to be always available probably I should help her look for and train my replacement.

After writing that I immediately felt like a jerk. She's actually a really nice person and I know she's in a tough situation now. But I have to stand up for myself sometimes, don't I? After all, because of her I have to borrow from friends to pay my rent, and live on noodles alone for weeks.

514,"I’ll try to keep this short. But I want to include all the details because it is a very nuanced situation. I (23M) met a woman (25F) early 2018 at work. We are in different divisions in neighboring cities but at the time she had to work in my office for a few months. The two of us hit it off quite well and over that time neither of us made any advances. Part of the reason could be that we were both working 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week and were exhausted. Also partly because I didn’t want to make things weird since I was seeing her at work more than my family and friends during that time.

Anyways, fast forward to August of this year. I had gone back to finish my degree, went traveling for a few months, etc. We sent the odd text and snapchat over this time. It was hard to keep good contact because she is an admittedly awful responder. She was always in the back of my mind though.

Now it’s October and she came to town for a few weeks for work again (not working with me). We talked a bit and ended up getting dinner. I’ve never been able to talk to anyone for long stretches but we sat there talking for 4 hours with no awkward situations (I honestly think that is a record for me, usually i struggle for 30 minutes). One thing led to another and we ended up having sex and I stayed the night.

I want to let her know my true feelings for her, but I can’t work myself up to say it and I don’t know what to say. I just keep seeing the barriers of her traveling for her job and us living in different cities 3 hours away. It also doesn’t help that she is the world’s worst texter hahah... I’ve seen her phone... she has texts from family, friends, even her boss sitting unread for upwards of 1.5 days.

She says she prefers talking on the phone but it’s hard to call her when she is at work basically 7am to 11 pm every day.

I sent her a text the next day saying I had fun and I hope she did too, and asked to go out again. She responded (a long time later cause she checks her phone like 2x a day) that she had fun as well, but unfortunately work has had her there basically 24/7 so she couldn’t go out. It’s a lottery how long work will make her stay each day so it’s very hard to plan anything in advance. She leaves town again in 2 days so I think it might be time to just put myself out there and put and end to this endless wondering.

I was thinking about sending this text to her:

“I was going to give you a call, but since you are salary slaving it I resorted to a text. I had a lot of fun on Sunday and I realized there are not many people I could talk to for an hour, let alone multiple hours straight. I think you are really cool and I would like to get to know you better. If you don’t feel the same way, that’s fine. I hope it doesn’t make things awkward between us because I enjoy talking to you and would like to continue our professional friendship.”

515,"I've handed my notice in to my current job, and they do exit interviews as most places do. My department has a huge amount of turnover. Most of the staff have less than 6 months experience, we hire and fire temps on a whim. We have people being rotated round into roles they aren't qualified for, it's a real mess. People are working past midnight. There's a lot of balls in the air and they're gradually dropping, I don't think it'll be long before it all falls through.

The reason so many staff have left (of a team of 16, around 13 have left in the last year and either been replaced or their jobs amalgamated into someone else's role) is that the manager doesn't manage so much as they sweep problems under the carpet. They have clear favourites in the team of people they were already friends with outside of work, they see young staff as unreliable and a liability when in reality they just see issues and point them out and feel unhappy when they're ignored so they leave. There's a prominent bullying culture. 

I know several people have been intentionally held back from progressing and everyone who has left has cited this manager and bullying/favouritism tactics, but it seems like nothing has happened with that information.

Making it worse, due to redundancies the HR manager left, and my manager (not connected to the HR field) has become a temporary manager there. So now if anyone makes a complaint to HR about this person it will end up going back through their own hr department in theory. 

The whole thing is confusing as hell and as so many people have cited the same issue with this person in their exit interview and nothing has happened it makes me wonder what will happen now in my exit interview? Should I still be honest and say how i feel or will my manager now be able to read it with impunity because they own HR now too? Do businesses do anything on the back of these interviews or are they just a formality? I know you shouldn't burn bridges but if bring honest will help prevent repeat issues in the future I want to be as honest as I can, but I don't want to slam the business in it if its not useful in any way and could result in my manager reading it and refusing to give me future references.",16Oct2019,1

On the other hand, my partner is overweight, drinks daily, smokes daily, plays video games till five am (on days he works even), and loves fantasy things. I try to share my interests with him and have light conversation after we get home from work but he seems to not hear me and won’t respond to what I say unless I get upset with him and repeat myself louder and ask if he can hear me. 

He regularly plays video games and I ask him if I can join or if we can play a game we can do together while I am over and he says you can watch me play this game and tell me what to do! So I try to do that and he disregards everything I am saying and doesn’t even acknowledge me when I talk about his game with him, so I end up reading. I try to tell him some fascinating things that happened in my books (about the holocaust, corruption, segregation, other political/moral issues) and he doesn’t respond. 

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don’t initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can’t even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can’t afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn’t even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can’t stop, like how he can’t stop drinking and smoking. I don’t understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me. He also only fucks me once a week. It’s like he only fucks me cause he remembers if he doesn’t initiate them I’ll be hurt. 

Edit:
He also is really into naked women art and said he kept a list of women he has fucked and a secret file full of nudes exes sent him and said he kept them as trophies.

I’ve discussed all these issues with him. It’s frankly pretty demoralizing to have to ask someone who supposedly loves you to pay attention to you. If we were really meant to be I wouldn’t have to feel so shitty about this because he would treat me like a human being

WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE? I DONT WANT ALL THE BLAME TO FALL ON HIM, WHAT ACTIONS CAN I CONTROL? Am I truly boring? Am I unworthy of attention? 
Am I asking too much of him? I am so fucking bored of him.

I’m afraid to leave my bf because he says he keeps nudes of exes on his phone because they’re trophies and I’ve sent him nudes before knowing this",16Oct2019,0
520,"I'm a female, 23yo. I feel like in my entire life I'm very toxic. At first I didn't notice it but since my ex bf told me that I am suffocating, I realize that I actually am. At some point, I didn't really care since I felt like I'm always alone anyway. Now I found some nice people that I would call friends (online, i dont really have any irl friends) and I start being toxic again. I wanted to talk to them a lot (my ex told me that he got no time for others because of me and he didnt wanna spend time with me) but I know I shouldn't. I like talking a lot, even if it's about nothing much but what I do today etc. A lot of the time tho, it went to negative feelings that I talked about and then felt bad about it later on. I felt like I put too much stress to people I talk to.

Long time ago, I kept everything to myself and I was scared to talk about all my feelings but I've changed since then and I realize that I quite enjoy talking about it (via text). It wasn't exactly good for me (maybe) but I think it's better for people around me. Lately I've been thinking about it a lot, how toxic I am and I'd rather be back to how I was before than suffocating people around me. I appreciate them being around for me, I don't deserve any of this kindness towards me especially that I am very toxic but I also want to keep them around since they are here already. I like having people around me as a friend. I like having friends. I wonder if I'm being selfish to want to keep them but they can leave me whenever they want to, and they know that. I won't text them first, so if they don't want to text me ever again, all they need to do is to stop texting me and I'll be gone.

My main issue would be keeping my problems to myself. I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna even hint about it to anyone. Any advice on how to do it? It happened before but idk how to trigger the fear of talking again.",16Oct2019,1
521,"This happened about 30 minutes ago. She texted me saying she had 32 pills in front of her and wants to do it. After 30 minutes of talking to her she put the pills away.
This was one of the most stressful situations I’ve been in because I was the one she came to for help so I couldn’t bare the thought of losing her and having to think I didn’t do enough to save her. After trying my best to convince her it’s not worth it and this isn’t the only option she’s okay now and everything calmed down which I am unimaginably relieved about. But  now I’m in this very weird state of like post stress and I don’t know what to do or how to process it. I’ve never been in a situation like this before. She had a note ready and all. I’m just so thankful she changed her mind now.",16Oct2019,1
522,"I bought a my first house a month ago. The yard is fenced in with a chain link fence around the three sides. Per the survey, 2 of the sides of fencing are completed on my property. The 3rd side is on the property line with my neighbors. 

The 3rd side fence is old and deteriorated and the neighbors dogs have destroyed the already worn and torn bottom of several sections of the fence. They are now able to crawl underneath into my yard and my dog can now do the same. My neighbor has put up some posts by the holes but gaps to get through still exist and now that they know what to do, they’re creating more holes in different sections every day. 

I had intended on installing a privacy fence around the whole yard sometime next spring or summer but now that I finally have my own yard for the dog, I refuse to still have to leash him and take him out, so I need to do something ASAP with the fence and not wait that long. 

Since it’s on the property line, I’d have to have the neighbors sign off on everything for the permit and preferably split the cost. How do I navigate this if we can’t agree on a type of fence/price?",16Oct2019,1

However, she is not in any of my classess, so I'm not too sure how to get to know her? I was wondering, what could I do to approach her or try to know her better?

524,"I dont really use reddit sorry if this is posted in the wrong place or something, but to get to the point. I'm a 20 year old female (soon to be 21) who lives an almost 100% sedentary lifestyle. My days are sleeping and going 1 meter away to the computer in my room for work. I work at home and for myself so I literally never have to leave the house, I live with my brothers and mom and they go grocery shopping most of the time and the rare times I DO go with them the walk in the store and to the car is about as much activity as I'll get for the week. Other than getting up to go to the bathroom or standing up for 20 minutes to cook I dont move. I'm an artist so doing my job standing up isnt really much of an option...  


  
I've had back pain since I was in middle school but since I have major social anxiety so I've never been to the doctor for it and its just been getting more and more painful as I get older. I'm at the point where when I stand up to get out of my computer chair I can't even stand up straight from how much my hips and back hurt. Even rolling over in bed causes pain. I know this is all totally my fault and I'm fucking up my body and I want to change this. So I want to know what the best way I can is. I hate pain and even walking hurts so I have no idea what I can do without injuring myself. Do I go to the gym? Do I start taking short walks? I have a bicycle but I stopped riding it a few months ago because my hip started hurting a lot. I honestly know nothing about exercising and fitness so I don't really know where to start and I really dont want to injure myself by accident... I live in canada so nothing beside my anxiety is holding me back from seeing the doctor so do I start with making an appointment? Any advice at all is helpful",16Oct2019,2
525,"Okay so my (20F) boyfriend (19M) moved out with his brother and his brother’s friend a little less than a year ago. 

His brother took out a loan and purchased a home. He’s paying off the mortgage in monthly installments and they all divide the cost of utilities and rent by 3.

Since I’m currently in college full time, working almost full time, and my boyfriend has a full time job, I stay with him most nights so that we can spend what little free time we have together. I get along well and like all of the roommates a lot so I don’t see any reason not to.

I’ve offered to chip in on the utilities multiple times, so that we can divide the cost by 4 and I can pay my fair share for the utilities and make contributions to the household. I’m self aware at how often I stay with my boyfriend at his house and want to do everything I can to carry my own weight and not be an inconvenience to him and the rest of the people who live here. But he’s never told me how much it would be and since most of the bills are online, I don’t have access to how much 1/4 of the cost would be even if I wanted to forcefully contribute.

My boyfriend and I buy our own food and groceries. I also do things to help out around the house every day like cleaning the bathroom/kitchen, doing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I’m not using this as justification for staying here free, I think these are courteous and necessary things to do when you live with other people. But I just wanted to add in that I do contribute in other ways.

Yesterday, my boyfriend’s brother brought up me paying the same amount my boyfriend does in rent, so 1/3 of the cost rather than 1/4. He says it isn’t a personal thing, but since it’s another person in the house, “things wear down quicker.” (most likely referring to the fact that our washer completely broke a few days prior) 

Immediately after the washer broke, I said I’d pay a fraction on a new one, to which the brother didn’t say anything directly relating to it in response. I don’t have a key to the place, and I don’t have a room to store anything beyond the small amount of clothes and laptop I keep in my boyfriend’s room. There is another room in the house, but it’s being occupied by the brother’s girlfriend’s things. She hasn’t been asked to pay any rent that’s divided amongst the household and she stays here more often than I do.

I’m not sure what to do here. I really like these people and I don’t want to cause any bad blood, especially between my boyfriend and his brother. But it seems a little outrageous for me to pay 1/3 of the rent every month when I don’t have a room, a key, or anywhere to store things I would want to take with me if I fully moved. Not to mention the fact that it seems to be profit for the brother if the percentage of my payment isn’t directly going towards rent or other costs of living here for everyone living in the house.

I want to discuss the idea of paying my portion of the utilities each month, and paying 1/4 of the cost of whatever appliances or other household items break as they come. But I don’t want to come across as defensive or cheap to someone who’s letting me stay at their house. Am I being unreasonable?",16Oct2019,1
527,"I can’t believe I’m actually writing this, it sounds like high school “drama” anyway... 

My boyfriend and I broke up almost three weeks ago and we haven’t made any contact at all. Yesterday it was my birthday and he wished me happy birthday and I thanked him, that was the only contact we made. 

My ex and I didn’t end on bad terms, he broke up with me and I tried to think of solutions to fix our relationship but he didn’t want to fix it. I just accepted this and tried to make our breakup not messy. 

Today I wake up to notifications from him on Snapchat. It showed that he had saved pictures from mine and his chat to his camera roll. I found this incredibly weird because it was not just one picture, he saved seven pictures.. 

I don’t know whether or not to ask why he saved pictures from our chat to his camera roll, as the majority of pictures in our chat are me and him.

Should I ask him why he saved the picture to his camera roll? And does anyone else find it weird that he would do this?",16Oct2019,2
528,"**TL:DR**  Friend is going through a really bad time.  Needs to see a professional, but won't.  Got incredibly upset when her mum tried to help her (in a very misguided way). I've tried to be supportive, don't feel like I'm in a position to help her myself at the moment and am getting really worried about her if she thinks I'm pushing her away as well. 



A good friend of mine is going through a bad time.  A really hrad time.  It's been going on now for couple of years and just seems to be gettng worse. 

She is such a wonderful person, that it hurts to see her like this, but it's getting to the point where I don't know what to do or say anymore, and I really think she needs to talk to a therapist, but because of the way she's feeling, she just ... won't. Or... can't?  
 
Without going into too much, she's had a couple of bad runs with people she's dated since she split from her husband a few years ago.  She's also had some bad  health issues, discovered in away that was also kind of rubbing salt in the wound, and kind of had 3 major bad things happening all within a few weeks of each other last year.  I think that's when it really started getting bad and now she's been in this dark place for over a year.  

She's gone through a couple of periods of basicly not eating due to anxiety (and depression I imagine). She lives by herself and has been over the past year, isolating herself more and more, and kind of cutting off friendship over what seem to be quite little things. I think because of her state of mind, she's reading into a lot of things in a way that isn't always there and some of these things are causing her even more anxiety. 
Not to long ago, she was convinced that her boss was implying that she'd stolen something, when -knowing her boss (although not super well) - i think that it would have just been something getting lost in ""tone"" when her boss was in a hurry and looking for something.  
I've been trying to make an effort to invite her to things, around to watch a movie,  out for a casual dinner and she always bails with something last minute.  The last time - she actually invited me out, and was really persistent about it, then didn't answer any of my calls and just never showed up.  I know it's because she's getting so anxious that now she's finding it hard to do anything, but i was really hurt and frustrated after turning down other plans.  

I can't remember what happened recently to trigger anxiety, but i remember her calling me because she was really upset that she'd been to the doctor to ask for valium, but they'd told her they wouldn't give her anymore and that she needed to see someone. She asked her mum to get some instead.  

Yesterday, (while trying desperately to catch up on work that I was getting a bit stressed about), she called me because she feels like her boss and regional boss is trying to force her to change her contract because she's been too unreliable, and is now so anxious that she keeps calling in sick to work, and when she has to work she's so stressed she can't eat and will feel sick.  She said  she was going to go stay with get mum for a night to get away from it, then an hour or so later, I got two calls in a row (which I didn't answer because i knew they'd be another long call and put me further behind with work) but i felt guilty so called back not long after.  
She was mad/ upset that her mum had called her in a 3 way call with a paster, to try and give her some counseling, and was livid that her mum had betrayed her by ""airing all my business"" to someone else.  While i don't agree with her mum's methods, i know that it was coming from a place of love because she is worried about her.  

I just agreed with her, but she said what i thought above.  

I asked if she'd gone to her first therapy session and she said she cancelled it because she was too anxious about it.  

The problem is, i don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to push her away, because I know she needs it, and i think I'm the only person she has to turn to right now, but I have problems in my own life right now, as well as been super busy with work, and feeling guilty that I'm not spending much time with a family member who's going through chemotherapy. I don't feel like my ""cup"" is very full myself, and I'm certainly not qualified to say the right things.  
I don't think she realises, or can't admit, that she's depressed, but I am certain that she is. She's has says that she's not doing too well, and that she just wants to sleep all the time.
I am also starting to worry that if I don't, then things might get even worse for her, but I'm starting to get s tightness in my chest when I see a call from her. 

She needs to go and talk to a professional, but only she can make herself go - and she would be absolutely distraught and betrayal (and probably humiliated) if anyone intervened - but she is in such a state that she won't go herself.  
I thought about telling her that I'd drive her and go with her, but i honestly don't even have time to do that for the next little while. 

I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I won't to be supportive, but don't feel like I'm in the place to do it myself right now and am worried what will happen if i don't.",16Oct2019,1
529,"So my girlfriend and I just moved into a new apartment. Boy were we excited. 

It’s been a long time coming as we put down full deposit three months in advance after only seeing example show rooms. The apartment complex is very popular so this is acceptable. Suffice to say those three months were hell as our previous living situation was bad getting worse. (robberies, screaming neighbors, Karens) This was supposed to be our relief. Unfortunately not so much...

Just as we were getting ready for bed after a long moving day, my girlfriend notices blue white light flooding through the closed blinds. “It’s probably just a car” I tell her, “it will move soon” ...NOPE 

Open the blinds to reveal a street lamp not 5 feet from our street level apartment. “That’s unfortunate, but it will probably turn off at midnight” ... NOPE

Cold-white light emanates from closed curtains flooding the room in its glory from dusk to dawn. Both my girlfriend and I tossed and turned throughout the night. This morning she is fighting back tears because she is so tired for work. But what can I say... we are both tired.

Icing on the cake is I have to take heavy medication just to get normal sleep in normal conditions... otherwise hallucinating night terrors plague me multiple times a night.

I feel slightly tricked. I wasn’t allowed too see the apartment until move in day. This is an apartment community so they have control over their own street lamps. I walked around the entire community, mine is the only apartment with a lamp this close. Its construction was probably an afterthought when they saw the alley was too dark.

In order of likeliness I see I have the following options:

1. Buy eye covers for GF (I already have one)

2. Buy special blackout curtains 

3. Ask management to buy us special blackout curtains. (... maybe?)

3. Ask management to add a timer to turn it off for after midnight (I can already see them rolling their eyes)

4. Ask management to remove the bulb from the light entirely. (Haha yeah right)

5. Look up building code laws in my city and come at them with legal action (probably no such code)

What do you think I should do? Am I overreacting? I’d really like some advice.

Well I landed an amazing job.   Finally.  My kids deserve so much more opportunity than I've been able to give them.  We have lived on 1200 a month or less this entire time.  Which is doable here.  

But now I'll be making over 3000 a month, which for this part of the state is A LOT.   I just want to be smart is all.  

My only thoughts are always out 10% in savings.  Maybe start an account for each my kids to throw money into for when they are older.   Life insurance.   

But also living pretty similar to how I am now.  I do want to own a home in the near future.  

I dont want to go overboard. But not gonna lie, my first few months I will be spending money, I mean right now I have blankets for curtains.   My kids sleep on a mattress on the floor, no dresser, its really poor.  

But I'm seeking real advice on how to he smart with the money.   Other than saving money, I dont know what else I should be doing.  Of course giving to people is a top priority.  So many people have helped me during these 10 years, now I want to be the one to help.

531,"So here’s the thing, I have grown up in a less than ideal family. What I mean is my family has lacked compassion, understanding, and mostly manipulates everybody emotionally to do things for each other. I don’t know if these issues stem from family tragedies or they existed long before that.

Regardless, my current issue is turning away from one of the few family members I still care about. My nephew is only 8 and I love him a lot. There are very few things that I wouldn’t do for him. 

Unfortunately, his mother is unbearable. She and I have never gotten along. She always finds ways to talk badly about me and compare me to her sister (being that she is “better than me.”) I will say I have been a mess over the years because of my mental health. I do have a history of borderline personality disorder (although, it’s a mild case), major depressive disorder, and some anxiety issues. But none of these health problems have ever directly affected my nephew. I really do put my best face on for him.  And I’ve maintained school and a job as best as I can. I will also mention that most of my issues with my brothers wife are because I wasn’t able to perform at a certain level due to my mental health. I did miss payments on things and just didn’t participate in family functions because I was drowning in depressive episodes. She also doesn’t believe in mental health. It’s all a big excuse to her. 

I am 27 (f) and recently had a birthday. I wanted to take my nephew to the movies but my brothers wife insisted I go with my mom. If my mom isn’t there, I don’t get time with my nephew. This isn’t new and she always puts in place rules over her kid that includes when, where, and with who I can see him with. I really try to jump through her hoops because he is the only family I care about. But it’s becoming too much. It’s also hypocritical how she doesn’t require these things for her way younger sister or her family in general. 
I will admit I have pushed away and did not bother getting close to her daughter to avoid a similar power struggle. I have tried talking to my brother about it and he refuses to touch the topic. He keeps referring me on to his wife and saying that it’s not his business which I disagree on. 

I have never truly confront his wife head on because I know she won’t be receptive to what I have to say. I tried having a heart to heart with my brother and mom once that she highjacked. She basically told me to grow up and get over the fact that I didn’t have a childhood because she didn’t either. She helped raise her two sisters while her parents worked. Although, I grew up raising my dad with Alzheimer’s when I was in high school, saw my dad beat my mom because of his illness, was molested by my brother, and lost a sister in a sever car accident at age 8. Events that significantly altered the family dynamic and lead to my moms neglect towards me. (She basically checked out and raised her depression after that. I can’t say I blame my mom for that because she was given some shit cards.) But My brothers wife will never see how she is wrong or accept she has judged me too harshly. She has all this resentment towards me and expects me to not feel any toward her. I don’t know what to do. The stress from this relationship is impacting my mental health. But I do love my nephew, I don’t want him to feel abandoned.  So what should I do or say? Does anyone see a solution ?",16Oct2019,1
532,"I got married about 5 months ago to my longtime girlfriend. We were together for roughly 8 years prior and the two of us have been deeply in love throughout the years. There was some distance between us on and off through that time but we stuck together throughout.

In arguments prior to marriage I would have some anger when in conversations with her when she got upset or held something against me, but I did a good job of calming myself and talking through it with her when she would open herself up. When she is angry she will often keep quite and just disengage from the conversation entirely. That frustrates me immensely, but in the past I have been able to look past it and hang at her emotional level while she works through things. This frustrates me though because I will have to stay upset while she works through things even though I would like to move on. She is also prone towards anxiety and depression, she has even said at times she has had suicidal thoughts. I have been there to help her though it, and I often stay at her side through dark moments. She is currently untreated, against my advice, and her mother is no help because she thinks she should see priests rather than therapists.

Fast forward to now, we married, moved to a new city, and are living together for the first time. Her mother never let us live together prior to marriage. My wife and I are having arguments nearly every night since moving in together. I have had very few angry outbursts in the past (childhood mostly) and throughout the relationship I haven't have never called her a bitch or told her to shut up, which I have always thought were horrible to do. Now I find myself boiling and saying stuff like that over the past few weeks. The agrevator has been her telling me to clean things and to be places on time, which I have trouble doing now that I have so many more responsibilities. I have had moments through our time being married when I have tried really hard to do things right, clean, cook, etc. However, these efforts have gone either unnoticed or disregarded because there has been something else I messed up. I am being held to unattainable standards and she is yelling at me over every mistake. When I fail to do something I try to express my grief but am being ignored. She gets frustrated and tells me her tone and her feeling are something I just need to deal with.

My thoughts have been getting darker throughout this time. I know she has her own issues but the constant disappoint and failures that I am feeling are making me resent her. I have had thoughts of hitting her, shaking her, and worse. Anytime we argue and she cries or zones out now I just want to disengage myself emotionally and relax on my own. This frustrates her and makes her resentful but it is the only thing I can do to make things better for myself while I wait for her to work through things. She tells me she wants to be left alone in moments where she gets quite and upset, so now I am trying to enjoy myself rather than slump along with her. This makes her think I am heartless but honestly I am just exhausted of getting upset over these things.

I do truly love her. She is an amazing person and a great friend. I fear that in one of our arguments I cross the line and do something violent towards her and forever shatter everything we have had. If there are any resources that you can suggest as well that would be appreciated.",16Oct2019,0

539,"We dated for 3, almost 4 years, she was honestly my favorite person to be around for a while and we loved each other a lot. I mostly ruined the relationship by being an ass to her, but she wasn’t perfect either. 

We had different goals, different values, and we just weren’t that compatible although I thought it was worth it because of the love we had for each other. 

It’s been 2 months and she’s a completely different person and it’s crazy. She’s dating some guy who posts shit online like “Don’t push me, I would kill for mines”. She grew up with a rich family and works as an engineer. I literally just can’t fathom it. 

Anyway, I just can’t get over how she was everything to me and now I want literally nothing to do with her. Even after the breakup I pretty much begged (sad, I know. Never talk to your ex, learned that lesson) for her to try again and now I just wish I could erase every memory of her. 

I hate that she knows everything about me, hate that I wasted so much time. I learned a lot from the relationship and how to treat someone but I held on for way too long.

Problem is I still think about her. Some days a lot, some days not at all. I just don’t get why or how to stop it. She was such a good gf and person, it’s hard to accept she’s just not the same anymore. I never thought she was like stunningly pretty but now that she’s gone I do. It feels like my idea of her isn’t what she really was but I can’t think of much negatives when we were together. 

Also feel forced to rush into dating now. I’ve seen 6 or 7 girls since the breakup, a few were just hookups but one I really liked but that got messed up because my ex and I tried to work on things. I just feel so codependent and like I need to find someone quick. Like when I only get 2 matches for day on tinder or if I don’t have a date or plans lined up for the weekend, I just get really down. It sucks and I don’t know how to change that feeling. Before my ex, I was perfectly fine with being single. Feel so mentally weak.

However she asks me how to handle it and I don’t know to be honest. The problem is if she talks to the parents they won’t believe her its messed up but that’s the way they are.
 
She asks me then to find a solution to this before my wedding.

I contacted a few of them recently and tried to meet them, but they kept delaying so i gave up.

I'm now a last year engineering student and i haven't made a true friend in that school in 5 years. I improved a little compared to high school, but i'm still as scared as back then.

 I'm looking at potentially giving up the job and going to uni to reskill, however, everything i find online is very rigid in its explanation and can't find anything about the actual experience. If any of you have done something similar, I'd appreciate some advice from someone who's actually been through the process (although I'll take it from anyone at this point).

I live everyday in fear and anxiety that something might happen to others simply by being near them, which is why I try my best to avoid people.

548,"So I have a boss who moves at a quick pace. I'm often left to my own devices and when I make the wrong decision, I'm forced to justify why I did things the way I did.

How can I handle these situations without resorting to tears? It's worth noting that I'm a 30 yr old female and I feel like I'm constantly living up to that stereotype of a sensitive girl.

I feel like I internalize rejection like there is something wrong with me. If I dont receive praise or do something less than perfect, I feel like a failure. We just had a meeting and he told me he trusts me, I'm doing a great job, and he was definitely sincere. I think my problem is that it's hard for me to differentiate between personal shortcomings and just a speed bump at work. I am very critical of myself so when I'm asked to justify myself, it's hard for me to stand up for myself and I just crumble and say okay you're right. I'd like to be able to suppress the need to cry and feel hurt and instead find it within myself to say, well this is why I did what I did.

552,"**Context:**

* I have been part of my work social committee for a year now. Over 2019 we have organised a series of social events for colleagues, some of which have been a hit and others a complete dud.
* We are an engineering company, at a site with 250-300 people, which is roughly split in half between ""office staff"" (finance, law, engineering, operations, I.T. etc.) and ""shop-floor staff"" (machine operators, cleaning, maintenance etc.)
* Gender split is roughly 70% male / 30% female
* We are very much a legacy business when it comes to aspects of the company culture and the business practices we use (although this is beginning to change)
* The workforce on site is largely 40yrs+ (I would estimate 80-85%) with a smaller group of younger newer joiners, including apprentices, graduates, interns, junior managers etc.
* Based in a suburban trading estate, with a few small-med size towns surrounding (i.e. not a city with easy access to lots of venues)

**Current State / Issues:**

* According to the committee veterans we have been seeing less engagement from people over the last few years, with this year in particular being the first where we've had to cancel a decent portion of events due to lack of response
* The most successful events are the yearly regulars (Xmas party, West End Theatre Trips, Go-Karting etc.), the newer events we have tried have been less popular and/or cancelled, including quiz night at a local pub, inter-departmental softball, cycling for charity, pool tournament, canoeing &amp; segway day (Go Ape)
* Communication is limited - upcoming events &amp; updates are shared via a site wide email blast (which shop floor staff don't see). Shop floor staff are supposed to receive an update from their managers during weekly meetings or check the social committee ""board"" in the cafeteria
* The business culture is quite segmented by department - for example, an engineering or finance team can easily organise a quick meet-up for themselves after work and get 30+ attendees, but for site-wide social events, if 1-2 people from a team cant go, then the whole team will often follow suit
* Management will rarely ever attend events except for the xmas party
* The social committee itself has been shrinking and we only have representatives from a small portion of the departments and none from management
* Budget wise we have not had many problems so far and finance are happy to provide additional funding if we can demonstrate that it would get us to engage more people, however we are not given a company card / account for spending and all ticket purchases made by staff have to be cash

**Help Needed:**

Advice for how we can go about engaging more people to get involved with social events, such as:

* Types of events (large and small) that may appeal to various groups / demographics
* Ideas to improve communication 
* Advice for running an effective and representative social committee

Or just other general advice you may have.

561,"Hello. Long time lurker. First time poster so here I go. A little long but I need some advice.

In June, my boyfriend and I got engaged (yay!). We've been together for 6 years already and a lot of our individual friends have become both of our close friends. We've chosen our bridal party already. I chose a girl for my maid of honour that my fiancee introduced me to and we hit it off quite well. So much so that the four of us recently went to Europe for two weeks with her husband. Over those two weeks, we learned that they are both a little selfish and unwavering in what they want to do, even if it inconveniences other people. They want what they want when they want it. I completely understand because in certain situations you have to do you but it was a little out of control and just rude. 

A little bit of backtracking: in August, we invited all our bridal party together for a fire and it was so much fun. We had a wine tasting with everyone to help choose the wine and it felt more like fun than work. I suggested to the group, with reassurance from my MOH, that we get together every 2 months or so to hang out and closer to the wedding date (April 2020) we can do more planning stuff. We have each of our siblings in our party so we wanted to make it a fun environment and not an awkward day off. Everyone thought this was a great idea and kept saying that they have been in parties before where not everyone really knew each other. Okay, great! Well, we plan to get together at the end of this month (October). We vote on the best weekend and my MOH says she can only do one of the weekends. That's fine because it worked for everyone else. We finalize the plan: we will play two games of laser tag and then go out for drinks with everyone and their significant others. Everyone is excited and we are good to go. This was all planned and finalized **at the beginning of September.** 

Fast forward to two days ago when my MOH says that she will come for laser tag but will be leaving after to go to a Halloween party she and her husband were invited to. No apologies, just straight forward - no room for argument. I explain my frustration to her that we had the evening dedicated to hanging out with everyone in our bridal party, even my brother who is coming from out of town and that we chose the one weekend she said she was available. She says, word for word ""well our plans have changed and this party means something to us. We are excited about the laser tag"". If anyone knows laser tag, they know we won't be there for more than an hour. 

Up until then, my MOH has been pretty flaky and not willing to help with anything wedding related until about 2 months before the wedding so this just felt like the last straw for me. Well, with my schedule as a professional wedding photographer, I have to have mine planned out a little more in advance because I'm booked solid up until our wedding. What should I do about this situation? Up until now, I haven't responded because I just feel hurt and disappointed. Since she has been flaky should I ask her to step down? She is very difficult to talk to because she just talks OVER you, making it really difficult to get your argument across.",16Oct2019,1
562,"To provide some context, I'm located in Toronto, with over a year of IB exp currently in the active process of recruiting.

All they asked for was my resume, and written answers to interview questions. I never once met anyone for an interview or even spoke to anyone on the phone - I'm pretty sure this is abnormal in general, let alone for finance.

I have some things going on, I am in a few sports clubs and enjoy days out, but whenever I meet a girl I'm just so socially awkward and I become detached. I only seem to socialize properly with other guys because that's what I'm used to. 

This is my first proper time interacting with girls frequently after leaving college. I attended an all boys school then moved onto study IT at college where it was a sausage fest that had only 1 girl in the class. The rest of my time was spent in my room playing video games, or out with my male friends, so interactions with girls have been quite few and far in between my entire life. 

I'm no longer that invested in isolating myself to play video games and I now prefer to be around other people, but I struggle when girls are around. I guess I'm just not used to seeing them as potential acquaintances so the immediate idea of ""girl = relationship"" that I've taken from movies makes me socially awkward. I'm not a creep about it but I just don't seem to be as compatible with girls as I am with guys, I cant have an actual conversation with a girl because what do I even talk about?

My boss is in a completely dysfunctional/semi-open marriage (don’t ask don’t tell/ let’s see how long we can avoid a divorce for the sake of the kids sort of thing) with three children. I am single and it was the first time I’d ever been pregnant. It was an automatic decision for me to have an abortion; despite the fact that I had managed to fall in love with him, there was no way I would have a child with a married man (let alone my boss). Given the fact that I am his subordinate, and the fact that one could argue he opened up far too much of his personal life to me; arguably spent months covertly seducing me, and that he has a family he would have had to explain an illegitimate child to, nevermind that he would lose his job and reputation, he had a ton more things he was jeopardizing by getting me pregnant than I had to lose. So he freaked out, and ended the short lived affair just days before my abortion. Throughout the normal gamut of emotions I was dealing with- love, resentment, worry, you name it- he has been brilliantly supportive financially and emotionally even more so. But today, five months later, this situation has proven to be brutally more difficult on my end. I have decided to leave the company as he is too senior and tenured there to exit without suspicion, so I am in love, heartbroken, unhappy about having to job hunt now, and mostly resentful that a decision I made and the suffering I am experiencing left his life unscathed.

*Introduction:*

Anyway, my husband and I moved in with his best friend and his two roommates in the house that his best friend owns last May. We had previously been living in this crappy house in a bad neighborhood because it's expensive as hell to live here and my company sucks. His friend had just broken up with his ex (who he bought the house with) and he needed help with the bills. This worked out for everyone because between the 5 of us, no one has a ""good"" job. The job market here is pretty bad. That August, my car broke down forever. I didn't have the money to put a new engine in an 18-year-old car that was basically made of problems. My mom came down to try to help me find another car because I needed someone to drive me around and even though I'm 30, I still look for an adult's opinion on things. Everything at the used car lots was very high mileage (200,000 plus) and didn't seem like it would last. My grandma had passed away in May and my mom already had a lot to deal with, so she wanted me to buy a nice car so that she didn't have to worry about coming 2 hours to get me if something happened. I bought a used rental car that I had to get a loan on and suddenly had a real car payment for the first time in my life. My insurance went up, because I had to have full coverage per my lender. Car insurance is already high down here. I am now stuck with $473 in total monthly costs for the payment and insurance.

One good thing is that my mom is settling my grandma's estate (still have to sell the house and my grandpa's antique car) and has said that she wants to pay off my car when she gets her part of the inheritance. 

Other stuff about me that might be relevant: I  work a crappy job where I only make $34k a year. We do not get raises ever, there is not room for promotion (and even if there was, you only get maybe 3-4% as a raise) and it just sucks. I have been here for over 3 years because this was the only company that was hiring when my contract ended at a temp job. I have been trying to actively get out of here for over a year now, because I have a master's degree and a decent resume, but it seems like everyone here wants to apply for the handful of good jobs. CareerBuilder sends emails letting me know 250-300 other people have applied for the majority of those jobs. So it's pretty hard to get ahead. 

My husband is currently working with a doctor to get disability for a handful of issues including a sensory processing disorder that makes him have very little spatial reasoning (and keeps him from driving), and bipolar disorder/depression that no one has been able to get a working combination of medication for yet. He doesn't have a ton of income right now, but does make some money doing needle felting, baking cakes and cleaning. He's a pretty good baker and trained in cake decoration, so I've asked him if he would be interested in running a cake business, but it seems like everyone and their mother does that. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The housing situation:* 

I mentioned that our roommate broke up with his ex last April/May. Well, when they broke up, she signed a quitclaim deed to sign the house over to him. They agreed that she would do that and he would do a mortgage assumption to get her name off the mortgage. But then her father decided that wasn't good enough. Her father talked her into suing my friend. I know this girl pretty well and I know that she was definitely pushed into it. But in any case, my friend got a lawyer. 3 months ago they did mediation and there was a settlement drawn up between the two lawyers. It was very much in my friend's favor if he did the mortgage assumption, very much in her favor if he did not. So, he got all of his documentation together, one of our other roommates agreed to cosign, and they sent everything to the mortgage company. They put him in the queue for review and sat on the application. It finally ended up on someone's desk and she sat on it even though they needed further information. He finally gets in touch with this lady (she rarely answers the phone or returns voicemails) and she tells him some of the documentation is blurry and asks for it to be resent. He resends the documentation. She just sits around not doing much with it. He keeps calling, she keeps not answering. His lawyer calls and talks to her and tells her there is a deadline and she blows it off. He physically drives to her office (like an hour away) to talk to her and she tells him that he's being overdramatic and that nothing bad is going to happen and that he isn't going to lose the house, etc. The day of the deadline comes around and the mortgage company doesn't even both to call to say if they've approved/denied him. He keeps calling until he finally gets her on the phone and she says that not only have they doubled the amount of money they need for closing and therefore need another bank statement but they also need all of the documents resubmitted to put him at the end of the line to wait to get his stuff processed again. So he didn't get denied, but it was already end of business on the day of the deadline, so now he has to sell the house. 

We now obviously have to move. The original idea was to stay in the house until it sold and work out a deadline to be out with the new owner, but we are concerned that the house won't sell with everyone's stuff crammed in it. I am also worried about showing while we're living there because everything has to be spotless, you can't have personal stuff up, you can't have pets in the house. The only person who doesn't work is my husband, and he can't drive so I have no idea how he is supposed to get our cats into their carriers and take them somewhere so the house can be shown. I am also not really ok with the idea of some stranger touching my stuff while I'm not there. 

I cannot afford to move out on my own with my husband because with our other bills, I can only afford maybe $500 and I have looked at (at least I feel like) every rental in this city and there is nothing that we can do on our own, especially with pets. I do not want to get rid of my pets. I have had my old man cat most of his life and he's almost 12. I know he wouldn't make it being re-homed because he hates other animals and no one else is going to put up with him. He's not a bad cat, just set in his ways. My car will be paid off eventually and my husband will have disability eventually, but I can't make a budget based on eventually. I also owe a ton in student loans, which has totally destroyed my DTI. 

I feel like I need to point out here that I make the most money. Like I said, no one has a good job. Everyone else's income ranges from around $15,840 per year to $30,048. All of these people are totally unable to live on their own in this expensive ass city. 

We have found a house that we would like to rent that is big enough for everyone and is in our collective price range. However, the problem is the mortgage on the current house. I realize that this is not my problem, but I also don't want to intentionally put someone in a situation where they are going to get screwed. So, after the house is appraised, my roommate can shut off the utilities and transfer them somewhere else. However, that leaves the mortgage. He and my husband had suggested that there are a couple of options: 1. We can help him pay this mortgage until the house sells. That makes like $147 each or another $294 on my monthly bills which is impossible. I had a conversation with another one of the roommates last night and she said that she doesn't get why we should have to pay the mortgage because it isn't our house or our problem. Which, yeah, it's not. I get that. Their logic is that it was also our home and that we should help. My husband comes from a family that will literally give you their last dollar or the shirt they're wearing or whatever and put themselves at a disadvantage to help someone else, but I can't do that. I have to put us (me, husband, cats) first. I would help if I could, but I just can't make that happen. 2. One of our other roommates said that the mortgage could be paid on her credit card for a few months. That's great and all, but eventually you end up with a $1000 credit card bill that the homeowner can't pay and no one else can afford to help him with. 

It has been suggested that we just move out and that he stops paying the mortgage. I have no idea how that works. I know it will put him in breach of contract and he will have to pay his ex's legal fees. I don't know if a house in default can sell or if it has to go to foreclosure. I don't know how much debt he'll end with. Someone suggested that he do that and file bankruptcy. I have no idea if that's a viable option. 

I do not want to be in this house any longer than I have to. His ex's dad is calling and harassing/threatening and everyone is paranoid that he will show up. A coworker asked me if her dad is aware that he is also ruining 4 other people's lives, and like I told him yes, he is, and that makes it better for him. He's just a douche and doesn't care who he has to screw over to get his way. I already had night terrors and even with medication, it is just getting progressively worse. It isn't good for anyone's mental state to keep dealing with this guy. The lawyer says there isn't much we can do about him. His name is nowhere on anything, by the way, so he's going way outside of what should be allowed. 

The only other suggestion that my husband has come up with is that we move to another state (5 hrs away) to live with a friend of his. There are several reasons that I don't want to do this ranging from superficial (I can't freaking stand his wife or their existing roommates) to the legitimate (he has just bought that house and I know how unstable his financial situation is- my friend had to take out a loan for him so he wouldn't get evicted from his last rental, he never has a job and seems to be living off of savings and a lot of the time they can't afford food) and everything in between like that I do not have job there and actually have a coworker from the area who says it is worse there than it is here, that would put me 7-8 hours away from my mother who I am trying to help settle an estate and I can't drive that much every weekend and I don't want to move my old man cat that far because I'm worried about the stress that would be put on him.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so freaking stressed out. I don't know what we should even a little bit do. I am hoping that somewhere out there is someone who knows exactly how any of us (myself &amp; my husband, the homeowner, the two other people) can move forward from here without being in debt for eternity or all ending up homeless.",16Oct2019,2

It’s been ten months now and while I am considering getting a better job and staying for another year, I really want to move home. I’m almost 25 and I feel so behind in life and I miss being near my family but know it is good for me to live on my own. 

The thing is I can only see myself living on my own for a while and feel like I’ll need to move back in with my parents for a couple of final years saving money, spending time with them, etc. 

I’m also having a difficult time making friends and now that I’m not sure I’ll be here much longer, is it even worth it to try to form friendships when I don’t see myself being this far from home long term? I like this city much more than my home state/town but I just have this guilt constantly hanging over me that I’m not spending this time near my family.

573,"people: A (the friend with the crush), B (the crush), C (the friend with the info) and D (secondary friend)

so one of my friends (A) has a crush on a guy (B). we were talking about it and when another friend (C) heard about it, she dropped a bomb on all of us

'you know he raped a girl that came to this school, right?'

naturally we were all shocked and believed it. we all knew the girl. she was very diplomatic, smart and didn't take shit from anyone, no one could've imagined something so horrible would have happened to her. i asked if she had gone to the police to which C told us she hadn't. that was suspicious to me.

fast forward to after school. A, D and I were walking to the bus stop and talking about C had said. i said that while i don't think she is lying, i don't fully believe her. saying that her lack of police 'involvement' was suspect to me. my friends said that they wouldn't do anything and i explained that filing a police report means that you are serious with the law about your claim.

 i also said that we may never know what happened; it could've been rape, they could've both been drunk and not communicating well/not realising the signs, she could've regretted it and said it was rape even thought it was consentual and it could've been perceived differently from both perspectives (the girl thinking it was rape and the boy thinking it was fine). we might never find out.

my friends got annoyed and called me a 'rape-o-pologist' and said not to talk about it anymore as C said not to tell anyone (which we obviously respect).

i need advice on how to explain to them i don't mean to come across as a rape-o-pologist but that i am just sceptical of her claims. rape is obviously a touchy subject and the 'defending of rape' (as my friends have called my reasoning for being sceptical, is not something they want to hear.

Last thursday, after a rough college day at 9:30pm, not many people around and there was a woman, with office like clothing, walking like 3 meters ahead of me on the sidewalk, and two guys there standing and as she passes by a dude catcalls her and says some nasty shit, to which I got mad and instantly said ""Shut the fuck up please, shut up"", now I didnt think it much, that was my reaction, I was in front of them and alone, none else there, it was stupid. I kept walking and the dude kept saying shit to me, to which I replied with a Shhh sign. Eventually I got to my bus line and he put himself in front of it, kinda far like5 meters and kept looking at me, I just smiled back at him. 
Yesterday again I was in line for my bus and he came and got in line behind me, when I noticed him I just looked at him, and smiled, didnt give my back until I was in the bus, of course he didnt got in the bus.

For my rabies treatment,i had to be injected rabies immunoglobulin and 4 vaccines.One on the same day,day 3,day 8 and day 14. I took the 3 first doses while i was at the hospital and had to go back to take the 4th dose.i also took a tetanus,pertussis and diphtheria shot.

But unfortunately my dad had a stroke and i completely forgot to take my 4th shot and  i only remembered when my local department of health called asking me if i took the shots because 2 rabid racoons and one rabid fox where found in my county. I took the 4th shot on day 27.Doctors said it would still be fine and it would still work.

598,"I am 26 and about half a year ago I got a full time salaried job for the first time. I genuinely considered declining the offer and asking for a contractor position instead, because I knew I would despise it, but I had nothing else and it offered health insurance, so I gave in and took it. I work in politics, at a non-profit research place as a policy analyst, which is just totally not something I would ever consider myself even remotely interested in. Adding to the issue is the fact that the place is very partisan in a direction that I at first kind of didn't agree with and now find totally laughable. I am required to write stuff and put my name on it, which is sending me into hours-long thought spirals about how I'm ruining my reputation at a relatively young age, because the first thing someone will see when they google me is the garbage I'm putting out, so it's beginning to feel like I'm getting myself stuck in something and there is no way out.

okay so, some rationality: im probably making my parents sound worse than they are! but i need to vent to people i don't know and who can give me insight.

so, my parents are anti-vaxx, homeopathic kinda people. i personally am FOR vaccines, though i am very critical of vaccines and ""big pharma"" because of my upbringing.

also, my medical issues greatly affect my life. i cannot function as a normal teen/adult and suffer mental&amp;emotional distress from my medical issues

my parents always doubt me and say i dont trust them if i want to see a doctor for something instead of listen to what they have to say. for time's sake i will make a list of what they have done to show what my situation is like:

- gained weight amd stopped having a period, mom said this was normal, two years later get diagnosed with PCOS.

- when i WAS diagnosed with PCOS it was from some midwives, and i know this doesn't matter much, but the midwife basically made a not-very-positive comment about my body type that really was unnecessary, and upon seeing me, at that. 

- got bronchitis, was painful. parents said it was ""just allergies"". until i had a fever. they still said it was allergies, you don't get fevers with allergies.

- put me on a gluten free diet for two weeks to test if i had Celiac's instead of taking me to get tested

- had a blood test and tested positive for liver enzymes and kidney stuff. did nothing about it

- did weightlifting and had awful pain in my hips, sometimes couldn't stand up. parents said it would go away. it didn't. they took my to a chiro and turns out i had a lateral pelvic tilt which made my muscles do abnormal things

- chiro was a person they trusted, who also did nutritional stuff? i didn't lose weight with what he was doing and he said it was bc of toxicity in my body. followed up by saying i should take more supplements or have a coffee enema 

- anytime i have an issue it is ""you need probiotics, you need these supplements"". my stomach has not been normal for a LONG TIME (my bf actually pointed it out cus it's normal to me at this point) 

- anytime i have pain or a mental health issue, it's always a ""me too!"" from my mom 

- had gynecological issues, she wanted me to go on probiotics. went to the gyno and found out i had two infections (not STIs, just stuff you can get from having female biology)

- went to the gyno again and get told they can't help me. they recommend i go to a hospital in a big city in my state to go to doctors specialised in my problem. my mom is hesitant and wants me to go to a nurse practitioner she trusts.

- promptly get kicked off of medicaid bc they want my disabled (he has been refused disability but he IS disabled) and impoverished father to pay them for my medicaid. 

- have mental issues (undiagnosed, obviously, but they are there) that have been addressed by family, friends, and therapists that (probably?) impede helping myself with any of this

- my parents never taught me to drive, and so i cannot drive anywhere. this is just something i thought was important.


my therapist says this is borderline medical neglect, but i don't know? oftentimes i doubt my own feelings of what is happening but i know i need something and don't know how to get it. i have waited years for medical help, but im 18 soon. should i just wait or is there something else i can do? i don't know.

And despite looking for a job every day, I haven't been able to find anything.  The job market looks really bad for someone with my lack of experience and I hardly get any interviews at all (only a couple in all this time).

I feel deep hatred for my employer and despair at my situation.  I feel like they took advantage of me, used me, and threw me away.  I feel like they sold the position as being one where they would really train me, but they were more interested in just using me as low-skilled work, forcing me to figure out everything on my own, so that they could go on holiday a lot and understaff.  And when they got what they wanted, they replaced me with less qualified (education-wise), part-time, lower paid contract workers.  I managed to get some experience, but not nearly enough.

I hate feeling like this.  I can't move on because I can't find a job.  I can't accept it or dismiss it as unimportant because my life is in pieces.  And all I can think about sometimes, when I am not just miserable and despairing, is how I wish to destroy them and their business because they would deserve it.  They ruined my life.  What can I do?",16Oct2019,1
609,"I have been working as an order picker in a warehouse for nearly 5 months. I was fine with the work at first because I was getting some income in but after about 3 months in, I dreaded working there so much that I want to quit. The thing is I'm saving up for a car and I want to  be able to quit with enough money to buy the car, insure it and still have thousands of pounds in my account. All I've been thinking about every time I go into work is that car but I then remind myself of what I have to go through in order to get it.",16Oct2019,7

614,"I am currently working two jobs. One as a waitress in a restaurant (that I love) and one as a administrative assistant in a clinic (that I despise). 

The clinic has regular office hours, and I make less in a 8 hour day than if I were to work a 5 hour shift at the restaurant. I like working both solely because I want to pay off my debt in a few months and I can do that with working every day. 

Health benefits do not matter to me because I’m under my dads insurance, and the time off policy at the clinic is attractive (8 hours for every 2 weeks worked). However, I hate it. The workload is insane, the patients are sick and miserable, and I’m a germaphobe. It’s not the industry for me whatsoever. 

The restaurant doesn’t have benefits but I love what I do. I love making people happy with food  - it’s a passion. 

Do I grind out the clinic work until my year is up to stick them on my resume/pay off debt? Or do I take a full time waitress job and make great money in tips? I’m 23 and live independently.",16Oct2019,1

616,"Idk if this is a tradition in other countries but here we like to almost die every time it’s our birthday.

Me and two friends are celebrating together and at midnight it’s tradition to take the same amount of shots as the age your turning while everyone films it. I’m turning 20 and I’m going to die.

I can drink plenty of rum but I was gonna share alcohol with another girl who doesn’t like: rum, vodka and sugary beverages 

Does this leave me with anything? I’m not a fan of gin.

It would be really embarrassing to throw up and I don’t do that well with sugary drinks either. Any suggestions for something that won’t kill us?

617,"Right now I want to get better at talking to girls and dressing. This is because I'm sick of being single, pretty much, and of girls not really being interested in me. I'm not ugly, and my social skills are actually really good, but I have a lot of social anxiety with women, and I don't dress too well. Purely for context, these developmental stunts both go back into an overprotected childhood.

The thing I'm worried about is the title of this post. It's all well and good me learning how to dress by observing what looks good on other people, then going clubbing and incrementally building my way up to hitting on women (although this is unfortunately going to mean a lot of cigarettes in smoking areas). I'm also joining a speed dating society at my uni, so that I have to go on blind dates sober.

All this being said, deciding to improve myself is fundamentally rooted in an idea of me not being good enough as I am. I don't want to get stuck in that, or to hand my sense of validation over to some stranger in a club because she's a woman. I want to maintain balance between feeling 'good enough' and working on myself. How do I do that?",16Oct2019,1

622,"so this has been the worst year of my life.  
in chronological order its started with the very traumatic death of my dog which set off PTSD, my partner of 5 years attacked and strangled me unprovoked, which resulted in me losing a job (its happened before work and we worked together at the time, i was unable to start my shift and consequently left) i became ill and had to have surgery, my mum and her partner of 20 years (the man who raised me) broke up, my mum was then diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer with 5 months prognosis, left my home and move in with my mum to care for her full time with no money, me and my boyfriend broke up because of his lack of emotional support and the fact he strangled me and its took me a few months to process what had happened. i then went on the first night out in about 2 years and i got spiked and ended up in hospital for a week, leaving me 2 stone lighter and practically skeletal and weak at 7st. that was 4 weeks ago now.  
as of monday my mum is now in remission with all our hard work which is amazing, but i feel dead inside.  
i have no friends, every relationship ive been in has been abusive/neglectful, i have an incredibly low self esteem right now. i used to be an artist but i hate every i do so now i dont do it. my circumstances force me to remain active but i feel like a vacant robot carrying out tasks.  
i take 40mg of citalopram for anxiety/OCD, i also smoke weed every day to help me sleep otherwise i lie awake for hours thinking about horrible things.  
im alone alot of the time and rarely speak to anyone other than my mum.  
ive been worn down alot over the last few years but this year has felt like someone has ripped out my soul, organs and brains and incinerated them.  


i just cant express enough how absolutely catatonic, numb and hopeless i feel. if i didnt have such big responsibilities and i werent so stoned everyday i would have killed myself a long time ago. i dont know what to do. i have to keep going for my mum but i just feel like im rotting away.  i dont know if anyone can help me or im just shouting at a brick wall but this year has really really really sucked. how to i turn it around when i have no support?",16Oct2019,24
623,"A couple of months ago I aced my uni entrance exams and got into my school of preference (biology major). About 2 years ago though, I realized I was more interested in pursuing a career in law. Because of the way the system works in my country, it was too late for me to change fields, so I decided to give biology/this field of studies a shot.
Classes started about 3 weeks ago and I'm pretty sure I hate this field of studies. I know it's too early for me to judge, but I hate going to school. It's so hard and I have absolutely no motivation whatsoever. I feel like I'm wasting my time, but I also feel like if I change schools now, it'll be like throwing away all the effort I made to get to this point. The last 2-3 years of my life will be thrown away, and I'll have to start over.
I could go through these exams again but since law school is in a completely different field, I'd need at least 2 years of preparation on subjects Im not that good at (history, sociology and ancient Greek), so that's another 2 years down the drain (as these subjects have literally nothing to do with law school), and I'm not even sure I'll get into law school on the first try.
I could study abroad but it's a huge and costly decision, and I'm pretty sure my degree wont be as valid as sb's who has graduated from a local university and studied local law instead of international law. I don't even know if I'd be accepted as a legitimate lawyer in my country with a degree from another country.
I could finish the degree I've started and then sit for another set of exams specifically designed for individuals who want to get a 2nd degree, but then I'd be throwing away my degree in biology (another 4 years down the drain).

Furthermore, the uni entrance exams here are national so most kids move to another town. These exams are kind of a huge deal as they're really hard, and I got through them thinking that 'as soon as this is over, I'll move out and get the hell away from my abusive parents'. However, as I did very well, I got into the university of my hometown so I'm still staying with my parents.. They won't let me get a job bc ""I should focus on uni"" and they obviously don't see why I wanna move out. I talked to a friend about moving in together and she's interested but it's not happening this year. Most of my friends have moved out, so I've been spending most of my free time at home. Unfortunately Ive only met very few people in uni and I don't feel like I click with any of them (with the exceptions of like 1-2 kids). I've been feeling like shit. I hate going to school, I hate coming back home, Im too exhausted from school to go out with the few friends that didnt move out either, and I'm just miserable. What do I do?

 Now, you should know she wasn't just some distant relative I heard about once a year. She looked after me when I was little, and we were good friends ever since I remember.

She decided to quit smoking at 80, and a couple months later, she was clean. Hasn't even looked at a cigarette since. Point is, I loved her and looked up to her. So when I felt nothing hearing about her death, I knew there was something wrong. My dad said it's ok to cry, but I wasn't sad. I am still not. Not even a little bit. The news didn't affect me at all, and I find that worrying. Thinking back, I haven't cried a single time since I was like 10. Is there some mental problem that prohibits intense negative emotions?

I'm 18 and currently enrolled in community college. I don't really know how I got here, it was just what happened. I was torn between going to university and this (I know school isn't the only option, but it felt more secure?) so I flipped a coin. Literally. Now, I have to choose what to get my associates in and I'm completely clueless. I hear people telling me to get a general degree, like business, but then I see so many others saying that is not wise unless you plan to get a bachelors. I don't know if I want to pursue further education or not. But I have never had any job experience and feel like the only truly secure path is to have accomplished something before you are out of high school, or to have an inkling of what you want to do. I dont fall into either of those categories. All I know is that I want financial security and to not feel like I am wasting the resources of those around me (time, money, space, etc.) But again, even when I think of pursuing something potentially lucrative, I feel hesitant towards everything for no apparent reason.

Furthermore, I don't have anyone to go through this with. I lost all my friends when I moved and am too socially incompetent to try to make new ones. I tried talking to an advisor about the school situation and they essentially told me to come back when I actually had a plan. So I guess my question is: what is the best option for me when I don't feel anything towards any path? I mean I genuinely have not discovered anything I'm interested in, even in the slightest.

Some times I don’t want to go near them. One example is at lunchtime. They take up half a table. I always sit at the table right next to them because that’s were my best friends are. Every time they do something disgusting with there food. One time one of them had chewed and unchewed goldfish coming out of their mouth. It was so gross that I almost threw up and I didn’t want to eat my food. All the time people have food on their face, spit on their face, spit on their food. It’s so nasty. Another thing is that they swear. I know it seems not that bad to swear, but I am in middle school. You’ll get detention or suspended if a teacher catches you swearing. My problem is that their swearing is unnecessary. They just swear to swear. They act like they are sooo cool swearing. It’s sort of annoying. Another thing was we had bouncy houses but 2 of the girls wouldn’t go on them because “eww, germs”  They are overreacting. It’s not like people who went on before were naked and had Ebola. It’s a bouncy house where fully clothed, not sick kids have gone on. I went on the bouncy house multiple times. I didn’t get sick. But the problem is that I don’t have very many friends.

647,"Hi. I know you guys read shit like this a lot and I never wanted to be a cliché but here I am. I don’t know what to do. For context, I am a bi guy and I lean more towards girls but this one guy was really a part of my heart. I do theatre and I am 17 years old. Me and him met when I was a junior and he was a freshman, I was 16 and he was 15. We were in a show together and I knew I liked him. He knew too. I went to England and we started dated while I was in England. Everything was great. Then I came home, we went on a pretty awesome date. It was amazing. Then a few days later, he broke up with me. He refused to answer why until like 8 months later so those 8 months were extremely dark for me. Since then, he has wanted to be friends and has since come out as straight I guess.

Here are my sentiments. I really liked him, so so much. He is so cute and sweet and happy all the time while I’m more reserved, cold, and depressing. For some reason we balanced each other out so well. It has been a year since then. We have had our ups and downs as friends and he thinks I am 100% on board with being friends. I’m really not. It hurts every day knowing he is straight and there is now nothing I can do about it. It hurts every day thinking that he never liked me the way I liked him. It hurts most knowing that I’m never gonna get a chance to just—love him.

I accept that he’s straight. It hurt A LOT in the beginning but whatever it’s cool, it is a part of life and I would never try to toy with his mind and force him into experimenting because that is something only someone gross would do.

649,"I'm kind of stuck and getting frustrated with a situation that probably shouldn't even be one. I'm trying to distance myself from a friend. We'd only been friends for a year or so. Main reasons I want distance are that the person always tries to lump in personal chores with hangouts because they don't have a car. They call/text/message at all hours, (like, one after the other, if I don't respond right away because I have a life outside of my phone) and it's often requests that seem reserved for more of a family member or best friend, such as bringing them grocery shopping or coming over just to sit on the couch and do nothing. They always need rides everywhere. And they always have their face in a screen when I'm trying to make conversation. To their credit, they offer to pay for gas and offer gifts and things. But friendship is more to me than transactions. I don't feel any kind of connection. I feel like it's just been one big chore/charity thing, and I just don't want to be part of it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I started distancing myself, this person has been clingy AF. Trying constantly to pin down a hangout date and not getting the hint when we're always busy or saying no. They've been relentless about either hanging out or figuring out why I haven't been responding. Their nagging has been going on for months now. They took to messaging my spouse when I started blocking communication. Normally people tend to get the hint and back off, but now I'm being forced into some kind of confrontation, which I hate. Yes, the cold shoulder is not the right way to deal with things but my options seem to be: put up with them, or be honest, which is going to hurt them.

&amp;#x200B;

My preference is always to be honest, and I could just tell them what I wrote above (in kinder terms). The complication is that we have mutual friends. I do still want to hang out with them, but I don't want to be the person who complicates THEIR plans by not being able to get along with this person. But at this point in time, seeing this person would be extremely awkward given how aloof and avoiding I've been. And then there's the drama: Us hanging out with the friend group without this person, then the person finds out and drama. I'm too old for that s\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards just being honest with this person so all of us can start moving on. To get down to advice, maybe someone has a good way I can put this to the friend in question? I'm pretty sure it's going to hurt regardless but ... I dunno, that's why I'm here. And if/how to bring it up to the friend group?

650,I (18 F) go to a community college and realize it is not for me. I feel like I’m not going to get anywhere with it even though I work hard in my classes. I come from a family who came all the way from a different country to give me an education. I want to drop out so bad. I feel like I’m wasting my time. I’m not in student debt due to scholarships I’ve earned so I got a full ride to college. I don’t want to tell anybody because I’m scared of what they would think especially of what my family would think. I feel dumb for making a decision like this but it’s what’s in my gut. It’s mentally exhausting being a full time student and working full time (I have my own apartment due to family problems) should I just finish college and get an associates  to make somewhat family happy or should I do what makes me happy?,16Oct2019,5
651,"So a bit of a back story first..

I just got out of a 2 year relationship because we had to move away from each other and things just weren’t going to be able to work out. I had two dogs with her that I miss dearly, and I miss the little family that we had. But while I was in the relationship I was always looking for something better and looking toward the future and I didn’t really know why because it wasn’t typically like me. I realized that I was just still struggling to recover from a prior relationship and jumped into another too quickly. I knew things had to end and I knew my move was coming up so I let things ride until the end. She was still my best friend during that time and I loved spending time with her, trying new food with, traveling with her, and mostly joking with her.I still love her but I’m not sure I was ever in love with her. We still remain somewhat in contact, wether it’s sharing news or her sharing photos of the dogs. But I think that may be where the problem is.

So we ended things probably mid September (I don’t remember which day or week) but I didn’t expect to not be able to move on. I knew I needed time to myself but once I started getting it I started feeling lonely. Even around my family who I see everyday I felt lonely. So I started hoping someone new might enter my life. So this week out of the blue a very attractive girl who I used to kinda talk to like 5 years ago DM’d me and asked me out. Without thinking about it too much I just said Yes and made and figured out a day we were both free. 

Now I’m feeling regret for some reason. It’s one of those things where it’s hard for me to even figure out why I’m feeling this way, and when I start to think that I’m just not ready to date yet that’s all that really seems to hit home. Other things are maybe insecurities or other things that any person would worry about before a first date, but when I start thinking about my ex, I just get super sad when I think about dating already. 

I think with this I get to see the humor in the universe though, be careful what you wish for or you just might get it is certainly applicable to my situation lol. It’s very interesting to me how in my mind I thought so badly that I needed someone new. When all it seems I actually needed was time alone to heal.

So my question is should I just be honest with her and text her now and let her know the truth on how I feel and leave the door open for a possible future date for us, because I have been interested in her for a while. Or should I just suck it up and go on the date because I don’t want to let someone else down. I really don’t want to let someone else down on this one and it’s the biggest thing holding me back. I’ve been dubbed before and I know that it kinda hurts. So that’s my fear is hurting somebody

652,"I really enjoy being in that type of environment where someone is explaining something and I’m there learning. 

I consider my self someone that’s intelligent, but not so sure if I’m able to get a scholarship, also for me is impossible to pay for it, to be quite frank Im not even sure to be able to afford even the lowest pricing. 

I’ve been thinking about options and doing lots of research, nevertheless maybe there’s people that can help me with this situation. 

My country is not an option since the education is really bad, we’ve some sort of dictator, terrible economy and also way too dangerous. So this means that I would have to study abroad which is not a problem for me if I’m able to sustain myself and I’m not breaking any laws or stuff. 

I finished high school at 16 and sold everything I ever owned in my life which wasn’t much and most of the things were presents, with that money and the help from my god father (mostly my god father hehe) I was able to go to study English in London for 11 months, there I took the decision that I wasn’t going back to my country due to all the problems that are going on in there, only for you to get an impression once I was protesting against the government on a Pacific way and suddenly everything went crazy and somehow I got shot. Not cool at all. So I decided that I was going to China. 

After I knew I was coming here, I started to collect every single coin that I had, and with that money that I gathered in London and some of my moms savings I was able to come to China. I’m currently here studying Mandarin. I don’t really know for how long I’ll be here. Most of the time I’m just looking up in the internet ways to study. 

I enjoy lots of things, filmmaking, writing, economics, everything related to technology and languages somehow they come easy to me, might be that I speak Spanish as mother tong and is really similar to french, Italian and Portuguese and I don’t even know how I learned english, just one day realised that I was listening to a movie rather than reading the subtitles. 

I really appreciate any sort of comments, even if you wanna tell me to “go fuck my self” (it has happened in the past while looking for advice) it’s fine, I know this is difficult, but you only loose when you give up. 

Ps. About asking family members or things related is impossible, I only have my mom who can give all her emotional support but in an economic way she can’t I don’t blame her. I also straight up asked my god father if he could pay it for me and I’ll pay it back trough the years and he kindly told me that he couldn’t so those options are out of the way. Also I’m not an European citizen or any citizen of other cool countries. 

Also, I know some people might have questions about maybe London or China or my Home country, or anything else so feel free to ask. I’m sort of an open book

667,"**Gun Violence**

Gun violence is a huge problem in the United States of America. There are more than 300 million guns in the nation, that’s 89 for every 100 people. Naturally, of course, there’s a lot of violence committed using these devices.

Mass shootings are defined as an event where more than 4 people are shot. These used to be rare, shocking events, but ever since the Columbine High School shootings of 1999, it has become increasingly common, especially with schools and racial hate.

One thing that’s often blamed for this increase in mass shootings is video games. Conservative politicians love to claim that shooter games and other games that involve realistic violence and killing cause people to eventually want to commit these acts in real life. Every single study that has investigated this matter has disproved this theory, except for one, where the results were inconclusive. This is only because video games have only been around for about 30 years, so it’s a new, scary thing to some older people.  


Another thing to blame is supposedly mental illness. It is often said that twisted people who have mental problems commit these mass shootings for a sick thrill. While this is a tempting thing to believe, studies have shown that it’s no easier for a mentally ill person to bring themselves to do these things than it is for a typical person.

Finally, there is the gun control debate. Gun laws in the nation have polarized many of us into 2 sides. One says are gun laws are too lenient, and the other says it is just enough. People have suggested that stronger background checks, restrictions on certain types of guns like assault rifles, or even banning guns altogether.

It’s sad to say that none of these solutions will permanently solve this problem. Background checks do not stop people with clean records, who are about to commit their 1st offense. 

Also, assault rifles and mass shootings are not responsible for the majority of gun deaths in the nation. Most of these come from handguns like pistols and revolvers, used by for-profit criminals such as gangsters, robbers, drug dealers, and carjackers; this kind of behavior will sadly never go away, as there will always be people who want to take nice things away from others without payment. 

Banning guns will actually make the problem worse, as they say, “if you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns”. There are way too many guns floating around for a full ban to be effective. Even if the majority of them are handed over to the authorities, people such as the types of criminals I listed will still be able to keep a surplus of them, and it will give gangs and cartels more power. Just like how banning marijuana only gave gangs and cartels more power, because the only place you can get it is from criminals who are also engaged in other, much worse activities.

I believe that the real culprit here is the news media. The way the media reports these mass shootings is messed up, and needs a complete overhaul. First, no matter what they always announce the shooter’s full name, giving them fame and notoriety after murder-suicide (most mass shooters don’t plan to live afterwards), which is what they wanted in the 1st place. The victims are shown as a simple number of kills and injuries, a lot of them don’t even have their names announced. This causes potential mass shooters to treat the news reports as a sort of leaderboard, and try to kill and injure even more people when they’re ready to pull off a shooting of their own. They don’t see the victims as people, only numbers, because that’s usually the way the news media shows them.

Whatever the cause is, it is clear that this problem needs to be solved. It is naive to think that violence will end altogether, it’s in our DNA after all. But people need to get into the minds and hearts of troubled school kids and racially hateful people, that's one way we can significantly stop this problem. After all, the mass shooting problem in America is only a relatively recent one, let’s return to the good old days.",16Oct2019,0
669,"So my best friend invited me to his group of other friends, and It was like 5 of us.

673,"\[It's long, sorry in advance\]

I met him on Tinder, 1 month since we started seeing each other I told him I wanted to be exclusive. He said he wasn't seeing any other people either and let me delete his Tinder and Bumble app myself.

I've been to his office, met his friends, and I'm on good terms with all his housemates. He invites me to events he has going on and always makes me feel welcome. He's been to my workplace, met my roommate and some of my friends too. He's always welcomes me to his place, and I stay over at his place nearly every other day because he lives really close to my university. He's sweet, he always prepares dinner when I study till really late, and when I bring up my concerns he addresses them maturely. When I asked for him to take an STD test with me, he did (I did need to remind him a few times), we're both negative. I also spend thanksgiving with him and his housemates yesterday. We give each other a lot of space when apart, but when we're together for nights in a row it's still always fun. All in all, he's a really great guy with ambition, and I've honestly come to like him a lot.

The thing is, I have a gut feeling that he doesn't want me on his social media, because whenever he uses his Snapchat I feel like he's trying to hide it from me. The other day, he saw me using Snapchat and and said ""oh you're using Snapchat too?"" I replied ""Yeah, wanna add each other?"" Then he said ""ew, no,"" and walked away. He said it in a joking tone, but I felt like he used the joke to try and cover up the fact that he actually didn't want to add me. I didn't say anything, so we really didn't add each other in the end. A few days later, I asked a second time in a semi-joking tone ""why don't you want to add me on Snapchaaat"", and he said ""if you really want to, we could add each other, but I'm trying to get off social media so I was planning on deleting it anyways."" I didn't say anything, and we still didn't end up adding each other.

To be fair, from what I know, he really never uses Facebook or Instagram. I also feel like my concerns are dumb because there's really nothing much to hide on Snapchat. If he wanted to hide his stories from me he could, and messages could disappear as well. so there's really not much to hide? The only thing that I could think of was that he didn't want to become best friends (there's an emoji that indicates if you are) with me in fear of losing his best friend status with someone else(?) I tried to ignore my concern because I felt like I was being ridiculous, but what I learned from the past is that my gut feeling is usually always right.

So this morning I asked him the final last time. ""Is there a reason you don't want to add me on snapchat?"" And he laughed. (TBH I think my fixation on Snapchat sounds stupid too.) He said if I really wanted to add him I could, but he really is trying to get off social media. I told him what I've really been feeling and I said that for some reason I don't fully trust him, and I feel like he's a ghost since we don't have each other on social media. He replied ""so you think that adding each other on snapchat will be more real than what we have in person?"" And I didn't know how to reply to that, because what he's saying is technically right.

To be honest I really don't care if he adds me on Snapchat at all, I barely even use the app anyways. I just need a validation, something to prove that we're actually a thing. I feel like only interacting on imessage is so.. nothing. I wouldn't have cared this much in the past, but I guess because I've been with a guy that has tried to hide me from others before, I'm especially wary about my presence now. Also, he just moved to this country two years ago, so his family don't know about me (which I'm okay with since we're not technically a couple right now). My two sisters know about him, but they haven't met him yet either. Also, his Facebook profile photo is still the one of him and his ex (who's in his home country). What I'm trying to say is that I'm technically non-existent to those back home for him. He also said a long time ago that he's not sure how long he's planning on staying in Canada, but he's really enjoying his time so far and isn't planning on leaving anytime soon.

So I asked him if he thinks what we have is casual, because I figured if he doesn't end up wanting this to be serious ,then all my concerns are a waste anyways.

He replied that he thinks things are getting more serious. I told him I like him and I'd like things to be more serious, and if not, I'm can't continue this any longer because I don't want something casual. He said he's not sure right now, and I told him that's okay, and he can think about it. I did say however, that if he doesn't want to, I'd rather him tell me early on so I can get over it, then for him to try and protect my feelings and drag this on. I also said I won't wait for his I don't know for long, and he said he understood.

Was I too strong? I've already postponed this talk for a while in fear of rejection, but I know that isn't the solution so I brought this whole thing up today. I just need some advice on how I should approach this situation. Is there something I'm doing wrong? How long should I wait for him to think?

Tl;dr

I've never been diagnosed with selective mutism (my parents didn't really believe in treating mental illnesses with medication, I just turned 18, and I don't have a driver's license yet) but I suspect I have it. I didn't speak at all in school in 6th and 7th grade, as well as sophomore year. I thought it was pretty much over but it's been starting up again and I really need it to stop.

Physically, I can speak just fine. There's nothing wrong with my vocal cords. And I'm not shy either, I have no problem with doing things that would embarrass others. But when I get overwhelmed and feel like I'm not being listened to, I just shut down and can't speak, no matter how much I want to. It can last anywhere from a couple hours to days. And I constantly feel the urge to just stop talking forever, but I do my best to fight it.

Does anyone have any tips to make the fight a little easier? Anything helps.

676,"I started as a stocker in a small retail store. Eventually got told that I needed to cashier so I did that. 

Write up 1: I was $15 short my first day as a cashier. As shitty as it was, I wasn't mad at myself, because I knew it was my first day. It's entirely my fault for miscounting/misplacing the money. It's something that I can change, and it's something that was preventable. 

My second write-up, the one I just got, I'm a bit more pissed about. Again, this was my first job, so I'm basically being molded by my experience here - and the team here is god awful. At least, that's what it seems like to me. When I started as a cashier, I wasn't taught how to do returns, how to do tax exemptions, this/that. Every time I ran into something I didn't know how to do I had to call the manager on the spot and watch the line pile on. After that she would proceed to be upset with me for being too slow. 

Well, as a stocker, one thing I have to do is count my boxes. Every case I open I have to count it, write it down on a piece of paper they give you, and turn it in. One day while counting my boxes, the assistant MANAGER walks by and tells me it doesn't have to be specific. I can just ""bullshit it."" Keep in mind that this was during my first week on the job. This sort of carefree and nonchalant vibe was present all throughout the managing team.

So, a few months later, and I've adopted that attitude myself. I mean, the assistant manager told me it doesn't matter. And again, it's been months, so not being specific with my box count doesn't matter. I count what I'm opening, but I sometimes I forget and choose to just generalize it. I mean, it doesn't matter, right?

Yes it does. Today I turned in my box count, went to the backroom to get my stuff in order to leave, and the manager calls me before I can do so. ""Did you really stock X number of boxes today?"" I tell her yes. She tells me to show her my opened boxes. I then start counting them in front of her, and I was 15 short of what I had written down. She chews me out and tells me that she is writing me up for lying to her. I sign the paper, clock out, and leave. I'm so fucking angry right now I don't know what to do. Maybe it is my fault. Maybe it was obvious I needed to be specific. I don't know. It was my first job, and this is what I learned so I went with it. Whatever is to blame I just need to vent. And need your advice. Should I stay here or quit? Any help is appreciated.",16Oct2019,0
677,"I love my partner and he is great and usually treat me well. But I can’t help but think we aren’t compatible nowadays. We’re very different and we have used it to our benefit before. But I always feel like I am boring him. I try to talk to him about various things such as TV shows we watch, a podcast I listen to (he got me into the podcast), my day at work, books I am reading, my goals for the future, cool new recipes and health tips, and try to show him how to stretch (his back always hurts). I’m a very relational person who cares about health. I’m very fit and enjoy cooking healthy and eating healthy. 

On the other hand, my partner is overweight, drinks daily, smokes daily, plays video games till five am (on days he works even), and loves fantasy things. I try to share my interests with him and have light conversation after we get home from work but he seems to not hear me and won’t respond to what I say unless I get upset with him and repeat myself louder and ask if he can hear me. 

He regularly plays video games and I ask him if I can join or if we can play a game we can do together while I am over and he says you can watch me play this game and tell me what to do! So I try to do that and he disregards everything I am saying and doesn’t even acknowledge me when I talk about his game with him, so I end up reading. I try to tell him some fascinating things that happened in my books (about the holocaust, corruption, segregation, other political/moral issues) and he doesn’t respond. 

In addition, he only initiates sex with me once a week. I am turned off by him because he has gained lots of weight so I don’t initiate. I never tell him anything negative about his appearance because I am afraid to hurt him but I dearly wish he was active and fit like me. He never compliments my body and hardly touches me. I feel unwanted and unloved. I get more stares from strangers than I get from him. 

He knows he annoys me when he plays his game and apologizes after the fact. I am so turned off that I am dating someone who finds multiple fantasy games more exciting than me. He act like a child on Christmas when he unlocks an achievement but can’t even get excited at the prospect of actually doing the things he does in games like hike, scuba dive, ski, etc. I love doing those things in real life but he can’t afford to go so instead I go alone. 

I feel like he doesn’t even like me that much if he does something he knows annoys me but can’t stop, like how he can’t stop drinking and smoking. I don’t understand why he treat me like he loves me and appreciates me. He gets more excited over a game than being with me or doing things with me. He also only fucks me once a week. It’s like he only fucks me cause he remembers if he doesn’t initiate them I’ll be hurt. 

Edit:
He also is really into naked women art and said he kept a list of women he has fucked and a secret file full of nudes exes sent him and said he kept them as trophies.

I’ve discussed all these issues with him. It’s frankly pretty demoralizing to have to ask someone who supposedly loves you to pay attention to you. If we were really meant to be I wouldn’t have to feel so shitty about this because he would treat me like a human being

WHAT CAN I DO TO CHANGE? I DONT WANT ALL THE BLAME TO FALL ON HIM, WHAT ACTIONS CAN I CONTROL? Am I truly boring? Am I unworthy of attention? 
Am I asking too much of him? I am so fucking bored of him.

I’m afraid to leave my bf because he says he keeps nudes of exes on his phone because they’re trophies and I’ve sent him nudes before knowing this",16Oct2019,0
678,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",16Oct2019,0
679,"I started my real first relationship about 2 years ago. We pretty long despite differing personalities completely, and her abusive nature. She would scream at me for just about anything, including not responding to text fast enough (like 30-40 seconds that long), or playing video games together and I wasn't playing the way she liked, or w/e. 



Anything small turned into a 4 hour long argument of me just going ""can we just drop it and go to bed, I really don't see the point of arguing this long""



Well, I finally pulled the bandage and dumped her about 3 months ago. The problem is I met a wonderful girl about a week later and we feel pretty hard for each other. She's actually wonderful, makes me much happier, is very sweet, and never says a horrible thing to me. She's very understanding, and even listens to me talk about my feelings about my ex.


But for some reason I'm always thinking about her. What she's doing, who she's talking to. She recently started seeing a guy and for some reason I care so much. I check her social media, what she's doing etc, I refresh it constantly. And I'm getting scared. Cause like I really don't know why I give a shit?


I wouldn't get back together with her, even if she wanted to. I genuinely don't even like her. She was a massively evil person. But, I really care that she's gone, and it's been eating me up all day for the past 2 weeks. 


Like I don't want her, but I want to know what she's doing and I'm confused, it scares me. I just want to focus on my current relationship and be happy, cause she truly is perfect.


I guess I'm just upset that she was so abusive to me, and now she's moved on and is looking happy and great to other people, it seems not fair... I guess.


I'm 22 btw, and my ex is 24 if it matters.


I just don't know why I'm acting like this?",16Oct2019,1
680,"Okay so I work in tax in public accounting. Yesterday was the 10/15 deadline, the team has been working insane hours for like two months. I haven’t had a day off since August, have been working 8:30ish-11,12,1 a few times almost every night. There was a event at a bar to celebrate the end of busy season.

I’m a new hire (July) and this has been so so rough. I also rarely drink, so this is so out of character for me that I’m shocked that this is even a problem. Guess the stress got to me. But the whole night, the lines b/w professional and unprofessional were very blurred anyways. People were getting pretty tipsy. We barhopped to another place, and then went to a coworkers house (more drinks). I didn’t throw up, no slurred speech, but I was drinking god knows what out of the bottle at this point, I’ve never done this before in my life. The worst thing I did was basically say I’m horny and sorta hit on another coworker who is a level above me- I’m sure it was interpreted that was anyways. (I’m female). Again, this is so so out of character for me and I’m never been more ashamed. I’m actually pretty shy and quiet in the office.

The night ended with me trying to lay down in a chair, and the manager helping me down the stairs to an Uber they called.  Yeah, idk how to handle this. Can I get fired for this? Ugh😭😭",16Oct2019,1

682,"Hi guys,

I recently started a new job (5 months ago) in a successful tech company that has an image of being cool and fun. 

The job I'm working in is not what I studied in college or what I did my Master's degree in but it's a totally different subject either. It's a reasonably well paid job, but it's in an area of the business I have no real interest in and I hate my boss as he is very aggressive and demanding. He has a reputation in the office as being unpredictable and difficult. I like a lot of people on my team and the teams around me. However, I dread going into work everyday. Sometimes it's okay and I come out feeling confident and that I'm finally getting a hold of things while other days I want to just quit my job and never go back. 

To make things worse, due to the location of the office and the levels of traffic it takes me 2 hours to drive to work some mornings and sometimes 2 hours to get home too which basically adds another 20 hours to my work week.

I feel like this job is making me depressed and is affecting the relationships in my life. My girlfriend has even brought it up that I don't seem myself or as happy as I used to be. 

The main reason I don't want to leave the job is because I want to move country next year (August) and I need to save money so I can do this (which this job allows me to do). Also, if I leave the job now it would look pretty bad on my CV/Resume when looking for future jobs. 

What I want to know is should I stick it out and try and get a year on my CV/Resume and save my money for my plans to emigrate next year or should I just cut my losses and get out now as I am pretty miserable.

Love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks 🤠",16Oct2019,0

After I told the L I didnt want to date them, they got very passive-aggressive and mean towards me. But I kept telling myself its fine and that they will get over it someday. However, I had the last straw when something horrible happened to me and I told L about it and L didnt even care about how I was or if I needed anything. In fact the worst part was that L even asked me to reach out to the person that harmed me because they needed something from them which didnt make any sense to me. Since that day I broke off total contact with L, i stopped talking to them, deleted them from everywhere and basically removed L's existence from my mind.

Now about 2 years after they reached out to me twice (mind we are in the same uni) but they ended up deleting the messages (twice) because I didnt answer. And everytime I've had my IG open they check my story. Now 3 years later L wants to follow me even and its such a slap in the face. Like dude you can't even look me in my eyes and apologize? and if not that you cant even text me that?

I honestly dont care about that person anymore but I just dont know how to act in the sense where I still want to respect myself cause I didnt for a long time cause I let them be really mean to me until i had enough.

690,"I am a full time college student, I work an internship 2 days a week (Tuesdays and Fridays for 8 hours total), and I recently got a job at Starbucks. Last year, I played college lacrosse for a different school (I transferred). That took up ALL of my time and the time left, I used for schoolwork. I thought I could handle all 3 things (jobs + school), but after being hired I realized that it's way too much for me. 

I am scheduled 4-5 days a week at starbucks at various times. My shifts are all 5+ hours and the commute is an hour one-way (the other places I applied to either didn't call me back or when I called the manager wasn't in) so I just settled for one that was far away thinking it would be fine. I live in Chicago so I take public transportation to and from my jobs. I have to take the bus for part of the trip (but the bus stops operating at 8pm and Starbucks closes at 8:30). I didn't know the bus only went until 8 (I am VERY new to public transportation). I had to text my manager an apology  and ask if there was a way to tweak the schedule so I could still make it to the bus. He replied with ""I'll take a look and see what I can work out."" But if he doesn't work something out, I literally have no way of getting home. The nearest train station is over a 40 minute walk away and I am not about to walk 40 minutes in the dark in Chicago by myself.

I also recently asked him if I could transfer for holidays because Starbucks employees are required to work 3/5 major holidays. I live in WI when I'm not at school and my dorm is closed over Christmas and New Year's break so I can't work there even if I wanted to (I'd have nowhere to stay). I don't mind working holidays but I felt bad asking him for something so soon after being hired. I asked for that a couple days ago and then asked about the bus situation. I want to tell him the commute is too far and I am being scheduled too much but I already feel like such a nuisance. I am not normally a needy employee and I have worked for long periods at other service places and I always keep my head down and never ask for anything. 

I'd like to ask if he could help me transfer to a closer starbucks, but I feel so annoying.

Hey. So, I've made several posts on this matter, but it's really getting to me. I dated this beautiful woman shortly after my workplace hired her. We had great chemistry on the dates, but after the third date, she kind of seemed to grow distant, until she started to just become cold and hostile towards me. Not necessarily in an insulting or bullying kind of way, but whenever we see each other, she's just cold, never smiles, rarely says ""hi"", and seems to try to make it clear that she wants nothing to do with my existence. I haven't been a creep or a ""NiceGuy^(TM)"" or pushed anything, I've stopped making any small talk with her as I'm giving her some space, but she's been like this to me for about 3-4 weeks now. 

It's hard for me to develop feeling for someone, but when I fall for them, I fall for them HARD. Double hard, because not only do I have strong feelings for her, but she despises me in return for some unknown reason. Triple hard, because I have no idea *why* she doesn't like me anymore, and I want some resolve that I'll probably never get. Quadruple hard, because I have to frequently see her at work where she ignores me or gives me a cold, hostile ""hi"". Quintuple hard, because she's nice to a lot of other people, so it feels very personal and is wrecking my ego and self-esteem.

I can't stop thinking about her. I have maladaptive daydreams due to OCD, and I constantly remember the happy or funny moments we shared on our dates. Like that one little cute, flirty message she sent me over text. Or that funny time she mentioned she accidentally had her vibrator in her purse the whole time on a date. Or some random conversation that we bonded over. It just makes it so painful for me, because I just think about what COULD HAVE been. But sometimes I fantasize about darker things, such as me playing a cruel prank on her at work. I would never do such a thing, but I constantly want to stop obsessing over this. I hate this combination of anger, sadness, frustration, damaged ego, poor self-worth, and the such.

I used to love my job. I still love working there, it's my most favorite job that I've ever had, but it's honestly becoming a drag just to think about having to go there. Even on the days that she's not there, being at work constantly reminds me of her and how she treats me there.

I want to think more positively, because there's someone else in my life who is showing interest, and I would rather be thinking of positives like that. Not to mention, some of my co-workers who I love chilling with and talking to.",16Oct2019,3
696,"Throwaway account. I think the title makes me sound like an asshole immediately, let me try provide some context...

My boss is great to work with, I enjoy talking with her, we have great communication, she understands the things that are important to me and advocates in our organization on my behalf. Couldn't ask for much more in a supervisor. We work at a nonprofit, and almost everyone here is left-leaning, including myself. She's not. This comes up from time to time and it goes over OK by me letting some things slide, usually.

The thing that bothered me most is in a meeting some time ago she replied to someone ""I didn't vote for Trump! Well, I guess I probably did, since my husband filled out my ballot for me"". Her husband is an attorney for the government, by the way, and I'm pretty sure this is voter fraud. I think I made a joke about it to try and let this go.

I'm an immigrant to the US, and tomorrow I have my citizenship ceremony. It's been a journey of over five years (my process was relatively quick) and cost my family thousands of dollars in expenses. I'm not particularly patriotic, but I take my ability to vote very seriously. My boss mentioned we should celebrate in some way.

I don't expect my boss to suddenly become extremely liberal or anything like that. If she chooses not to vote in the end, well, that won't make me happy but at least it will be her active choice. I want to somehow communicate to her how much energy, money, and time I've invested in this process, to get the rights she's had from birth, and my hope she'll think more mindfully about exercising them.

This is probably not a good idea, but it also bothers me quite a bit. I don't want to be friends with my boss, but I still have a personal relationship with her.

However, I feel that I’m at that point in my life emotionally and idk maybe a little selflessly want my own space. My close friend has a room available that I can rent with him, but I’m so very scared on how to talk to my mom about this. I don’t have any idea how to start the conversation or what to say to make her feel like I’m not abandoning her. Any and all advice would be so appreciated.",16Oct2019,6
708,"I currently work full time job and make about 20k a year. I have never been paid as much as I am now, and its still so far from enough. I've been working as a line cook for about 7 years at various places in KCMO and this shit just isnt working out. I show up at these places, absolutely kill it, get early raises and never have problems getting scheduled full time, but this industry doesn't pay me enough to stay caught up with bills, to keep food in my house, to take care of my son. I have no problems with the job itself but I need more pay, like twice what I make now to stay afloat. I live well within my means, just short of skipping town and living in some cheap small town, so budgeting and cutting expenses doesnt help. I do that plenty on my own. I need to know how to break out of my industry and start working somewhere that can pay me enough to take care of myself and my family. I really have no idea where to begin or where to go. Only other things I know that might earn money is very small amounts of javascript(I'm a fan of rpgmakermv and make my own plugins for it, just for fun) and quite a bit about audio engineering as its been my main hobby since childhood and even sometimes get paid to mix, master, record, or do commission (less than $20 a month, its very casual.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am an online college student. I am in my fifth year but I still have 72 credits left to graduate. I took a year off and I started back up this fall semester. I have not been doing the work for the most part this semester. I just lack the discipline and focus. I try for a few days but then slack even more. I don't have any excuse and I know this is all on me. I am a CS major but I feel like I'm not smart enough at times and that I should just switch, but I really do want that and have tried to stick with it.

I have just been thinking about joining the military after this semester, that way I can feel I'm being productive and then continue my schooling just at a slower pace. Right now I am living with my mom and just work a part time job and trying to do this school thing. I feel trapped and that my life is just slipping away from me.

713,"So my husband comes from a really non-confrontational family, whereas I come from a very blunt / confrontational family. Honesty is the most important value to me. Keeping a calm environment with no arguing is the most important value to him. His whole family believes it’s better to tell people what they want to hear to keep the peace, rather than be honest. My family is one of those “brutally honest” families that are so far on the opposite end of the spectrum that it’s almost a bad thing. When we got together we agreed that both are families are too extreme... but the reality has been that I revert back to how I was raised and he does too. This has resulted in him doing “little white lies” all the time. 

To my knowledge, he has never lied about anything big like finances, he’s never cheated, etc. so I do trust him when it comes to that kinda stuff. The problem is he’s a really fucking bad liar.. and not only can I always tell when he’s lying, he also NEVER remembers the little white lies and outs himself all the time. So it’s not like I’m actively trying to catch him. 

For example: he’ll call me when he’s driving home from work, and during the call he’ll tell me that he just showered at work. Then a little while later he’ll be like I need to shower so bad, it’s been like 2 days since I showered. And I’ll say I thought you just showered at work? And he’ll be like “damn it! You’re right I’m sorry that was a lie”. Like why the fuck did he go out of his way to tell me he showered if he never did? I just don’t get it.

It’s to the point where this is a daily occurrence. We have talked about it ad nauseam and I’ve made it clear that I’ll always be more mad if he’s lying than I could possibly ever be mad about these stupid lies. In the example I gave above, it’s not like I would’ve judged him for not showering for 2 days... I have a history of depression and there were times that I went much longer than that without showering. I don’t get why that’s something that he felt he needed to lie about.

He knows how I feel about this, but he’s doing it anyway. Then what really drives me nuts is that he always admits he’s wrong and says sorry, as if that erases the fact that he’s ever lied before. But it happens SO often that I can’t just pretend like it’s never happened before just because he said sorry.  I’ve even told him that I don’t even want him to apologize to me anymore. He’s just deteriorating the words “I’m sorry” because he doesn’t mean it even though he says it ALL THE TIME. And then he makes no effort to change anything, so I’d rather he just skip saying sorry.

There have been a handful of times throughout the 6 years we’ve been together that I’ve basically said this is a deal breaker for me, and he’s always super mad at himself and apologetic, yet nothing ever changes. It might change for a day or two but it’s such a habit that he always goes back to doing it. 

I’m at the end of my rope. It seems so stupid to say I want to leave him for these pointless little lies but the thing is it’s every day. I literally don’t believe a word that he says, (unless I suppose it’s about something big). I never wanted to be in a marriage like this. Idk what to do. It feels like it’s too small of a thing to want to split up over, but it’s that it’s added up that bothers me. 

But then the reality is I’m a pushover, and I’m not going to leave him. I keep threatening it (if things don’t change), but nothing changes and I never do leave. Idk what to do. We can’t afford marriage counseling, so I’m looking for ways to deal with this on my end since he clearly has no intent on changing.  I need to maybe learn how to accept that he’s a liar? Or else I need a new strategy of threatening to leave or something?",16Oct2019,3

About 3 months ago I went through a crisis in my family and I started eating pure takeout. We didnt have time to cook at home so we ate a lot of take out. I stopped exercising within those three months as well. In all that time I have gained about 6 pounds, so I am at 127 right now. Just a few moments ago I ate a whole bag of chips by myself. It had been a while since I had not done that and I feel so bad. Next week I will turn 22 and I really want to change my ways again but it is so hard.

720,"Hello people, i've been really lonely for the past years, it was pretty much just me and at least some family. No friends or anything like that. Literally been sitting at home all day, didn't have a job.

Now things started to change a month ago when i finally found a job. Had to go through a training class for the job which lasted 4 weeks, met new people who are my colleagues now and we all get along super well. Went to the cinema with some of them yesterday and they even invited me to a games night on friday.

So you could say that things are starting to go really well for me.

However, today the training ended and I had my first few hours at the actual job. I work in customer support now so I speak to a lot of people on the phone. Immediately after my shift ended, I started to have a weird feeling which by now, 5 hours later, I think I identified as loneliness and fear of failure in the new job.

I don't understand that. I have never really felt lonely when I actually was lonely but now that I'm starting to make friends again, I am scared... 

I was just wondering if someone might have some advice for me or something, i don't really know.

I told him I’d help if he had a structured plan on what his organization would be and how he would keep things afloat but he told he doesn’t need a plan and just needs the grants to get started. 


I’ve told him countless times that people are not simply going to donate just because you have a organization, alas he refuses to listen to me.

729,"I'm a freshman in college. I met this girl who went to a high school where a lot of my friends from middle school went to. We started hanging out recently and have a lot in common, and both have been hanging out pretty frequently. What really made us start hanging out is that we have the exact same taste in music.

Friday night she invited me over to watch Netflix. We watched it for around 5 or 6 hours and I slept over in her dorm. We hung out again some more over the weekend and last night. We both seem to get along really well and I genuinely feel happy when I am with her and that I can be myself around her, and she seems to feel the same and be really open about things in our conversations.

The problem is that I cannot stop thinking about her. A few of my friends have told me that I should just tell her I'm into her to get it off my chest. However, that would not go well. She has a long distance boyfriend that she has talked about breaking up with. They are also in an open relationship, so she hooked up with some guy the other night. She talked about him all day Sunday and a little Monday but hasn't really mentioned him much since. She has also said that a lot of her friends are guys, and this makes me feel that I am just a friend to her.

734,"First of all, English is not my native language, so sorry in advance if this is badly worded or full of mistakes.

My (F/18) grandparents (with whom I live) have never really allowed me going anywhere alone. Throughout almost my entire life I thought this was normal, and that my grandparents would probably change once I was an actual adult. But it hasn't. They still don't allow me to go anywhere alone. Not to the cinema, not to a theme park, not even to the local grocery store. When I was in middle/high school, I wasn't even allowed to bike to my school, which was less than 3 km away from my home. (Where I live it's VERY common to go to school by bike) My grandfather insisted on driving me there every single day. The furthest I've ever been allowed to go on my own was to a swimming pool close to my old middle/high school, a couple of months ago. And that was only after a lot of begging and pleading. As small as it actually was, It felt like an absolute TRIUMPH to me. 

I have attempted to talk to my grandparents about this, but they (especially my father) won't budge. They'll say that the world is full of dangerous people. Which is true to an extent, but they're taking that train of thought way too far, in my opinion. 

But this brings me to the bigger, underlying problem: If I keep (politely) insisting/explaining my point of view, my grandfather will 9 out of 10 times go into this weird state that is a mixture of anger, passive-aggressiveness, fake apathy and self-loathing(?). It's hard to describe. He'll say things like ""Do whatever you want, I don't care."" or ""Everyone in this family always tells me I'm the asshole, I'm used to it."" Or he will compare me to my biological mother and my half-sister, both whom he despises. Stuff like that. I even remember him vaguely hinting at wanting to be dead. It will always make me apologize, even if I don't think I said anything wrong. Just anything to get him out of that awful mood. He's done this for as long as I can remember. Even over the most trivial of things, and it upsets me so much and often even drives me to tears, hearing him talk like that. I fear that one day he'll hate me like he hates my bio mom and half-sister. Which will mean my grandmother will hate me as well, seeing as she just seems to mirror whatever opinion my grandfather has. (She will also blame me for my grandfather's bad mood.) And if my grandfather has to talk to someone outside of our household while in that weird ""phase"", he will just instantly snap out of it and will act completely normal. Has anybody experienced something similar? I wonder if this would be considered emotionally controlling/manipulative behavior? Or is this normal and am I just too sensitive?

735,"So my current job, working at a pharmacy and there’s a couple of mean people that talk behind my back and one particular coworker who “teaches” me how things work but she sucks at teaching and treats me like I’m dumb. 
Well in my old job at another pharmacy the entire staff were blatantly harassing and bullying me and the other newbies, full on calling us “useless” and making a lot of my fellow newbies cry, no proper training either.

I had other jobs that weren’t pharmacy related and I had a few annoying coworkers but not to the extent of me wanting to quit on the spot.

So I’m wondering why it’s like this? Is there something wrong with me or what? Does this happen to anyone else?

The thing I recently noticed is that I feel in some way incapable of saying stuff to, for example, a good friend or an acquaintance.
It's like being scared or frightened that whatever you say, there is a high chance for it to have a negative effect in your relationship with that person. 
You get so many thoughts and worries at once that you just don't know how to act appropriately.
Hence, a barrier forms in my mind and I just can't say what I want to say.
Btw, the content is pretty much indifferent.
Like, it can be a deep topic or just a casual talk, it doesn't matter. As long as this feeling, this mental wall never goes away, I will have difficulties in telling them about my thoughts.
That's why I talk lesser and lesser with good classmates or need some time to respond when someone asks me for help.

Do you have a similiar situation or know what would be a good option to finally get rid of this unnecessary mental block?
I really want to be a help for other people but if I'm unable to honestly answer their questions, a half-assed answer which I will regret later (because it isn't what I wanted to say) will come out.

740,"I don't really know how to start this but my mom is seriously affecting my mental health at this point. I'm on edge almost 24/7 in our house. I try my hardest to keep my cool and ignore it but she pushes all of us. We all walk on egg shells trying not to piss off the beast. For example, these are real things that happen, if you ask where something is THAT she moved from the spot you put it, she'll start yelling and roll her eyes and eventually start raging about it if you can't find it. Or yesterday when I had to restart the internet for 5 minutes and it was such a big deal and she started SCREAMING and basically calling me selfish. (When I say scream I am not being dramatic btw)

Or another that just happened right now which is literally SO dumb but this shit happens EVERY SINGLE DAY.

I was making myself some food and she saw me do it differently than she usually does and said ""oh you should do it the way I do bc blah blah blah"" and I say no I do it this way, you dont have to tell me how, I make it everyday. She starts going on how ""you know everything okay yup go ahead you dont need me yup, you think you know everything dont you"" Obviously, I bicker with her back and fourth and she goes ""JUST STOP!!!!"" when I was literally replying to her own bullshit and whining. I try to ignore her and forget about it because I think she's over it, but no SHE KEEPS GOING about something SO god damn dumb. Constant fucking bickering and yelling about the stupidest stuff. I said ""maybe our dad deals with this shit but I won't let you treat me like this all the time"" I've started saying things like this more often because I am so fucking sick of it, part of the reason I'm asking AITA?

She went OFF. ""Shut the fuck up you don't know anything about marriage!! (She cheated on my dad in the past and CONSTANTLY treats him like shit)"" ""You should move out then"" ""I dont want to be in a house where everyone hates me"" ""Yup I'm just the worst mother ever arent i""

I called her out on being manipulative and not being able to take LITERAL criticism thats seriously affecting my mental because she just cries when anyone says anything to her.

Then she kept screaming calling me a little brat and how could I say things like that, and i'm making fun of her for having feelings by saying she cries.

Recently I've gotten more fed up with her bullshit and the past few years she's gotten so much worse and i've gotten so fed up. My dad just takes her shit and doesn't say anything back. He literally just walks on egg shells like me and my sister and she will STILL yell and belittle him and call him dumb for nearly anything he says or does. (He does do SOME obviously dumb things but she treats him so bad for this) He won't say anything back and oh, when he does, welcome to fucking hell. She'll mention divorce, screaming at the top of her lungs calling him a fucking asshole. It's a hell hole. It honestly is so bad and I really feel like recording it sometime just so she can hear how she sounds.

Almost everything about her is starting to piss me off because I'm realizing how much of a manipulative person she really is. Even her chewing food recently just sets me off and I have to leave the room. I know it sounds bad but I'm seriously so fed up.

I'm still in college and I can't move out right now, as well as my other issues to why I can't. So of course this isn't going to kill me but it's really fucking stressful. It's been years of this. After like 2 of our recent arguments i've texted her and told her she seriously needs to stop. She mostly responds ""it's my house i do what i want"" but eventually turns into ""ill try to stop yelling"" when she calms down. But she still never sees shes in the wrong.

Sorry for all of the writing but there was so much to put down and a lot of it was ranting as well as input. I'm in my room feeling bad now but this happens every single day and I for real am questioning if i'm the bad one here now. If I come out of my room she will start arguing again and trying to make me feel bad, or just roll her eyes at me and give me a mean look. It will be like this for a few days. When my dad comes home shes going to complain to him and get him to talk to me. when he himself has told me he knows how bad shes gotten.

Don't get me wrong, she does a lot for me and I love my mom with all my heart but these past few years have been horrible in this aspect.

741,"Basically I texted a high school friend earlier today after she posted a snapchat to her story and I asked her about it. After that I asked how was she and she answered by saying she was doing good and then proceeded to ask me how I was doing and what’s going on with me and how she didn’t know much about me or what i was doing. I answered back although I will admit it was a pretty dry response. I said: Glad you’re doing good. Uni has me exhausted too lol. I’m studying at “this university”. I don’t know much about you too. Where are you studying? I thought she seemed pretty interested in talking with me since she asked all those questions? Should I text her back or should I leave it like that? I wanna talk to her since I always thought she was pretty and we used to talk a little back then in HS but don’t know if I should and if you think I should text her back what should I say?

742,"The girl I have been rooming with for the past three semesters has been throwing her used pads away unwrapped in an open trash can where I can see it ever since we started rooming together. The first semester I noticed it but spent such little time in the dorm that I never really got around to confront her about it, the second semester was the same, but this semester I was vacuuming our room and when I went to vacuum under her desk there they were, in plain sight, in her open trashcan. I’m concerned for my health right now since a lot of pathogens can be found in blood and I don’t really want that wafting into the air I’m breathing. In addition, it is not a pretty sight. We have been very close friends since high school but she is going through a breakup with her high school sweetheart right now and she has been very touchy and sensitive to say the least. I don’t want to agitate her and ruin our friendship while she’s in this state of mind but at the same time I am absolutely repulsed. Am I overreacting? If I’m not overreacting, how do I get her to dispose of her feminine products in the bathroom which is literally two doors (a three second walk) down from our room and has the proper waste disposal receptacles?

751,"This is somewhat of a long story, so please bear with me and I'll try to keep things clear.

About 2 months ago, my girlfriend's mom started seeing this guy from Oregon. We live in Kentucky, however, she was messaging and calling him via Facebook Messenger. Everything seemed good at first. She told us about how good he was and she seemed genuinely happy with him, so we didn't think anything of it.

Fast forward to the beginning of this month, he flew here to Kentucky and stayed a couple nights with her. During his time here, she bought a car, IN HIS NAME, for them to drive back to Oregon. I was a little concerned about the car being in his name, but she seemed happy, so we didn't ask many questions. At this point, the plan was for her to move with him back to Oregon. So she packed up her things and left with him. 

Now, this is where things started to get out of hand. About a week after they left, we get a phone call from her boyfriends daughter saying that he called her talking crazy, saying he was going to kill himself. She said she couldn't get a hold of him, and for some reason, his own daughter didn't have his address. Luckily we had the address, so we called the police in their city and told them about it. So they went and checked things out and found that everything was fine.

After that night, my girlfriends mom started acting weird. She didn't call or text much after that. She would read our messages but not respond, which is TOTALLY unlike her. She loves her daughter and the rest of her family very much, yet, nobody could seem to get her to talk. She had 2 phones when she left, and they magically stopped working after that night. 

So here's the situation now:

My girlfriends mom bought a house for her and the boyfriend and they've been staying there for about a week. Neither of them have a job right now. The house doesn't have heating. She has a new phone and the boyfriend is always with her, next to her. She doesn't have a hint of privacy. He goes through messages of hers and listens to every phone call she gets. He is extremely jealous, controlling, and manipulative. They have absolutely no source of income. I am worried that soon, she won't have the money for internet or phone service, and we will lose her completely. I've been in relationships like this one before, and this is a VERY BAD situation. He is very high risk of hurting her, not just emotionally, but physically, as he also abuses drugs (worse than weed)... The worst part is, she is IN LOVE with him. Her SOLE GOAL is to make HIM happy. So she won't let us come and get her. The clock is ticking and it's only a matter of time before we lose complete contact with her, he hurts her, or worse. It not a question of ""If"" it's a question of ""When""

My question to you all is -- What can I do?? What can we do?? I would appreciate some advice!",16Oct2019,1

753,"I got my first dog, Honey, when I was 6.  I am now 19. She’s an elderly lab/retriever. And then my mum bought Delilah, a pedigree cavalier King Charles spaniel, around 5 years ago. 

They are everything to me. But my family treats them horribly. After Delilahs puppy fur disappeared my mum decided she’s allergic to her (she’s not.. she just wanted her because she wanted to show off a new puppy). They’re not allowed to be up and out of their plastic bed. If they’re spotted out of the bed they’re yelled at etc until they lay back down. So whenever I’m home I bring them to my room and let them do whatever they want up here. I try and make it routine that they spend every night on my bed so that Honey gets some relief for her joints. 

The issue is, my family hates me. In the last month I’ve been attacked, kicked out.. constantly yelled at etc.. I’m starting uni next year, locally. I desperately want to escape and stay in student accommodation but I wouldn’t be able to bring my dogs. So I’m kind of forced to stay here. I feel so trapped. I don’t think I could stomach leaving them. All I can imagine is sitting in a tiny student room, getting the text that honey has passed (she’s really old now and struggling) knowing she spent her last days in that stupid plastic bed.

754,"Some Asian boy my age moved into the school this junior year. I noticed he would sit alone at lunch, and when he sat with others he wouldn’t say much, he seemed shy. I sit alone at lunch too, I tried going over to befriend him but I was so nervous I broke down and couldn’t do it. 

I found out later her was a foreign exchange strident from hongkong, no one told me but I was able to find his social media and look through his pages. 

He didn’t look shy in these photos, he had lots of friends, family and school mates. He even played basketball, not only that but he has wonderful fashion sense. 

I decided to overcome my coward ness and try to befriend him, from the looks of it I’ve seen two girls hover around and talk to him but they don’t really seem close, and a group of kids would hover around him but ditch him later or just say hi and leave. He seems lonely.

You see I pretended to be happy, up until March of 2019, as my best friend, he started ignoring me for some reason and this sent me over the edge, everyday was hell for me. I couldn't pretend anymore. I sought out help from my teacher and was taken to the er, and of course they told my family about it. The people I've been trying to hide it from. My mom was worried as hell- it was the first time I have ever saw her cry and it honestly broke my heart. I have been on meds and been going to therapy since then, everything had been going well until this year. Ny teacher is really strict and gives out a lot of homework. (Geo, math, language, science, religion+ project) is your typical work day. I couldnt keep up. And Miss saw that some of my work was incomplete and she yelled at me. ""It's not fair that everyone else follows instructions and you just do whatever you want."" Keep in mind I have various extracurricular activities B-ball, Piano, swimming, tutoring, tae kwan doe. Trying to keep up is like running a marathon with a broken leg. And so, for this one project I procrastinated. Doing other homeworks, activities or taking naps. (I hardly get 8 hours of sleep) Yesterday I had to do the whole project after my activities, I got 3 hours of sleep. So I went to the school counciller to talk to her about my stress. My mom ended up getting involved. The counciller requested some of my activities be cancelled (the ones I didnt want to do)  and that my sister stop asking of me trivial things whilst I try to study (close my light, get my bag) my mom immediatly agreed to letting me leave swimming and math if it stressed me out.

from her perspective, she gives me the most time in her schedule because she texts me the most. she also doesn’t realize how much effort i’ve been putting in so she doesn’t think she’s short of effort.

after our conversation, she said she would try to make more time for me but she can’t guarantee anything because she has a lot to do. i decided to be content with that and believe her when she said she cares about me just as much as i care for her.

it’s been a couple days since then but our relationship has gotten very awkward.
she doesn’t text me as much anymore, and when i try to start a conversation she replies with short or uninterested responses.

I don't really care what people think of me but I still don't want to be annoying or a problem to others around me. I've dealt with depression and all that stupid shit before but I don't really have anything like that now I think.

So it's vacation for me right now so I'm just at home doing nothing like always, I have been watching a lot of anime tho I find it relaxing and it helps me just forget about school and all that.

And I feel more careless than ever like I don't have any reason to even get out of bed anymore.

I've always kept people out of my life, I don't know if it's trust issues or some other shit.

I went through a breakup a while back which shattered my confidence with girls more than it should have it only lasted two months. I used that pain, however, to start alot of new hobbies like Muay Thai, Boxing and I have just started a bit of dancing as well. I also have noticed I have started drinking on Saturday nights alot more than ever before.

 I am trying to rebuild my confidence with girls but now instead of getting hurt every time I get rejected I just don't care. I also can't seem to open up and connect with girls like I used to.

 I wouldn't say I am depressed as I never feel down. I just feel meh constantly. I don't know what is wrong with me. I have started new hobbies and enjoy them whilst I am doing them.

Thanks for the advice on how it went as I couldn't ask her this Monday because there was no opening to talk to her, she was too occupied on playing and chatting up with our other friends. So I couldn't ask her if I did something to make her feel uncomfortable.

 But recently I found out that she read my Reddit posts(a few days after I texted her that she was pretty) on my other account when my guy friend told me earlier today. ""Holy shit moment right there.""  She was the one who told my guy friend to delete the posts about her(which i didn't even specify but she knew it was her) on that account.  No wonder she told my guy friend the other week that if i will go then she won't go watch with them on that movie. As i forgot to mention on the last post that i was seeking advice on my other Reddit account. I deleted the posts that are related to her on my other account. Now that she knows I like her, I haven't had the chance to tell her in person. I don't know how to engage a conversation with her anymore.  I still try to act casual around her as it creates less tension.

771,"Ok so recently at my high school a big fight broke out, my friend was directly involved. Memory is hazy because I wasn’t there but have pieced it together pretty well.

What happened was my friend was my friend was making sexist jokes towards two girls and who I’ll call bob told him to stop my friend got angry at him and they started pushing while also one of the girls that he made a sexist joke towards is trying to kick him in the head. Now my friend doesn’t care what race or gender you if you are trying to hurt him he will retaliate. Naturally my friend slaps her in the face (gets a bit confusing here) and somehow pushes the other girls head in to a wall. By this point a lot of people were beating my friend up (about 8 people) his head was stomped on etc. after he got out of that however long later he was talking a girl (one he hit her head against the wall) and was saying “throw it at me” (she had a slurpy) and eventually she did. I understand that my friend asked for it but it’s not very mature to actually do it. He chased her around after getting it thrown on him (not sure how long). Later he went up to another girl and hit her in the back of the head (don’t know how hard or why) he then was crying at this point got a teacher and went to wellbeing

The next day another fight broke out while I was right next to him, it happened as follows (all different girls btw). Me and friend were sitting down and girl1 had enough room between rows to get to her seat, but because she hated my friend she pushed the table towards us for no reason, my friend pushed it back and I had to grab my laptop so it didn’t fall off the table, a conversation followed that he was abusing women (which wasn’t really true because he did most of his things with reason) anyway girl2 stood up and shoved the table full force into us, my laptop fell off the table and I managed to catch it. My friends iPad fell off the table and at this point he got really mad he stood up saying “I’m fucking done, I can’t take this anymore” and as he was walking out he said “you fucking bitch” pointing to girl2, the teacher barely intervened. People are completely disregarding the fact that girl1 started the first table push, and girl2 who would’ve broke my laptop if I didn’t catch it also my friends iPad managed to come unscathed by some miracle. 

EVERYONE in my grade hates him or at least dislikes him except me, even my other best friends hate him. My friend and 2 others got suspended. My friend cannot go anywhere in the school without getting yelled at by his piers saying “women beater” and other horrible stuff. My best friends at this point are starting to dislike me and I don’t know what to do. Do I stop being friends with friend that got beat up to please best friends or other way around, pls help

Two days ago when I got out of the shower, I was too lazy and hot to put on clothes, so I decided to just lie naked on my bed. My dad barged in without knocking, and I rushed to get under my sheets. However, he just stood there staring the entire time I was doing it, and then he started talking to me in a really weird tone to me. I’m normally really paranoid, and I was really weirded out about this interaction, so I decided to lock my door that night and sleep.

However, yesterday night I forgot to lock my door, and my mum went out to work at a night shift. I sleep with the fan on, and I normally put it really close to my face. When I woke up, the fan was on the opposite side of the room, which has never happened before, and I had a pain in my lower stomach and butt.

Management  made her stay after her shift (a demand not an ask) and forced to wait on the managers and deputys as they drank. As if that weren't bad enough a co worker of hers has been on a crusade to get her fired. Most recently she has used CCTV footage of my sister giving her boyfriend a single free drink (He works there too and every employee is permitted a single free drink a night so this was not against the rules at all but management is corrupt so whatever I guess) , and has used this as ammo to get my sister fired. She succeeded as my sister was given the option of either be fired or get the police involved. So she just let herself be fired which is bad enough but if they decide to change their minds  it could jeopardise her next job she is going for. Being the big brother I of course am fucking furious but I'm not an idiot. I know me going down there and starting a shouting match is not going to help/make the situation worse.

My boyfriend works in a job that pays around $3000 a month and is currently living in his parent's home. His sister also works and both of them are giving around 70-80% of their salary to their parents. His parents are requesting this amount specifically. This goes to house/business rent, debt repayments and general expenditure.

Realistically he has had no opportunity to save. The remainder of his money will go towards personal expenses and the rest will be for us on the weekends. I will often pay for most things because I know money is tight for him at the moment. I can see this being problematic down the line if finances become shared.

My concern is that my boyfriend's money situation is suffering because of his parents. I admire his sacrifice and I know he will support them to whatever cost - but personally it's difficult watching him struggle. I have tried to discuss it with him once but the conclusion was that he has no other choice. What do you guys thinks?",16Oct2019,6

After ending a call it goes on longer (Does snapchat save calls?) I have an s6.

776,"My dad is looking at buying a house, current we’re renting. At the moment, I (20year Old) &amp; my two younger sisters live at home.

He called me on my way to work asking if he could borrow money. He wants around 10k to go towards the house deposit. I want to help him out. 

My answer on the phone was I can but I want it written up, so all the legalities are covered. I feel like a bit of a dick considering he raised me. But I don’t want to lose all my money. 

It’s not really fair when this is most of my savings &amp; he expected me to say yes. He’s gonna be so pissed off later. But What am I supposed to do? The bank doesn’t give out loans without making people sign for the money they’re taking. Last thing I need is to lose all the money I’ve saved for travelling/life.

I don’t anticipate to lose out but I want to make sure I can’t. He’s taking it personal &amp; “Don’t trust him” because I said that. Now it feels like I’m going to be emotionally blackmailed for saying no. Ugh.

780,"After three years of residence, we are leaving our current apartment in December. Our property management company is notorious for charging for new carpets no matter how clean they appear to be. They bought the complex’s two years ago. 

The unit was sublet before us, so we don’t know exactly how old the carpet is, but it is at least four years old. A little over a year ago, the carpet was stained in the process of the new company’s renovation of our kitchen and, when it happened, a representative of the complex offhandedly mentioned that they would be replacing our older carpet no matter what when we moved out. If I’d thought of it at the time I would have made sure to get that in writing, but I only heard about the incident well after the fact. 

I know you only have my word for it, but other than the stain that occurred during renovation, the carpet is in totally normal condition for four plus years of wear and tear. No pets, no smoke, no wine spillage. Moving is expensive enough without an exorbitant carpet replacement fee. Any advice? (Or advice on anything else we can do to get in the property management’s good graces and make our move as painless as possible?)",16Oct2019,8

I would hear voices constantly an see things and I could also feel things touching me . To Add to to that was I made me in a state of mind as if I where haveing a panic attack constantly constant anxiety.  As well as spasms with my body . Well it has been almost 2 years sense I was useing heavily and seeing things has gone , feeling things gone , spasms almost gone unless im trying to sleep sometimes ill jerk parts of my body .
The problem is that although hearing things has dissipated,  from time to time at night or when relaxing in a quite place or randomly ill hear voices of people that are not here.  I can't control even tho I know there fake . Ive been working hard to stay clean I have relapsed in those two years and every time I did these symptoms would come back and last weeks to months.
Does anyone here maybe have an answer or can give me some advise on healing my brain . To a point to where I'll feel like a normal human again? As I have and will continue to be clean.

786,"To give background my family has been dealing with this terrible contracting company for five years now that was meant to fix our roof and has progressively made it worse and worse. The workers and owner are completely disrespectful and irresponsible and have never been easy to deal with. We finally were able to get into contact with them to fix the roof but they have only been able to come when my mom wasn’t there but, luckily, I have been home to make sure they don’t do anything. They came in on Monday and basically scraped at our ceiling for ten minutes then left so as you can see they’ve been a major help but I was meant to let them in today also. The problem arrises with how they were supposed to come at eight am and showed up at twelve pm after I had decided to lock the door. I am a minor and a girl and I don’t want to be home alone with the door unlocked while sick and falling in and out of consciousness for hours if that makes sense. Finally when he arrived many hours late he popped up to the house, jiggled at the door handle for a few seconds, then left and I was unable to let him in because I had to get my dogs locked up in the other room as I didn’t want to lock them up all day for fear that he wouldn’t show up. When my mom finally came home and I told her what had happened, she got really angry with me and then left and I haven’t had the chance to explain myself. I’ve looked into the company and all of the reviews they have are one stars with really similar experiences to ours. I also was able to find out that the owner’s son, who works with this company and has been near us, is a sex offender. I just don’t want to have to deal with this company anymore and now I’m scared that if I bring this up my mom will think that I locked them out on purpose. What should I do?",16Oct2019,1

Im not really here for advice nor pity.
Just wanted to make a little note or something.

Will this fix things? No.
Am I selfish? Yes.

I am a worthless piece of garbage who just svrews everything up. Its my fault that she is probably now crying. It's my fault that I am now crying. Everyone is mad at her and I but it should only be me. 

Maybe if I do this it'll distract everyone for a week or two. Give time to help her stop beating down on her. Maybe it'll help them see how worthless I was anyways.

All I know is if I don't do it now it'll be too late. We don't want a repeat of last time. We mustnt fail again or everything will be even worse.

How am I going to do it? Not sure. Maybe I'll just lay in the highway. 

Maybe jump off a ledge. Not sure...

I just want to stop existing because I know it hurts everyone else. Only a few people would miss me but I hope they'd move on.

That's my one fear. What if she doesnt. What if she follows suit. I know Id never know but it's immoral to put her through that.

But I've already screwed up this much... I dont even know why she loves me... Im literal garbage...

The only other person isnt a person but my dogs... Would dogs get over a death if they didnt know? I mean my parents would still take care of them but would doing this hurt them?

My jobs would also be upset. But mostly due to lack of a worker. Granted One is a dying job position and the other could easily hire someone new.  

But funerals cost alot of money... Hopefully they'll just throw me in the trash where I belong.

Sell all my stuff.

Make a profit...

791," So for years starting while I was in college i've had crazy ideas. My baby that I want to use to fuel all my other ideas is a solar powered bio fuel cell. My bio fuel cell runs on bio chemistry and according to my calculations should achieve the same if not better energy production than a solar panel sq ft for sq ft. The bonus is also my engine will eat CO2 produce O2 and avoid the 20% heat refection back up that solar panels create. I tried to get help from my teachers, but they told me the questions I asked were above their education level. My idea to get this off the ground and the folders of other ideas is to get the attention of a celebrity(Lil Dicky, Leo D, Elon Musk, Gates anyone who has money) . I grew up in poverty and have never escaped it, even as i type i'm not sure what my future is going to be like in the next few months. The constant physical therapy and 3-5 doctor apts a week hasn't helped my ability to bring income. I""ve tried to do it myself but with a twitter that's barely used (unverified), and no help from publicist I feel I have nowhere else to turn. I also entered NAT GEO'S chasing genius competition but my idea was lost supposedly and never received the help promised by them. So i thought why not try the power of Reddit, and all the other people out there. Maybe others could join me in trying to get the attention of someone influential, all i need is 15 minutes on the phone and i know I can hook their interest. Some of my crazy ideas include: Bio fuel cell (10 trillion+ industry), redesign of the modern toilet, about 5 other patents, a non profit that creates a level of transparency unlike any other, an idea to long term fix Africa via a 3400 mile river ( i gave this long plan as my final in public speaking a lot to this idea), an aggressive cancer treatment to help boost success rates of auto immune cancer therapy(they modify T cells to attack cancer but only about 40% current success rate). I just hope some people even see this, and want to help. I don't have much to lose at this point so if you're willing to help out you can find my shitty twitter at [LHAYES52](mailto:LHAYES52@twitter.com).

My parents (39f and 39m) growing up didn’t really have their parents around, so they were always doing things that they weren’t suppose to do at a young age. My mom growing up had multiple boyfriends and she constantly snuck out of the house, same as my dad. 

I have brought up dating before and my parents are like “absolutely not” which to me makes no sense.

Also, I had asked my parents when I could start dating and my mom said maybe when i’m 16 and a junior. then a couple days later I brought up how I am going to have to hang out with my boyfriend outside of school and how I want to go on cute dates with him and go over his house and stuff. My mom instantly changed he mind about letting me have a boyfriend when I turn 16. she doesn’t want me hanging out with him and neither does my dad. my dad is pretty strict about me and boys. he doesn’t even like me on the phone with them.

Well last week I asked a coworker to give me a hand and it turned into a huge issue he ended up snapping at me that I ask to much of him. (When I asked him his section was empty and I was busy cashing out tables) he told me I don’t do anything and expect everyone to do everything for me. Which is completely untrue. 
Lately I’ve been going threw a hard time personally. My dad was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. So I’ve been late a few times. Well my supervisor gave me a break one day and covered for me bc he knew I’d be in a lot of trouble if I was marked late again. 
So after I told my supervisor about my coworker snapping on me about me asking him for help bc he had nothing else to do. He came up to me and told me if I ever told either of the supervisors or my manager about anything he did again he would go to my manager about me being late and that could cost me hours or even my job. 
Well yesterday after a much needed weekend off with my family I came back and I walked into the kitchen and heard him talking to another coworker about how much weight I’ve gained and how fat I look. 
This really hurt me as it’s something I’ve always been self conscious about. 
Now Idk what to do I feel like I can’t work with him anymore bc I’m afraid if I do anything he’ll come at me again or go to my manager. He’s been working this location longer so he has more of a relationship with most of the staff including the supervisors and manager. 
I’m trying to just get over it but with him not only blackmailing me but then continuing to bully me is hard to get over and it’s only been a week what is he going to do next.

I disconnect it and take it to my room so she can no longer listen. It drives her insane and it’s such an obsession to always keep an eye on my dad. She calls me immediately and says she saw me disconnect it. She doesn’t even bother so say anything other than “f**k you!!” And then hangs up. All because I took her control away from watching my dad’s every move. She comes home furious and starts throwing things in my dads room, along with attacking him. Physically abusing him. I run over and separate her from him. She’s still whaling at him with all her might. Kicking his back (he just had spinal surgery) and slapping him. I get in the middle and she scratches me and slaps me on purpose. Not an accident. I have had it. I call the cops and get her arrested. She stays a few hours. Fast forward to today. Her final court date is next week. Supposedly, she could possibly face jail time for this because the pictures of my wounds were booked as evidence. I will not be at court because I have midterms and commitments, plus the officer never gave me my subpoena in person. He left it at the door so by law “I never received it”. Am I wrong for calling the cops on her? What if she gets jail time? Can she get probation? If I didn’t tell her I was calling the cops after she attacked me, I feel like she would have kept attacked my father and I. I don’t believe she is emotionally or mentally ok. I believe she needs professional psychiatric help. Not anger management as the court sent her to attend.",16Oct2019,1
813,"I’m 22 and pretty socially awkward, I find it difficult to talk to new people, especially girls who I find attractive. As a result of this, my romantic life is non existent, and sometimes I have times like now where I can’t sleep and start getting kind of upset about it, like some of my friends in relationships are so happy and I just don’t seem to be able to do any of it.

Figured a pretty basic starting point is talking to girls in general rather than “how do I get a gf”. Any advice appreciated",16Oct2019,9
814,"I’m going to try and make this short. I met a man named Kyle right after my marriage ended. He lived in another country and was in mine for vacation. We ended spending his vacation together and had an amazing time. So we kept in contact and decided to try the long distance thing. Kyle is 12 years older than me, and has never been married and has no kids. I have one young child. 
We continue dating for a year and only are able to see each other once a month or every other month. Phone calls daily and messaging all day. 

Fast forward, my job takes me to another state. Kyle and I decided we want to try and live together. He was able to have his company pay for a visa and move him to my country. So we are now living together. I have a new job, and I am now able to see my child more often (after my marriage my ex took my child because it worked best for our situation).  I feel extremely stressed out with all of this “newness”. I’m used to living alone, and now I’m trying to get into a routine of being a part time mom/get into the swing of my high stress job. 
I honestly feel like I’ve been wearing rose colored glasses this whole time with Kyle. I hate coming home because I don’t want to see him. I’m not sure why all the sudden I have this extreme distaste to see him. Every little thing he does bothers me. I also feel extremely guilty and embarrassed having him move his whole life to be with me. We talked about that this could possibly not end well, and we said we would risk that anyway and give it a shot. Well, for me it hasn’t ended well. 

He wants badly to try and make it work (offered to give me more space) but a part of me thinks this won’t be enough and that I was just in lust the whole year we dated.  

Also, we signed a year lease for an apartment that I am not able to afford by myself. 

Honestly I’m not sure what I’m looking for her...I need advice but part of me already knows what I need/have to do. But any insight would be so nice.",16Oct2019,6
815,"I'll try to keep it simple and if you have questions ask me. 

I'm self-proclaimed, I hate doing tasks for others. I'm lazy, and I do what benefits me that's it. I know it's my responsibility to do other things for my family so I help out but that's it. I say fuck it after that. 

My dad and mom brought me into this world for one reason alone. To be their worker and it's annoying. They expect me to take on the same projects they are doing. Like the other days, they wanted me to use a knife to cut a pvc pipe because, (they are getting renters to live in our shit home, which has bed bugs for over priced). I feel so bad for them. But that process takes half and hour of continuous repetition, we try to spread out legs way more than we can. With that being said they are controlling. They used to physically abuse me as a child and now they are doing it emotionally because I'm fucking 21. They made me go want to become a religious figure, and I straight declined because it was too much responsibility when I was 9. They wanted me to become a doctor and I declined, even though I tried for them but I got 60s in all my biology courses when I put in best. So I felt guilty and said I will become an engineer instead, by my own free will, but think they pushed me because they set high standards for me. Recently my parents got into really big arguments and its happening continuously and they are getting tired of it and so am I. 

For example, my dad started working on the roof a few years back and made me involved. He continuously starts new projects and its annoying because we never finish them and it's not even worth the hassle. We are too cheap minded to get a trades man to help us. Instead, He rushes me and expects me to be perfect at these tasks. I'm not so enthusiastic so I run into my room to play games or what not. But then he makes noises like OOH my back, oooh my leg, oooh my fore arm and makes me feel guilt and makes me involved. Dont get me wrong hes just really selfless and does things for me, that no other father would. Like he did my grade 9 project for me when I slept. Or he drops me 2 hours to my uni in 2nd year alot, because the transit was slow. He let me sleep on the way there. But hes really fucking getting on my nerves with his emotional black mail. 

My mom on the other hand is toxic to another level. She always bring up how she was an amazing child, and its a mjor sin to have me as a child. Its like god doing her injustice and what not. she said you used to go out of her way to help her parents and is angry and frusterated that I'm not like that. She is quite judgemental. Whenever she sees me with junk food she comes and screams at me, and takes it away. even though shes like 200 pounds. Im trying to actively lose weight but not matter how I turn out she will never be happy with who I am. She spits on me whenever we get into an argument because she knows I dont like that.

I on the other hand am an ignorant fuck. My mom tell me to clean my room, I never do. They tell me help out the family with its small chores, and I do but sometimes I really dont want too. They want me to live their life style and for some god damn reason I can't get my self too. My mom is logical, but she never showed me love. She would always find something wrong with me, and I done know why I can't get my self to give a shit about what she wants from me any more. I hate doing the laundry (machine breaks every time, bed bugs in our house ruining my life), nothing is proper any more. My life is falling apart I need help. The therapist here are retarded, and instead of giving advice they say give me time and dont come back to me. They are money hungry.",16Oct2019,1

817,"So, I’m from a smallish area and at homecoming this one girl brought a date to the dance, and I was automatically attracted to him, but I didn’t want to intrude because I didn’t know what their relationship was. We actually ended up talking a little bit and even dancing together, but nothing crazy.

At a football game I was talking with this girl about her date and she told me they weren’t dating and she wasn’t interested, and that they both mutually decided not to date so I asked if I could have his snap and she said go for it.

So I got his snap and we’ve been talking a little bit (he’s not crazy into Snapchat so it’s not extensive conversations). I was asking some friends for advice and one girl told me not to talk to him because he was a player, but I wanted to see myself so I kept trying a little. Then another girl told me that the girl who brought him to homecoming was into him and now I feel like a jerk, but the feelings are already there for him.

Should I keep talking to him or is that a b*tch move?
If I do keep talking to him, how do I know when to show interest, because right now we only talk on snap and he doesn’t go on it a lot?

818,"Okay I'm not really sure where to start to make this flow smoothly, but here goes. 

A girl a know but am not friends with has always been a 'tragedy magnet.' She was the only person in the city to find razor blades in her kids Halloween candy one year and did an interview with the news. Her kid got really sick and ended up losing close to 15 lbs. None of this raised red flags for me. 

Now, I work in the medical field and have access to all sorts of health records, from doctor appointments to surgeries, and have access to all of the records for all of the cancer clinics in my province as that is where I work. About 6 months ago, this woman posted that she had been ""keeping things on the downlow"" but was diagnosed with cancer and just completed her very first chemo treatment. The post included a selfie at our local cancer clinic. I worked the day she posted that and despite it being against many regulations, searched her name to see what type of cancer she had.. only her name hasn't been in our system for years where she had a swab test done and it came back negative. 

At first I was really weirded out and figured there must be an error in our system somewhere or that her treatments just hadn't been processed on the back end yet. 

A few weeks go by and she posts a picture of her with a (very clearly) shaved head and a long post about how the chemo made her hair start falling out in clumps so she shaved it. Now, I'm not going to call myself a cancer expert, but in my 11 years working here I've never known a patient to lose their hair after one treatment or that quickly. 

A few more weeks go by and she posts another selfie about how she misses her hair and how hard it was getting out of her 2nd chemo treatment... at this point I'm fully positive she's lying as there is no chemo treatment for any cancer that goes at the schedule she's stating hers is.. not to mention she still isnt in our system. 

By the sounds of her posts and her husband's posts, she has even been lying to him. Making up excuses why he doesn't need to pick her up from treatment or how they will just phone her results in when he's at work...

Now, more than anything, I'm terrified this is a pretty gnarly case of munchowsin, and I'm also worried it may be possible byproxy as she put razors in her kids candy once.. 

Not to mention the absolute slap in the face this is to everyone ACTUALLY dealing with cancer. 

There is no way for me to ""out"" this woman without losing my job, though I desperately want to.. which probably makes me an asshole but I'm fine with that cause at least I dont lie about cancer? 

Any creative ways to out this girl, or better advice on ways to make sure her kids are in safe hands with her?",16Oct2019,3
820,"My mum recieved her inheritance after the recent passing of my grandad. My brother is down her neck asking for a loan to buy my grandads house (it has to be sold as per the will.)

On the day my grandad passed away, on the car ride home my brother asked me to help him figure out how to get my grandads house. I said he shouldn't be talking about this he had died less than an hour prior. 

2 days on my brother has moved into my grandads house with his gf of 3 months and her 2 children with the approval of my mum (executor of the will). Living rent free. 

1 week prior to my grandads funeral, she said she wanted none of our (my siblings) significant others in attendance. My partner lives In another country so did not book tickets. 3 days prior to the funeral, my brothers girlfriend has been allowed to attend because he needs ""support"". I questioned this and she said she never said such a thing. Either forgetful or lying. 

2 days post the funeral my brother has unleashed another offensive on my mum for a significant sum of money to be able to purchase my grandads home. She doesnt say yes or no. I over heard the conversation and say to not let him bully her into this. 

Throughout the past few weeks I have not told my mum to do anything but have tried to tell her how uncomfortable with all this has made me. If she give him the loan she wont be able to buy the house she currently lives in (rented her whole life). Her excuse is he is worried he doesnt have a home. Neither my or my sister own our own homes yet. I got angry stating it's unfair, and if she does this for my brother she is essentially telling me and my sister we are not as important. 

My brother earns a modest wage and could have saved for a mortgage by this point, hes 35. But hes spent it on contract phones, cars, caravans, and holidays. I had to work for 2 years to earn enough to complete my masters degree without any financial help. Am I in the wrong? If I'm not how do I stop this from moving forward. I dont care if hes worried about having a home. Graft like everyone else.

I love my boyfriend, he is kind, generous, attentive and an all around great guy.  We had dated for 4 years before we broke up on good terms for a couple years to knock off some bucket list items we both needed to do prior to settling down.  During these 4 years we datedwe lived a couple different places.  Now that we are back together, I really think he is the one.   However, there is one issue that has been really weighing on my mind, honestly the only issue in the relationship.  He will not compromise on where we live.   He insists that he must remain in the town he grew up in.  He owns a small business and says that due to having clients in the area he is unable to move.  Ok, that makes sense, I’ll just move there to be with him.  So I packed up all my stuff, moved to this new state, away from all of my friends and family.  Got a new job, everything.  I have been here for a little over a year now and I’m struggling.  I have not made any good friends even though I have tried.  I feel like everyone already has an established social circle at this age.   I also resent that he is so close and is able to see his parents weekly when I barely see mine every couple months.   It’s been harder than I imagined to maintain long distance friendships and I’ve never felt more lonely.   The days I spend with my boyfriend are wonderful, I am so happy however on the days he is busy I spend most of my time by myself, trying to go for runs or keep myself entertained.    It’s definitely weighing on my mental health.   On one hand I know if I moved back to where my friends are I would have a much more active social life BUT I can’t imagine giving up this relationship.

827,"I moved into an apartment complex within walking distance of the college I attend about 2 and a half years ago. About 6 months ago, a new neighbor moved in beneath me and has been driving me nuts, but it's been way worse the last few weeks. Their loud, bassy music plays constantly not only can I hear and feel it in my apartment, I can hear it over my white noise machine, air conditioning, fan, and noise cancelling headphones while playing my own music. Not only that, but despite the tenant being pretty slim, I can actually feel their footsteps rattling everything in my apartment when they walk. They often stop around their unit while yelling into their phone, so this is a constant issue. 

Because I'm an 18 year old girl living on my own, my dad told me under no circumstances to directly engage with the tenant in case it causes bad blood. So I called the housing manager, told them the issue and asked them to just let the tenant know they're being loud and politely ask them to stop on the off chance they didn't realize other people existed in the same complex as them. Needless to say, it didn't work. The manager told me to call the cops next time it happened, so I did, again specifying all I wanted was a warning. I'm not trying to get anyone evicted or in trouble. Again, to no avail. 

Since they usually stop playing their music around 11 and if I call the non emergency line at 10 when the noise ordinances kick in the cops don't arrive in time, it's been pretty much my word against theirs. I've called the cops during the day so they can hear how loud the music is, but because it can't be heard well from outside the complex, it isn't considered disturbing the peace (I'm paraphrasing and may have gotten the specifics wrong, but that's the gist of the situation).

Recently graduated with a BS in Biology and moved for work in an out-of-field job, because I was desperate to get started with my life. About 4 months later I still don't enjoy the job, and don't really have any friends (in the area or otherwise). I also feel like I am struggling financially. I'm probably spending too much on my apt, 1 year lease and cheapest I saw online (should shop local next time...) and have had some medical and other bills eat away at my paychecks. Given my unhappiness, I'm trying to change it as quickly as possible. My end goal is currently to get a masters or PhD and teach/research. Route #1 is to join the military (probably army) as an Officer. This gets me financially stable, out of the apartment lease, and all the other benefits. I do also support the military, and would enjoy having the opportunity to serve. Route #2 is to talk with landlord about breaking lease as amicably as possible and move home, study for GRE and pursue degrees now. The main thing that concerns me is that it's hard to find a replacement renter in winter, and my mother is cosigning the lease, and I don't want her credit or anything damaged. Route #3 is to stay the course and not change anything drastically. My original plan was to work for a year, then go back to school if I thought that was correct.

I would appreciate any and all insight into this matter, since I have done as much research as I can, and still feel like this is a nearly blind decision. Analysis Paralysis is just making me coast down route #3, and it doesn't feel great seeing the time tick away. In the US.

Yet they expect me to get perfect grades, be on top 100% of the time, get internships, etc. makes me more and more isolated from them. As a matter of fact, when I told this to my friend, he noticed that the relationship isn't that of a parent/son dynamic, but rather that of a roommates/roommate dynamic. The worst part is, I think he's almost right.

It amazes me that some people act way worse to their parents, while the worst thing I do is not get very good grades. I think the reason why I try to avoid my parents or talk about my personal life a lot is that I'm very conflict-avoidant. I would rather avoid any kind of fight or conflict in general.

I’ve ignored it because that wasn’t exactly cause for suspicion, but I can’t ignore what just happened.

836,"Hello /r/advice. 

I am hoping to get your thoughts on a decision that is upcoming for me. 

Okay, the situation is at the end of the year I have to make a decision between 3 different routes to go down for the next 3-4 years of my life. 

Option 1, is continuing my current work contract for a company that pays well but I hate the company and the job itself. Don't really get on with people in this place of work no matter how hard I try to fit in. The only thing that's keeping me sane is the fact that it pays very well. 

Option 2, would be to go back to an old workplace where I had a short contract while at university. I got on with people there and I fit in but the pay is terrible and the living expenses are rather expensive. 

Option 3, I have been offered a PhD scholarship across the world in a different country. The PhD is interesting and the supervisor is incredibly nice and supportive. The negatives here are of course money, I would be scrimping and saving for the next 3 -4 years to basically survive but the end I would be Dr Spark0 and it might open up different kinds of opportunities for me, but at what cost. 4 years of basically no money, I come from a poor background and family and I hoped to change that for my future. 

In terms of relationships that would affect my choice here. There are none. No SO and no friends to speak of (not to bring the tone down or anything, just for context).

840,"I (20M) have a huge fucking fear of losing my LDR gf (19F) to really just anything. Over the past month we've both had some emotional moments and for me it always starts with this fear of losing her which plagues my trust and I hate it. I trust this girl with my life but everytime i think these bad thoughts like shes gonna break up with me for being a failure, or she finds someone else, or that she realizes I'm worthless. These thoughts always come in the way of that im weak and I dont deserve love because of that. I've told her about these thoughts and she hates it when I tell her I hate myself and that she feels a little disappointed that I would think she would leave me but she always comes back with that she will never leave me and that she is with me for life. For a while that cures me and I dont think about it until I'm alone and then that main fear of losing her and all those mini fears just flood in and I get scared that she is going to leave me. I've traced this fear all the way back to my ex which who i got really attached to then she broke my trust when she started talking to other guys while in our relationship and hiding it from me. She also started drinking and doing drugs which I'm totally fine with but I dont really like it because it gives me anxiety and it came so sudden. She also ghosted me for a whole month and just didn't care for me in anyway. I dont even know why I tried to stay with my ex so long but I ended up breaking it apart and the following months I felt depressed for a long time. But now I'm in a amazing relationship with an amazing girl and this fear keeps plaguing me and I hate it so much. I love this girl with all my heart and i don't want these fears to hurt our trust and hurt her in anyway. So with that background what can I do about this and yes I know seeing a therapist is an option but I would like to hear some opinions from you guys about how I can overcome this fear of losing her. I really want to get better and I've been working with my gf on this but this fear happened again like a day ago. So please help.",16Oct2019,1

845,"I understand others go through worse than me, however I feel trapped and don't know who to turn to at this point. To put things into perspective I am in seventh grade, have had depression for about 5-6 years now and have been suicidal for 3. I somehow flooked my way into a so-called gifted program in fifth grade. (basically they do work faster than a regular classroom) And everything was all fine and dandy until last year. You see I pretended to be happy, up until March of 2019, as my best friend, he started ignoring me for some reason and this sent me over the edge, everyday was hell for me. I couldn't pretend anymore. I sought out help from my teacher and was taken to the er, and of course they told my family about it. The people I've been trying to hide it from. My mom was worried as hell- it was the first time I have ever saw her cry and it honestly broke my heart. I have been on meds and been going to therapy since then, everything had been going well until this year. Ny teacher is really strict and gives out a lot of homework. (Geo, math, language, science, religion+ project) is your typical work day. I couldnt keep up. And Miss saw that some of my work was incomplete and she yelled at me. ""It's not fair that everyone else follows instructions and you just do whatever you want."" Keep in mind I have various extracurricular activities B-ball, Piano, swimming, tutoring, tae kwan doe. Trying to keep up is like running a marathon with a broken leg. And so, for this one project I procrastinated. Doing other homeworks, activities or taking naps. (I hardly get 8 hours of sleep) Yesterday I had to do the whole project after my activities, I got 3 hours of sleep. So I went to the school counciller to talk to her about my stress. My mom ended up getting involved. The counciller requested some of my activities be cancelled (the ones I didnt want to do)  and that my sister stop asking of me trivial things whilst I try to study (close my light, get my bag) my mom immediatly agreed to letting me leave swimming and math if it stressed me out. I have about 10 classes left of swimming and its $100 a season. As per my math, there are definitely no refunds and its about $1500 a year, ive only been to 2 classes so far. As per my sister, my mom talked to her, and my sister got really mad, yelled and slammed the door. My mom was in tears. I was pretending to sleep but I was crying the whole time. My mom just held me until I fell asleep, I remember her words ""Dont cry, if you cry what am I supposed to do"" I want to fucking kill myself for the pain I put her through. It feels like everytime I open up about my stress she gets hurt. Which is why, for her sake I feel the need to bottle everything in.

My step-father is depressed from work and home and is taking some medication. However, this makes him crave alcohol and sleep a ton more. 

A few night ago, when I was spending the night at my friends house, they got into a heated argument after my drunken step-dad dropped some chicken, microwaved it, and tried to cook it and serve it (of course, he now thinks him trying to do that was stupid). Mid-fight my mom took my baby brother and left. She went to my maternal grandmother’s house and lived there for two days. 

I went to my friend’s birthday party and she texted me asking where I was. I texted her back with:

&gt;Why does it matter where I am? If it is ok for you to drop everything and leave I should he able to do the same.

Naturally, she be livid. We had an extremely heated argument. I told her that she needed to confront him about the alcohol instead of running away. We kept arguing. 

She threatened to disown me. In the heat of the argument I said I already feel disowned. I pay for my car insurance, phone bill, and gas on my own without anyone’s help on a minimum wage job. 

She began comparing me to my biological father (I cut him from my life entirely he did nothing good for me and I hated him with all my heart; he truly was a terrible person). I started to cry harder and harder and just told her to stop and I indirectly apologized. 

I want to sit down with both of them and tell them they have to go to a marriage counselor or something. I also want them to stop drinking entirely. It does nothing good for either of them because when my step-father gets drunk he gets extremely irritable too.

How can I get the two to stop drinking? Please help me with this, I’m so desperate. If they do decide to respect me and listen, how can I carry out their promise to stop drinking?

I can’t stop fantasizing of what I should’ve done, or how if I did something different, how it would’ve played out.

We’ve been really close for 12-13 ish years. She’s been through my substance abuse issues, jail and rehab stays. We’ve had tons of fights before, but and this is the first one in a long time and it all started over her saying that I wasn’t acting the way she thought I should - spiraled into me “having bipolar personalities.” (This was last night). 

And today, things were a little different for most of the day and then I said something about my past again that rubbed her the wrong way. I ended up getting frustrated and telling her “That she hasn’t cared about me since she met her husband anyways.”

I think that she’s going through some things, and I have been working on some really deep things with my sponsor. But, regardless she ended the conversation with an effective ending of the conversation and “the friendship”. 

Now this has happened before, I’ve swallowed my feelings/pride and whatever else and put it all to the side for the sake of our friendship. I don’t think that it all really matters in the sense that if I make an attempt to apologize or make things right - we’ll be ok. 

But the problem I’m having is that I don’t know if it’s beating a dead horse? I’ve heard a lot and read from the “experts” is that friendships tend to have an expiration date and don’t last, and the odds of them lasting past marriage or trauma is even more of a challenge.

862,"Hey guys, so a little backstory (tl;dr at bottom):

I (M29) met my partner (F30) when we were around 19 y.o. by that time we were both in college and I was actually seeing another girl. Fast forward a few weeks and I stopped seeing this other girl to hook up with my current partner.

We've immediatly connected, both physically and mentally, so falling hard in love was unavoidable.
I'd still feel some kind of ""need"" to meet other girls, but never actually done anything. We were madly in love so we've both set aside some other people in our lives to make our relationship work.

Well fast forward a few years, I was about to graduate and she got pregnant. Around 22 y.o. We were desperate at the time, but I managed to get a well paying job so we moved in together and started building our adult lives from this point on. I'd still feel that need to meet other girls, maybe even a little more at that time, because our sex drive wasn't really matching anymore. But again I never did anything because I still loved her so much, and she did too. Nothing that masturbating to porn wouldn't keep these needs in check.

Than 2 years go by, she gets pregnant again, i switch to a better job, but now I have to travel more for work. I spend the whole week 600km from home and go back every weekend.

Now I'm 29, still love the hell of my partner, love our 2 kids (7 and 5 now), love our home and everything we've built together and I couldn't imagine doing something to throw this all away.

See, the thing is this need to meet other women never got any better, actually it has gotten way worse. Masturbation is not enough, hell even going to ""strip clubs"" doesn't do anything anymore.
But I just can't take this ""urge"" to hook up with other women anymore. I see women at work/bars and I think ""maybe I should talk to her, just flirt a little see what happens"".

Has anyone that's been in a long term relationship ever had this? How did you overcome this? How long did this feeling last? Should i seek a therapist or something? Am I a perv?
Maybe i just want to test my game nowadays, or have the thrill of the conquest, or maybe massage my own ego. I dunno I think i'm just a little desperate.

(Tl;dr) been in a relationship for over 10 years, living together, had 2 kids. Still want to meet/hook up with other women. Never done anything because i still love her, but i'm not in love anymore i believe. What do I do?",16Oct2019,3

872,"For some background, I have known this guy ever since Junior Kindergarten, which was 14 years ago. We've always been super close but for most of elementary school he always had this superiority complex over me which caused me to feel some dislike towards him which I never brought up. I was very unpopular and not very well liked at my elementary school so for me having a close friend was great and I didn't want to mess it up.

Once high school started, my life turned around a bit and through a few different things I ended up being fairly well known and liked in my grade and I had a lot more friends. I still kept this guy very close as a friend and we would hang out practically every week. In grade 11 we made it an official tradition to hang out every Friday whether with friends or just the two of us.

This year, in grade 12 he has started acting with that superior attitude again, he has started only talking to only the smartest people that he can find and is sucking up to them (laughing at all their jokes, always asking them for homework answers when he knows I have the same ones) he basically acts like I'm some idiot and like he's at such a higher level than I am. Those people aren't the types to do anything outside of school so they don't really provide any kind of social benefit to him.

He didn't hang out with me three weeks in a row and was very resistant to making plans or doing anything outside of studying and staying in his house so I asked him if everything was okay and he said yes but he has *""lost interest in hanging out with me""* seems like kind of a rude thing to say. A lot of other people have invited him to things but he doesn't ever tell them definitively if he's going or not and has even implied to me that he's going to go and then a day or two days before he'll tell them he actually doesn't want to go and doesn't do anything else instead, barely giving them any notice.

I've stopped eating lunch with him at school and starting tomorrow I'm not going to be taking the bus home with him anymore. No matter what I've always stuck by him even when he's being rude because I believed he was good at heart but now he just seems mean.

Tldr:

Ok so heres the part where I ask for advice: 

Should I...

1) Drop him as a friend and just stop talking to him so he can go hang out with those other people that he thinks are so great.

2) Keep pushing for him to hang out with me. I'm not sure how I would get him to hang out with me or his other friends who do stuff outside of school so please leave suggestions :)",16Oct2019,2

She's a 12 yo girl taking ""clases particulares"" (I help her w/her homework) for two months now and in the one day spaw of one class to the other she's losing all her notes. It's the 4th or 5th time it's happened and I don't know what to do. I considered buying her a notebook and keep it with me after class but it won't be useful if she needs help at school or home.
Her parents are separated, I know her dad had a child a month ago with his new partner so I don't want to pressure my student or talk with her parents. The kid is not mean spirited, she's really sweet but she doesn't show interest in her studies. I can tell she's going through a lot with her new sister and she needs time to adjust. The problem? Raising a child is expensive (formula and diapers specially) and that's a good reason for me to not waste the father's money. 
What should I do to prevent this situation? Do I give her another try or tell her father to stop wasting money?",16Oct2019,1

I like this girl a lot still and she rejected me about 3-4 weeks ago. I feel like ever since I got rejected she’s been acting differently. Like she’s been talking to me more. Every band competition we sit next to each other and talk a lot, and the last one was a hour long bus ride we played Bitmoji games on Snapchat and we both laughed super hard. We read my witch craft book (it’s not real lmao) and we joke around and tease each other. Some of my friends thinks she changed her mind and she realized she has feelings for me. But I’m pretty sure I still have a chance. When she rejected me she said that she likes someone else and we would still be friends (I don’t think she likes someone else tbh, I think she just said that) also sometimes she repeats herself and she says stuff differently. Like when I first asked if she stayed after the band left the football game she said no and when she mentioned it again I asked it again and then she said she did stay after. Today I saw her walking behind me and my best friend and I said dude she’s walking right to torward us and she walked up right next to me. Idk why I said this and I now realized it was really stupid but I said “what the f**k is up (her name) and she smiled (chuckled) and said Hi. Also she laughs and a lot of things I do. I think she might of changed her mind because I feel a lot closer to her and it seems we’re getting even closer",16Oct2019,1
878,"Hey Reddit.
I ditched work for a few minutes to give my girl a hug around 11am today because my house was close to the next job site. I usually get out of work around 3:30 but today I got out at 5 because of an emergency plumbing situation.

  On the way home I saw a bike she always wanted to I bought it and wanted to surprise her with it when I got home. 

I drove down the driveway on it and knocked on our sliding glass door so she could see me on her bike.

I didn't see her laying on our bed (we live in a studio apartment), just blankets. I called her name a few times but she didn't come running out of the other rooms like she always does. I was really confused.

Someone who rents a room from upstairs came outside and said ""The cops dragged Emily out of the house at 1pm today."" I couldn't take him seriously. I asked him if he was serious a few more times and he was. 

My girlfriend and I met in a rehab about a year and a half ago but didnt start dating until about 9 months ago. Her parents always hated me and they have the tendency to call the cops over everything. If she doesn't respond to anything they ask, the cops come. Her phone broke a couple days ago and they called the cops yesterday. 

Her parents hate me for some reason. I don't know why. To be honest, I hate them a lot more now, but just want to know if there's any way I can know where she is. She must have been sectioned. I live in cape cod. She's either been sectioned 12 or section 35.. but is there any way I can figure out where she is or if I can talk to her?
 
Please someone help me. This is going to seriously interfere with my work and personal life. I already feel hopeless without her and the first thing Im doing is propose to her when/if I see her because I just realized how much I love this girl.

Sorry for all the text. She was also my only friend.",16Oct2019,2
879,"This individual is a senior civil engineer with several decades of experience in all aspects of construction. He went to school many year ago in a country where things were much more relaxed. Much of his experience is in a foreign country, however, the projects that he was involved in are REALLY large scale government contracts. He is a big deal in his origin country.

Many years ago, he moved to a new country with his family. He was at the peak of his career and operated his own family business for several decades. But he closed everything to move to a new country.  He hoped to find a new job or continue the business, but still has found himself in a tight position. 

He is highly knowledgable, but the country that they moved to requires certain education from within that country and thus, he has had a very difficult time finding any sort of employment in the industry.

This individual would like to continue his career while not having to start all over again. He's extremely passionate about construction, engineering, management, etc. and has dedicated his ENTIRE life to it. He would like to work again and be meaningful to the industry, in any way possible.

881,"I am starting to fall behind in things, too. This post is mainly about college. I went to college for 4 years at my old school, been going to a new college for 2 months.

I don't know how to not be stressed. Even when I sleep enough and exercise I still get stressed so easily.

The more I get stressed, the more I procrastinate, which means the more behind I get. Then I think about how behind I am, and get incredibly stressed. It's an awful, vicious cycle.

Sleep doesn't work, exercise doesn't work, anti-depressant doesn't help with this issue. I don't usually get along with therapists, but there is one at school I haven't tried yet, so I may, but who knows how the process of getting in is. I have no idea what to do and I'm really scared, I don't want to be behind anymore, but I have so much to do that thinking about it I just get so scared, and want to procrastinate more.

882,"Hey all,

I’m in desperate need of advice. I have tried to be an understanding neighbor but I can’t bear this anymore, and it’s making me frustrated. My next door neighbor plays booming bass at all hours of the day (including evenings, sometimes I cannot sleep). It is so loud I can hear it from outside and my walls shake. We share the wall in my bedroom. I have tried white noise, spending more time in the living room, but it is so loud I can hear it everywhere. 

I already tried confronting her about it but she turned the music down immediately when I knocked. She looked at me like I was crazy and proceeded to blame it on the downstairs neighbor like “yeah! I hear it too, so annoying”. Ever since I confronted her about it, she has simply turned the music up even louder. I’ve also confirmed that the music is coming from her apartment as sometimes the music is blasting but the downstairs neighbor, who she blames for the noise, is not home. I’m at my wits end. Clearly confrontation is not working, and I’m afraid saying “I think you’re lying” will set her off. Can someone give me any advice on how to handle this situation? Would calling the police help or just add fuel to the fire? 

Thanks,
- would like to not feel like I’m coming home to a rave every evening",16Oct2019,2

These past couple of months my mental health pretty much went to complete shit. I have isolated myself from everyone and now have developed this paranoia thing where I feel as if everyone is looking, judging, and laughing at me. When in actuality, I am the one criticizing myself.. anyways, would it be terrible of me not to go to her shower? The thing is, the true me really wants to go. But the person I have been for a while now is holding me back. I don’t want people to see me the way I am. But I also don’t want them to judge me for not going.. (20f)",16Oct2019,1
885,"So I've posted on reddit a few times but I'm still fairly new to this world and so bare with me here.

I have always struggled with food addiction, since I was young and could go out and buy food on my own. It is on and off but when it's on.. It's REALLY on. At this moment I am struggling with a full blown addiction which usually leads to fast weight gain, self hate and depression. What's  interesting is, as I mentioned, it's on and off. So sometimes I get ahold of my life and eating habits, lose tons of weight, get super beautiful and have great confidence then somehow I let it come crashing down where I find myself binge eating daily for months on end and I gain tons of weight again. I have been going up and down for the last 12 years I would say (I'm 26 btw).

I've done a tiny bit if counselling but cost is the issue even though I have a job and benefits, it doesn't cover much. I just feel like I can't stop binge eating and to put it in perspective, I have been aware of my habits for the past 8 months, so I've been trying to be mentally strong and seek out help in this time. But for the full 8 months I haven't changed a thing and I'm feeling helpless. 

I am so sorry for the length but does anyone have some advice? I'd love to hear of anyone going through this or someone who's overcome this addiction. I really don't want to destroy my health any longer and I want to live a normal life, enough of this on and off B.S.",16Oct2019,2

889,"My dad just got a call from the mother of my cousin who was molested. He's in 5th grade. We'll call him J to make this easier. J's mom was talking to him about visiting his grandmother and he said he didn't want to go there anymore. When his mom asked why, J got embarrassed and didn't want to talk. After a few minutes of talking, he went into detail about his cousin, we'll call him M, molesting him two years ago. J's parents are divorced, but J's mom immediately calls his dad about it. His dad (my uncle), who basically has a new family now and doesn't see J as much, tells J's mom don't tell a soul. That it's just ""boys being boys"". He realized his son was raped and he doesn't want it to get out to cause drama.   


&amp;#x200B;

Let me add in now that J's mom is hated by my extended family. Her and J's dad had an awful relationship where drug abuse/cheating was rampant. That was years ago and they divorced. She was married into our family, so after the divorce, she was basically excommunicated other than dropping J off at things. She isn't perfect but loves/takes care of J and isn't a bad mom by any means. No one in my family has forgiven her, except my dad and I. They can't stand mentioning her name, and call her a loser. Ironic, since we have so many former drug addict/cheaters in our extended family but I digress. My dad and I love J, he's extremely bright and kind. Literally the smartest kid I've ever met.   
J's mom, not knowing who to turn to, then calls me and my dad. She's hysterical saying she doesn't know what to do, but knows we're the only ones she can go to about it. She going to take J to therapy as soon as possible, but doesn't know what to do about someone confronting M. She knows no one in the family will even listen to her, and asked us if we could step in and help her. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
M is in 7th grade. His mom is schizophrenic, so he and his siblings have lived with our grandparents for the majority of their lives. He is extremely well taken care of, my grandparents shelter him (too much). He is babied by others, especially my grandmother, and it's led to him getting away with acting overly obnoxious at times. I am pretty close to M, just went to his swim meet last week, and he calls me his ""favorite cousin"". He's opened up to me about getting picked on at school. I am not trying to stereotype, but M acts very flamboyant and always has. He has said he is bi since he was very young. Our family has no problem with LGBT and many of my uncles are gay, so everyone supported his coming out. A few years ago, my at the time boyfriend said M kept trying to sit on his lap and was doing inappropriate things. I scolded M and told him that it was absolutely not cool to do that to people. That was all I ever heard about him being inappropriate. To my boyfriend and me, it seemed like a kid just acting weird and not understanding boundaries. Never knew that this molestation was happening at around the same time.   


&amp;#x200B;

I am very, very close to all my cousins. They are all like siblings to me. I know M needs to be confronted, and I know I could do it without attacking him. He trusts me, and I think I could get him to open up and even go to therapy if I had the chance to talk to him. However, I also know my grandparents will make excuses for him and not let anyone talk to him if this comes out. I know they will side with M and try to push it under the rug, like my uncle did. I don't know what to do. I don't want to make J's situation public, because I know he is embarrassed. I don't feel that it's my place to tell our whole extended family about what happened to him, because I don't want people to bombard J through all this. However, I know something needs to be done about M. I just dont' know how to go about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
Even More: This news comes a week after M's older brother opening up to me about being raped many times by another person in our family when he was very young, who he didn't feel comfortable naming yet. He's just starting therapy to work through these emotions at 20. No one knows about his childhood rape except me, him, and his sister. He would be broken if he knew his little brother did this. So, right now I have one named young molester (M) in my family, and one adult molester who I'm not sure we will ever get the name of. And I'm the only person who knows about both. I'm starting to consider the idea that my family knew about M's brother's childhood rape, and just covered it up.   


&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I've helped friends through experiences like this before, but never had to open up to my own family about this. Do I tell my grandparents immediately? Do I address M on my own? Any advice is seriously appreciated. I just want to help J, while also making sure M learns this cannot be ignored. I apologize if this is scatter-brained. Please help. Thank you.",16Oct2019,4

895,"Idk man, I just keep getting angry whenever I see people smoke weed.

My parents smoked weed all the time when I was a kid, and we were poor (for different reasons). I felt like I was trapped, and there was no way out of my poverty. I remember just randomly crying one day because I didn't have an Xbox 360. My father would randomly get angry at me. I later find out that they were using weed to ""treat"" his bipolar disorder.

Everyone in my highschool complained about schoolwork, and then they'd get high and just ignore all of it. One of the smartest people in my school started smoking weed: he started to fail his classes. This happened with a lot of people too. They decided it was better to get high than to do schoolwork.

Idk dude every time someone I know smoked weed, it ended poorly for them. They got poor grades, they got poorer, or they stopped caring. My best friend recently told me he smoked weed daily, and he brought a CBD vape with him to my house. It's everywhere I go. My parents do it, my friends do it, it all over the place online.

Anyway, this is the latest: the other night we went to a dinner party with the parents of the kids I babysit. BF got drunk and apparently told some of the parents that his dad prescribed some singer (I think from like Grateful Dead??) some pain killers or something because he was the doctor working that concert. BTW this was like 20 years ago and he doesn’t even work at that hospital anymore. We are from NC.

But now BF is convinced that one of the people from the party is going to call and get his dad fired for confidentiality breach. Keep in mind that these ppl don’t even know my BF’s name let alone where or when his dad did this. I think it’s insane that he’s worried about this but I don’t know how this stuff works.
