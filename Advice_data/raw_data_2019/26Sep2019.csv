0,"Hi, my name is Kelsey, I‚Äôm from Oklahoma and I would really appreciate if someone could tell me what they know about this and maybe give advice. I guess I‚Äôll start by saying that I‚Äôm 18 years old and I‚Äôm a sophomore in high school for the third time. I started 9th grade when I was 15. I struggled badly with depression and didn‚Äôt have any motivation to do homework, so I didn‚Äôt. I even attempted suicide and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I ended up failing multiple classes, so I had to retake the ones I failed the next year as a sophomore. So I was taking freshman and sophomore classes. Towards the end of the first semester my (first) sophomore year, I started having panic attacks almost every day at school. When we went off to Christmas break I decided I didn‚Äôt want to go to that school anymore and needed a fresh start. I started the next semester at a new school and was determined to get better and do good in school. I went for about two weeks and my panic attacks continued, so one day I walked out of class and never came back. I dropped out of school and decided I wanted to get my HISET (high school equivalency test) which I guess is similar to GED. I took classes at the adult learning center in my town. My mental state was really bad at this point so I dropped out of those too and just decided to not do school at all. For about seven months all I did was stay at home. I was miserable because I had no friends and nothing to do. So in August of 2018 I went back to school as a sophomore for the second time. They put me in a program my school had just created called pirate connect, where we do our classes online on Edmentum. They gave me like 19 online classes so I could catch up on my credits and hopefully graduate. I managed to stay in school for a whole school year (yay! Progress!) and did summer school, but I didn‚Äôt finish enough classes. When I went back to enroll in school for this year, I thought I would be a junior, and do online classes again so that I could graduate this year. The school counselor told me I was 1 and a half credits short of being a junior. But I think I‚Äôve earned those credits now. I‚Äôm taking 3 hours of my online classes in the morning (where I have 20 online classes, some of them are just random electives), then I have normal classes that aren‚Äôt online like choir, ACT prep, culinary basics, and library. The counselor and all my teachers want me to graduate THIS YEAR because I‚Äôm 18. Im taking everything that I need to take in order to graduate and I‚Äôve already finished 3 of my online classes. I‚Äôm much more mentally stable and I believe I can do it. I‚Äôm going to work really hard to graduate but I still don‚Äôt know what will happen to me after high school. I want to go to college for music education, and be a high school choir teacher when I grow up. But I feel like my high school situation is such a mess that I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible. My parents aren‚Äôt very supportive of my dreams. They think college is overrated and when I talk about it they say ‚Äúwell, let‚Äôs just see if you even graduate high school‚Äù in a kinda rude voice. They still are willing to pay for it, but they say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna go off to some big college far away or anything‚Äù so it has to be somewhere in like Oklahoma or Arkansas. I know my choices are very limited for college but I want to be able to go to one that‚Äôs far enough away that I can live on campus and not at home. I tried to talk to my school counselor and ask her if college is possible for me and she was like yeah it‚Äôs totally possible but started talking about this college in my town called Carl Albert State College and it‚Äôs not very expensive and not hard to get into but it‚Äôs only a two year school and I have 0 interest in going there, and it‚Äôs so close that my parents would want me to just live at home if I went there. I only have a 3.0 GPA and I feel like I probably won‚Äôt score very high on the ACT (I‚Äôm taking it October 26th) but I really really want to go to college with a decent music education program. Should I give up and find something more realistic? Or is it still possible for me? If you‚Äôve read this far, thanks so much. I would really appreciate your input.",26Sep2019,1
1,"Ok to preface I work in customer service... I have an disability where my voice can be affected. Ok what happens is I‚Äôm either super quiet or really loud.

2,"He‚Äôs my only client and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll fire me. I‚Äôm not sure what the nurse told him 

I don‚Äôt often set boundaries and my therapist suggested that I do this and I did bc I felt like he thought I would punk out bc I did kinda bad when we practiced. 

The nurse told me that she told him I said he makes me uncomfortable a few feet away from him and I was like üò¶ and he was like üòêüòí 

Because all I told him was that I can‚Äôt do the thing (that makes me feel uncomfortable) and all I can do is help him do it bc my job said so

3,"Hello, so this isn't as huge of a situation as other things on here, but I want help and tips because I've never:

-been on a long school trip

-been able to fall asleep on a bus

-been on a bus for 12ish hours with 60-90 other kids

and yeah, I've been in a car for 10 hrs but I got info on the trip and I have to fall asleep on the bus (we leave in the evening) and since we're going to Washington DC looking at all the monuments, we're gonna be walking a total of 20-30 miles in 5 days (including bus ride there and back).

So far, my tips (from my older friend who went last year) have been:

-wear good shoes
-energy drinks are your friend
-sleep on the bus and whenever possible

I really want as much tips about this as I can get, my school rarely has any trips and I want this big one to go right. The school is paying for food with the money we paid them to go on the trip and the hotel rooms as well, I'm rooming with three of my best friends.

Thanks, Reddit. Ik this probably isn't a big deal in the long run but I love traveling and want this trip to go right :)",26Sep2019,1

6,"I have done some cheating on online quizzes and tests in my day. Never in class cheating. I am now a junior and am committed to never doing that again. The guilt has been horrible. God has been working on me to become better in this area.

7,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short..

I am an independent photographer that gets 1099 work from a small local company. We photograph high end luxury homes and 80% of my income comes from work they send.

It‚Äôs a small company and the owner is pretty reasonable but he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with photography he only deals with video she leaves everything photo to the guy I work under.

Here is where me and the other photographer are starting to have serious problems.. the guy we photograph under gets first dibs on all the jobs, even though at this point they call for our quality and not for him specifically. He fills his schedule first and leaves is the scraps even though he makes money off our shoots since he manages the photo side. 

Now what he‚Äôs been doing is sending us work because he can‚Äôt fit it in his schedule, then his schedule opens up and he takes it right back. Yesterday he took 4 jobs back from me that he originally had me book because he was full. The other photographer (my peer) has a job scheduled Friday that the agent rescheduled to Monday so our ‚Äúboss‚Äù promptly took that shoot back from the other photographer as well.

Easily over 20 shoots in the last few months that he‚Äôs done this to us on and now it‚Äôs really pissing me off. He‚Äôs a decent guy and helped me become a better photographer but he is not leadership material. Last time I complained to him about something completely valid he just said ‚ÄúI hear you but I wouldn‚Äôt complain to loud we can just send all the west valley work to the other photographer‚Äù

So instead of working with me he just threatens to send me less work from that side of town. Same deal with my peer, when he‚Äôs complained it‚Äôs more or less met with threats to take our work away. 

How do you deal with someone like this? Right now I feel like everything falls on deaf ears but if they want to grow the company this needs to be dealt with now.",26Sep2019,1
8,"Ever since I broke up with my ex, almost all of my friends have been acting weird around me. They're proud that I finally broke up with him, saying things like ""he was no good for you anyway."" Him and I still talk sometimes, like earlier today. But other than that, we barely see one another anymore.

I don't have many females friends, and because of that, people assume that I'm Bisexual, or a ""stud."" It pisses me off, but I can't really blame anyone for thinking that. I always hang around guys, and only have about two girl friends . There is no particular reason for this, I just get along better with males. The only problem with that is - those males start to like me.

Mind you, I've been with my same group of friends since last year, and none of them acted like this back then. But now that I'm single again, new problems have been appearing. I found out that one of them - we'll call him G - used to like me last year, but didn't say anything. And ironically, I used to like him last year as well, but never told him, or anyone else about it. Now, things are weird between us.

As for my other friends - there are six in total, including G, we'll call them K, C, J, D, and Z - they've all developed abnormal behavior towards me too. J was the first to ask me out. It wasn't random though, I somewhat saw it coming. But D was there when he asked me, and it angered him. Persuading me to say no, he pushed my chair away from them and talked to J one on one about something. I just shrugged and went back to my assignment.

D has a girlfriend, so his behavior is by far the strangest to me. I think G has one too, but he doesn't act like he has a crush on me like D and the others do. After J confessed, soon did C. He asked me if I could ""think about it."" I never gave him an answer. He's still waiting..

Soon after came K. He's new to our table, or ""group,"" but we quickly accepted him. And I most definitely did not expect him of all people to ask me out. He confessed over text messages on Messenger. I didn't give him an answer yet either. I mean, what can I really say? I don't even know him that well.

As for Z.. well, he's never asked me out, or confessed to liking me. If anything, I'm the one who likes *him*. He's always been the guy I liked, no one else in my group of friends. But our relationship is so confusing. Sometimes, it seems like he feels the same about me, and the next minute I see him with some other girl. I'm never able to just sit down and talk to him about ""us."" He usually just avoids the questions entirely.

I've been in this situation for weeks now.. What do I do?",26Sep2019,1
9,"Basically when it comes to today day in age etiquette for specific things, we always disagree because my mom is stuck in her generation and the way her generation thinks. Examples, plus-1 to a wedding is not right regardless if the invitation specifies- basically that such a thing as ""plus 1"" to a wedding doesn't exist. Also that it's perfectly fine to show up unannounced to visit a woman in the hospital who just gave birth earlier that day. (Mom &amp; pregnant woman are niece/aunt but are NOT close and haven't been in years.)  To my mom's argument, when she gave birth nobody called and just showed up (mind you, that was in the 80's, cell phones were rare). Whenever we disagree on something, she runs and asks the same 5 people their opinion on the matter and mostly they agree with her because they all are the same generation. It's gone to the point where it is just frustrating because she can't see how life and the world is changing with each generation.",26Sep2019,3

12,"This is not the first time I post here about my bf. My previous post was about him being a materialistic and I received several comments that warned me from him. 

So yesterday, I told him that I think we are not right for each other and our relationship will not be as successful as I want it to be, but he asked for a new chance and told me that he would do anything to please me. But as a matter of fact, he doesn't even avoid doing the things I told him I hate. 

For instance:
1- He keeps talking about money which I really hate and my previous post was about this. He is on dept and he wants me to transfer money to him. A couple days ago, he asked me for the X time if there is a western union service in my country to transfer money to him because him and I are from two different countries and all our relationship is just online. We have never met in person. 

2- When we first met online and he told me he loved me (since the very first 5-6 days), but at the behinning of our relationship he kept me on hold and talked to his ex behind my back which I figured out later. 

3- Sometimes he is so disrespectful, and I really hate that. I grew up in a family that really value respect and I think respect comes before love. I make sure to be always respectful with him even when we are arguing. 

4- I feel he abuses me emotionally because when we argue or when I mention breaking up, he directly talks about suicide and he says that his life will be over without me. He tries to make me feel guilty because of what will happen to him if we break up. 

5- Sometimes when I ask him ""why me"" he says ""because you will be a good wife who will never let me down or cheat on me, who will raise my kids well, and you are so tender and caring so I am sure you will take care of my ill mother, and because my life will be different with you"" so I tell him you don't love me for who I am, you just love things about me, but he says no he loves me and I honestly find that hard to believe. Am I wrong? 

I find his messages very clear and I think he loves how his life will become with me, he loves certain things in me, but he doesn't love me for who I am, all of me, but he says I jump into conclusions and I am getting him wrong. Plus, he keeps asking me to introduce him to my father as soon as possible but everything he's doing makes me feel I am not ready to do that. Am I wrong? Am I being harsh on him?",26Sep2019,1

16,"So, this will probably be a long one, and for that, I apologize. I just have a lot to get off my chest. So, I recently dropped out of college because it just wasn't for me. After 4 schools and 3 majors I realized that all I was doing was wasting my time and money. That brings me to now. I'm stuck living at home, working the same job I've been working since high school (5 years ago) and I hate every minute of it. I just feel trapped. I can't find any other jobs I'm even remotely interested in, I'd say largely due to not having a degree to back up my skills. My last major in school was electronic media technology, so essentially camera, audio, and editing work. I really wanted to specialize in sports broadcasting and photography. Of the three majors I've been in, that's the one I'm the most passionate about and that I find most enjoyable. I've been doing photography for a couple years with for two blogs covering Major League Soccer and college football. However, neither of these are for pay and have been strictly as a hobby. Of course, because I have a car payment and a couple of other bills to pay, (fortunately, living at home has kept my expenses in check) I always have to give priority to my actual job and that causes me to miss out on games and other opportunities to get better with my photography.

Really, I just feel stuck. I feel so limited by where I live, by the shitty job I have, and the lack of a degree. I've been depressed for several years now, even before I dropped out, due to a few factors I won't get into here. I have no life. I'm watching my high school classmates graduating college, getting jobs they've always dreamed of, moving away, getting married, having kids, and so on. Meanwhile, I'm a dropout, working the same job I did when we were in school together, I live with my mom, and I'm single. All of my small circle of friends are busy doing there thing, and I rarely see them. I'm seriously considering just up and leaving. I've had some really dark thoughts lately. I want to move and start over somewhere else with more opportunities, but I don't know where or how. I don't have the savings to get a place. I don't have any plans for a job wherever I might go. It would just be me, my car, my clothes, some other essentials, and my camera. I've had some random ideas, but none are realistic. I'm not sure what kind of advice anyone can actually give me. I guess this is probably just an excuse for me to put my problems out there to the world and hope someone can help. Anything at all would help.",26Sep2019,0

There are times where the distance gets to me and I feel sad and lonely but I never tell her because I want her in my life. The distance gets to me and it's even worse when there are people who get into my life uninvited (my ex and friends who tell me I should date someone else) and ask me to basically cheat on her.

18,"I  am a dude in my 20's. I started watching porn as a young teen and would  watch regular porn and just beat off and think nothing of it. As I got  older, into my late teens and early 20's, My porn habit got intense and  so did my preferences and sexuality.

I  am by the way straight and have always been but as my porn habit  increased I started to now imagine myself as the girl in the video and  have the women body and get fucked and suck dick etc.

I  Never actually want to do those things with a man in real life because i  know i would regret it and feel guilty forever for doing that.

Anyways,  I am a straight dude but the minute i start watching porn I start  getting horny and my mind shifts to a more feminine mind. I start  wanting to be a girl, have sex with a man, dress up as a girl, be a  sissy, etc. Now my porn habit has led me to do very weird things. I have  been so horny some days that I make it a mission to drive to malls and  go to Victoria Secret, Macy's, Forever 21, etc and buy women panties,  skirts, fish net stockings, leggings, booty shorts. Then I go home and  dress up in women panties (usually a thong or G-string) then I wear  women skirts or women leggings.  I then chill around the house dressed  like that and watch porn and this combo of dressing like a girl and  watching porn makes my fantasy or fetish with being in the role of the  girl more intensified. However i would never wear a skirt or leggings in  public so What i do most times is i just wear the women panties since  it is hidden underneath my pants.

And  as a result I go on wild adventures wearing women panties. i have  played a game of basketball at a park wearing a thong under my  basketball shorts, I have worn a thong under my sweatpants or shorts to  school a lot of times, during tests, during presentations, during job  interviews. I have worn a thong almost everywhere in public under my  pants without anyone knowing.

However  here is the crazy part, after I jerk off i regret wearing women  underwear and buying women clothes etc. But It got to the point that I  would watch porn so much that I was wearing thongs almost more than i  was wearing boxers. And as a result I got used to how thongs felt on me  and i remember once after jerking off, I showered and without even  reazling it i put on a thong and went to work in it. Thats how used to  it i was that i forgot about it.

Anyways,  watching the porn and getting horny now at my point in life, make me  horny to the point that i want to wear panties and be in a skirt and  when im in a thong and skirt i feel very feminine and girly and i like  that (at the moment) and start having bisexual thoughts like wanting to  be in a cuckold with a girl and some bigger guy where me and the girl  suck the dudes dick. It is weird and stuff but when im off the porn i am  straight as hell and get disgusted thinking about me being in a thong  and thinking all those bisexual thoughts about men.",26Sep2019,1

26,"It was the first day of classes and I chatted with the girl next to me. Her name was one I'd never heard of before and she pronounced it with an accent. I repeated it once or twice to her but by the end of class it had slipped my mind. In leaving, I said, ""(name), right?"" and she was completely appalled, nervously smiling and saying, ""that is not it at all; that is nothing like my name; that makes me really uncomfortable."" My heart and face dropped when she said that. I told her I'm sincerely sorry and didn't mean to hurt her feelings. She didn't say anything else, just shook her head, and other classmates were wondering what happened. I was so taken back that I just left.

I don't know why I'm so hurt by this? I apologized and I don't know what else I could have done. I don't fully understand how it was so offensive, either; people mispronounce my name 10x/day. The names involved were pretty similar, as if I had called her Kassidy if her name was Kassandra (not the actual names used). I think her name was Spanish and the one that I guessed was also Spanish. I'm wondering if that is what made her upset -- if I appeared to be profiling her or something? I know I'm overthinking this but I am unsure of how to approach her next time we have class -- do I ignore what happened; do I ignore her completely? Apologize again? Hope she doesn't sit next to me? I suppose my main question here is what did I do wrong and should I do anything else? This is really eating me up today. Thanks.",26Sep2019,1
27,"I'm honestly pretty torn here. I have a job that I LOVE, more than any job I've ever had and probably more than any job I will ever have. I'm a librarian, and it is just so fulfilling. I love saying I'm a librarian. I love helping my community, I love my coworkers, I love my duties, I love every single bit of it. I've had this job for just over a year and I can count the number of bad days I've had on one hand. I started part time a year ago and earned full time in less than a year, which is practically unheard of in our system and is a huge personal accomplishment. I have worked my butt off, dove into every bit of this job with enthusiasm, and have already established myself as one of the most dependable librarians in our building, according to my managers and coworkers. 

All that being said, the pay sucks. I make nine dollars an hour, despite being a government worker in a job that has very high hiring standards (4 year degree preferred, but not technically required kind of standards). When I started this job, I was in a long term relationship with someone making significantly more than me. The money was not important. But now, I am living on my own. I'm only able to keep afloat through the help of my incredibly generous family. But it feels unfair and childish to rely on them. 

I have an opportunity to take a job as a secretary that pays twelve dollars an hour. While it's not much of an increase, it would be enough for me to cover all my bills on my own. But I know I wouldn't love it as much as I love this job. I've wanted to be a librarian since I was a little girl. And its incredibly heartbreaking that as soon as I achieved this dream, I might have to lose it. 

So, any advice on what I should do? Or just thoughts in general? Thanks Reddit.",26Sep2019,1
28,"Hi. I am a first time landlord. I hired a property management company to provide the full range of services--showing, renting, handling maintenance requests, etc. I don't really know how all this works, so I am wondering if the things that are bothering me about the property management company are things that should actually bother me. What do you think?

**The rental agreement that they had the new tenants sign had three mistakes.**

1. The year the lease ended was wrong. They had the lease running from September 10, 2019 to September 9, 2019. I didn't think this was that big a deal. Easy fix. 
2. They marked in the lease that I would not be providing pest services. I will be. Also, not a big deal, I guess. But deserves clarification. 
3. The unit has a washer and dryer, but were to be included as non-waranteed items--if they break I am not responsible. This non-warranty was not specified in the lease. The washer and dryer were listed as inclusions. 

**When I inquired about these issues, they said they would fix them. I heard nothing. Today I called to ask particularly about the washer and dryer. I was told they had a verbal agreement with the tenant.** 

**They rekeyed the house, which is fine. There are three exits--front door, house-to-garage door, and garage-to-outside door. They only rekeyed the first two. Now the tenants are, reasonably, wanting the other key to match. I asked why they didn't do it at the time and they said the person forgot.** 

**They mis-entered my bank account info into the system so my payment did not come through.** 

I think the thing that bothers me most about all of this is that all throughout there have been no apologies. No acknowledgment that they messed up. It seems to me like they messed up several things--mostly small. I guess that's where I want some advice. Is it unreasonable for me to be bugged?

31,"I am in AP Language Arts, and I want to quit. I'm afraid to do this, because the teacher scares me. To the point where in the hallway, if he walks toward me I start having a panic attack and I flinch. I'm afraid if I ask to leave, he will make a big scene and make me look like an idiot. I just don't think the class is right for me. The workload is too much, and I already have more important commitments. 
I get a certain level of respect, for being an honor student. I'm afraid I will lose that if I quit. But it's worth the worthlessness for being able to live peacefully. I know there will be a lot of Homework next year, but at least it's content that I will know. I need to learn stuff and the one thing he hasn't done yet is teach anything.

32,"It's a long and depressing read friends

Added the TL;DR because it'll be a somewhat long and depressing read, and this is a throwaway account I made just in case my mom or brother sees this. (They use Reddit too so it's pretty likely)

Ever since I was a child I've been overweight; I just sort of kept baby fat and never fully got rid of it and then poor eating habits and meds made it worse, I'm (18M), 6' 0"" and I weigh 304 pounds. When I was younger, (around 7 or 8) my dad was going to college to get his doctorates but it was hard because he's blind, and my mom was working 2 jobs just to keep us afloat. My dad started drinking more and more but because me and my siblings were so young, we never recognized that he was drinking. But as I was saying, when I was 7 or 8 he made me start doing exercise at home but I didn't want to and didn't understand why I should, and why I was the only one out of my siblings that had to, and as I grew older I began to see myself the way my dad saw me. He became hateful, never explaining why we should do things, getting angry with my siblings and I when we made less than a B in classes at school, constantly punishing us, but because my mom was working all the time and we were children, we didn't know any better and we just assumed that's how everybody was treated. He never physically abused us, but emotionally and psychologically it was 24/7. When I was 10 years old I started to feel like my dad hated me, because of who I was, how I looked, how I acted. He was homophobic and racist and I didn't understand why. When I was 11 we moved to be closer to family, (we were in another state so he could go to a decent college), and the financial trouble between my parents got worse, they could barely afford to move, my dad was trying to start a business, my mom was working all the time still and also trying to help my dad set up an office, and I had to go to a new school. On top of all this going on my parents were constantly fighting and I could hear from the basement (this was where my younger brothers and I slept) but because I was so young, I thought they hated each other and my siblings and I because I didn't know it was a financial issue.  I've occasionally had friends but otherwise I've felt like an outsider my entire life in social settings, and in 8th grade my grades dropped horribly. From 8th grade to sophomore year of high school my grades were terrible, and at 15 I had to get a job where I worked 30 hours a week just to pay my phone bill. My dad's drinking problem got worse, I got a girlfriend in high school (we're still dating and go to the same university) and I got bullied in high school just like I did in middle school, and elementary school. My dad berated me for my grades and made me feel stupid, I thought all throughout high school that I was talentless, stupid, and nobody liked me except for my girlfriend, and even then I didn't know if she just stayed with me out of pity. I scored a 25 on my ACT, I had never been more proud of myself because I expected to score lower, I went home and told my dad and the only thing he said to me was ""I scored a 30 and your sister scored a 28, maybe you should retake it to get a higher score."" In senior year of high school I tried to kill myself, I had come to hate everything about myself, I hated how I didn't know how to act around other people and I didn't understand most social cues, I hated being overweight and I felt disgusting, I hated having unexplained anger issues and outbursts, I hated being too poor to take my girlfriend to even the cheapest restaurants when I worked my ass off just to pay my phone bill, gas for my car, and repairs on my old car which I had to do myself, I hated feeling stupid and feeling anxious and I hated the fact that I had gone to therapy since I was 8 and I felt like I had made no progress at all, I hated everything about myself and legitimately believe that the world would be better off without me. I got off work late and absentmindedly drove downtown around midnight, my parents and siblings had gone to sleep, and I drove to the top of a parking deck I knew, and I planned to jump off. In a second I thought of how this would affect my girlfriend, or my mom, or my sister, some of the only people who had ever cared for me, and I called the suicide hotline. I ended up in a locked psychiatric ward for a week and missed school and work, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, after that I was put on Lexapro and felt like shit even more for putting so much emotional distress on my mom and my sister and my girlfriend and my only friend at school. The Lexapro made me gain 20 pounds, which put me at 310, and it made me feel panicky and anxious, so I was put on Zoloft after 6 months of lexapro. I barely got accepted into one of the easiest universities to get into in my state, and since then I've tried to kill myself 2 more times. I think about killing myself every day. I look in the mirror and wish I were a different person, and I feel like there's never a quiet moment in my head. I've never had violent tendencies but I've experienced panic attacks, periods of mania, extreme mood swings, unpredictable and sudden rage, racing thoughts, depression, anxiety, and the list goes on, I hate my classes, I feel unwelcome at my university, I quit my job because my manager was psychotic. I thought that it was supposed to be different here but I was wrong, everybody's still an asshole, and I still hate myself, the Zoloft didn't help so without consulting my doctor I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago and I've been experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I feel like a burden on everybody and I can't tell my girlfriend or mom or sister how U really feel because it'll put more emotional distress on them than necessary, but I don't know what to do. I don't even know how I get myself out of bed every morning. I smoke weed almost every night because that's the only time I can forget who I am, I hate myself, I feel hopeless, nothing has ever worked to fix what's fucked up in my head and I feel like nothing is going to change, I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Therapy has never worked and medicine hasn't either. I feel psychotic and my symptoms have only worsened. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to die but every day it seems like that's a better option than this shitty, horrible life I'm living.

Sometimes he threatens to hit me when he thinks I'm being disobedient, awful (as in being a bad daughter) or stupid (which is often, given that I am rather slow), though he hasn't struck me in many years. Even if his anger isn't directed at me, I still feel on edge. 

I know I'm to blame for this. I'm an adult now. There's no excuse. I actually did try to move away when I was younger, but every job I've had, I've run away from due to how often I would make mistakes. These were minimum wage jobs.

37,"Seven years ago I moved to the west coast for a career. I secured my first job  worked my way up to a low to mid-level position at a different company eventually. Ultimately, I burned out of the industry and quit a stable job in a career I loved at the time. Now, I work a job that I could find pretty much anywhere in the country but the only reason why I like it is the flexibility and unlimited paid vacation time (which isn't too common in NYC or the east coast). It's remote which is a bit isolating but it's good pay and flexible. 

Ever since I moved from the east coast to the west coast my parents have begged me to come back to the east coast sometimes crying. I have older siblings who have kids and they all stayed in my hometown within 15 minutes of my parents. Now more than ever they tell me they want me to move back especially since I changed careers and really don't have a purpose to living on the west coast. 

Personally, I love the people, diversity, the food, culture, outdoors, and weather. Whereas on the east coast, the mountains are much smaller, the summers are way too humid, and winter sucks. The one positive is being closer to family but I'm hesitant I'd be miserable leaving such a great place to live at some point. 

Financially, I'm just fine. Could be better living somewhere cheaper but the line of work wouldn't be too exciting in rural areas of the east coast. 

I do miss my family a lot and see them 3-5x a year for 3 to 4 days at a time and holidays 7 to 10 days. But my parents think I should move back to be closer to them and that I'm selfish. The guilt is so strong. I've expressed this to them in small bursts but haven't gotten too confrontational. 

I'm on the fence about relocating back east as I know I'd be giving up a dream place to live. Regardless, I don't have much of a career purpose on either coast. On top of everything that has been building up, I recently was asked to move-in with one of my better friends closer to the beach. It's cheaper rent, closer to a circle of friends, but still on the west coast -- not sure what I should do. I can either stay put, move-in with my friends or move back east. The first two options would crush my parents and family and risk my general unhappiness at some point in time (so I think) staying put would keep me in my boring routine and moving in with a friend would be more social and cheaper.

They recently hired a new girl at their store that is in the same job position as I am. Their store is super slow and doesn't make as much money as ours so we talked a lot. 

I learned that she gets paid more than I do and does none of the administrative things. So basically she is kind of like another sales associate but with authority and access to everything. She told me that the store manager likes to do all of the administrative things (he seems a bit controlling) and doesn't have the intention of teaching her how to do any of it. 

This pissed me off because some of the administrative things are stressful to do and draining some days. I know what I signed up for so i'm not really complaining about that.

So back in April I ordered this hoodie from a site my fiance has been eyeballing for years. If it matters, the site is RaveNectar. At the time, I ordered a t-shirt and a hoodie. I did receive the t-shirt in a fairly timely manner and the quality was fine. It's now late September and I STILL have not received the $75 hoodie I ordered. The ONLY contact info I have is the following email address: [hello@ravenectar.com](mailto:hello@ravenectar.com). I cannot find a phone number or anything else. I have emailed this email address 15+ times and only one of those emails were answered (in August) which stated, 

""It looks like only the shirt was delivered. I'll get in touch with the factory about this and let you know as soon as I have an update. Thank you for being patient with us!""

Anyway, at this point we don't even want the hoodie. I've made that very clear in my emails, but I DO want a refund because it was expensive and I do not want to let them scam me out of $75. Since this is the only contact I have, I've also posted to all of their social media SEVERAL times. I did get a response on a FaceBook post but all they did was tell me to email the same email address I've been repeatedly emailing.

Went on for like 2 weeks. Till one day he tells me this girl who used to have a crush on him is screenshotting his public snap stories. So I told him to block. He is my man and that bitch isn‚Äôt. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your man‚Äù well he blocked her day or so later. 

The next day I tell him how people at work think I flirt with the new guy. I said ‚ÄúI told them all I have someone‚Äù and gave him my phone. And he saw I snapped the male friend. He asked but i told him it was nothing. I even invited him to my work function and he did come that night. 

Well the next day I went out to dinner with another male friend. It was supposed to me a group thing but just me and that guy.  While there I  ran into my ex from a year ago family and hugged my exes mom. 

I told the guy in question and he got mad. We got into a big fight over things and he called me a mean word. So I just told him I‚Äôm done forever. 

I guess he still had my social media account cause he saw I asked my male friend to buy me a makeup set. And my male friend said ‚Äúfor your bday ;)‚Äù 

Well he flipped and another fight. Anyways this went on for another 2 weeks. But during that time of him begging and me trying to tell him to stop or calm the situation down. I started sleeping with the male friend and dating him. He even started telling me about his past that he never told me about. 

I had enough and rubbed it in my exes face


He called me a cheater and all sorts of things

Funny thing is this whole time he was friends on social media with girls he liked and had crushes on. And if one would have said hi he would have replied.",26Sep2019,0

today when i got home from school, i went to go walk the dog i‚Äôm dog sitting. i met up with my boyfriend who wasn‚Äôt that far down the road from my house so it was a fairly short walk but still. 
any please note that the dog is a pit bull. she‚Äôs not at all aggressive but she looks like it (dark fur, scar across her nose, etc.) 
so me and the dog had just met up with my boyfriend and she tackles him with love and so forth. there are middle schoolers walking to their houses and i‚Äôm trying to keep her from getting too overly excited and tackle them, too. she tugs really hard in her leash to a kid and i try to grab her and pull her away. as i do her leash (which is a chain with a cloth handle [shes very energetic and will basically rip through anything else]) wraps around my finger and pulls the skin. basically like a scrape but with no blood. my boyfriend grabbed her and barely 30 seconds later i feel very dizzy and my eyesight is very blurry and blotched and i cannot heat very well. i didn‚Äôt know what was happening and i figured i‚Äôd ask others lol. 
any help or idea would be wonderful, tysm.",26Sep2019,0

80,"I believe someone I know is in an unhealthy and toxic relationship.

 My boyfriends sister, Anna, 18, is dating a guy named Joe, 20. Joe is the older brother of her former boyfriend of 1+ year. Joe dropped out of high school at 15, hasn't had a single job since, is addicted to marijuana despite it being illegal where he lives, and lives with Anna in her parents house. Her parents insist that he doesn't actually ""live"" there despite the fact that he sleeps their every night, showers their every day, eats dinner and breakfast with them, has a key to the house, knows the house security codes and stays in the house everyday while everyone goes to work. When Anna started a new job after graduating high school, the very first day she worked, Joe locked himself in the house and threatened to kill himself if she didn't come home. (It should be noted that he made previous threats like this to his former girlfriend when she tried to break up with him, which is unstable and manipulative behavior) I think the parents do nothing for two reasons: 1.) Joe is the son of family friends, and 2.) when they tried to make Joe sleep at his parents' house for a few days, Anna and Joe threatened to run away together and live in a homeless shelter, and they even shacked up at Joe's grandma's house for a while. They're afraid to discipline Anna because of her dramatic reactions to normal parenting. I believe Joe will ruin this girl's life if they stay together, and that it could even impact my relationship with MY boyfriend as a result of familial strain, because they're too afraid to show their anger to Anna, they force it all on my boyfriend for minute things. Anna never posts pictures of herself hanging out with her many friends like she did before she started dating Joe, and she's begun posting some indicative posts on Facebook about being depressed and anxiety and stuff like that. There's probably nothing I can do, but at the same time I can't just sit by and do nothing - any advise, or should I just leave well enough alone?",26Sep2019,1

There are some red flags I'm worried about.

1. She's started staying out til 3am, 5am and sometimes 9am with friends I've never met.
2. She's always on her phone texting someone.
3. She gives me fewer and fewer details about where she's been and with whom.
4. Every time I mention the slightest thing about her behavior she gets livid.
5. Intimacy has dropped drastically.
6. She spends more time in her home office than in the living room with me like we used to.
7. Even the most basics of affection such as handholding is a chore for her.
8. She's stopped claiming me on social media posts, blocked tagging and doesn't post photos of us like she used to.
9. Masking more plans without me.
10. Doesn't respond to texts or calls anymore... Ghosting. And when she does it's all one word replies.

95,"

This all started back in January, where I noticed that this girl, (we‚Äôll call her L) was staring at me quite a bit in some of my classes. A friend of mine asked her what was going on, and she said that she had no interest in me whatsoever. She even went as far to call me ugly and weird. I don‚Äôt remember seeing any staring for about a month after that. After that month though, she started doing it again, but this time much more often. I noticed it practically every day and staring seeing other signs, like her taking her time to walk in front of me etc. I even tried staring back at her and saw that when I looked, she would move her eyes away. I decided not to do anything about it at the time and summer came.. During summer I saw that she had created a Instagram account. I decided to try and follow her since we are acquaintances. She never accepted my follow request during this time and still hasn‚Äôt. This year has now started and things have been a little different. Ever since the time she called me ugly, we hadn‚Äôt said a word to each other. I decided to finally say something to her after all this time (keep in mind it‚Äôs been almost 7-8 months) I say something really simple to her, I can‚Äôt really remember it, and a couple days later she finally says something to me (she would never talk to me, even in group assignments where we were supposed to ask every person in the class something, she would never come up to me, but I guess I never went up to her either. Not long after this she told me that she already knows that I‚Äôve been crushing on her, but never said anything about what her thoughts were on that. My friends keep egging me on to ask her out but idk what to do, and I really don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself. Just a college student asking for advice, what should I do?

96,"Ever since freshman year of high school, I had dreamt of studying physics in college and going on to work at NASA. Obviously, it's easy to say all that, but I was genuinely in love with physics. Right before junior year started, I told my parents of my aspirations and they completely supported me...until they asked me how much money physicists make. At that time, I didn't exactly know that a Master's or PHD was what everyone looked for when hiring physicists for a job so I just looked up the salary of a college graduate with a Bachelor's in Physics. I don't remember seeing anything too high, and this led to my parents rejecting the idea of becoming a physicist. I didn't take it too seriously since college was far away. 

As the years went by, my passion for physics remained the same. I kept telling my parents how much I wanted to study physics but they always kept bringing up the salary, kept asking me what I would do as a physicist and whether or not I wanted to spend the rest of my life researching or teaching. When I said I wouldn't mind teaching but research is something I wanted to do from the bottom of my heart, they said it'll be hard to find jobs anywhere. My parents are immigrants, and they've really seen nothing but hardship and I get why they want me to get the best education, the best job, and have the best life for myself.  

When it came time to look out for colleges, I applied as an Electrical Engineering major since it was the most theoretical and math-based engineering field, something that resembled with physics. I'm in college now. Electrical engineering is definitely fun, but I feel jealous of people when they say they're majoring in physics. I always feel this regret inside of me, like ""Damn. I could've been that person, majoring in something I love a lot."" 

On one hand, I tell myself, ""I don't care about the money. I just want to pursue something I'm passionate about and end up discovering something big in physics."" On the other hand, I think, ""Electrical Engineering is a lucrative and in-demand field. A higher pay would allow me to take care of my parents in the future along with my own family."" 

Electrical Engineering is interesting, but I'm not so sure I see it as something I would do in the future. What do I do?",26Sep2019,2

99,"So this is a long story I'll try to make it short. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I messed up. My dad and I have never gotten along, he is not a nice person and is an even worse father. The only real support he ever provided me was financially. He's not rich or anything, but just good with his $$. He was an alcoholic and drug addict and married an alcoholic who used to hit me and almost killed me once bc she strangled me when she was drunk. She spent a little bit of time in jail and then was on probation. Needless to say, they're not my favorite people.

My dad got really sick over the summer due to some chronic health issues he's had for a while. He ended up being very close to dying, to the point where we all expected him to die, doctors told us he was going to die and to start to try to brace ourselves for it, etc. My grandmother (his mom) left me some money when she died in Aug 2018 so I could go back to school but left it to him to disperse to me when I needed it. That's always been his way of controlling me, with money.

So over the summer when he was basically going to die, before he had to be sedated/intubated, he told me to tell him how much I needed for tuition. In reality it was like $7500, but I told him it was $15k. I did this ONLY BECAUSE my stepmother had gained access to the account because he was getting too far gone and I knew if he did pass away, even though that money belongs to me, she never would have given it to me and I wanted to make sure to have enough for my classes for the following semester in case FAFSA didn't come through and/or some cushion money so I could work a little less while trying to go through nursing school.

Well now fast forward two months he miraculously recovered and is going to be fine. He's now telling me he needs a receipt for the tuition for tax purposes. I haven't spent any of the extra money or anything, it's all in my bank account, but what should I do? Part of me wants to come clean and tell him so that way I have a reason to cut myself off from him permanently (something I've truly been wanting for a long time) but the other part of me is so scared. He doesn't pay any of my bills or anything, I still work as close to full time as I can manage and pay my car payments/credit card bills and other things I have to pay for, but he is the co-signer on the car loan I have from a few years ago and I'm not really sure how I would continue school without the $$ from my grandmother.

Does anyone have any idea what I can do??? This is all real and I know I'm an idiot but I just wanted to make sure I'd be set up for at least next semester and he doesn't see anything wrong with his witch of a wife so he'd never believe me if I said it was because I knew she wouldn't give me any of the $$ being left to me. Please don't say anything rude - I am AWARE it was not the right decision and clearly I was thinking with emotion and not logic. I need genuine advice, not to be berated for a bad decision I made in the moment.",26Sep2019,3

101,"Hello! So I‚Äôm going to try and make this as short as possible but I‚Äôd really love any feedback/advice/hopeful words.

So I moved states over two times in the year two past year. My hometown was pretty okay but I guess I didn‚Äôt realize it when I was there. Finally I found a stable home with my boyfriend and things have been pretty good. I had one really close friend here and they really helped me get out of the deepest hole I was in. Recently they‚Äôve completely cut ties with me since his girlfriend thought some fucked up shit, ya know the entire jealous/insecure mindset. (She ended up saying a lot of shit about me, my family who she‚Äôs never even met, and my boyfriend.)

He ended up breaking up with her then getting back together with her a good  amount of times and each time they got together he would dodge me completely, which really pissed me off since I was the only one he would dodge (he‚Äôd answer my boyfriend lmao). So it got to a point where I tried talking to him and letting him know that the shit was dumb and just treat me like normal. I guess he didn‚Äôt agree and got tired of me or whatever and cut me off. He blocked me and I deleted him on other socials since I didn‚Äôt want to see anything of him and now it just really sucks. I don‚Äôt really have any other close friends at all and he was the only friend I felt like I could get along with and not feel anxious around like my other friends, he was a brother to me at this point. Because of all of this I‚Äôve just felt completely alone and I guess I have an issue with cutting people off. I feel like him as well as other friends I‚Äôve tried getting along with are just judging me now. I want to know what I did wrong within the situation but he won‚Äôt even tell me. 

At this point it‚Äôs just increased my depression and anxiety completely. I feel so low of myself and honestly I think about just ending it every night. I have my boyfriend but he doesn‚Äôt really understand how I‚Äôm feeling even though I‚Äôve tried to explain it multiple times and all that. Any advice on how to get out of this feeing, just not feeing worthless since I don‚Äôt even hear from any of my friends I had now.

Sorry for all this being long still haha, I‚Äôm not great at making long stories shirt.

Another is her rules, if you take a test out of the classroom on accident, you get an automatic 20% off and are no longer allowed to do test corrections for the next test. Maybe this is something other teachers have but I have never had one treat us like we are stupid and lazy. Any advice? Am I just nitpicking?",26Sep2019,1
104,"I‚Äôm not talking about performance nerves or being nervous before a game day. 

During my training camp, I‚Äôve been dealing a lot of family issues during this time, and today, a fight broke out between me and my father, which resulted into him cutting ties with funding for my sport, and wants no part in it. 

During the past 1.5 month of training camp, my father has been toxic, negative and discouraging me. Even though he had been previously funding my sport, he wanted me to pursue something else, hence which causes him to spit negative remarks on me. Which hurt. I never expected my own father to be very discouraging

It‚Äôs not criticism or soft-toned recommendations. It‚Äôs flat out bullying me out of something I‚Äôm good at and want to continue. 

Today was a peak, and it led me to break down and this whole week of him making things difficult, I haven‚Äôt been entirely focused on my fight. I also feel like I‚Äôm rushing into this tournament.

There is another tournament next January that is also qualifying so I do have a second chance but I have to enter a bigger and difficult division

109,"Hi reddit. It‚Äôs been a very long and draining week so I apologize for any grammar mistakes or misspelling ahead of time. 

Last Tuesday, my grandmother suffered a massive stroke. Realistically, it should have killed her, and now I am wishing that it had. She spent the majority of last week unconscious in the ICU. The doctor kept telling my family that we had to wait and see what kind of recovery she could have, which was an immediate red flag to me. I thought that if they had any positive outlook they would be able to tell us right away. Instead, they sort of tip toed around the issue and said that they couldn‚Äôt say one way or the other what the outcome would be. 

This past weekend, a neurology doctor finally met with my grandfather, as well as his and my grandmother‚Äôs kids (6 of them ranging from 50-60 years old, including my mother). He delivered the bad news that my grandmother has lost all cognitive ability, she will never speak or swallow again, she will not move, and she cannot understand anything being said to her. It was a huge blow to my grandfather, and my mother and her siblings are devastated (understandably so). My mother and all but one of her siblings - my aunt - are on the same page as far as their wishes regarding my grandmother goes. They would really like to see her pass, as peacefully and painlessly as possible. My aunt, however, is insistent on giving my grandmother a PEG tube and moving her to a nursing home to ‚Äúgive her a fighting chance.‚Äù 

The neurology doctor, as well as my cousin who is a doctor and works specifically with hospice patients, have told my aunt that my grandmother has no chance of improvement. My grandmother is more likely to develop dementia or die of something like pneumonia than improve. My aunt does not want to believe it, and insists that we all ‚Äúgive her a fighting chance.‚Äù Her own children have tried calling and convincing her otherwise, her siblings have, and she will not hear it. 

Today, I visited my grandmother in the hospital. She had two more small strokes (I can‚Äôt remember if they happened last night or this morning), and the doctor said that if we don‚Äôt make a decision soon, then another stroke will most likely kill her. She is awake now, and she looks so fucking depressed. She looks like she wants, and is ready, to die. I know that she can recognize me, she takes my hand and squeezes it, and looked directly at me with recognition in her eyes. But she was so, so sad and so, so depressed. She looked defeated. 

How do I convince my aunt that letting her go is the right thing to do? We have tried coming from an ethics viewpoint, we have tried coming from a factual viewpoint, we have even tried coming from a religious viewpoint (my aunt and grandmother are devoutly catholic, and several of my family members have spoken with priests who even say that the church says letting her pass is the right thing to do because it is a quality of life thing). My grandmother deserves to pass in hospice, painless and in peace. Please send me any and all advice to make my aunt see that my grandmother is suffering and she needs to let her go.

I'm currently living with my dad and my stepmother, both in their late thirties. 

I've been having issues with school. My ADD is making it impossible for me to focus on school work. That is causing my grades to go down. A lot. I currently have a 61 in Spanish and a 77 in history. That is causing depression to creep back in because I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm not trying hard enough. It's also causing my anxiety because I know that as soon as my dad sees the grades that I have, he's gonna take away the only means of communication I have with the outside world; my phone. Then I won't be able to reach out when I'm feeling anxious or depressed, I'll just have to suck it up and deal with it.

I told my dad that my depression was getting better so he cancelled my appointments with my therapists and my phycologists, as well as took me off of my antidepressants. I never had medication for the other two, so I've never really been at peace.

I don't want to go to my dad and ask him for help because if I tell him that I need to talk to my psychologist, he's gonna think I'm suicidal again and talk me to crisis. I want to get help and he's the only one that can do that but he jumps to conclusions really quickly and I don't need to go to crisis again.

I need a way of approaching this that won't set him off. He never listens to me so all of the stuff I say will just fly out of his head as soon as it goes in until I say ""I need you to book me an appointment with my psychologist."" I need a way of getting and keeping his attention for more than 30 seconds.

I have kids and school, I don't work because I take care of him most of time and we are waiting on his insurance to approve him for a nursing home which I doubt will workout because he is usually so rude to the staff.

My pain and confusion comes from him wanting me to be home at his apartment 24/7. I literally do nothing but watch my kids, go to school and take care of him, no alone time or relaxing days which is taking its toll on me mentally. When I am not at home he is constantly calling me asking when I will be home.

My mother has a history of drug use (including intravenous), and had a myriad of health issues at the end of her life, so I honestly didn't expect anything to be viable.

Surprisingly, three people received organs successfully: each of her kidneys and her liver were healthy enough for transplant. I recently received a letter notifying me that the donations were all successful and letting me know I could send a letter through the transplant organization to the recipients.

Now, I'm not sure what I should do. My mother was not a good mom. We were estranged because she was abusive and refused to do anything to salvage our relationship. That, coupled with her addiction, makes me nervous. What if these people want to know about her? What if the truth makes them feel conflicted about their transplants? What if I lie or omit info?

132,"Hello all, I am 22 and I am girl.  A month ago I moved to my first apartment, after living with my ex boyfriend. The complex is small, one level little cottage style apartments, it is close to work and it‚Äôs within my budget. 

The month that I have been here, I noticed most of my neighbors are older, and retired. My closest neighbors (close as in distance) are all males, living alone, one of them is retired and the other 2 seem like they are in their mid 30s. 

Recently I left my key in my car so I had to call my insurance, one of my neighbors introduced himself, and asked if everything was okay. I do not remember him saying anything about being able to open my car in case this happened again or offering his help in the future. 

Moving on about a week ago, friend visited for the first time, and after he left he said that there was sticky note on the car, with ‚ÄúDans‚Äù phone number, and the message ‚Äúif you want to open‚Äù I thought that maybe it was my neighbor from the day my keys were in my car. Didn‚Äôt really think about it too much. 

The day, my friend came over over, again there was a number, the same sticky note with just the phone number, ON MY DOOR. This creeped me out but I thought that maybe he just wanted me to know the number.

Okay so today is when I got really scared. When I came from work, there was an envelope with their apartment number on it (if it is actually them) I can‚Äôt make out what it says but it says either ‚ÄúI agree with one stalk‚Äù
Or ‚ÄúI agree with one stack‚Äù. My friend visited me last night. And it also says something like‚Äù I can get mine now‚Äù

Some time later I start seeing a lot of posts from the husband who had been pretty quiet on there to that point.  (Though I admit he did try to message me a couple times. But it seemed harmless.). It‚Äôs clear that the couple had split.  And after a few more weeks the wife goes completely MIA and it seems she packed up her kids and left town.

The husband this whole time is posting over and over about his life being over and wanting his family back etc. really having a tough time with the split.

Well folks it has now been years since this happened.  This guy still posts DAILY about how evil his ex was. He literally calls her evil.  And trust me, he paints a convincing picture.  Apparently she cheated on him, was fooling around on him while his mom was in hospice, she took the kids and ran to another state and won‚Äôt let him see them. Now he‚Äôs opened up about her being physically and verbally abusive to him and the kids while they were together.  

But I don‚Äôt know... I get the heebie  jeebies about the whole thing.  This guy is obsessed.   The ex wife posts every now and then about the kids, or some meme but otherwise she‚Äôs fairly quiet. Which is also creepy like she‚Äôs hiding something.

Would it be possible for you guys to walk me through approaching someone, maybe asking them to hangout after school without looking weird? I‚Äôve gone 12 years without friends and it‚Äôs getting really fucking unbearable. 

Thanks for any advice you may have for me

136,"I'm 19 and a freshman in college. Saving my money is something I've always been good at but I don't know how to save it for retirement. I work part time at a grocery store and go to my local community college. I decided to go the community route for two years as I know I'll save a lot of money and that I can transfer to a four year school and pay a lot less than kids who decide to go there from the get go. I've had various people tell me to start saving/investing now as by the time I do retire I'll have a good sum of money saved up. Issue is I have absolutely zero idea how to save for retirement or what to even do, what do I invest my money in? How do I invest it? I wanna start early so I can better prepare myself for the future but need some advice on how I can do so. 

I'll be honest, investing my money is something I've been wanting to do for awhile. Though since I have no clue how to do so properly, I've been too scared to try. Saving for retirement is something that's been on my mind since I was 18 but I've now decided to really start doing it. Any advice will be appreciated and if it can help me start sooner than later I'll really appreciate it.",26Sep2019,2
137,"We both have jobs (she recently left her previous one and bounced back pretty quickly thank god), but whenever I have to go to my job she is very clearly sad. 

Picture us playing video-games and I say ""hey I have to start getting ready for work"", and she'll sigh, turn off her ps4 really quick and just lay in bed and be on her phone. It becomes worse when I GET to work.

I'll get texts from her telling me that she is depressed and feels like a failure from not being able to find something to do while I'm gone. I've told her many times to find a hobby or do SOMETHING other than being on her phone all day or do chores (she feels obligated to do chores around the house on her days off). I've told her many times that she's not obligated to deep clean the entire house (I would let her do it if she seemed enthusiastic about it, I know many people find it fun and relaxing to clean, but she ain't one of them). It's even gotten to the point where she is even unhappy being on her phone, so she just does nothing all day.

Anyway, today I felt like I've reached a boiling point. I got home and she was just sitting on the couch and welcomed me very nicely. I asked her how her day was and she said it was rough and boring. She then proceeded to tell me ""I missed you a lot, did you miss me too?"" and she knows the answer that question already. I don't ""miss"" anyone when I'm at work, I just put my brain on autopilot and wash dishes for 7 hours.

To be frank, she just feels depressed and unmotivated to do anything while I'm not around. She doesn't know how to make friends or have any hobbies of her own, but still keeps telling me how depressed and useless she feels every day that she doesn't have work, and I cant stand it anymore, I cant keep telling her the same shit I've told her since day 1.

141,"Technically this is my boyfriend's (now fiance! He just proposed!) Apartment. I moved in with him almost 2 years ago. The way this house is set up the upstairs is split into two small apartments and the downstairs belongs entirely to his dad. So we technically do live with his father but at the same time we don't. We have our own apartment and we pay his dad a small rent fee every month.

But this place is tiny. I have nowhere to put any of my own stuff. I'm doing my best to find nifty space-saving storage options (like a wire shelf that slides right behind the toilet with shelves over top). We don't even have an oven/stove.

 I feel like I'm beginning to go crazy... I'm trying so hard to get everything cleaned up and as organized as possible, I want to ""renovate"" the bedroom. I'd like to get a dresser so I can find a place for all of my clothes (which I'm currently going through, I plan on cutting my wardrobe in half at least). I want to get rid of the giant unused desk he's got in there that takes up so much of our already limited space. I've asked him to help me sort through everything in there so many times but there is always a excuse for why it can't be done. I'm not an extreme OCD person, I'll admit I can be messy.. but there comes a point that I can't stand the clutter anymore and I go into full OCD Purge/clean mode. But this is one situation I can't tackle alone. I keep trying to tell him if he would just help me on a weekend off we could get it all done and as long as we keep up with it it'll never take up more than maybe an hour of our time again. His answer is always the same, I know and we will... But it never gets done.

I'm at the point where I just want to set the place on fire and start over. I want to move into our place, living here is nice because we can save serious money not having to pay much of anything for rent. But it's just so cramped. I want a clean organized bedroom I can walk in and relax in. I want a kitchen with enough cabinet space for groceries and storage, and that has an oven I can cook with (ideally a dishwasher too because asking him to do dishes is like setting the plague on the world) Honestly if he would just help me get the bedroom to where I'd like it to be I don't even think staying here would be so bad. Yea the kitchen situation sucks but we have other tools that get us by. And if I really want to use the oven I can ask his dad and just make a meal for everyone.

He helps with every other part of the house (mostly and albeit reluctantly) but he won't help me with this bedroom, and I feel like I'm the verge of a melt down. 

Sorry about my long and boring (and probably completely inconsequential rant... I just needed to vent a little I guess. I just don't know what to do about it anymore. I try to do it by myself but any time I make some progress by myself it's one step forward and two steps back because within days it's right back to where it was.

Tl;dr my apartment is tiny and I can't get my fiance to help me do the deep cleaning/purging it needs to get organized and maximize space.",26Sep2019,1
142,"Okay so this situation did happen in the past, but I'm looking for guidance if it happens again.

I'm on the main campus for my college. This campus is HUGE. Own zip code huge. Own emergency services huge. Might be the biggest in my state. This is relevant to the next tidbit of information:

The whole campus is a smoke-free zone. You're not allowed to light up a cig anywhere on campus.

I admit I probably have a bit of a bias against smokers since I'm asthmatic (moderate, it hurts but it won't kill me) and allergic to cigarette smoke. (Gives me mild but lasting headaches.)

So as you could probably guess, I'm leaving my classroom and am smacked in the face with the smell of a cigarette. I look around in confusion and see a woman smoking, about 30 feet upwind from the door (and 5 feet away from a no smoking sign lol)

What I wanted to do was say ""Really? Right in front of the sign?"" And take a passive aggressive inhaler puff. But I had a class to get to so I just covered my face and left.

What would be the best way to approach this in the future? I know smoking is an addiction, and she and people like her would have to drive to another zip code to get the fix. I also know getting an expulsion wouldn't help with the problem of their addiction, and in fact might worsen it, so I would like to avoid campus security.

At the same time, I appreciate the clean air and breathing ability my school promises.

Is there a middle ground way to approach this?",26Sep2019,0

I then proceed to stay up procrastinating a couple of hours into the morning or pulling an all-nighter all together. I get anxious (not a medical condition) and I don't have the mental capacity to do the work but I also can't go to sleep because I feel guilty that I didn't finish my homework. I probably won't if I let myself fall asleep because I can't wake up in the morning. For the past year, I caved in and I just set alarms at random 5-15 minute intervals (ex: 3:03, 3:08, 3:19...) for the entire night, hoping that I would wake up at some point and find the motivation to finish my homework. I've done this so many times, I think I cease to hear my alarms. I use two alarm clocks and my phone with my alarm settings at full volume. I've slept through \~25 alarms once. Sometimes, I actually start the home work and realize that it's something I could have easily done in 0.5-2 hours. I'm really falling behind on my work in my classes.

149,"Hey guys, I'm a 16 year old turning 17 next month and I live in Toronto, Canada. I just started grade 12 and am now supposed to be choosing what field I'll be going into for university and now should be looking at what program &amp; university I want to go to. The thing is I am completely lost. More recently I've been put under pressure by my school and father to find out what I want to do for the rest of my life, like yesterday...

I'd describe myself as someone who does not want to live with regret later on in my life. I don't want to be able to look back and say man ""what if I had done that or what if I had done what i wanted to do..."" 

In life my main goal is to be wealthy and successful. I want to live a life that will be remembered. I want to have an impact that stays and will be remembered once I leave this planet. But I do not know what I want to do or do I?

The pressure being put on me is all about academics and what field I want to go in but I just can't imagine having a office job and making shit pay or doing like an engineering degree or becoming a lawyer/doctor or anything like that. I just don't want to be average. Like I feel it's not satisfying enough. I've been speaking to my school guidance counselor about this and I think she just doesn't understand what I mean. 

My dream as a child was to become a professional footballer but I have always been scared to take that next step into joining a proper organized competitive team, where I can have the chance to reach my dream. But I've always not been able to do this. Back in my middle school days due to my parents not being able to travel to take me to practices or games I was never able to join a competitive team. Now that I have the opportunity to join a competitive team and this is literally my last chance, as it is my final year in high school, I can't understand how to express to my father that I want to play football professionally. I've brought up how I want to join a team but I haven't flat out made it obvious I want to play professionally. He tells me to be more focused on school because that's what will help me get a job and what not. Which I understand. But I feel like I've wasted the past 6 years on not attempting to make way towards my football dreams that the time is now slipping away and if I don't act now, I'll forever live with the regret that I could've. 

I AM REALLY CONFUSED ON WHAT TO DO.",26Sep2019,2

So here's the story. I saw a story post on snapchat from a guy I met at a party. It said ""who wants to make 300-400 bucks a day legally"" I was like hell yeah! So I hit the guy up and he sent me to another guy on snapchat. The guy said he would send me into a phone store and put a downpayment on 2 iPhone xs max's and give them to him. (explaining that he worked for a competing company and he would take over the contract tomorrow) it seemed convincing as he was dressed nice spoke well and drove a new lexus. Then I got on here and saw that it was a scam that had happened to other people. Around the time I looked up from my phone he opened the center console and I saw a glock pistol buried under some papers as he pulled out BLUNT WRAPS AND WEED (non legal state) and I knew at this point I had to go. There was another guy they picked up on the way to get me who refused to give them the phones until they brought paperwork to get the phones out of his name. They threatened  him (without the gun, just a couple shoves) and told the poor guy to hoof it. So then it's my turn to go in and I didn't want to do it but I went in anyways with $200 they guy handed me in my pocketand told the clerks what was going on. They let me out the back door and I booked it out of fear and hid up the street until I bribed a ride from a friend as it was about an hour and a half away from where I lived. He came and got me and I paid him $100 for the ride and the guy I ran from got information about me and where my family lives posing as my friend to other mutual people me and party guy knew. He is now threatening to shoot my house up and the whole 9 yards. I understand  what I did was wrong so I gave him the money I had left ($50) and left it in a hiding spot with him agreeing to stop perusing me. I sent him the location and as soon as he got the money I got another message from him saying ""it's not enough"" and  another message saying ""watch what I do to your family"" that's where I'm at as of right now.

I was telling my gf that my gut is telling me not to take her home because the previous owner was making my Spidey senses tingle. Gf convinced me that I'm just being nervous.
Turns out I was right as we are out with Ziggy for at least 4 hours a day and she still has a lot of energy left. She also has very strong hunting instincts. Furthermore, her fur makes me itch and our situation has changed. Gf's cabin crew work contract wasn't extended and I said that she should take 6 months to learn the language in my home country (where we're living) and maybe add some skills to her repertoire - I suggested Adobe PS, Illustrator, and InDesign (she likes design and has a good eye). She could then stay home with the pup while I'm working and just focus on her studies and improve her chances of getting a new job. Turns out she manage to get a job, starting a week after the old one finishes. Not to mention that Ziggy has grown a lot in the 3 weeks we've had her and my gf is not strong enough to control her while out on walks as she pulls a lot. I've decided that we should find Ziggy a home that can cater to her needs better than we can. Me itching is also part of the decision. Gf said that we should just find a doggy daycare center for when we're working and that I'm just giving up on her. She loves animals, or at least the cute looking ones, and falls in love with them very easily. So now she's crying every day, saying that her friends and family will hate her for doing this and that I'm an asshole. I just want what's best for Ziggy tbh and have found a family that are very outdoorsy, husband wants to train her to search for wounded animals (from traffic accidents) as well as take her out for hunting. The wife is home most of the time and really interested in dog psychology and had already a lost of courses they're going to take together with Ziggy. They also have a child that would like to do agility with her if possible. 
I really care for Ziggy Kunta Kinte Bigos and keep doubting my decision, but I feel like it's better to find her home that fits her and her needs than making her fit ours. I could live with the itching for my gf but it doesn't make the situation any easier. 

Any thoughts or suggestions on what I should do or if I'm making the wrong/right decision would be mucho appreciated.

175,"I'm a female in my teens. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so fucking sad. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning. Not like a, ""ughh mornings yo i can't do em."" But, like it's hard to think of a reason to get up and do things. I thought it was PMS, because mine is always so bad. But, It didn't start after my period ended. I started the pill after said period and I thought maybe I just can't handle the pill. That was almost three weeks ago. It just won't stop. I see a counselor, and I know this sounds stupid, but I don't like talking about my feelings. I've told her I'm very sad and she's said keep an eye on it and that hormones can be powerful. I absolutely agree with her but, my mom suffers from depression and I'm terrified that that's what this is. I've told her I'm feeling better because I don't want to see a doctor but at this point I think I should. I just don't know anymore. The best description of the feeling i can give is that I feel like I'm drowning. Like I'm in a hole and there's no way out. I'm not hungry as often, after anything social I feel good for a little bit then it's like i've been dragged back into the hole.

177,"Hi all, I'm currently a pre-med student. I'm not even in medical school yet, but I'm already so stressed out. It's not the courses per se, my grades are stellar, but I'm a very neurotic person by nature, so it feels like I push myself harder and harder each day. I used to think I thrived under pressure, but now I'm not so sure. 

My question is, if I were to give up on a career in medicine, what other career options do I have? I haven't decided if I want to give up yet, but if I did, I know that I would want a fresh start. What I mean by that is, I wouldn't want an alternate career in healthcare; I would want to get pretty far away from the medical field. One other career option interests me, and that is being a mortician. I have also considered being a mail carrier as I've heard they make pretty good money and it doesn't seem like a terrible job. 

My main issue is that I'm worried I won't feel like I have a purpose. I had myself convinced that hard careers like medicine, law, etc. were the only way to go if I wanted to feel fulfilled.

My mom is psychotic and always has tried to one up herself to hurt the rest of the family. Her latest stunt this week was to have a bonfire with every single thing from our childhood and even some adult life stuff i had stored there and send me gloating messages about it. Now my dad is literally the only thing left there she knows we care for. I feel its only a matter of time until she flips and goes after him.

He told me when we were closer before she drove bigger and bigger wedges between us that he sold all his guns because he was afraid of her. Said he kept a couple well hidden pistols just in case. This is no way to live....

We are thinking of a big family intervention to get him out of there with my brother, dads brothers and sisters, even friends of ours. We figure shes less likely to try anything with a group of us.

183,"I (16M) haven't been a good kid, I never have. I've always gotten frustrated with my parents quickly and wanted them to leave me alone, and I didn't appreciate the things they do for me. In short, I never really tried to work on my lesser qualities or anything.

But in the last few weeks, I've been trying so hard to improve and better myself. I've been on top of every school assignment, I've been doing all my chores and I've been keeping conflict with my siblings very low. My dad told me if I'm going to use computers, it has to be for homework and it has to be in the chair where he can see what I'm doing at all times, so I started sitting there instead of the other side of the table (against the wall). He said I needed to have the dishes done earlier, so I started doing them earlier. I've been trying so hard but nothing seems to get better.

Today my dad told me that what I'm doing isn't nearly good enough for him. He's always telling me to open up about my depression/anxiety/ADD but what little I do tell him he takes as a half-brained excuse. I tried to explain to him that I was trying my best to do everything right after messing up so badly for so many years, but he says whether I try or not doesn't matter, but results matter. When I told him that something that's easy for him was much harder for me, he said it didn't matter because if I wanted something, I had to go through him and his opinion on what ""improvement"" means. It's been a few weeks since I really started trying to improve and it seems like nothing's improved.

I don't know how I could possibly meet his expectations, which he says are already low. I don't know how to tell him that what his idea of ""results"" means is so much more than I could manage. He thinks that if you work hard enough you'll get the results, simple as that. But he's so much more capable that I am, and I won't be able to catch up.

How can I explain to my dad that I can't continue on like this? It may not seem like much, but I have really been trying to do my homework and my chores and go to church/scout activities (which I don't like to do at all) without any complaint.

I hate lessons, hence all of the accumalitive time that's built up spending time working with this instrument had felt like a waste of my life, even though this skill has immeasurably benefited my ability to play other instruments.

189,"I'm an early 30s male. Single. I make alright money for not having a college degree, and I plan to get a $5-$7 raise within 1 year. My job is secure, and I enjoy it. The downside is that I took this job to get away from some toxic friends from back home. Although I do still have friends, as well as my mom that I miss. Regardless, if I'm living and working here, I want to feel comfortable.

My realistic budget for monthly housing expenses is $1000.

Most 1bd apartments within 45 minutes from work run $800-$1200/month. Yet these home buying websites say estimated payments are well within my budget, and a realtor mentioned a USDA loan that the whole county qualifies for. She said it's little to no money down, and takes about 30 days to apply. 

This one house in particular is $150,000. It was built this year. 3 bed, 2 full bath with a basement. Once the last 3 houses sell they charge a $200/yr HOA fee, and they plan to install light poles and landscaping once they start growing the HOA account, as it was explained to me. So it sounds like guaranteed and fast increase in home value. Even if I sell it after a few years it seems worse case scenario, I'm able to sell it and walk away without any long term debt. Best case scenario, I like it and decide to keep it, or sell it any time at a small profit.

I'm just very alone trying to figure this shit out as well as severely ADD. (Not just an exaggeration) 
Any advice is much appreciated.

My two biggest questions are:

1. How permanent is buying a house through a USDA loan? Would I be able to sell it within a few years at a profit if I had to?

200,"Hey guys. So I‚Äôm a 16F in Alberta, Canada. This is sort of a shot in the dark, but I was hoping some of you might have some advice on how I should be caring for my younger cousins?

Long and sad post, sorry.

They are 5 and 8, the 8 year old (N) is Hard of Hearing and almost completely nonverbal aside from babbling/baby talk, possibly has a learning disability. Nobody in our family has bothered to learn sign language in order to speak with her, and anything she does at school stays at school. I have no idea what she likes or what her personality is, I‚Äôve been trying to learn sign language but her vocabulary is limited. She still watches baby videos on YouTube for her primary source of entertainment and generally acts like a toddler.

The 5 year old (A) is extremely bright, capable of language. Unfortunately she isn‚Äôt potty trained, nor has anybody really made an attempt to potty train her. Because of this she won‚Äôt be attending school on time, and I don‚Äôt have high hopes that she will be attending school next year either.

The house is filthy. All adults in the house just lay around in their own filth all day, the mother goes on hotel stayed to escape the situation. These children are essentially placed in front of a tv playing toddler youtube videos at 10am and taken off of it at 7pm, so they can be locked in their rooms to watch more toddler youtube videos on their iPad until they presumably pass out.

I watched my older cousin (18) grow up in this exact situation, and no offence to anybody, but he turned into a vegetable. I primarily fear for N, because she may be missing her window to develop her language skills.

The whole side of the family hates me, and every adult in the family is perpetuating this or complicit in it. My own parents included. My father (who no longer wishes to get involved) and I have attempted to call children‚Äôs services MULTIPLE times. They have done nothing and will do nothing, the family has a ‚ÄúCFS drill‚Äù in place. There is nothing they can do, and the case is closed and they will hear nothing else about it. The last time I encouraged a (separate) cousin (B) to call CFS when she was being hurt by her parents, my parents and I were barred from seeing her, and my parents got extremely mad at me for snitching. All this to say that Children‚Äôs Services is not an option. Don‚Äôt even bring it up, it won‚Äôt work. There is still hope for these two cousins, and I will not let myself fuck this up and lose them.

I am turning 17 in November and graduating high school early in June. I am looking to eventually gain legal custody of A and N, maybe even B, although that‚Äôs probably a lost cause and would only complicate things further. I have been doing extensive research into parenting and parenting with learning difficulties, and am confident I can be strong for these children and care/provide for them properly given the chance. I will be leaving and cutting all ties with the family regardless when I graduate/when I turn 18, but I can‚Äôt bear to leave them knowing what will happen.

Any advice other than contacting CFS is appreciated. If you made it to the end of this, thank you.",26Sep2019,1

Let's just say my job has rules against that. I want to let this poor sap know he's getting played, but I keep telling myself it's not my business.

A friend put a reassuring hand on my shoulder yesterday, and it meant so much to me, but I‚Äôd struggle to do the same in return. I just broke down crying as I acknowledged this all to myself.

I think part of why I struggle with this is because of an experience I had in college. I cuddled with my then-best friend once because I felt so safe with him. But I later found out he had a crush on me. He asked me so many times how I could have cuddled with him if I wasn‚Äôt romantically interested. I felt guilty for years. I now know this was shitty of him (and he knows it too and has since apologized), but it still makes me so wary around people. And because I‚Äôm bi, I feel worried that both men and women will misinterpret any touch as an indication of sexual interest. So I don‚Äôt touch people. 

What should I do? I‚Äôm not sexually involved with anyone at the moment, so I go months with zero physical contact. It really gets to me sometimes. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice for how to initiate more contact or for how to get better at feeling okay without it.",26Sep2019,3
213,"First post so please forgive me if I didn't follow the format correctly or if I broke the rules. I am a twenty something year old male who has no support group in place. My immediate family is either suicidal or have plunged deep into nihilistic/depressive dream states. They'll say things like they are just waiting to die and they don't care about anything I bring up to them. My parents worked in the housing market that crashed in 2008 since then it's been a trauma packed adventure ever since. My friend group has scattered and moved away after our time spent at community college. I've alienated myself at my place of work which has resulted in a cut of hours and a tense work environment. My relationship history is rough, probably due to the fact that I can't articulate myself emotionally and/or being used as an ego booster for someone else. It gets better. I'm a virgin :D My whole life up to this point has been constant anxiety as I jumped from other people's problems while neglecting my own self care. I'm trying to get out there and socialize with people, but I'm very discouraged with how media-centric everyone seems to be nowadays. I have struggled with a media addiction since I was a child. So I'm faced now with a dilemma of entering back into that world so that I can hold a conversation with people. I once worked two jobs to try and put myself through college but ultimately burned myself out and haven't been able to find any purpose for my life. I'll have prolonged episodes of trying to better myself (whether it's reading, exercising, helping my family's situation, journaling, meditation, trying relax, trying to learn an instrument) but I'll ultimately get thrown off by medical emergencies, panic attacks, and addiction to the screen. The only thing that makes me feel like I have a handle on all this is weed even if it takes me to a bad trip at least it makes me feel something real. Another problem is that I just started seeing a therapist who will stop doing MDRT treatment if I use. My Therapist isn't all interested in listening to any of this. 

I don't really know what I'm expecting with this post. I suppose I just wanted to tell someone my sad story for once and not be the one who listens to the sad stories of others.

I'm sure there are a few wondering why I haven't tried ""opting out"" of my sad story. Well I've tried my hand at that too in a very passive way. I'd play a game where I'd close my eyes for ever growing periods of time while driving to work. I couldn't even commit myself to that lol I've got one thing going for me.

225,"So I live in an American apartment building where we all have our own mailbox in a hub of everyone's mailboxes. If someone receives a larger package, there are a few larger boxes that unlock with a special key that the postmaster will put in your personal mailbox if you need it. When you unlock the big locker, the lock keeps the key stuck in place so you cant steal it and you just leave with your package.

My problem is that when I got my mail and saw there was a key inside, I immediately tried the large unit under my own mailbox. It didnt work, so i tried the one next to it, and the one next to that, and so on until I tried like 5 boxes. Eventually I doubled back on the first locker and SURPRISE! It worked! 

However, upon opening it, there was another key inside. So picking it up, confused, I went through the process of trying lockers again. Again, it didnt work on any of the doors. So I inspected the key and noticed in small font that it had the same number on it as the locker I took it from. Realizing what probably happened, I looked at my original key, now locked into the locker, and saw that it goes to the locker directly next to it. 

So now its stuck and I dont know how to get my actual locker open. Who do I call or talk to? Do I camp out and wait for the mail man?

226,"This post is the first of this kind I've ever made, but I'm really just having a 'what is wrong with me' moment that I need help to figure out. 
Quick example - 

""Hey do you want to go to ___?"" 

Me: ""Yea sure"", thinking that could be cool I guess, eternally optimistic and open-minded.

The problem is, over 50% of the time, I'm stuck in some situation, on some trip, or at some location, or with some group, and it's like why the fuck am I here right now? I don't want to be here. I don't care about any of this. I DO care about these people who invited me or w/e, but I end up pretending to be happy looking fake and awkward. A lot of the time it comes down to that I'm just not connecting with the people, nor do I really care to talk about Cardi B or Trump or w/e, and I'm totally ok with that. I haven't found the larger group of 'my people', but I keep saying yes to all these things thinking that they're just around the corner or something. 

I'm talking the type of decisions where someone invites you as a 5th wheel on a camping trip (and maybe they're even assuming you'll say no), but your brain says yes that could be fun in the moment. I've even made a major career decision like that and am living through the regret. The answer is obviously 'just say no', but it's complicated because I would have to say no to everyone all the time. If it's because I'm not with the right people for me, then the solution seems like go somewhere else and start saying 'yes' all over again and just be stuck in the same situation.

I'm an honest person and so many people I know bullshit everyone half the time making up fake excuses like telling someone you have plans, but really you just didn't want to go to the concert. I tell people straight forward 'I don't want to go that' and there's no problem. But if you do that all the time, people start to dislike you. So you have to make some compromises, so I think optimistically. I've changed a lot and I think I've outgrown a lot of the relationships in my life right now, but I can't move on and at the same time I don't want to hurt anyone or cut them off. I don't know if my circle is too small or too big, or the people inviting me are just doing so out of their own desperation for connection (ironic...), but I'm doing this compromise literally constantly and it's killing me. 

If you have experience overcoming this issue, please I would love to hear your story or anything that would help. I've just subjected myself to a string of these type of events over the past couple months and particularly bad, larger commitments, and I'm starting to realize it is seriously damaging myself mentally, and that I've been doing this for several years. And I'm getting worse at acting happy. And it shouldn't be euphoric to go and do one thing I want to do because the rest of my life is coerced by other people, it should just be normal. 

I feel like the only option is to move away and totally isolate myself from my current friendships. The worst part is, I know I'm doing this agreeing thing! I have notes written to myself for months that say stop doing this. Stop going over X's house. Stop agreeing to random events. But it's like there are new clever ways that trick me. I meet new people and fall into new traps. What do I do?",26Sep2019,1

I haven‚Äôt confronted them because the husband seems really aggressive and I saw him arguing with another neighbor.

unfortunately, he still had a deep attachment to his ex.

I'm in England, it has recently come to my attention that, when transgender people have children, they are forced to register as mother. if they gave birth.

I understand why, but these terms are so intertwined with gender, that it's no better than permanently misgendering them. So I want to get this changed. I understand that there are medical reasons behind having these terms, but what about changing them to ""Person who gave birth"", and ""Other parent/sperm donor""? (I'm not sure which one would be better).

This way, men don't have to be humiliated by being registered as mothers, and non binary people can feel comfortable too, whilst retaining the same information. It would be much more accurate information, in fact. I'm obviously not saying we should get rid of the terms socially.

Yeah, I think it would be really beneficial, and I want to make something happen with it, I have no idea how, though. It's really important to me that this gets changed.

242,"Hello, 

I am sad writing this post. I rescued a beautiful black lab almost 5 years ago. He was in very bad shape when I found him, someone had shot him and he was starving and had wounds all over. He became my baby, slept with me in bed, and went every where with me. Over the years, I have gotten really busy. I have a full time demanding job, I am married, and I just recently had a baby. I haven‚Äôt had time to spend with him like he deserves. He gets very bored outside and has become extremely destructive and escapes all the time. I have boarded up my fence like a million times to prevent him from escaping and possibly getting hit by a car. I‚Äôm worried he will die if he keeps getting out. Anyways, I have been having intense guilt about not taking care of him properly, and I recently looked into rehoming him. I found a couple who said they have another black lab, and a few acres where they said he could run around and they would take him on their fishing trips etc... I know this would be a better, happier life for him, but I‚Äôm so sad thinking of getting rid of him. What should I do? I can‚Äôt change anything in my life right now to make more time for him and I just want to be fair to him. But it really breaks my heart. Thanks in advance!",26Sep2019,1

A few months ago I accidentally broke my bfs headset and the replacement was a couple hundred dollars and I was willing to pay for half - even all of it because I felt so bad. I wasn't able to pay it right away due to not having the money but I have been able to quite recently and every time I try to offer he says not to worry and he feels bad taking my money. But then other times he will ""joke"" about how I haven't paid him for his new one. 

It seems he does want me to pay for it but doesn't want to take my money, and I've offered to transfer it right away but he would usually say ""I'll send it back"" etc.

The dog lunged at her, she couldn't get away, and bit and shook her till she died. This is sad enough, but what makes me angry and enraged is that when my brother and mother came outside to see what the yelling was about, my mom started screaming for him to try to get the dog to let go-- the dog was not trained and was not listening to its owners commands to drop Gracie-- and the old man yelled ""Jesus, it's already dead!"" in my mothers face while the dog still had her in its mouth. He then proceeded to blame my mother for the whole affair and claim he had ""total control over the dog"". My question isnt what to do legally. I loved that cat.

So I have 3 friends. One (let's call Violin) is my close kinda friend. The other 2 friends are mostly Violins friends not mine. Violin and his closer friend in the group, Bat (I'm not using real names if that wasn't obvious enough) like to pick on their other friend Melon. Usually it's all in good fun with some not so nice things.

V had told me stories of them and B cream getting M to drink someone's piss as ""a prank"" and I guess that's acceptable to them. But recently V was telling me about a new prank they wanted to do on M. Not telling too many details because I know V browses Reddit and I don't want any of them to find out. They basically are planning to give M a sandwich with dog shit pretending it's Nutella. 

Now I've only met M once and they're a sweet younger kid and I feel like this ""prank"" of theirs is a bit far. To the point where I've thought of messaging M giving them a heads up. I mean it's very usual for V and B to ""prank"" M even tho I personally think they are too harsh on the poor guy. V literally told me he feels bad about the things he's done to him but it's also all really funny to him. :/ And like I feel like it's not my place since I'm not very close to I or M but I feel like it's just too mean for me to just let this happen. 

Why not just tell V you think it's a bit fcked up? I wish I could but I'm a bit scared to speak my mind around V. It's dumb I've known them for a good few years but I have my reasons.

256,"I've really been trying to keep my shit together, been trying to get my life together. I'm 18. 

I honestly don't know anymore. I live with toxic grandparents, and there is no way I can leave because the alternative is being homeless. But honestly being homeless doesn't sound so bad sometimes, it sounds much better than staying here sometimes. But I'd end up permanently homeless because my city has no such thing as public transportation, meaning I wouldn't be able to get to work and I'd lose my only source of income. 

And I can't exactly explain it either. I'm trying SO HARD to get my fucking life together, but it never feels good enough. 

But now it's like, my emotions are causing problems at work. They're literally so intense everywhere I go. I don't know if it's depression, but I've definitely been feeling suicidal lately. I feel like I have to act ""normal."" I've always thought everyone else's emotions were this intense, and that I just couldn't hold it together as good as them. But my emotions are way disproportionate to certain situations and I don't know why. It is making my life 10x harder than it should be. 

Like for example, one time at work, I had to work in the morning, and hadn't gotten much sleep the night before. Thanks to this, I definitely wasn't feeling great when I got there. 

But while I was working, a customer ordered a coffee with 7 creams and like 7 sugars. I was still new, so I was a little slower, and I tried to shortcut by not putting the sugar and stuff in, since we had it on the side. But my manager caught it, and got onto me. 

That was all it took, but a few minutes later and I was in the bathroom breaking down into tears. This wasn't a fucking normal reaction. I told my family about it, and they just acted like it was no big deal. And nobody is taking me seriously. They think I'm doing it for attention. 

Since then I've done several things that could've ended up with me being fired, like I literally walked out on my shift once because I couldn't trust myself not to go off on this manager who was kinda making me feel like shit every time I worked with her. I wasn't in the mood to play her games, so I just left. I could've lost my fucking job. Why would I do that? 

I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I'm a little out of it right now. I just feel like nobody understands what I'm going through. But I'm 100% serious when I say my emotions are the problem. I've been trying to take care of myself, trying to learn to love myself, and am working on boundaries. But idk :(",26Sep2019,1
257,"My story is a bit long and complicated. I‚Äôm a 25 year old male from the South Asian country, Bangladesh. I finished my graduation last December with a Bachelors in Business Administration from one of the better schools of my country. I have a GPA of 3.51, good computer/software skills and considerable involvement in extra curricular activities during university years. Since graduation, I have been on the lookout for jobs and opportunities. I applied at almost every entry level position that I came across. I got called for maybe 4-6 interviews and assessment sessions in total but couldn‚Äôt land a job offer anywhere. In July, I got a low paying freelance content writing job online that requires me to work from home. After getting that, I started feeling that I might have studied in the wrong field entirely. Business was a wrong field for me because I am of a slightly introverted nature. However, I have always had a flair for writing and it is the only thing I can imagine myself doing to earn a living. One of my relatives offered me a job at his manufacturing plant but the commute to and from the place is nightmarish plus I have zero interest in leather products. Recently, we got an immigrant visa to the United States through my uncle. We are due to fly there in December. At this moment; I am completely clueless as to what to do. Should I keep looking for jobs in my country that are content based or should I immigrate to the United States and start afresh?

266,"Over the last year, my friend has gradually cut off contact with me and the rest of us eventually not speaking us at all. We are all college aged students and while we were relatively good friends in high school, going to college has made all of us fall apart a bit. We still managed to keep in contact with one another using social media platforms such as Facebook and Discord. However, within the last year, one of my friends suddenly decided to sever all of his online connections with us. He left the Discord server that we used to talk and eventually deleted his Discord account. While he was responsive to texts and other messages, he now ignores them all. All of this happened without warning. Every time we try to talk to him or try to hint at the issue, he never responds or sends anything.

Over the summer, we visited his house and hung out with him, had dinner with him, things seemed oddly fine. While at school, we had a strong feeling that he might have been depressed as we knew he was dealing with an online relationship (through Discord and other online platforms) that supposedly did not end well. We tried contacting the other person in this relationship but she did not share any details about their relationship or what had happened. But this visit was weird. It was almost like he was trying to seem like he was fine and everything was going fine, but it still seemed awkward. Every time we would try to bring up the subject of him suddenly cutting himself off from us online, he would dodge the subject or just not say anything. That was the only time we visited him as for the next few months he was away from home.

I get word that he is back in school and he is doing activities in school and being involved in clubs. I wonder why he is willing to talk with certain people but not me and the rest of us, wondering what we did wrong.

Most recently, I texted him again, asking him directly what was going on, why he no longer wanted to talk to us, if he was okay, and that we were worried about him.

He responded saying that he has ""no obligation to explain anything"", and that he is ""doing what I think is best for everyone"". That really shocked me, and I didn't really know what to think.

Something is clearly going up with him, but any attempts to talk with him have resulted in him pushing us away more. I'm concerned that he's going to possibly harm himself in the future, and confused why he's doing this. Can I do anything about this? I don't want him to get hurt and I want to help him get over his emotional hurdles, but every time I ask him how he is, he simply refuses.",26Sep2019,3

268,"Sorry this is so long, but there‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôve already missed out. If you have questions, I‚Äôd be happy to answer them.

So I tutor a homeschool student in English and Maths because her parents knew she would be needing extra help. She‚Äôs 14 and her English and Maths proficiency is far below the level it should be at this stage.

The homeschooling system, at least in Australia, is deeply flawed. From what I can tell, there is no real grading system and relies on the quantity of the work rather than the quality. Individual work isn‚Äôt really looked at, it‚Äôs just ticked off as being completed, and as long as you complete everything, you can continue being home schooled. You get moderated only once a year.

Anyway, so my student is writing an essay about a book. The final essay is simple and very short, but it follows the structure I gave her, which is a massive improvement from what she was doing when I first started tutoring her. I give a couple of minor corrections and call it done. 

That night I get an email from her saying that her dad had made her change some of her essay. I read the new essay and it‚Äôs totally clear where the father had rewritten bits of it. The language is totally different and way above her normal writing standard. I tell her as such and very gently try to discourage her from letting her parents interfere with her work. 

She responds asking me to pinpoint exactly where I thought her dad had rewritten the essay. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and I knew I should have stopped there and said we‚Äôll talk about it when we next meet. That way I was at least getting payed to go through her essay with her. Stupidly, I responded and gave three examples of where her father had clearly rewritten her work. Her father had also changed previous corrections I had made, and in places made her essay worse. I didn‚Äôt point this out though.

She emails back acknowledging two of the three changes I had pointed out were in fact her father, but initially claimed that the third was her. Later in the same email, though, she admitted that the third change I had pointed out was something she had copied from the book, without quoting it or referencing it (something we have spoken about before). 

I knew that I was probably causing more trouble than it was worth, so I just called it done and said we‚Äôll talk about it when we next meet up. 

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know whether to talk to her parents about plagiarism and to stop them from interfering in her work. If this were a perfect world, I would suggest that this girl be put into school immediately and be made to stay there. The lack of structure of homeschool, the lack of moderation or consequences if she does continue to plagiarise and get her parents to do her work will impact her academic future. 

I also lack the experience and expertise to help her if she continues to plagiarise. I was hired as a friendly face (we used to go to the same dance school) to help her complete her work. I can‚Äôt punish her for plagiarising or letting her parents do her work, because the homeschooling system doesn‚Äôt care and I have no power to. Nor would I want to. She‚Äôs improving week by week, which is gratifying, but I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs enough. 

I‚Äôm struggling as to what I should do. Should I talk to her parents about plagiarism and doing the work for her? Should I just let it slide and keep doing what I‚Äôm doing? Should I tell them she needs to be put back into school? Any advice would be great. Thanks!",26Sep2019,1

273,"So long story short, my current girlfriend has issues and horrible memories from past relationships, but specifically with one guy. About a month ago she finally explained to me why the thought of him made her uncomfortable. A long while back while they were dating, he would tend to sexualize everything and at the same time flirt with other girls, he generally didn‚Äôt love her and only seized sexual desires with her. She didn‚Äôt know if she loved him but he claimed he loved her, which led to other things. 

One day he brought her into in alley after school and insisted they had sex (prior to this he would always mention sex to her, which made her uncomfortable). She explained to me he pressured her into it and what happened was, he had taken out his dick and started to rub it against her clothes for a couple of minutes. She told me she made the excuse to ‚Äúgo pick her brother up from school‚Äù, to escape the situation as she ran home crying.

Months later after they broke up he went and told his friends that they ‚Äúfucked‚Äù, which wasn‚Äôt true yet he got everyone to believe him. Till today he still claims that they had sex. Because of this she developed suicidal tendencies and made her lose hope in many things. I love this girl and care so much about her, and we both lost our virginities to each other.

Nowadays she‚Äôs a lot better, but every time I see that guy pass by I remember everything and I‚Äôm sure she does as well. He just stands there with a smirk and laughs away talking to other girls and guys. It may not be right but lately I‚Äôve had to urge to fight this guy. I‚Äôve talked to my girlfriend and she claimed she wouldn‚Äôt mind if bothered to do something to him. I, myself, am not really a violent guy, but it‚Äôs that serious to me that I‚Äôm actually willing to beat the living shit out of this guy. I‚Äôm not sure where to go about this, as I feel I won‚Äôt be losing anything but self respect for myself, but at the same time it doesn‚Äôt feel disrespectful considering what he‚Äôs done. I‚Äôm sure there are other girls he‚Äôs dated that have dealt with something similar to what my girlfriend faced. In my head I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs right, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt be doing this for myself, as I would be doing it to make a statement and for the disrespect he‚Äôs spat on everyone else including my girlfriend.",26Sep2019,2

276,"My mother wasn't great. In fact, it could be argued that she screwed all us kids up pretty bad.

All of my siblings have dabbled in drugs of various kinds. Two were able to keep it from ruining their life, but one was not. He has an addiction problem. At different points in his life he's been addicted to gambling, alcohol, and meth. Right now he is at his lowest. He's homeless, jobless, using meth, and generally angry at the world. 

He keeps going to my mom begging for help and she keeps letting him back in. Not only is this straining her sanity, it is also interfering with her marriage to my step dad. But she ignores all that because she loves him. She let's him sleep in the garage and he is generally good to them. That lasts about 2 weeks and he'll snap about something and fight with them both, often bringing up the fact that he is messed up because of my mother and that she owes him. He gets kicked out and the cycle starts again.

My mom has cirrhosis from her alcoholism. She has quit drinking, but it still causes her many problems. One such problem is ammonia on the brain which causes a range of symptoms including suicidal ideation. This is often triggered by stress, which my brother causes with his freak outs.

This most recent freak out from him was about him not wanting to go on a job. It was construction and he said he wasn't prepared. She said that she would get him some clean clothes so he would go. He flipped out and said that he wasnt going and even if he did, he would just screw the job up just to spite her. Then, he nailed the garage door shut and left. 

She called me crying saying that she had a cup of poison and that she was going to kill herself. She said it was all her fault and that she wanted to be with her brother (who passed about a year and a half ago). She lives about three blocks away from me, so I headed over there. She told me that she didnt want to be in pain anymore. That she couldn't handle that her son hates her. Then she looked me in the eye, said goodbye, and downed a cup of liquid I didnt know what it was.

I called 911 and the ambulance took her away. She didnt drink enough of whatever it was to hurt her too bad. They are keeping her and trying to get her help.

283,"So as of this Sunday, my boyfriend and I will be homeless.

We are being evicted from our apartment as the lead tenants were illegally subletting and we were unaware. It didn't come out until they decided to leave and we tried to take over the lease. They took all of our deposit which was ‚Ç¨1650.

We have found an apartment but need ‚Ç¨2500 to live there, the landlord is giving us until the 8th to get it. Which is so nice of her considering she could get someone else moved in by then. I gave her ‚Ç¨500 yesterday but we're both screwed money wise since our old housemates stole our money.

My boyfriend was also let go from his job a few weeks ago and the government won't help him as he has no address and is means tested too high because of my job. I work and get paid weekly and I should be able to get about ‚Ç¨800 by the 8th but it's not enough.

We don't even have money for food so have been living off dry cereal. We have a few boxes that will do, thank god for aldi haha. 

We're both at a loss of what to do. We're going to live in our car for a while outside of my job I guess but I'm terrified, we don't even know what to do with all of our stuff as it's a tiny 2002 golf so it won't all fit and we have a fish tank with 2 fish. 

What's even more upsetting is my boyfriend's family. They are all quite wealthy, not that I expect a handout, just to sleep on their couch would be nice, but they refuse to help us.

They're old school and quite racist towards me so they don't believe in my boyfriend dating me and they basically cut him off. My dad has been trying to help but he's sick and has debts from his alcohol addiction, that he has since kicked, and I could never expect his help. 

I guess I feel extremely hopeless and exhausted right now, and I have no idea what to do.

Any advice? Even if it's advice of how to survive in the car when I have to work everyday?

285,"sorry in advance if this sounds like cringy, cliche high school drama.. it really is though.

Anyways, tonight my friend (we'll call Sarah) asked me if I was going to the school dance in October (sadie hawkins - girl asks the guy out). I've never been to a school dance, simply because I have no one to ask. I'm really shy and only hang out with my group of friends. I'm not completely anti-social, I still have 'friends' from cheer or from other classes, but I just don't really talk to any guys. I told her I wanted to, and we were talking about who our other friends were going with, then Sarah told me that Karen (fake name) wants to ask someone but she didn't tell her who. So I texted Karen, who I consider my closest friend, and asked her who she wanted to go with. She then told me to ""please don't kill me."" I immediately knew she was gonna say the guy I liked (who we'll call George). So of course she says it's George, and honestly i'm not surprised. When I started liking him back in sophomore year (currently a senior - yes i know.. lame) I just had a hunch that he liked her from small tells despite them not really talking to each other or being friends, there was just something I felt. Karen proceeded to tell me that they've been snapchatting and that George confessed his feelings towards her, but she didn't want to start dating him because a friend of hers liked him. So now she is saying that she won't ask him or date him, because she knows that I like him and that it would hurt our friendship. I told her that I'm totally okay with her going with him and that if you two like each other, then there's nothing I can do about it. I talked about the situation with a couple of my friends, including Sarah who suggested that I try to get closer to him and ask him, then if he says no, then Karen can ask. I feel like that just seems wrong and weird. I rarely talk to this guy and we just follow each other on like twitter on instagram. we have a class together, but that's it, so if I were to start randomly talking to him he would know I'm the friend that likes him, which would be embarrassing. There's a part of me that wants to ask him just because I've never told someone how I felt before, and he's really the only guy I've liked in high school (the guys here are just something else) and I think I'll regret never telling him how I feel. But I feel like that is kinda a snake move to do and a pretty stupid one considering he likes someone else. If I end up talking to him and asking him I feel like he'll just reject me and I'll feel even worse about the situation. There's also a part of me that just wants to ignore this whole thing and just let them date and try to suppress my feelings for him. I don't want a boy to come in between our friendship, but I mean it's already pretty weird between us now because of the whole thing. I'm hurt by the fact that Karen snapchatted him without telling any of my friends and she lead him on enough to where he confessed his feelings, and she even considered asking him to the dance despite knowing that I like him. I want to keep our friendship, but I honestly don't know what to do. Should I ask him and tell him how I feel? Should I just let them date since they already ""like"" each other and try to let George go? I've never dated before nor had anything remotely close, so I'm c l u e l e s s.",26Sep2019,1

292,"My wife(29F) and I (28M) got married last year. Since our marriage, we had not experienced any significant bedroom issues until last month.

My wife was an amateur tennis player and continues to play tennis in the monthly tournaments organized by our club. She seemed to be doing well in these tournaments until this 31 year old woman joined the club. My wife and this woman soon became best friends and started bonding over their love for tennis. This woman believes that the greatest positive trait of my wife is her physical appearance. She often calls my wife a ""ravishing beauty"". I admit that my wife is exceptionally beautiful but she has other appreciable traits too. Somehow, my wife's friend consistently fails to notice them. Yet, they continue to be good friends.

The duo frequently practiced together but were never drawn to play each other until three months ago. In July, they faced off against each other in the finals and my wife fought valiantly but lost in straight sets. Her admiration for her friend increased by leaps and bounds after this point. The next month, both of them faced each other in the semifinals and my wife suffered a humiliating 0-6,0-6 defeat. Despite her disappointment, she kissed her friend on both cheeks at the net and offered her a treat in a nearby restaurant when we were leaving the club.

That night, I asked her if we could have sex and my wife actually appeared a bit surprised. She mechanically spread her legs apart. Her behavior was so bizarre that I felt compelled to stop and ask her midway what the matter was. Apparently, she could not take her mind off the humiliating nature of the defeat.However, she wanted me to ""enjoy her beauty"" and have sex the way I wanted. That was downright inexplicable!

Since that night, she has behaved in a similar manner every time we have sex. She often calls herself a ""loser"" and a ""weak person"" and berates herself at other times too. In fact, this friend of hers calls her a ""losing beauty"". What a disgraceful nickname! I tried my best to provide her with emotional support. I tried to explain to her that tennis depends on strategy as well as strength and her defeats do not really make her ""weak"". Well, my wife challenged her friend to an arm wrestling match the next day and lost that contest as well. From that point, she gradually resigned herself to defeat and sex became one sided. To make matters worse, they have been drawn to play each other in the second round of this month's tournament. My luck is badly out and my life has changed for the worse.

TL;DR: My wife has been behaving strangely in bed after a few defeats in a tennis match. What is wrong with her and how can I solve the problem?",26Sep2019,1
294,"I‚Äôve been talking to this guy for about a month. We met on tinder.

He was flirty and kind of sexual. Then it got super sexual, and I ended up deleting him off snap. He messaged me on tinder and apologized.

I decided to add him back. I didn‚Äôt really pay much attention to him; I was talking to other people.

Then one evening he showed up at my work and waited for me to get off. I was having a really rough day and he wanted to make sure I was okay. He was so awkward, when he left we shared a hug and that was it.

The next day he messaged me saying he deleted tinder and unsubscribed to the boost. I told him I wasn‚Äôt ready to be exclusive, and he said he understood.

We‚Äôve had a few dates, talked every single day. We decided to hold off on sex until the fourth date. That‚Äôs when I told him I was only seeing him, yadda yadda.

The date after that, I gave him a BJ and he didn‚Äôt touch me or really do anything back. I thought he wasn‚Äôt interested because usually guys are all over me by that point.

I tried cutting things off and he like freaked out. He kept apologizing and telling me that he really did like me and he was just nervous. After thinking about our first kiss and first date, it was obvious that he was just inexperienced with girls so I was like ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm sorry for overanalyzing‚Äù.

I asked if anything was wrong or if I upset him and he said everything was fine. I feel like he‚Äôs losing interest but doesn‚Äôt want to say it.

Am I being crazy? Maybe he‚Äôs just busy. He has work and school and works out. It‚Äôs also getting deeper into the semester and he‚Äôs having trouble in his classes. So maybe he‚Äôs focusing his time on studying. But the sudden change in communication has me second guessing everything.

I like him a lot. He‚Äôs put in so much effort into seeing me and I haven‚Äôt had that in a long time. He‚Äôs so cute and I feel so comfortable yet nervous around him. We ramble about nothing and it‚Äôs so refreshing to have a conversation with someone without it leading to what‚Äôs in my pants.

Please tell me I‚Äôm just being crazy. Tell me that people get busy and he‚Äôs no exception. Remind me that no one can keep up with texting 24/7 because they have lives.

299,"Hi,

Not really sure how to approach this in the most professional way because I haven't had to deal with this before. I work in a hospital on the evening shift. Basically what happened was it involved 2 day shift techs. Tech 1 was in the department for a few seconds, which I had assumed came back to retrieve something or was on her way out she was also scheduled that day and was still on the schedule and was never updated. Something was left over from the day, and I simply asked her on her way out if they wanted it made or wait until the morning since they might not need it. Anyway she basically just says I have no idea I wasn't here today. Me: ""Oh alright, have a good evening!"". I'm at work so don't check my phone right away but during my dinner break I received a text message from Tech 2 whom also does our scheduling ""I'm not sure what you think I do all day, the only reason tech 1 was in the hospital is because her mom is VERY sick there was not reason to ask her about anything"". 

This literally made my heart drop and almost made me tear up at work during shift. I don't tend to show my emotions, but this was one time I did tear up a bit. This was taken COMPLETELY out of context and I had absolutely no way of knowing what was going on in tech 1's personal life. When she had left she didn't show any problems either. I basically texted Tech 2, ""I'm sorry if it sounded like you left it on purpose, I just wanted to know if it was something that wanted to be done or waited until the morning, also I had no idea her mom was ill"" then I also text tech 1 to apologies and give her family my best wishes. I also mentioned if I said something that was offending please talk to me first 1 on 1 instead of involving other people as well. Tech 1 did not sound like she had an issue about it, she said she had texted Tech 2 to ask about said task and also said ""I can't speak for her, I simply asked her why it was left and she explained perfectly why and I moved on"" 

Anyway I know that was long, but how do I approach this? Tech 2 never replied back to my apology and what bothers me the most about this entire situation is how out of context it was taken, getting involved in something not involving her (it was between me and tech 1), and just being completely rude about that situation and I never even got an apology for that. Is this something I should talk to my department manager about so they know about the situation before there's any retaliation? How do I approach my manager about this issue or what do I say to them? Is this something I just keep to myself? The other problem with this is Tech 2 and the entire day shift tech staff has a big tendency to gossip. This is something she will take out of context quickly turning them against me. Even though this was a literal hey do you know anything about this task, and me not knowing what's going on in anyones personal life.

301,"My partner and i just moved into a new place, we really lucked out on the price as its 500 dollars under what you normally pay per month for rent in the city we live in.  The house has three floors, each floor has its own personal entrance and its own tenants.

We are on the bottom floor, our entryway is in the back and there is a shared coin laundry in the entryway, then our door right across from it. The middle floor neighbors, super great couple with a baby and then there is the top terrible neighbors.

Story: When we first moved we met our middle neighbours (lets call them awesome couple AW). AW told us the first time we met them that we might have trouble with our upper floor neighbours as they have been very loud and annoying. At first we didn't want to get involved as we thought that we should form our own opinion, and then we met them...

Our first meeting they seemed nice, talked to us where the cool grocery stores were and if we wanted to buy their couch (800 bucks,no thanks) they had a cute dog and things seemed pretty chill. Until we realized what AW meant, they would have such loud fights that we could hear them from the bottom floor screaming and yelling, slamming doors and yelling at each other on the street. This happens at least once a week, then their laundry. Because we have a shared laundry room thats right in front of our door, they pile up their dirty laundry in front of our door like its their bathroom, then the door we leave from they piled up laundry there, so every morning when you exit the place there is always the same piled up dirty laundry greeting you at your front door.

Not only that they have so much garbage that they take over everyones garbage bin, the first time we got our bin they filled it before we could get even a bag in. They put their garbage out into the back alleyway without a bin and it was torn into, leaving garbage everywhere and not taking responsibility to clean it up.

I got tired of dealing with it so i messaged our landlord to talk to them about it as i didn't want to get involved with them as i already knew AW has been trying to talk to them and they haven't listened at all. The landlord gave them a warning to clean up and move their laundry, so in retaliation they decided to pile up even more laundry outside both doors and do laundry at 1130 tonight.

I messaged my landlord who is coming over tomorrow to deal with everything and take photos, however i'm unsure of what to do if things are not going to change. This has all happened in under a span of a month.

TLDR; Neighbours use our front door as their personal dumping ground, extremely loud, leave garbage everywhere.",26Sep2019,1

305,"I take care of my younger brother who just turned 18. I handle all the bills and anything he needs help with. Recently he asked me for quite a bit of money and because he doesn't ask for much, I gave it to him without much thought. 5 days ago though he dissapeared while leaving a note saying he was sorry for being a burden and that he's sorry that he couldn't succeed like I wanted him to. I panicked and i tried many ways to contact him through friends and otherwise with no luck and ended up going to the local police department who are still looking for him. I dont know where he could have gone and im getting more worried by the day. One thing that seems strange is that a month ago the cell phone bill was 80 dollars higher than usual so wondering why it was so high, I called verizon who is my provider and they told me that the number that my brother uses called  811-17002952  which is a Japanese phone number for 30 minutes and that's why we were charged because it was an international call. I talked to my brother about it but he did confirm that he made the call but he won't tell me why for whatever reason. I'm getting worried and dont know what to do.",26Sep2019,1

309,"I have been lost and confused about my future for some years now. My school experience has not been promising since I was kicked from a couple schools and didn't pass a couple years due to my lack of effort/willingness to study. I have also failed the boat license test 5 times in a row. All this made me stay away from University since I concluded that it would be a waste of money for my family. This said my family doesn't have any sort of issue with money since my dad is a lawyer. My mother tells me that I will regret not studying and I can understand why. My dad is disappointed that none of his sons are pursuing a study in law. I have no ""talent"" on which to rely on and my hobbies are useless, I like gaming and that's basically it. Right now I found an ""internship"" in a small IT place and they are telling me I need some sort of extra education in order to continue working for them. I have no dream and I have no concrete goals. I just wish I could be autosufficient and happy, and surely uni doesn't match that ideal as I am pretty certain I would not pass many (if any) exams there due to my lack of experience studying.

312,"I'm  sure every teen here has some idea of what this is about, and I need  some specific advice about an ongoing issue I have. This is sort of fits  into the categories of advice and rant, but I could only choose one, so  asking for advice is most relevant.

The  father is the most ballistic, toxic person I have ever known. He is  always demeaning, and goes absolutely ball-sacks when a little thing is  or isn't done. Specifically, if someone spilled a glass of water on the  floor or on the table, he'd immediately go over your shoulder like a  f\*cking dead goose and scream at you to clean it up and immediately  point at every single drop of water that's not in the glass. Do you  expect me to just leave it there, like, all the years of you screaming  at me were for nothing? Do you think I'm blind? In text, this might not  seem like something serious, but you guys haven't seen this scenario in  person, so do give a little leeway if you don't understand.

An  hour ago, he found three pages of a book that is like 2000 pages  (shared by the family) that were creased, and just stormed in my room  and called my sibling in, disrupting my assignment work and his  instrument practice, with no regards whatsoever to what we were doing.  (Don't you hate it when people are so wrapped up in themselves and can't  see outside their own ass? This is a mental stage your brain should  have developed out of when you were 6 or 7 (go see egocentrism in  psychology), for f\*ck's sake! **Parents don't see that we have schedules to keep!**)

He  asked us in a rude and demanding way if any of us creased the pages. I  didn't do it, and my sibling claimed no, so the father said in a very  impolite way, ""Well, did it appear by magic?""

My  sibling and I are too old to be spoken to this way, and I was very  offended. I curtly (low-key curtly) insisted I didn't know and that it  wasn't me, and didn't talk again, so he just went out and slammed the  book (it's heavy) on the table and closed it roughly. Okay, so you go  bat-shit when three pages are creased and then proceed to throw it on  the table and slam it shut?

When  the blinds aren't properly closed, he'd tell us rudely to fix it, saying  things like, ""Didn't you notice that? Can't you see?"" Try saying this  in your meanest tone, and you've got the idea of how he is.

That  is just the surface of his toxic behaviour, and honestly, I am getting  sick of it. I am not old enough to support myself and live on my own,  and there is no extended family I can go to in my country, so do not  suggest moving. Please do not ask my age, but also please do not assume I  am too old or too young to be a good member here.

What  should I do to cope with this sort behaviour?  I absolutely cannot  confront him about it, as it won't lead anywhere (it never has, he is  just the same as ever), and I absolutely cannot ask my mother about my  concerns (don't tell me to, don't ask why) because she alone is not  capable of changing his attitude. **I  am not asking how his behaviour can be changed, but how I can get  through it from day to day. I also would love advice from people with  similar experiences and of all ages.** If you need any more info in order to give advice, please ask.",26Sep2019,1
313,"Hey so this question might come off as long-winded and im sorry if it does. I will be as concise as possible. So over the course of about 4 years I have helped break up relationships of a number of couples, probably 4ish if i remember correctly. One being in real life and the other 3 being online as I play video games a lot.
I do not do this to be with them however since in each instance, the boyfriend has either been abusive (mainly emotionally) or they just aren't working out. Also I do not really do long-distance relationships. Normally I would be fine with this yet I sometimes feel like another reason they do it is because they get get pie in the sky expectations for their BF because of me. Ill explain.

Not to sound egotistical, but apparently I am pretty hot. As a video gaming introvert all my life, I never thought it to be true and don't really see it but that's just what girls tell me. They also become attracted to my personality, which I will admit is top notch (with maybe a little ego). So as we start talking more they start telling me how their BF is emotionally abusive, yells, never gives them alone time, is manipulative, etc and how i'm so ""perfect"".

My problem is while they have merits for breaking up or at the very least have some kind of intervention, I feel like I am in a way responsible for them breaking up because of the way they see me as some kind of holy grail in their mind while they are in a flawed relationship. I know no relationships is perfect and I always try to give advice on talking with their boyfriend to fix the issues, but with how they talk about me I feel somewhat responsible. The last time this happened they said ""they never understood how bad things were until they started talking to someone about it"". Id like to think I just so happen to be at the tipping point in these relationships but the way they sometimes blatantly comment on my looks or personality makes me think I have some part in it.

Do you all think I am doing the right thing by helping or am I just so alluring they cant help it? (joking) I sincerely enjoy making friends and helping people talk through their problems even if its just there to listen, both male and female. I feel like I am really good at understanding peoples feelings and making them feel that I genuinely care and understand them. If there wasn't an overload of psychologists majors in college that's what I would want to do, I enjoy it that much. I appreciate any advice anyone can give me and thank you!",26Sep2019,0
314,"I wanted to go out to the park because of many reasons but to sum it up in three points:

\- My step-mother's parents and grandparents have moved into the house for three months and they love putting the heater on blast, making the room where I study in very obnoxious. I wanted some fresh air and ""liberation"" from that.

\- I was bored to hell and decided I could at least get some Vitamin D during the school holiday.

\- I just felt like getting my ass up and walking.

So my sister who is 12 years old decides she wants to tag along with me to the park. My Dad is in denial of our request to go there since he is about to pick up my younger brother from kindergarten and won't be able to look after us should something happen. My sister and I are hanging out in the backyard, where she proclaimed she would be sneaking out to the park as my Dad had already left. I said ""Sure"" and locked the door. She walked up to the transparent door with a smug face and just slowly started walking around the backyard to the front side of the house. I unlocked the door and told her to come back multiple times, this is still when she is only around 3 meters away from me so she obviously heard my calls. She started running to the front and I chased her and I found her at the front entrance of the house, filling in the security code to get in. It turns out my Dad hadn't left yet, and was literally reversing out. When he realized we were both outside, my sister for whatever reason screamed loudly. My sister ran back around to the backyard and returned inside the house and I did the same. My Dad opened the front door and demanded to consult with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I explained everything that had happened, which was nothing really significant. What had happened was merely a childish moment to be forgotten in the future. My Dad asks why my sister didn't just return back in the house when I unlocked the door, and she started crying profusely about how whenever she would return I would just lock the door again, WHICH HAD NEVER EVEN HAPPENED. She tried to explain how she did try going back and then after trying, gave up and that's why she tried to go around to the front entrance.

I tried to explain my side of the story once more when she called me a liar. I in turn, called her a liar instead and she started crying even more. My Dad, thank god, believed my side more because he knows who I am and my younger sister has a long, dark history of telling lies and even contradicting them. Then my sister starts saying stuff like:

""Why do you trust lolman1312 more than me!? That's so unfair, I'm your child too, aren't I? You don't care about my opinion at all and you have no trust in your own daughter!"".

My Dad decides that he's wasted enough time and leaves. I call my sister a liar once more when she screams at me to shut up. I concur that it is hard for a father to rationalise what is going on when his daughter yells those lines at him, and now he's beginning to think she's the victim.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I wasted your time reading this and this story doesn't require your attention as much as most other posts on this subreddit do. This is just an example of my sister crying in support to her lies to act more believable and manipulating the relationship between the family members. So what's your advice? How do I prove myself innocent? Not only that, how do I point out her lies?",26Sep2019,2

I joined an open discussion before, everyone barely talked, because we were forced to join this, but the moment I talked, the mood became different, everybody  raised their hands to share their minds. I wish to have this kind of mood setter voice in my daily life. 

I tried to use my real voice daily life, but it just return to the softer one subconsciously.

Some info: My father is a narcissist, isn‚Äôt physically abusive, but is verbally. He is a control freak as well. He is very immature as well. I am 19 years old. My mother who has put up with him for 25+ years has finally left the house to get a divorce. She has dealt with the same thing I have. Won‚Äôt let you talk, tells you to shut up, yells, calls names. He has a ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù mentality. He is beyond toxic, and I wake up everyday with this feeling that this toxic entity is in my life. My mother is currently looking for a place to live, she is living with her sister for now. My mother, my gf (19) and I (19) have agreed to split the bills 1/3 each. I have a little brother, and sister that will go back and forth between my parents. 

I am planning on getting out of his house the first day I can. To remove a toxic person from my life. 

He HAS to control everything, so I feel when he does step into the new place my mom and I live to pick up the kids or come for a birthday party, etc.  he will still be controlling, put people down, have his ego cranked to the max and try to be the alpha male. 

Although the place will be in my mother‚Äôs name, I still feel like I have the right to dismiss him from the place I stay and pay rent when he crosses the line. My mother feels my emotional pain as she has dealt with it longer than I have. As soon as I get out of this house I‚Äôm in now, he is not walking over me, he is not putting me down, etc. My mother will not put up with it either, she just held on during their marriage because she had kids and no where else to go. Times have changed though. 

Let‚Äôs say he crosses the line what is the way to go about it? 

Let‚Äôs say he crosses the line and he doesn‚Äôt listen to my mother telling him to leave, what do I do?",26Sep2019,1
318,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible...

We were together for 12 years, we have a 7 year old child. My ex left last year, we made an arrangement to split custody evenly, over a two-week period we each have 7 days with our child.

I've been managing to run the family home and look after my child &amp; I. I never persued any benefits (right or wrong) because I work &amp; was managing ok. Also I just don't tend to persue state benefits if I can help it because I'd rather cope on my own.

The last few months money has got really tight and I've had to apply for universal credit. My claim came through I'm entitled to ¬£0.00 because my ex made a claim when she left, putting herself down as main carer of our child. 
I do understand that re' univ' cred' one party has to be the main carer for admin' purposes. However we do share custody and of all the child benefits she's claimed over the past year, I've recieved none of it toward the cost of childraising.

I brought the subject up with her &amp; the only answer was:

It's been weird sitting in silence about it for the past year and a half, but it kinda feels like the right time to put it some where and see how it sits. I'm not sure what i'm looking for but i guess its a combination of clarity and legal advice.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, so lets begin.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex, lets call her purple, one day out of the blue called me and told me she was pregnant and was certain it was mine. I was shocked and had no idea what to say, ultimately i decided the decision was hers to make. If she wanted to keep it i would support her but my opinion was that it was a bad idea given that we wanted nothing to do with each other and that wasn't a healthy environment to raise someone in. She eventually came to the decision that abortion was the correct thing to do. Her mother vehemently disapproved of it and refused to be by her side while she went to the abortion clinic. It was a tough call to make and a really lonely trip for her to make. I was overseas when it was all going down and it was hard to hear that she had to go it alone. From memory a week past and out of the blue she messaged me again. She was irate and upset that i had messaged her being insensitive and abusive. I was really confused and had no idea what she was talking about. I checked my messenger and couldn't figure out what it was she was referring to. I took a screen shot of the last time we had a conversation and sent it to her, but she didn't believe me and told me i was a liar. She sent me a screen shot of her conversation and there was a long and very personal message from me. It was detailed, abusive, incredibly personal and contained a bunch of stuff that were some of her darkest secrets. It was a shocking message but i never sent it. Eventually she came around and agreed that it wasn't from me. But we were perplexed.

Soon after, we found out it was my ex prior to this one, lets call her black. Years and years prior we all worked together and black was incredibly jealous of purple. She happened to stumble across purples email account opened in the office and kept all her details to access all her accounts. Over time black had also found her way in to purples facebook, instagram, messenger and somehow her phone messages and camped in there for the duration of my relationship with purple. She had waited this whole time, for the right time to stir the pot. And now she was ruthlessly doing it. She was messaging purple every day, abusing her, telling her to kill herself, telling her that she deserved to be raped when she was younger, that she deserved to die and it would better for everyone. Black also messaged me and berated me with abuse, accusing me of cheating on her all those years back then and that i deserved for my life to be ruined.

Black threatened to release all off purples diary entries that she had stored online if she spoke to anyone about it. Purple felt abandoned and helpless, so purple ate a handful of pills one day and decided that dying was an easier option. I received a phone call from purple, half way across the world, and listened to purple slowly fading away over the phone, informing me what she had just done. I frantically got in contact with her mother and made an educated guess as to where she was. They called the ambulance and managed to get to her on time. She was taken to a hospital and shortly after to a facility. I received a call back on the same day, an hour later, it was a psychologist that also worked as a paramedic who had arrived on the scene. She requested to talk to me and understand what had happened. She then wanted to investigate it further, to see what my part was in her suicide. This psychiatrist informed me a short time later that purple had never gone to the abortion clinic and that the pills had taken care of the abortion.

Over the next few months i spent two hours a day and sometimes more on the phone to the psychiatrist working with them to help understand what was going on and how we could help Purple. The psychiatrist constantly used me as a point of reference for any outbursts that purple had and the conversations were always long and at times very probing. Purple had repeatedly attempted to commit suicide while being detained in a psychiatric facility and had no intentions of seeing out her life. At the same time, Black was still reeking havoc. She still sent abusive messages, encouraged her to kill herself and some times made phone calls and would stay on the line and say nothing . Black some how managed to keep tabs on all communication and was using it to plan her moves. It turned out the Psychiatrist had found a long line of messages almost on the daily from the past two years of Black trying to befriend purple but then becoming unsatisfied when she couldn't manipulate her into believing lies about me, so she started abusing her every day. Sending threatening and highly personal and abusive messages. This went on unknowingly during our relationship up until this point.

Purple eventually showed improvement and demanded to be released, but it was a tentative release. The psychiatrist went out of her way to stay in touch with her regularly because she was concerned and skeptical, we all were. The psychiatrist kept in touch with me often, she made me feel that i was also responsible for what happened and i equally felt that it was a part of my responsibility, wether it was out of duty of care or because it was simply the right thing to do. It was unprofessional and unethical but she knew and i knew it was necessary. Black had gone silent and we assumed she was satisfied with the amount of damage that had caused. Purple was unstable and her brother was concerned that she didn't really care for living. She would often go missing and not tell anyone where she was and eventually from memory, it became evident she was seeing someone again. This character is well known and had made tv appearances in the U.S. It quickly went south, it triggered her trauma and soon after she was doing heroin to escape the harrowing nightmares. She went back to being in a facility and we were back to where we started.

Things get blurry around this time, this is two or three months in and a lot more things that i just cant fit in to this happened. But in continues on.

Eventually they let purple move back to the city we both met, a bigger city, a hedonistic city. She is released and convinces everyone that she wants to move back to our city. Purple doesn't want anyone to know what happened and everyone is concerned that she will relapse in to heroin. But we cant stop her. A month later she's missing, nobody knows where she is, turns out she hasn't had a fixed location in a long time and no one has seen her. Her work place is concerned, she has stopped seeing her therapist, she is sending strange messages that dont make sense and nobody knows where she is. Psychiatrist requests that i go back, they cant find anyone reliable enough to take her onboard and they don't want to expose her to any more people that she knows out of fear that she will react badly.

I agree. Reluctantly. She resents me at this stage but knows she needs help. Psychiatrist promises me that she will help via the phone, she will have a therapist in our city and that i will always have support.

I fly back and decide to house her in my mothers house. HUGE risk. I also decide to tell my mother that she's just sick and needs a place to stay while she recovers. I tell her nothing about the heavy drug use, suicide or any of the back story with black. But we set a clear cut plan on how we are going to help Purple and i am head strong in sticking to it. I also set myself a time limit of 4.5 months for reasons i will go in to later, but also because i don't want to be a dependent of Purples. She must learn to walk on her own again and i had already invested 3 months, every day, in to this.

Now.. Obviously there are specific details i have left out of this, but i've also left out some of the most unbelievable bits that happened, just because i dont know how to include it without blowing this in to an even longer story, but also because i just dont know how to talk about it. But anyway...

During the time at my mothers house, she goes missing numerous times, relapses on to heroin, i often have to go in and pull knives out from underneath her pillow, look through her things to find stashes of medication that she had been accumulating to overdose on and am constantly being called back from work to go attend to her having a severe episode. She also claims that in her room at night there's a dark creature that talks to her and antagonizes her. Her psychiatrist often calls me and relays to me what is happening, she says that she's not sleeping and that this character is terrorizing her at night in her room. Several times purple shows me bruising around her legs, hand marks across her arms and large marks across her sternum. All in the mean time, black has resurfaced and from time to time proving that she's still evidently in, not only purples accounts but now mine.

In this time period, i had been seeing someone, before this all erupted. I had made a conscious choice to not relay this information to any of these people. Because i was already so involved and i did not want her to become involved. So i would find time in every day to call back overseas and keep her updated. Secret phone calls every day - anywhere between an hour to 3 hours a day on top of phone calls to the psychiatrist, juggling jobs and keeping an eye on purple. But we had a plan, and we were sticking to it, it was a progressive plan but it was working.

3 months in Purple is starting to get better, she's consistently going to therapy, stopped using hard drugs, suicide attempts had ceased and her general outlook went from negative, to unstable to hopeful. I informed everyone that i was committing to leaving on the back of the improvement and told the psychiatrist the part of the reason where i was seeing someone. She was agitated by the idea and almost became adversarial to the idea, but my mind didn't change.

Towards the end, the psychiatrist became skeptical and disapproving of the choices i was making. She didn't believe i was committed enough and was doing a healthy enough job to succeed. On my birthday, purple had a momentary relapse and had an episode while she gifted me my present. She took them back and refused to give them to me, later on i found out she smashed them. The psychiatrist also called me up and proceeded to tell me that i was doing a terrible job and that i wasn't doing good enough. We got in to a big argument and that became the last time i spoke to her.

The day i flew out, my mother drove me to the airport and while we were driving she decided to air her feelings and she felt like she was confused as to what had happening and why i was suddenly leaving again. She was frustrated that i looked unwell and wasn't telling her what was going on. She said i had lost weight and looked tired, she got in to a rage and started presuming i was doing drugs, dealing drugs and trying to escape financial debt. I ended up getting out of the car with my things and proceeded to walk to the airport from the freeway entry. It was a hard pill to swallow having my mother also become frustrated with me. I felt like i been used, chewed up and spat out and was still being scrutinized for not doing enough.

That was the last day i was in my city.",26Sep2019,1
324,"I‚Äôm a sophomore in college and literally don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with my life. I‚Äôm sure all of us goes through this phase at one point but I feel totally miserable right now. The president at a club I‚Äôm in has no respect for me and doesn‚Äôt like me due to a conflict I had with his roommate in the past. To make it worse I‚Äôm a secretary for that club and I totally don‚Äôt want to do it anymore. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him about it but he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me. So I‚Äôm still going to try my best but you know how that makes you lose your motivation? 

And regarding his roommate, he dragged me into a lot of drama that I wasn‚Äôt related to this summer and made it one of my worst times. He‚Äôs spread a lot of rumors about me already in my community and I‚Äôm just afraid to see people now. Even if rumors are rumors, I know people always believe them to a certain extent. 

My roommate this year used to be my best friend from high school but after becoming roommates, it just became harder since we are not the most compatible. I feel left out when she‚Äôs with her other friends and sometimes even uncomfortable around her now. 

Most of these are social issues but I feel like I‚Äôm constantly nervous. I thought about transferring but the school I go is the only one in my state that has the major I‚Äôm studying.  Will these kinds of things teach me to be a better person in the long wrong (even if I feel terrible right now)? Or would it be better to find a new environment and just have a new start? Sorry for being dramatic lol but these things are making me question if I can even handle college.",26Sep2019,2
325,"Hi everyone,

I am a 21 years old male (22 in a few days) and am completely lost. I graduated high school, but my marks weren't great.. Granted, I didn't really try and regrettably, spent a lot of my time smoking weed, cigarettes and skipping class with my friends.

I did stop smoking weed in my final year of high school and tried to study, but I could never do it. I'm not sure if it was laziness, lack of motivation, lack of caring or simply that I was not up to the job. My parents were always furious at me whenever I would say that I was stupid, and said that that was basically a cop out. I don't think I'm stupid at all, but I've never been able to prove it with academic results, so I question myself.

After I graduated high school I travelled for 9 months overseas with money I had saved up working throughout high school, and also worked for a few months in the U.K., which was a really fun time. I came back to Australia and attended university for 1 semester. I enrolled in a bachelor of arts with psychology and pretty much gave up after about half the semester and stopped attending/handing in assignments. I actually got one ""distinction"" mark for something I handed in but still, I stopped giving a fuck about it and just kept smoking weed, hanging out with friends, drinking, and being lazy.

After that I worked in a cafe for a while, then did some construction labouring. I was 19 by this point and had been out of highschool for a year and a half. My parents said I needed to do something, so I settled on a trade that seemed semi-interesting to me - electrician. I did this for almost 2 years but didn't love it. I was behind on all of my trade school as I didn't study and couldn't keep up with the maths it required. I also hated working full-time from 6am - 3.30pm because none of my friends did, (they were all at university working park-time or not at all) and felt I was missing out on a social life because I was too tired to do anything after work and was in bed by 8.30pm to wake up for 5am.

So at 21, I dropped out as a second year electrical apprentice and did gardening for a while. I didn't hate it, but it isn't what I want as a career. It is something I would pursue if I had my own house and garden, though. I quit that after about 3 months. I then started a sales job at a phone shop in a shopping centre, which was based off commission, and quit after 3 weeks. I didn't think it was ethical, and hated having to sell old people phones and plans they didn't need, and not being able to offer people genuine advice/help that they deserved.

I have now just secured a job at a pub, where I think I will have fun at, as I'll be working with people my age and girls! Finally! After years of working in male dominated industries with people much older than me. Anyway, I recently won about $5,000 on a poker machine a few months ago (lol) and decided to go to Europe (I have a European passport as well as an Australian passport, luckily), to travel and then maybe study at university in Ireland. So I have a one way ticket booked and am leaving the country in just over 2 months. I have all my plane tickets, a lot of accomodation and insurance booked as well as enough winter clothes to not have to buy anything while over there. I have around $10,000 in savings to survive.

I will also quickly mention that since I was about 19, I have been smoking weed HEAVILY every day and then started to use drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine as well as benzos on the weekends with friends when going out. I suffered horrible depression and was felt suicidal towards the end of it all. I realised I was ruining my mental health and life and have been sober for almost 5 months now (minus social drinking). I want to stay clean, and feel my new found sobriety has really helped me realise I need to sort my mess of a life out now as well as find a purpose.

I have also been struggling with lying in bed all day on my computer/phone, in my dark room. I am either out with friends in public, socialising, at the gym or lying in bed in my messy room. I tell myself it's because I need to move out of home and don't want to be around my family and have nothing to do in my house, but I wonder if there is an underlying reason...

I don't know what to do! I don't know what I want to do with my life! Where I want to be! Who I want to be! When I was younger (8 - 15) I was obsessed with computers, technology, software, hacking and the internet. I used to love video editing and spent hundreds of hours editing videos and making videos for my YouTube. I was apart of so many ""hacking forums"" and was super interested in computer viruses, spreading them, hacks for games, etc. I was also making money online from the age of 12 (not really in an ethical way) through hacking game accounts and selling them, dodgy affiliate links, e-whoring, buying things cheap and re-selling them for a profit, etc. Despite a lot of it being semi-blackhat/greyhat, I am semi-proud of what I did back then at that age, because I was so talented, committed and passionate.

Because of this I am leaning towards studying information technology, but I don't know where to start or if I even still have a passion for it. I also was considering computer science, but I feel my poor math skills will be an issue.

Despite not exactly practicing what I preach, I am also really interested in nutrition, food, cooking, mental health, and fitness.

This is really long, and not really very well written. I hope someone reads this and is able to read between the lines and make some sense of what I am even asking. I just need some advice. I feel so scared for my future and wish I had some purpose in my life. I feel so pathetic and pointless...

Thank you for reading.",26Sep2019,3

I‚Äôve been planning to move out for well over a year now, and it‚Äôs been what I‚Äôve been working towards since I (19f) graduated high school. The thing is my parents have no idea I have been planning this. The reason I‚Äôve kept it so secret is because my parents are fairly controlling and somewhat traditional, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that if I told them earlier they‚Äôd do everything in their power to stop me. In the past they threatened to move me out of state if they found out I had a boyfriend (I didn‚Äôt at the time) so I felt it was best to hide what I was up to.

329,"So this is going to be a long one. I (20M) am currently attending college in California and this year I‚Äôve noticed something different about one of my roommates. I was his roommate last year and he was one of the happiest people on campus- he just had a happy and kind persona about him, which made it great to hang out with him and our friend group. 

I think it started last semester with about a month and a half left to go. He had befriended a girl and they got pretty close. She was over at our apartment a lot and then suddenly she stopped coming over. And I noticed he was pretty depressed. Our other two roommates were also concerned and we talked to him about what was going on. He had basically said she had more or less ended the friendship, for some frivolous, unimportant reason. So he was pretty upset about that, as I would imagine anyone would be. Around the same time, one of the women in our friend group was dumped by her boyfriend of two years. These two started hanging out more, which I think was great because they were good for each other in that healing process. 

So over the summer I kept in touch with them and I think about a month in they started dating. They called me and asked me about it, seeing if I thought it would be a good idea. I was hesitant, but more or less told them to go for it if they felt they were truly healed and ready to move on from their previous pain. 

Summer goes by and huzzah we‚Äôre back. My roommate in question stayed with me in the same apartment, except we have two other people instead of those previous. (Which is relatively unimportant but I would say he doesn‚Äôt trust them on the same level as he did the two before). Anyway, he‚Äôs completely changed. He isn‚Äôt nearly as happy anymore, and he‚Äôs seldom around. He spends nearly every free moment he has with his new girlfriend and then comes back at 3 AM each night clearly upset. Aside from that his demeanor has changed as well. For example, he snapped at one of the girls in our friend group because she dared to say hi to his girlfriend while they were having dinner. Things like that he never did before. 

So now, I‚Äôm left wondering how on earth I can help the situation. I‚Äôve talked to my two closest friends about it, trying to see if they have any insight. They both recommend I track down our old roommates and try to have a discussion about it. Just to talk to him because we care about him and don‚Äôt want to see him in a constant state of anger and depression. I really want to help the situation but don‚Äôt know how.",26Sep2019,1

333,"My boyfriend and I have been dating a little over a year. Our relationship is long distance and we've been switching  who visits who each month for a good amount of time each visit. We've been talking about moving in, and I would love to move where he lives, but I'm currently taking care of my mother, who isn't incapable of taking care of herself, but is super dependant and starting to show possible signs of early dementia and developing other health issues and old issues getting worse (in which we found out she has brittle bones and a lineage of hypertension, diabetes, and strokes). 

My father is a full-time worker a few towns over and is only home for about 2 days a week, so he would be incapable of taking care of her unless he brought her along with him (which is allowed, but they tend to argue often over small things when left alone together for too long and my mother is a very sensitive woman and I would rather not have her go through such week long) and I can't trust her siblings to look after her (as they have their own health issues, can't take care of themself, have asshole children they live with, and/or treat her like a housemaid since she's the youngest). 

I've talked to her about moving, and she gives me such a sad expression and makes it seem like me leaving her was some sort of betrayal, sometimes claiming she wouldn't know what to do without me, and I would love to stay with her, but I've grown more attached to his family than my own (extended family, not my parents. My parents are so unbelievably important to me) and it genuinely feels much more positive than it is here.

So, I even decided to ask my parents if they would want to move to the same area if I had decided to move to that area, even saying I would help cover some costs since it was my idea, but my parents both dislike the idea as the area I plan to move to has natural disasters surrounding it fairly often, but rarely ever actually hits the area.

I am not sure if it is right to post here, and if not I will definitely remove it. I figured someone here may have experience in my aforementioned problem.

In August 2018, I was in a car accident in Los Angeles, CA. The collision occurred at an intersection where traffic going east and west had two way stop signs (coming from a residential street), and traffic going north and south was able to proceed (there were no yield, stop signs, or traffic lights after proceeding through a light at a prior main street/intersection). I was traveling northbound and hit the other party (who essentially ran the stop sign) coming from the east direction. The other party was attempting to make a left turn in front of me and pulled out at the last minute. My insurance company did not find me at fault at all. However, the other party's insurance, James River (Uber Insurance), is finding me 40% at fault. 

Now it is time to settle and my attorney contacted me this past Tuesday to tell me about the settlement costs. According to my release of all claims statement, the total settlement is $9,500. However, my attorney said I will only be getting about $3,167 and some change. I am questioning if that settlement amount is right? When I first signed papers for the firm to represent me, the papers said the firm would only take 33% of any settlement I would received. However, it seems I am getting the 33%, while the firm takes the rest of my fees? I am not sure if I should sign the papers and I do not know what to do currently.

I really do not trust the law firm because every time I initiate contact, I have to figuratively jump through hoops just to talk. I also feel I could have been represented better because I had to threaten a restraining order in court because the other party kept harassing me. A family friend got the law firm for me as I was just entering graduate school when the accident happened. I am going to follow up with my attorney before I sign the agreement. However, before I do, I wanted to get a second opinion of how the settlement monies are being disbursed to myself and the law firm. If I am being short changed, what should I do? Do I not sign the papers? Ultimately, I am tired because I am in my last year of graduate school and I would much prefer for this to all be over.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I apologize for being so vague; I am trying to give as little information as possible since this case is not settled yet. I am seeking advice regarding if the settlement is being disbursed correctly between my representing law firm and myself. If it is not, what should I do?",26Sep2019,1

I (19m) was having a conversation with my boyfriend (22m) about something dumb like cum related jokes, and he mentioned, ""oh my first gay experience I accidentally hit myself in the face with my cum""
And like I laughed at first. 
But then I felt nauseous, and angry, and gross.
I know part is jealousy. Well I know it is.
But also I get super upset when I think about his ex, or if the topic gets brought up, because his ex was also abusive towards him, and I get angry because that person hurt him so much physically and emotionally and doesn't deserve to of ever touched him!


I get generally jealous over people in his past. I wish I had grown up with him. I wish we went to the same school. I wish we would of hung out after school and fell in love like that, like he probably did with these other people. I wish I was his first. When he talks about his past I listen but I hide my anger and everything so I don't hurt his feelings. He was my first everything and I wish I could of been his. And I try and remember, oh they only had him for a short time but you have the rest of your lives together, but it doesn't really help, because my anger just clouds my brain and all I can think about is that.
He's told me some of his sexual experiences in the past, and I get jealous, partly because of my anger towards his ex, and partly because I wish it was me in that place.


He like earlier, to get into TMI, he was telling me about how it was his first 'gay' experience, and it was basically a blowjob, but he finished things himself and got hit in the face with his own nut. And like a tiny voice in the back of my head was like, ""ew gross, now I don't want to touch him because this other person did first"".
And I know that's like toxic! But I can't help thinking it and I dunno how to stop thinking about it.


I have a very vivid imagination so when he tells me things I can like see it in my head and I don't wanna imagine him fucking his ex like no gross but my brain just does it anyway.


Another thing is he told me he got walked in on with his ex after coming back to their house after a halloween thing and we are planning on going to one, part of me wants that to happen to us, so I can say, ""haha I got to do that too, you're not special bitch"" and part of me doesn't want to even go bc I'll be thinking about what they did that day. 


I don't usually get jealous of people. I have complete faith in him so I have no issues with him hanging out with other people, and all that. But this is completely different, because it's his past, and I wasn't there. I wish I was there. I wish it was me, so he wouldn't of had to suffer like he did. But this person. I hate them. I really do. So much, embarrassingly, I'd wish ill upon them. Does that make me a bad person? I don't know where I'm really going with this post.

i want to contribute, i want a job so i can have decent financial life... but im just getting older and older and i have nothing to put on my CV, the only reason i got this job is because my friend recommended me... normally i dont get any call backs on any of my applications

the only thing i have left is alot of friends, very nice friends who just threw my a surprise party last week... i was so high up and now again here we are back to the normal routine of feeling like a dissapointment... a stupid white trash techno loving motherfucker who just pulls everyone around him down financially wih his idiotic ideas 

How do i stop hating myself and move on? where do i fit in? all the places ive tried i dont, where is it?

ive fallin so far behind i cant ever catch up, not unless some miracle happens, but im an atheist so pretty unlikely i guess haha......",26Sep2019,1
346,"Ok, so about 3 weeks ago while in a club I met this girl. We hit it off and we were with each other for the rest of the night. We were both pretty drunk but managed to exchange Snapchat and Instagram details. We are both in first year in the same college and the next morning I sent her a message. We got chatting. Everything was pretty good but she replied really late to my messages sometimes around 24 hours later. I took the hint and stopped sending her messages because it seemed like she wasn't interested. 

However 2 nights later in a club one of our mutual friends brought me to her and again got with each other for the night. I decided to ask her to go for coffee the next week and she said she would. The date was 2 days ago and it went really well and in my opinion we had a really good connection. 

Earlier that day my brother had given me 2 tickets to go to a concert that was on the same day, so at the date I asked her if she wanted to come. Thankfully she said yes. I picked her up and had a really good time. We were both sober for the whole night. When I dropped her off she asked me if I was going out the next day (yesterday) and I said that I'll have to see. 

The next morning I sent her a message on Snapchat asking where she was going out to that night. She didn't open the message until like an hour before going out and said that she didn't know yet because it was a pub crawl. I'm getting pretty paranoid thinking that she didn't enjoy herself on our dates or that she doesn't really like me. For the most part I don't want to seem to needy and desperate but I also don't want to seem too laid back and casual.

 I sent her a message this morning asking how was the night out and made a joke about something that happened on our other date.  Again she hasn't opened the message yet. I know that I shouldn't be paranoid because there have been a lot of good signs so far. 

I'm really not sure what to think. I'm really new to all this dating stuff and don't want to mess it up. Should I just take it easy and send her an open message, or just be patient and hopefully see her on the next night out? Need advice because I don't want to fuck this up",26Sep2019,3
347," I'd like feedback from both men and women.

My company allows me to take up to 16 weeks in any increment of days/weeks/months split up over a 12 month period after the baby is born. Problem is, it is all entirely unpaid and we definitely couldn't afford 4 months without my paycheck as I am the primary income.

I'm trying to decide how to take it and what would be the most impactful for both my wife's recovery/state of mind as well as for bonding. I was thinking something like taking 2-4 weeks at birth, then working for 2-3 months, then taking another 2-4 weeks so my wife could get some time to herself, perhaps start her job search to get back into the working field. I just want to make sure I'm smart about when I take my time.

348,"For reference, this is in New Zealand. 

Hey all, I started by day at 5:30am and was about to start work before I got told I had to stand down, I asked the HR what for and they simply said, ""indecent  exposure""...I went home rather confused, went to bed then woke up to an email which contains the named female complainant saying that I jacked off to a colleague while his back was turned, behind the bainmarie in the a foodcourt view of the public, where the complainant allegedly saw me. We had none of the public to witness sadly, but I'm certain that the cooks were there. I am with the union and they are assisting me tomorrow, and I'm forbidden to speak to the co workers for obvious reasons, and while I'm sure my work will see through her lies, is there anything else I can do in the mean time? I have at least 1 month before I can even say anything. I hear that taking notes is important?

349,"When I was about 9/10 my mother married someone I very much didn't get along with. Little after the wedding they moved me to a little island away from everyone in my family. Their relationship was strained due to my unruly adolescent behaviour. Because of my behaviour I was kicked out the house during years 8 to go live with my dad (where I used to live). By this time I had friends of a couple years and was in school so didn't want to move back. Alas, not my choice. I moved back to the island at the start of year 9 only to be kicked out again during my exams in year 11. Once they got divorced I moved back.

That is a very small backbone to my problems growing up. There are more issues at hand but nothing I feel worth going into. 

I'm now 28 working a minimum wage shitty job with no future and no drive or ambition.

I also know at 28 if I haven't got my life together it's all my fault and yet I still blame my mother. We go months without talking.

361,"I want them to understand each other. My parents are loving, caring, the best parents I have ever known and I am glad to be in this family. My parents are so lovely when they get along, but why does every time they fight it would be so severe? And the thing is, such severe fights were only from simple matters. 

My dad is caring, but he's the type of person who won't do the things someone expects him to do without telling him first. But he is pretty harsh with his voice whenever things aren't going supposedly as he planned. He tends to slam stuff and accidentally break things whenever he's angry. Since my high-school years, my dad would complain to me whenever my mom guilt-trip and nagged him because of simple things. My mom would give me the silent treatment and become so sensitive of every single thing; me not liking the food which resulted in her not wanting to cook anymore in the future is the one she said the most. It wasn't my intention that I dislike the food by telling her the truth, she had several dishes and it was just that one dish that I dislike, so I wanted to eat the other one. I tend to avoid food with strong animal odour like pork. I think to have a certain sense of smell doesn't really affect her because what is the difference if she doesn't like some types of food too? 

But my mom is actually very kind and patient. The issue is that she is very sensitive and always guilt trip my dad and me whenever we argue. It has been happening since I got into elementary school. I have several things recorded in my mind, that I am not supposed to eat junk foods unless she'll nag me and keep reminding me the dangers of oil, salt, sugar, etc. Perhaps it felt too much and I felt overwhelmed to the point of being angry sometimes. She does this to my dad too. She basically controls the food and drinks whenever we're eating at home or outside. But I don't blame her because she only wants the best right? 

This time, I think my dad has had too much because I realised that my mom has been constantly nagging him about little things. My dad has always been silent to the treatment, until today. He accidentally broke one of my ceramic teapots, and my mom yelled that she cannot forgive him because my dad always slams stuff whenever he's angry. I think that this fight is the result of misunderstandings and lack of communications. But I have a feeling that they would never talk to each other because they always mentioned a divorce whenever they were in a fight (the first time was when I just graduated college). 

I'm 24 y.o. and I am not ready to see my parents separate. For the last three years I just got steady with my job and I'm earning a lot, in which my intention to work so hard and skip sleep is because so I can make my parents proud of me and show them that I am capable of doing what I love. What's the meaning of my hard work then if they were to separate? My only dream is to make them happy and proud of me. I don't know what to do if I start feeling lost. I am always confused whenever a fight happens because it was just so bad. I am trying to collect the pieces together because the day before was so nice and we were so happy. I don't know what is wrong with my family. I've been trying to figure it out on my own. Whenever they are fighting, I would cry every night until I fall asleep, then avoid people during the day because of how bad my swollen eyes are. 

Is it true this happened because they lack communication? Or is it just my mom who refuses to tell whatever she needs help with to my dad? Is she too sensitive? Or is my dad too violent and short-tempered? But he just slams things and never hit me or my mom even once. I want to be the bridge to their communication but I don't know where to start because both of them seem like they're done for each other. I don't know what to do?",26Sep2019,1

369,"Dear friends,

I'm trying to figure out which master degree I want to apply to. Currently, I am interning in the financial sector and writing my undergraduate thesis ( major: business administration, topic of thesis: Takeover Prediction in M&amp;A). Due to that, my time to write applications is relatively limited. Due to that I will not be able to apply to all the programs that I find interesting. In a utopian world my one master program I'd apply to if it existed would include the following:

Economics:

How do certain sectors work, how do they generate value / how do financial markets work, what makes a market attractive for investors (trading), are markets efficient?, how to exploit inefficiencies / how are investors successful: hedge funds, private equity companies / how to people behave in markets-&gt; behavioral economics &amp; finance, intuition about growth of economies, attractive economies to invest in, what is Innovation, where is the world heading: productivity, climate change, demographics, exponential growth of computational power

Corporate Finance:

Valuation of companies, stocks, investment Strategies: what defines a good company / to buy / to invest in / what is a good business model / how to grow a company, increase its profitability / improve its services/products

Statistical Models/Data Science:

how to classify / how to predict: on macro-level: recessions, GDP's, defaults, growth / on micro-level: earnings of a company, M&amp;A, returns, how to gain knowledge from data, how is the economy developing: are there anomalies, how to identify biases

Additionally, I have some vague thoughts about possible future professions and what I regard as the biggest downfalls in each of them.

Possible Professions:

Investment Professional (PE, M&amp;A, Hedge Fund Analyst, Consultant, Impact Investor) / Data Scientist / Data Analyst / Advisor /self-employed (founder)

Pitfalls:

Finance world: No visibility of your work, you primarily serve your personal financial gain, no higher purpose just shifting money around, work-life balance (neglecting your friends/family/relationships with travels)
Quant/data science world: Less personal interaction, group projects, a lot of individual work on a computer often exceeding 8h of screen time per day

Finally, I'd be grateful for all of your experiences, thoughts, comments and suggestions for possible degrees/ programs. 

Have a great day!",26Sep2019,1
370," I don't really know what to say here. I've seen this reddit for a while now and I dont really know how this works. I feel very trapped and I have no outlet I guess.. I can't really speak to my parents because I feel like I've disgraced them and every principle they've raised me on. I don't feel like my friends give enough of a shit because their lives are going so well. Can't really talk to my girlfriend because I feel like if I open up to her it'll just cause me more trouble. Since she is the main reason why I'm in this predicament in the first place. My girlfriend used to suffer from depression and shes been in a lot of abusive relationships. I knew all this when I started dating her. Recently she came off of the antidepressants and things have taken a turn for the worst. I like to think that I changed her views on life because her outlook on life has been influenced by me to a great deal. However, lately it feels like she is reverting back to her toxic traits that she picked up from her past relationships. How do I know that she picked these up from her past relationships&gt; Because I've been her best friend for sa long as I could remember. I feel very trapped and hopeless. She is always on the edge of suicide as of late and its taking a toll on me. It makes me very sad and I can't really handle it sometimes. I've got a lot going on in my life other than my GFs issues and I'm finding it very hard to handle my GFs issues on top of it I suppose. I've considered going to therapy but then it feels like a betrayal to my partner because she said that she feels guilty about her inability to be my counsel. So I don't really know.. My parents have always raised me up to be a person that doesn't easily go on tilt. And I feel like I can't face them as of late because all they ever do is hear me cry myself to sleep in the middle of the night and its making me feel embarrassed because my folks are separated and my dad messages my mom all the time and calls me ""a useless cow"". This is all very difficult for me since I'm studying for my Masters degrees entrance exam and its taking a big toll on me because my dad and my little brother are always at each others throats. And every time they fight, I get blamed. So I don't really know what to do here.. I want to be a better partner to my GF I suppose. I don't even know what I can expect out of this reddit.. I guess I want to be heard? Because as of late I can't tell my partner about anything thats bothering me without her beating herself up over how horrible of a partner she is and its making me sad and annoyed at the same time. Like - I tell her that I'm fine and that if I ever open up, all we ever do is fight and she still instists on me opening up to her when she clearly cant handle it.

381,"A bit of a lengthy post. Thanks in advance.

So I turned 17 this year. My mother died of breast cancer about 2 years ago, and since our main source of income came in through her, everything fell apart after her death. 

We moved in with my uncle and I ended up doing everything within the family. I recently got a job, and I'm the only one working right now and providing extra income. When I come home I cook dinner, do the laundry, clean the house, and help my sister with her homework. In the morning I wash dishes and I set up my sisters textbooks and other homeschool supplies for her before heading off to work as a waitress/cook at a restaurant. I barely have time to do anything for myself. It was like this even before I had a job, but it's gotten so much worse now.

My dad doesn't do much besides play videogames all day. He can't get a proper job otherwise the pension will be cut off once they find out and we'll be losing our only stable source of money. The only way around this is by looking for a job that doesn't involve taxes, and I understand it's hard for him but lately all he does is play on the computer. I don't see him do much of anything. He's very loving and he's a wonderful dad, but I don't think he's putting enough effort into things right now.. He doesn't even help teach my younger sister. 

At first I was okay with this, my mom's death has hit us all pretty hard. I still cry about her sometimes. But it's been nearly 2 years and my dad has done so little. I'm beginning to resent him for not doing anything and letting everything fall on my shoulders, especially now when I could be spending this time focusing on college and my own future. I try to talk to him sometimes but then he gets sad.. Or worse, he gets mad at me for ""making him the bad guy"".

I don't know what to do. I can't keep doing everything in this family, it's eating me up inside and I don't want it to be like this forever. Something has to be done.


TL;DR - My mom, the breadwinner of the family, died about 2 years ago and all my dad does is play videogames and sleep. I'm the only one working and taking care of the family and I'm beginning to resent him. How do I ask him to contribute more without seeming disrespectful or rude to him?",26Sep2019,1
382,"Yes, I know that working is the best way.

But few days ago, I got fired from my job (I am an electrician, and I was changing some outlets. My boss turned the power in the whole house on, while I was changing the 380V power outlet, and I almost died. I was so scared that I kinda yelled at him, and got myself fired).

My rent is due in 3 days, and I applied for dozen jobs, but nobody will pay upfront (expected), and I'm selling a lot of my stuff for cheap but nobody's buying. Is there any way to earn money online quickly, or something. 

What are the best sites for working online?  
And, give me some advice to find a job, because it's practically impossible. I managed my CV, and everything is cool, but a lot of people won't hire me without experience, or because they assume I'm too young. 

It's so tough, and I'm really scared, so please give me some cool advice. My rent is due (like I said), but atleast I have 2 weeks for paying bills. So I can postpone that. I can't even loan some money, because all my friends are in college.

I wrote complaints several times and made sure to let the staff in my building know and they try to talk to her but she ends up just screaming through her door.

384,"Please understand that I am very emotional about what happened to me, but I will attempt to give you the unbiased facts. This happened years ago, but my family hasn't stopped suffering. For myself, it began in December of 2016, when I was a sophomore in high school and only 16 years old. I caught my Brother-In-Law attempting to take photos of me, photos of my underage naked body just getting out of the shower. He thought I wouldn't notice his phone, shoved underneath the door, taking pictures while I got dressed. However, he was dead wrong, I noticed the phone because I bent over to dry myself with my towel , and I saw a screen with a reflection of my ceiling- like he was looking for the photo angle he wanted. After this happened, his wife and my sister (who I will call Sister L), they abandoned the December holiday and left the state within a few hours, suspiciously fast to head home.

Two sisters blocked all forms of communication with me after that, without actually talking to me. I found out later, it was because my brother-in-law statutory raped both of them when they were underage, and had even had sex with their mother. They're my half-sisters, so we have different mothers. Their mother was a sexual deviant, conceiving her youngest daughter from statutory raping a 15 year old boy when she was 30 years old. With their mother and my brother-in-law in collusion, I forgive my sisters that they were children when the sexual abuse began. The other sister, who we will call Sister B, actually moved to the state I live in, two years ago, and we have been slowly building up a relationship again. She admitted to everything, and apologised for freezing me out. When she lived with Sister L... She was scared, hooked on drugs, and in debt with the wrong people, but the first chance she got, she got out of that place and came back to my family. Then, a few months ago, we got some awesome news. Sister B has become pregnant, the child's father is a man that she met when she moved back to be with us. He's a decent guy, with a bit of a temper, but nothing Sister B can't handle. 

However, Sister L has refused any and all communication with me. This became... a bit of a problem because Sister B is having her baby shower in the new house my mother just purchased. Of course, Sister B wants to invite Sister L and their mother (by this time, Sister L has seperated from my brother-in-law, but she isn't willing to admit he was a monster and that she helped him).  My mother reluctantly agrees, but she firmly states that NO ONE except Sister B and Sister L's two children will be allowed to spend the night. Sister L can stay, but only if she does what Sister B did, and admits to my face that she abandoned me to enable her pedophile husband, and that she regrets the injury she caused me. Sister L still has not unblocked me, and refuses to acknowledge what happened. And Ok! Fine. I can still be a woman, an adult, and enjoy the baby shower. I just have to pretend that she doesn't exist, which shouldn't be too hard because she did that to me. A part of me wants to just forgive her, she's my sister, and I love who she was before him. But, the other part of me is just too strong, the part that knows that her husband is a child molester, pedophile, a rapist, and he commits incest. She knew about the illegal &amp; immoral sex he was having with women, and she helped him trick other underage girls. Yet she goes about her life, and in her head, she doesn't feel like she has anything to own up too- nothing to apologise for. That makes me so angry, so very angry, and it makes me hope that she and her husband die before they corrupt my nephews into sexual deviants, or permanently scar another underage girl. 

I was lucky. I caught him before he got any photo worth it on his phone, and I have a Mother strong enough to stand by my side. Another girl might not have noticed what he was doing, or if one thing had happened differently that morning.. then maybe I wouldn't have caught him at all. That thought makes me feel like I have the responsibility as a woman, as a sexual assault survivor, to refuse to forgive Sister L until she at least admits that he is a sexual predator and that he attacked me. I have memory of a few incidents that I now believe were her attempting to trick me, when I was about 11 to 13 years old, into their sick sexual incest chain. I don't know how I managed to save myself each time that predator attempted to molest me, but fortunately, I managed to avoid being raped and/or murdered every time they tried (and failed) to trick me into sexual situations and I wouldn't fall for it. I believe she participated in trapping young girls with tricks and lies, at the very least, but I have no idea what else she participated in.

Should I pretend that she doesn't exist (no greeting, no talking, no acknowledgment whatsoever) at the party? Should I even go to the baby shower? Should I shut myself in my room and lock the door until she is far away? Should I get a friend to come over and protect me from her?  I hate that she is making me fearful about such a beautiful occasion, it's just that I have my own personal ethics and morals wrapped up in this. If I can't convince my sister to admit the truth, even a small fragment of the truth, even just to herself, then my sister might as well be dead...",26Sep2019,2

386,"Hi Reddit. - TL;DR at the bottom

I'm using a throwaway as my friends and family know my main account and I am trying to figure this out before telling anyone. 

I am originally from England and have come over to the states to study a masters degree for a bit of a lifestyle change and am so far loving it, I want to be here work hard. 

When I was looking for my degree I was only looking to complete it in a year as that's the same as most masters degrees in England. I found a bunch of good degrees for me and after speaking to each university individually and expressing what I'm looking for, what I can afford and what I want, I sent off my applications to a few.  

I got accepted into 3 and committed to one and here I am! Absolutely loving the course and I've made some good friends already. 

Last week I received an email about graduation 2020 - as I was told this was a year degree and nothing online or anything else told me otherwise I was assuming I'd graduate in 2020, I tried to register and It wouldn't let me. I emailed my International advisor who basically just replied with ""lol no, you graduate 2021, its a 2-year course, could be wrong though"". I immediately started searching through my emails and call history to start to see when the hell I was informed this was a 2-year course - I wasn't. What I do have is emails stating that I am only looking for a year's course, that I have no idea how the system works and I'm trusting them for help with this process. I also have all my funding documents showing that I ONLY have enough money for the year course, and with what they were charging me (close to $50k) I was assuming that I was paying for a good degree in a year (context in England, a masters is around $15k)

I also clearly remember (but don't have evidence other than a call timestamp) of having a phone call with my advisor in which she and I registered myself for classes for this year and I repeatedly confirmed that I was only here for a year and that the classes I was taking are enough. 

I'm now left confused and slightly worried  - I don't have the funds to pull another $50k out of thin air, and I don't see what the point of continuing this year is if I'm only just going to drop out next summer. I have asked my dean about condensing the course down into 1.5 years but I've been told it's 'virtually impossible' to do that. So far they've told me that they're 'sorry for misinforming me'.

I appreciate that yes this is partly my fault too, but I came into this with a list of requirements and was told that this would be fine. I know I could've double and triple checked, but I was under the understanding that these people are professional adults and at least **one** person in the 15¬± person chain I was speaking to would've thought to have checked it with me.

I have also checked and rechecked the online course catalog, it doesn't mention the timeframe to complete the course at all.

What the hell do I do?

392,"So for most of my life, I've been told drugs and alcohol are terrible. To some extent, it's not completely wrong when it comes to some hard drugs and the things any substance can do when it isn't regulated. However, as weed has become more accepted, I'm still not completely sure how I feel about the subject. Let me explain.

So for years I grew up in a neighborhood next to one of the biggest colleges in my area and lots of college students lived in these houses that were being rented out. As a little kid, I saw a lot of crazy things. There was parties every day, it was rare to not see parties. I understand being a college student now that parties happen but everyday is too much. I had seen people drinking like fish, smoking like a chimney, and snorting stuff (coke, etc) like there's no tomorrow. Well often times people would get out of hand and do some crazy stuff; having sex in our lawns, public urination in our lawns, graffiti, injuries (some serious, some not), a house was actually caught on fire because the entire house was too drunk and weren't paying any attention to where the cigarettes were being put. 

My best friend of 15 years now also experienced some things that involve drugs and alcohol that he hasn't even told me completely about.
Around 8th grade, we were going to the same church and on one of our boys nights things, him and I both somehow got on the topic of drugs and had both promised in church that we'd never do drugs. Because it was in church and this is my best friend plus seeing what I'd seen, I've never done drugs. However, now that weed is being more accepted and will become legal very soon and I have a girlfriend who's curious, I've become more curious to try weed. But the problem is I remember making this promise and feel like I'd be a terrible person for breaking this promise. I need advice, what do I do?",26Sep2019,1

394,"There are a handful of tales about digital pen pals falling in love online, usually concluded by an adorable, outdoor wedding or a photograph of them finally moving in together. See, I thought that'd be the way I'd end up with the guy I so stupidly got attached to, but I was wrong. And I'm tired.

I'm in my late teens, him in his early twenties. For starters, we lived on opposite sides of the world. At first, he seemed like an absolute darling‚Äîhe'd call me whenever he could, messaged me almost daily, gave me pet names and told me he cared about me. Of course I believed him. I was a starry-eyed teenager with a broken sense of self. To point that out feels like a waste of time at this point. Then he dropped the bomb and said he wanted a girlfriend who was nearby. What struck me as odd was the fact that he seemed to talk to me as though he intended to start something with me. When I presented my confusion to him, he told me that we would simply wait and see. The arrangement seemed comfortable enough, so I kept talking to him. Our conversations got quite intimate, and I grew more and more attached to him. The pet names continued and the diabetes-inducing sweetness persisted‚Äîhe had me dancing right in his palm. I, silly as I was, thought he and I would get to know each other, meet after a year, realize we were madly in love with each other, meet a few more times, and then move in together as soon as life got a little easier. 

I was wrong. Of course, I'm not saying that falling in love online is an impossible feat‚Äîpeople are different, and the truth is that there are two people on opposite sides of the screen. It's risky, but that's yours to take.

Anyway, he recently went offline for an entire week. He came back as though nothing happened, told me he was glad to be talking to me again. He went offline for another four days, and he hasn't come back yet. I'm not going to ask for a viable reason why he's acting the way he is. I was stupid enough before, but now it's easier to see: I was there to fulfill a temporary need. I knew he had things going on and he was busy, but it only takes a minute to type in ""Hey, I'll be away for a while."" When he had problems, I listened. When he was lonely, I was there. I acknowledge how stupid I was, and although a part of me is still.in denial and hoping that I could experience better things with him, I think it's better that I move on.

All I want to know now, is how do I move on? I have no intentions of ghosting him, because I'm sure he wouldn't be too happy about that. But the question is, what do I do if he comes back? I wouldn't mind being friends with him, I just need everything to be in order again. And in case he doesn't return, what do I do then?

397,"Okay, so I‚Äôll start this off by saying I‚Äôm 13. I have a main group of friends consisting of me, and three others who we‚Äôll call B, K, and T. Throughout the summer, we would all have sleepovers at T‚Äôs house pretty often, occasionally at someone else‚Äôs house but it was mainly T‚Äôs. One day, towards the end of summer (about 2 months ago) T told us that multiple people were claiming to have been raped by T‚Äôs brother. One of them being an ex girlfriend of his, the other having never dated him. The ex girlfriend told M, the brothers friend, about what had happened and M told T. 
I think it‚Äôs important to mention that the brother got into trouble pretty often besides this. He does a lot of drugs, and smokes really often. He gets into fights and more often than not has some sort of visible injury from said fights. It‚Äôs also pretty important to mention that he is a junior in highschool currently, and has recently turned 17. 
So the three of us (B, K, and I) tell T that she needs to tell her mother or some trusted adult really soon because if it‚Äôs true, then we don‚Äôt want it to happen again. After pestering her for a week or two, she has a breakdown so we decide to not bring it up but still encourage her telling someone. A month later nothing has happened so the rest of us keep insisting that she can‚Äôt just ignore it. After a few weeks of her saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it tomorrow,‚Äù ‚Äúnow isn‚Äôt the right time,‚Äù etc we decide to really push it and if she doesn‚Äôt tell anyone, then we‚Äôll go to the guidance counselor at our school and tell her everything. 
She doesn‚Äôt say anything so we go and tell the guidance counselor everything. T still doesn‚Äôt know we told and we‚Äôre well aware she‚Äôll probably hate us when she does find out. After an about an hour after telling the counselor, me and B get called to the office to talk to the school resource officer (police officer) at our school. We‚Äôre told we need parental consent before they can interview us so B calls her mom and she comes down immediately to the school so she‚Äôs with B when talking to the officer. 
After thirty minutes, B comes out and they tell me they have all the information they need from us so they don‚Äôt need to interview me. I decide to call my mom anyway to tell her about the situation (she had no idea what was going on at the time)
My mom picks up the phone and after telling her she seems pretty indifferent about it after telling her I wasn‚Äôt harmed or anything. I kinda thought that maybe she was more worried but I just couldn‚Äôt tell over the phone. I ask to be picked up from school early because I‚Äôm pretty stressed after having to deal with that for two months. She agrees (begrudgingly) and I go home. 
The next day (today) I barely slept and I‚Äôm so stressed out I feel like I‚Äôm gonna throw up. I told my mom that, and after me complaining for a while she agrees to let me sleep a bit longer but she also said that she doesn‚Äôt get why i even care at all about this because nothing happened to me so I have no right to be stressed. So I say I‚Äôm stressed because I was in the same house/room multiple times of someone who may have raped multiple people and she responds by saying that we don‚Äôt know for sure that the allegations are correct so it shouldn‚Äôt matter.
I know that what she said is correct, but after dealing with that for two months and having lost a really close friend, shouldn‚Äôt I have the right to be stressed? I even got diagnosed with anxiety about half a year ago, and that can‚Äôt have helped make me feel calmer. I‚Äôm really tired and stressed now and I‚Äôm not sure what I can do to make her care.

It has been more than a month since my friends ghosted. I turned quiet and meek that I did not dare to say anything out as I fear that they might look at me like a weirdo. 

My two friends were pissed off at me as I was not a ""good"", cooperative teammate. I apologised to them and felt worse, thinking that I let my team down with my useless self. 

I did not dare to type in the group chat, seeing how happy they are without me. I apologised twice but they left me on read or just ignored it. 
I knew nothing will work, so I just let it be.

I have been trying to move on with my life, doing what I like to do and do something to challenge myself. However, I have been having episodes of feeling like crying and screaming. I would just stare at my phone, scrolling through the internet, letting time passed by.

I just don't find any enjoyment in my interests. I watched an anime series but I don't feel any happy feelings in me. I read books but I left it there after reading halfway through.

 The new college semester approaching made me fear for the worst. I was a loner and did not talk much to my classmates during secondary school. College is something I want to be someone different. I made friends and was content. Until one and a half year, my insecurities took the best of me and lost all my friends. I did not want to be alone in college as there are lots of projects and most of them were group work. Normally, the girls will grouped up but I feel like I will be the one left out.

My heart leaped whenever someone messaged the group chat. I just watched the messages overflowing, my fingers hovering over the keyboard but I resisted.

I was not ready to face them, seeing how I am treated like air. Everyday, my mind will think about them, scolding me how I was such an idiot and should have done better. How a worthless human I was.

I tried to be happy. I faked a smile and joked with people but I can't feel the fullest of my life. There is this raging fire inside that made me exploded and cried out until my eyes were puffy and red. 

I feel like my world is darkening slowly. I think I am becoming crazy whenever I look out of the window, thinking if I fell out, I would not suffer anymore. My mind is in ablaze. I can't control my emotions, no matter how much I tried to bottle it up.

399,"Like all of you have experienced, the best life choices usually turn out to be the hardest ones to make. 

TL: DR at the bottom

Hi there, I am a 25-year-old guy living in South Africa that creates the apps you use on your smartphone, full-time. The goal is to leave South Africa as I feel this country is holding me back on my potential due to corruption. 

Although to leave my environment is pretty high up on the list of life purposes... I really, really badly want to become a machine learning engineer. I have a semester and a year left with my honors in Computer Science where most subjects I picked are aimed towards AI. I am really passionate about it and sometimes find myself canceling social plans to spend more time researching or creating AI systems. 

To achieve these goals I have three choices. 1. Startup a freelancing career as an ML engineer. 2. I create a product or service that works with advance ML algorithms to achieve (I have an idea) and create a startup or 3. I move up my subject in the last semester next year to the first semester and start applying for jobs in other countries by the end of July 2020. 

Option 1 and 2 will take, well, what I am guessing, round about two years to safely be able to leave my job and survive from the income but this means I am still stuck in my environment for another two years and even after all that, I am still here in South Africa by 2021. Option 3 seems to be a juicy option. I get to leave almost 2 years earlier and I get to do what I am passionate about. 

""So why not just pick 3"" I hear you type away on your keyboard. Well... Simple, I will still be working for someone else. See, my end goal is to build something big and possibly change the world. This is a big ambition. I know, but it is possible. Elon Musk proved it. The man is from the exact same city I am living in. It just took me a bit longer to get here. I am afraid that if I pick 3 then I might negatively affect my ultimate goal.

""What about 2"" I hear you think through my psychic powers. The problem with option 2 is that not only will I be stuck here in SA but the business will be a South African business that won't go unscathed by the corruption from our Country. Sure all other countries have problems but I believe I would need to take 10 steps forward in this country which is equivalent to 5 in another. 

Lastly, option 1 is the same as 2 but on a smaller scale. This option does, however, allow for more freedom. I can basically do my work in any country, just as long as I have a computer and an internet connection. Though I would still be touched by our ridiculous tax (31% of my total salary and pretty soon 36%).

I don't know which one to pick and I need to know pretty soon if I want to go for option 3. As that option is the hardest to achieve but definitely do-able. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL: DR I have 3 life choices. Either get the hell out of dodge next year July, start freelancing or create a startup. Although leaving earlier seems the way to go, I am afraid it will impact my life goal negatively were the other two options probably won't.",26Sep2019,1

I don‚Äôt react well to unexpected news or change, and I am very much a creature of habit. So when I get news like this, I generally need some time to process things. I said something like ‚Äúuh, okay?‚Äù and went out into the living room to think about why that news made my chest fill with ice. 

About 15ish minutes later I came back in the bedroom and told him I wish he would have considered me or said something to me when his boss offered him the work.  February IS pretty far out and that gives me plenty of time to plan how the week is going to go without him there and prepare myself.

But I feel like it‚Äôs inconsiderate and selfish that he agreed without so much as mentioning it to me.

I told him there was no way that could happen, school is too important, I don‚Äôt have the PTO, and we would be just sitting in a hotel with a woman I don‚Äôt know at all, waiting for them to get done work everyday, since the state they‚Äôre going to isn‚Äôt exactly known for its tourism.

After I told him that there was no way I was going to be able to go, he got all quiet and wouldn‚Äôt talk to me other than to tell me that if I didn‚Äôt want him to go I could tell his boss myself since he already agreed to go, and wanted to go. I didn‚Äôt want him to go, I told him so. He runs jobs on his own without his boss there all the time, and I told him if he had said something to me before agreeing I would have asked him to stay and run a job here. But since he had already made the commitment to his boss there wasn‚Äôt much that I thought we could do at that point. 

After that he just completely shut down, rolled over and went to sleep, which is very unlike him. This whole thing is so uncharacteristic for him and it‚Äôs making this 100% worse for my anxiety.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all last night and this morning I was late because he stayed in bed didn‚Äôt do any of the things he normally does in the morning. Which I think was just him being petty, which again is super out of the norm. When I went to kiss him goodbye he gave me a half hearted peck and immediately went back to looking at his phone. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from him at all this morning until he texted me at the time he normally gets to work and just said ‚ÄúNot going to [state 1,000 miles away]‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt even know how to respond, but he‚Äôs definitely mad at me, because he... I don‚Äôt know, hurt my feelings? I have no idea what‚Äôs happening or why he‚Äôs being like this. We‚Äôve been friends for over a decade and been together for 2 years and I‚Äôve only ever seen him act like this when he‚Äôs incredibly upset. I have no idea why he‚Äôs having such an extreme reaction to ‚ÄúI wish you would have considered our family before you agreed to this‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs mad at me for being upset with him. Was I wrong to tell him I didn‚Äôt want him to go? I‚Äôm so lost.",26Sep2019,0
402,"So my best friend is friends with a girl I use to hook up with. For the sake of this post, lets call her Paula and my best friend Lily. During that time in my life, I was really not in a good place and I made really horrible decisions. I smoked daily, I drank every weekend, and I wanted to be high all the time. All around just a crappy person. At this time, I was hooking up with Paula. I didnt really like her and I was just doing it to run away from my dysfunctional family &amp; running away from myself. However, she ended up befriending Lily. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. I thought they were just being friendly, not that they would actually be friends.  So time passes by and I realize that I dont really like this girl, I need to get my life together, and figure out how I can heal from my own trauma. 

At first I tried to ghost Paula when I was sick. However, I made the bad move of telling her I was sick before I ghosted her and she got worried. She ended up texting Lily and asking her if I‚Äôm okay. I told Lily that I was going to ghost her, but she told me not to and just reply telling her the truth. So instead of ghosting her, I end up telling her A MONTH later that I cannot be with her anymore. Note during this month I was not talking to Paula. I know thats a long time, I‚Äôm not great with confrontation but I realized that it is a problem and I need to work on it. So we opt out to be friends, we try it and it doesnt work out because she caught feelings for me. I ghost her again and we just cut ties. However, she is still friends with Lily and now even claims to be her own best friend now. I may be paranoid, but I dont have a good gut feeling about this girl.

She got into a strange drama between Lily and A DUDE LILY WAS HOOKING UP WITH. I just am a bit wary about this girl as she is also coming to Lily‚Äôs birthday party in a couple of months. I know I wasnt innocent in this situation, considering I used this girl and multiple times tried to ghost her. But in general I have a bad feeling about her. I‚Äôm, truthfully, not okay with my best friend being so called ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù with a girl that I use to hook up with. Especially since she got into a strange drama with Lily. I just dont know what to do when I see Paula at Lily‚Äôs party. Last time we were together, I had an instinctual feeling that Paula wanted to sleep with me after she had a bad time on a date. She slept over and was, I THINK, making moves on me (it could be paranoia). After that I cut ties and she confessed that she liked me and I couldnt do it anymore. 

All I‚Äôm really asking is, is it normal for me to be so paranoid about my best friend being friends with my ex hook up? What do I do when I see Paula at the party? I want Lily to have a drama-free birthday and I want her to be happy. Please provide any advice or ideas. Thanks :-).",26Sep2019,2

1. I'm overreacting
2. It's new and there is a lot to learn so I just feel lost.
3. It's long hours and I'm not use to it.

3. If the staff is this rude so soon then I'm not sure if they're going to get any better.

Yesterday, I was just going through YouTube (have been off school past few days thanks to illness) and came across one a Nexpo video. He essentially makes videos that are Reddit investigations into dead accounts and things like that. In the recommended was another video and before I knew it, I was watching a 3 part series of his. His videos are always quite creepy and slightly disturbing. Although I get scared shitless of things like that, I couldn't just stop watching it (curiosity killed the cat and will probably kill me too). I have done this kinda thing before (scare myself) and not be able to walk around the house without all the lights on and my phone torch on max as well. I even have to shut the doors to every room so that if a monster or something like that was to be there they couldn't see my walk past or get to me. And the worst part about all this is that it isn't even when I watch something scary. I'm always cautious. Even now, I'm sitting with only one half of my headset on and checking my room from time to time. I'm even having to stop typing when a loud vehicle drives past my house.

I asked for a tenancy ledger (so damn confusing) and studied my bank accounts for my outgoing rent payments. Here's where it gets complicated, I've had 3 housemates over my time in this apartment (one at a time) all of which had more than one account so tracking the payments is hard. 
We halve the rent so 10 weeks means that we have missed 20 payments between us. TWENTY.

418,"This story takes place a year ago. I'm a scout leader (in my country scout leader are young, like from 18 to 25 approximatively, so it's not like the US) and I used to be close friend with other scout leaders, let's call them Mel (F) and Lucas (M). After our summer camp, the tree of us really bonded, and I (F) sort of developped a crush on Lucas. Lucas, however, had never showed any romantic interest in me and I knew he would not have the same feelings than me so I decided I wouldn't talk about how I feel, as I didn't want to make him uncomfortable and make it weird between us. I really liked the relationship we had.  


And it worked for a while, but as we do activites with our cubs every saturdays, we would see each other often and given that we were close friends, he would always be really nice to me, which did not help with my feelings. Mel and he would also want to hang the three of us so we would also see each other outside of scouts activites and it started to hurt. I just couldn't stand being next to him and hide what I felt. I started declining their offers to hang out, and tried to be more formal while talking to Lucas. 

While all of this was happening, I had not realized how close Mel and Lucas were getting, but apparently they were. One night, Lucas practically begged me to come hang out as it had been a while, and I caved. Boy, I really should not have caved. We started drinking and I eventually told him my feelings about him. He did not know how to react, he didn't say anything for a while and I was crying and apoligizing to him for putting him in this situation. I left after a long awkward moment.

After that, as you can imagine, things got reaaaallly awkward. When we saw each others at scouts activities he would not say a word to me, Mel also started acting weird, anyway I felt really uncomfortable whenever I was around them. I also made the mistake of talking to Jess, Mel's best friend, about the whole situation and how it made me feel.   


After an activity, Lucas asks if we can talk, and I accept, it was getting awkward as hell and talking things through could really help out. He told me that he was actually in love with Mel, and that they had been dating for a while. I was schocked, but apparently a lot of poeple in the scouts knew but were keeping a secret from me to avoid hurting my feelings. I also learned that Jess had talked to Lucas and Mel about how I felt and that they had been talking about me behind my back. So this was a lot to take in. I realized I was not actually mad that Mel and Lucas were dating, I genuinely liked him and if Mel was the one who made him happy, I was happy for him you know.  


What made me mad though was the fact that I felt dumb for sharing my feelings and excluded and mad that poeple I considered friends were talking about me behind my back and hiding things from me. I'm an adult, I could have handled the news, had they told to me about it directly and not waited like 5 months to tell me. It's a combination of things that really made me mad. I told Lucas and Mel exactly that, and that I wished that our relationship remained "" professionnal "" (concerning the scouts at least).   


Ever since, Lucas and I remain very formal but at least we make the scouts work and that's the important. Mel, on the other hand, is quite mean to me. In the scouts, she is my superior and I feel like she sometimes treat me in an unfair way. She's always criticizing what I'm doing, like she told me that the activities I was in charge of planning were dull and would bore the kids, when the others with whom I'm working are saying they're just fine and the kids really love it in the end. She also says that I'm being too controling and not giving the others any responsibility so she always asks me to give my work to other scout leaders that I work with. She feels like I "" shouldn't be doing all this work "" and gives the work to another scout leader specifically who happens to be a friend of hers. I feel like what she's trying to do is pushing me out of the scouts. It's been bugging me for a while and I want to talk to her about that, making her understand that she should treat me fairly and talk to me like any other scout leader.   


I'm not sure how this whole situation is clouding my vision though, and I feel like I'm exagerating how bad she treats me. So I guess I'm here to ask if somebody could help me find the words to tell her that maybe it's just a feeling I have, but if she could try and talk a bit nicer to me I would appreciate it ? Or somebody that tells me if I'm just being a drama queen and just not say anything.

429,"I 28m father of 1 need some advice and im not sure where to turn theres a fair amount of background mainly because i want to get it out and so i can hopefully get some good advice based on my situation (not trying to look for sympathy i just need to know how to help myself).

Basically i have been out on my own since the day after i turned 16 due to it not being safe to live with my parents (mother and at the time stepfather) also have a younger brother and special needs younger sister. Couldnt get them out at the time due to their age and claims my brother and i had made had been dismissed, to keep it short and sweet we were abused and our parents were on and off hard drugs all our lives. Biological father more so he had done more rehab than anyone I had ever heard of, he is now spending the rest of his life in prison for sexually assaulting a little girl late last year in a dance studio in sydney after getting out from a 5 year sentence for sexually assaulting an elderly woman less than 12 months prior, before that had happened i had completely cut ties with him anyway but still shook me none the less. So in summary here we didnt have the best up bringing and i no longer communicate with most of my family for good reason.

At 16 when i moved out i finished year 12 in canberra and got my drivers license and a job at mcdonalds. I also developed a dependence on weed and alcohol, that continued for around 5 to 6 years just couldnt really cope with the reality of my situation and it was super depressing. As a result i no longer worked and pretty much spent all my time skateboarding and smoking weed and drinking also various other things as much as i could afford, this also meant that i never really developed a passion or interest in anything besides getting fucked up (which scared me because of how my parents turned out) so i made a decision to clean my self up and try get my brother to do the same (he had started selling hard drugs with some very unsavoury people around age 14 and using some of the harder stuff at about 18 i think). Managed to clean myself up and somehow role model for my brother after a few years to do the same.

The key thing at the time being i think 22 was basically going into a job agency and begging them to get me some sort of apprenticeship, they got me into a mechanical apprenticeship i did that for 3 years and didnt finish it previously i had never had any inherent interest in cars. Then i sold cars for around 18 months then moved on to timber flooring which im still currently doing, i am actively trying to get into the navy as an avionics technician short of success i have no back up plan because i dont really have a passion for anything and am probably slightly depressed. I know i cant stay doing what im doing currently i normally work a 50 to 60 hours week some times up to 80 for $900 take home a week but have to support my self my partner of 5 years and our 1 year old daughter off of that not to mention its technically a casual role so no benefits paid leave etc.. my boss often cant pay me either and currently owes me about $4000.

So i guess the things i need advice about besides all of it are

1. what do i say to the navy when they ask why do you want to join? 
Only answer i can think of is im 28 with no formal qualifications no benefits and a family to try and provide for and the benefits you offer are the best i can find, but i have a great work ethic (doesnt sound like a great sellimg point does it).

2. Lately it has really hit home just how little support i have and how much i am responsible for and its been getting really hard mentally to try and bandaid past trauma and keep up trying to be a functioning adult.

3. I have no time and not much money if anyone can suggest other possible career avenues for me to research something that will help me provide a decent living for my family and have a time for them without having to be on terrible money for long or at all to start with please let me know what, why and how?

So my big question is 'do you feel that therapy should be used regularly, and continually?' The main reason I'm asking is because this very, very serious to my partner, and I feel pressured to go to counselling. 

TL;DR: My partner believes everyone should be in therapy no matter what, but I struggle with feeling that that's necessary/affordable.",26Sep2019,1

Being a furry was never a sexual thing for me. I made it very clear I never looked at ""yiff"" although I joked about it sometimes. I just like to draw anthro characters and talk about them.
A lot of my friends say it's weird but they tell me they are okay with it and this one instance of someone going overboard kind of threw me off.

446,"Hi Reddit Community,

I am 22 years old, a fresh graduate with a Finance degree from an Australian University. I just graduated in July this year, and right now I am pondering my future. I am faced with a very difficult decision.
Basically, I completed my Finance degree with mediocre grades (just barely enough to pass every subject), because I had ZERO interest in Finance and only studied this degree because my parents advised me to do so (I'm Asian, surprise surprise). I understand that it is also partly my responsibility that I did not bring up my disliking of Finance to my parents, but all has been said and done now.
Basically, I am considering becoming a Doctor. I have always been interested in the medical field, and have always been fascinated by the idea of being a Neurosurgeon. However, given my poor results in uni, the only chance I have of doing this would be to start from scratch. I.e. Take a Pre-University course (e.g. A-levels/AUSMAT/etc.) and enroll in uni to do a Undergraduate Medicine degree. Is this a ridiculous idea?

450,"Hi all,

So I'm fairly new to the dating scene and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting but I need some advice/thoughts. I've been on three dates with a lass and I'm getting mixed signals if she's into me or not and I don't know if I should continue to pursue her. 

We ""met"" on Tinder and hit it off pretty good and a coffee date was arranged pretty quickly. It went very well and were texting a lot after and pretty quickly arranged a 2nd date which I thought went very well. However, she starting texting back less and less over the week until a third date last weekend where she seemed pretty absent and uninterested in my company. I'll get a one-word reply once a day now from her.

I didn't know if this is just because she's busy with work and uni or she's decided she's not into me, so I invited her out to dinner this weekend expecting a no or some kind of excuse which would confirm my suspicions, but she seemed totally up for it.

What're Reddit's thoughts?",26Sep2019,1
451,"OK,  so this will be pretty long. It is definitely a rant but it comes from a good place. There is a tl;dr at the end. before I get into details of what has led to these feelings I will describe a bit about myself. I appreciate anyone that is taking the time to read this.

I'm a medical student in my late 20s going to school in a major city, however I live right on the city border in a suburb. I grew up in a very rural and poor white area where racism was prevalent. In my younger years my family was middle class, but due to unforeseen events, during high school we were poor and on welfare. When it would rain the ceiling in my bedroom would leak into a bucket type of poor. I hated those aspects of this area and there was very little opportunity for education so I moved to a major city when I turned 18. I did my undergrad in this city and now I'm currently in medical school. I'm progressive/liberal and would consider myself to be left of center politically. I voted for Obama twice, did not vote for Trump etc. Both my undergrad and med school are extremely diverse and I have friends of many colors and nationalities. I feel that this information is important, because I view any form of racism to be morally abhorrent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how this started. About 3 months ago my car's engine died. I used this car to drive downtown. I am now saving up to get a new car, but for the last three months and potentially until the end of the year, I have had to take public transportation downtown. I live on the city border in a decent neighborhood. And in order to get downtown the public transportation goes through a predominately black, predominately poor, high crime neighborhood. The ride is about an hour long and I couldn't help but notice that every morning, for the first 45 minutes of the ride, I am the only white person that is riding. I stick out like a sore thumb, but this initially did not bother me. Over time I have become irritated with the type of people that are riding with me. Obviously they are black, but many of them are also poor. This irritation has grown to feelings of anger, which is very odd for me because I generally have a calm demeanor. I don't necessarily think it's just because they are black. For example, I imagine if I was riding with poor white people or poor hispanic people SOME of the same irritants would apply.  However, some of this anger that I'm feeling is undoubtedly because these people are culturally black. I've heard black students at my university talk about how many of them have black skin but are not culturally black, or how some are more culturally black than others. What does that mean exactly? I'm not sure other than the stereotypes. So it's not really about the skin color. And I wouldn't say that hate black people or want anything bad to happen to anyone because of their race.  It's more that I find aspects of the black culture to be annoying.

Besides the obvious annoyances: people are on drugs, people haven't showered, people acting crazy. 

I find myself getting really annoyed because many of the passengers are LOUD. They are sitting next to each other and practically screaming and I can hear them through my headphones. I think this is a cultural thing, because if you have ever ridden on Japanese public transportation you can observe the exact opposite culture. Japanese are extremely quiet on public transportation. 

Another thing is that they litter. They will literally be drinking a soda bottle and throw it on the ground. Having spent some time in Japan this is culturally the opposite. Another thing is they play there music without headphones on thier phone full blast, or they will literally be face timing or on a phone call on speaker phone. 

Another is the lack of personal space. I would estimate that 70% of the people riding are extremely overweight--especially the women. I don't think this is a racial thing (although I don't know the stats), I think it's an economic thing, because the closer we get to downtown the better the economic conditions get, and the passengers that get on tend to be skinnier. It's almost like there is a correlation between street number and BMI. Being overweight, is a controversial topic, but the seats are small, and nearly every morning some obese woman will sit right next to me and I'm squished up against the window. I'm trying not to make contact, because I don't really like to rub up against strangers in public, but it seems that the passengers have no sense of personal space and maintain contact from my knee to my shoulder instead of sitting a little bit over. 

If they are bringing children onboard it seems to be either one or two extremes. Either they are letting their children run rampant and not paying attention at all. Or they are swearing at them and beating them. Saying things like ""Act grown you stupid mother\*\*\*\*er"" This morning was a case of the former. I'm sitting quietly reading a book and the parent puts the child next to me. The parent isn't paying attention and the child has the parents phone and is watching a violent gangster rap video on full volume right next to me. The kid is like 4-5 years old. Fun fact: I love gangster rap music and I got into it when I was in my teens, but it's just not something a child that young should be watching. 

I just also can't help but notice that the loud conversations they are having... I have no nice way to put this... they just sound dumb and ignorant. I ride public transportation in other parts of the city, or my university has a shuttle and I will invariably overhear a conversation that is interesting or in depth. Or occasionally, I'll even learn something or have someones conversation spark ideas to explore later. It just seems the conversations on this public transportation are always about violence or fighting, drugs or just plain shit talking about other people that aren't there. 

There are also fights, and it seems to always be two black people fighting. After I do this ride, I then get on a different line, where the racial mix is more homogeneous, where there are equal representations of blacks, whites, Indians, Asians etc. You will almost never see two Asian guys screaming at the top of their lungs at each other and threatening each other on public transportation. More often than not if there is a verbal fight on public transportation it's white people or black people 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. I know rationally that these people have not had the same types of opportunities or education that I have had, and that I'm fortunate, but I also give myself a bit of credit because my family was on welfare and I worked very very hard to get where I'm at. Despite knowing this rationally, I cannot control my feelings about these people. Of course it's not every person, but I feel definitely a sense of irritation or anger. From my studies, I know that anger isn't a primary emotion and it's rooted in fear. What am I afraid of? Am I afraid for our society? The lack of education? The persistence of misinformation and ignorance?  Am I becoming more of a republican as I get older? Does it have nothing to do with color of the individual, and I just prefer my own culture to the black culture? Am I interpreting black culture incorrectly and it's just that poor people tend to be loud, litter, rude, have no sense of personal space, listen to music on their phones, fighting.  Is it wrong to dislike a culture? This might not even be  ""black culture"" it might just be ""poor black culture in this particular part of my city that ride this specific public transportation"". Is it possible dislike the culture of that group, without actually disliking every individual?  I need some advice here guys on what to do? Or maybe advice on different ways to think about this?

&amp;#x200B;

 tl;dr  (Although you really should read if you want to be able to give thoughtful advice)  I started taking public transportation that picks up a lot of poor black people, and I'm getting irritated by their behavior on public transportation and I don't like the feelings of anger I have towards them. I need some moral guidance on how to handle this situation or new ways to think about it",26Sep2019,4

461,"HELP!!!

My friend, let's call her Amy, is fairly close to me and someone I care about a lot. It may be worth mentioning here that a few months ago I started to develop feelings for Amy so I told her but was rejected. We were fairly close before I asked her out (had known her for a few months) and were talking a lot and texting pretty much every day. We decided to continue being friends after I was rejected.

Things weren't exactly the same after I was rejected - I stopped texting as much and didn't see her for a while because I had to have some space to deal with my feelings. I was incredibly hurt. Although I am over it now, even now I rarely text her, but when I do it's something important and I had always received a normal and welcoming response. We still see each other regularly because we have the same friends circle and are generally friendly to each other and have a normal conversation etc.

More recently I have been a lot busier and just caught up in life. Naturally, being more busy, I have not really been messaging her or anything and my mind has been elsewhere the last couple of times when I was around her in person (not alone, but in a group). Aside from being cordial, just saying ""hi"" and ""bye"", I haven't had any interaction at all.

I have noticed the last couple of times I saw her, she seemed upset and would look away if I made eye contact. The other day I bumped into her and her friends and I said hi to her friends. Went to say hi to her but she just looked away and looked upset.. didn't say a word.

I sensed something was wrong, so I decided to drop her a text a few days later just asking if something was wrong or if she was upset with me etc and she has not responded at all. Its been a couple of days since I sent her the message and I appreciate that she might just be busy. What concerns me is that she doesn't normally take that long to reply, which leads me to believe she is mad at me, but not sure why. I have not sent a follow-up message or had any other contact since I mesaged her.

I want to give her the space she needs but I want to also work things out and let her know that I am there if she wants to talk or needs me. She is a really kind and gentle person and not really the type to hold grudges against anyone, which is why this is really taking over my mind. Did I do something awful? What should I do??

465,"Throwaway account for obvious reason. I hope I post in the right subreddit.

I'm a student doing clinical practice years in the hospital, currently going through ob-gyn rotation. As per daily routine, I have to follow the hospital staff doctor whenever they do visite around the ward so they can do some bedside teaching or maybe ask some questions regarding the patients. 

This morning a senior gynecologist came to the ward for visite. Me and a couple of my friends (I'm the only girl) followed him as usual. I had to witness he joked very loudly with some senior midwives and when he was done, he finally addressed us and asked if we had any problem. 

I was standing behind one of male friend because this man already gave me the creep from his previous visite (asking a patient who was obviously uncomfortable with it to open her shirt so he could show us her lactating nipple and he went as far as pinching it and told her that she had 'good nipples', forcing a young midwife to put condom on a transvaginal ultrasound wand and then waving it threateningly at her). he told me that I was 'hiding from him' and that I should stand at the front.

Nobody asked anything so he started talking about the protest going on in my country lately, blaming the youth for wanting change, saying that university students are not knowledgeable enough about politics and have no will of their own whatsoever therefore the real reason they were protesting is because 'someone with power' told them to do it. it's a typical paranoid old people thing so I said nothing until one of my friend told him that the new rules are stupid.

(Bit of background story: my country currently undergoes a political turmoil because some people decided to change the law and make some stupid new rules, one of them is that a woman can go to jail for doing abortion no matter what is the reason behind it. Some university/college students have gone down the streets as protest regarding this problem in the past few days. Afaik the government is delaying the enforcement of these stupid new rules atm.)

He started talking about the new abortion rule and how it took a team of medical professionals to determine whether or not an abortion should be performed (not exactly okay imho but what can you do if you live in a country like mine) and that a pregnancy on a rape victim should never be aborted unless the mother suffered from a horrible depression and diagnosed so by a psychiatrist. (he doesn't give a fuck about physical and mental trauma, or something as simple as what the victim actually wants. big surprise).

Suddenly he pointed at me and said 'what if I rape you out of love? Your parents don't want us to be together so I make sure you are pregnant so I can have you all to myself?'

I was so shocked I couldn't say a word at first. he kept talking about 'but I love you', 'I'm the father (a rapist) and that is my child', and also, 'will you, as doctors, abort that pregnancy eventhough that father (a fucking RAPIST mind you) wants it?'

When I finally managed to say that rape is a crime, that I don't care if he loves her she never said yes, that rape is rape and it is a crime and the rapist should never have any say in what the victim should do next. I couldn't get myself to say anything about how he used me as a bloody subject because at this point I'm so mad if I touch that problem all I could possibly do was screaming at this worthless piece of human trash.

He kept talking about 'but I love you', 'I'm the father', 'that's a baby you are talking about aborting', and some other shit but the one that got me was 'hey you never know, maybe she did fall for my charms and the sex was consensual, she just doesn't want a baby so she is accusing me of rape so she can get rid of it' then had the gall to laugh, said that the victim is not believable, that it's a really hard thing to prove, and kept insisting that 'she lied'

He fucking laughed. Not going to lie but I kinda want to hit him right there and then.

Eventually my friends start asking for some actual medical cases, I couldn't bring myself to walk away at that moment because I'm afraid so what he could do to my grade. He never apologize or saying 'it's just a joke' and when he dismissed the group I just walked out ahead of everyone else.

Note that this doctor is not a good person. He kept saying racist remark to my friend because of her accent, he kept making dirty jokes in the middle of a case presentation and not stopping unless we politely laugh at them. I was an observer for a curettage procedure he operated before and I heard the OR nurses talking about how he 'likes them young and pretty'

I told a friend about this and she was furious but she couldn't possibly tell me what to and not to do. Called my mom about it (while breaking down crying too) and she made sure I'm physically okay, told me that she understands why I'm so disgusted, that her beautiful daughter is going to be alright, that I shouldn't do anything about it because he didn't touch me and going against a doctor/lecturer is a hard and long process which could cost me my education and she doesn't want me to go through that, and told me bunch of safety precautions.

I'm still really angry about this. I'm afraid if I say anything they would take it as a joke and that I can't take a joke. I can't believe a pile of human trash like him get to be a doctor and working with women all day. 

Crossposted somewhere because I really need to know what other people think in this situation.

470,"Hi, so the backstory is that my friend was my bridesmaid. During the course of planning our wedding, my husband's 30th birthday came up. We invited her and her boyfriend to attend his party and they didn't come. 
The wedding came and went, it was a beautiful affair. 
Now, her 30th birthday is coming up this weekend. I don't want to go for a few reasons, but the main being because she didn't go to my husband's birthday (or even get him a gift!). 

For my own conscious, I need a little advice here. Should I let the past stay in the past and go to her party (even if it's a brief appearance) or should I boycott it? 
I've asked my husband his stance, and he says he doesn't care. However, I can tell he was hurt when someone who was so heavily involved with our wedding, and was supposed to be a friend to him, didn't come to a big birthday of his.",26Sep2019,1

482,"Background:

I have been at my current position for a year. After my interview, someone from the office gave me a call to negotiate my salary. Not knowing who he was, I negotiated approximately a 10% salary decrease in accepting the position, with the salary decrease being given as a bonus at my year-end evaluation in May of each year (hired in October, so first bonus given in May. If I had known that the person I was negotiating with is a habitual ""deal seeker"" and I would have got the position regardless, I would never have agreed, but oh well. 

Reading my contract, it states ""**up to** X% based on satisfactory evaluation"", which sucks because they could say that there is a smaller amount available, but I can live with that as standard contract talky-talk.

When May rolls around, I ask for my evaluation and am told that they are ""formalizing the evaluation process"", and that I won't get an evaluation until the new process is complete. Annoying, but makes sense because this company has never had a formal evaluation process before. In the same conversation, I am told that my salary is too low for my position, and am promised a 10% raise, back to my original salary expectation for hiring. 

I just had my evaluation today, considered ""satisfactory"" or better in every aspect I have control over, and the evaluators had no comments on my bonus, salary increase, or anything else. I am supposed to pay for medical and pension starting in a couple of days, and that is 10% of my **current** salary.

How can I escalate this while maintaining professionalism and good will? Frankly, I am tired of waiting for what I have been promised, but this company is a long-term investment for me and has honored its other commitments to me (paying for continuing education, training, etc). If they are unwilling to give me what they promised, how do I deal with it then?",26Sep2019,1
483,"Hello this is more of a ‚Äúam I acting entitled if I do this‚Äù thing? I guess.

I recently started working out in a fitness center close to me. I really like and it takes about 40 minutes. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs called circle training in English as well? 

In this center there‚Äôs a small cafe area that kind of overlooks the work out area. It‚Äôs all pretty small. There‚Äôs often free snacks and water in the cafe area. 

I‚Äôve felt uncomfortable a few times now. I often change in the small stall which resembles a changing room from clothing stores a lot. When I walk out I‚Äôve experienced men (one at a time) sitting in the cafe area and quite obviously staring at my ass. I usually try to think ‚Äúokay, I‚Äôm wearing leggings, my butt looks good right now, just ignore it.‚Äù These men are 40-60 years old btw. I‚Äôm 19.

But when they‚Äôre literally sitting with their hands folded behind their head as they watch me work out for 30-40 minutes? That makes me super uncomfortable. They don‚Äôt even work out, they‚Äôre not supposed to be there. I feel really vulnerable while working out and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one.

I shrugged this off as me having bad experiences with men before this and therefore being sensitive to it. But then I worked out in another center (same brand) and found out they have a woman circle. I found this a little extreme, since I don‚Äôt mind working out WITH them. I just don‚Äôt wanna put on a ‚Äúshow.‚Äù

An older lady told me it was to make women feel more comfortable and no other reason. I guess some women feel intimated by the really big guys.

Can I suggest to one of the workers that they put up a foldable wall (if you know what I mean?) in between the work out area and the cafe? Or should I try and bring it to their attention that some people go there just to eat the snacks and stare?

For every semester upto now we've had at least one class together and sometimes he ""chooses""classes that are best and I weirdly comply. I don't even know why, I don't even agree with him most times. 


Every time I hang out with him or have a conversation I feel like shit. I don't even know why. He's super competitive and proud. Normally I wouldn't even hang out with someone like him. The weird thing is he gets jealous the moment I have other friends or I'm interested in a guy. I'm even afraid to talk about other people to him. I hate it because I know this shouldn't be this way. I might be having a great day of self love and acceptance and then one conversation later I hate myself and him. And the weird thing is. I'm drawn to him. I seek him out to hang out. It's become a weird comfort thing. 


This weekend he invited me out to watch a movie. I don't want to go. He knows i like to spend weekends with my family, but he just doesn't respect that. I accepted but I dread going. I'm afraid if I cancel this time, he'll ghost me forever. I never hung out with him before (but that's a whole another issue with my family). He never understands. It shouldn't be like this right? I'd rather stay home and study for my upcoming interview and stay on top of coursework. How do I balance this friendship? Or maybe even get out of it? If he leaves I won't really have a ""fixed"" or a long term friend in college? But I'm always kind of like that anywhere I go, so maybe that's who I am?

495,"TLDR: Just graduated and I have no guidance and/or idea of what to do with my life and if I can afford to do anything. Does moving seem like a good idea?

To start, I just graduated (with a major in Creative Writing and minors in Linguistics &amp; Computer Science). This is basically a point where people start looking for a career, which I've done before and after my graduation to no avail. 

I'm currently a Math instructor at a learning center. The pay is good but there aren't a lot of hours since it's only weekends and after school hours. Most of my previous jobs have been like this-- private tutor, teaching assistant, peer mentor-- as it worked best with my class schedule and I had experience tutoring within college but by assignment via professors. (Jobs that require customer service like fast food, retail, coffee, etc. often don't work for me, as in I don't get them; perhaps because I'm simply bad at interviews but also I think social anxiety gets in the way. Teaching jobs usually only require background experience, a demo, and knowledge in the subject, so it works differently.)

Given my academic studies, I've been looking for jobs like Technical Writer, Editorial Assistant, and IT Specialist. The last one is because despite learning programming I've mostly taken theory classes over the past 2 years, and I didn't have the motivation to practice coding on my own. Thus I don't have the confidence or skill per se to look for a role in software engineering. However, in any case, I haven't heard back from any employers, presumbaly because an employment history in teaching is probably not the best fit. Ideally I want to write fiction although at the moment I just want a stable income. 

Of course, that's another concern. Like I said, my wages aren't the best but I still have to pay for rent, food, and now student loans. My parents aren't super involved in my life. Let me elaborate.

I moved to NYC to go to school after my mother told me to transfer because she didn't want to pay the admittidely expensive tuition for my other school. My mother paid for my tuition and dorming at first in the city. Then she said she didn't want to pay for dorming anymore. By the end of the next year she said she didn't want to be fiscally responsible for us (me and my sister/roommate) at all. That said, before this we convinced her to pay utilities and I'm pretty sure the only reason she hasn't taken it off automatic draft is because she's not computer savvy in the least. (Believe me, stuff like this has happened before.) She called after several months to tell us she was taking us off the phone bill (same story here) and complained that it was too high. I told her that she would have to pay off the rest of our phones in that case and then I checked the bill online on which her phone had the highest bill and told her this too. She hasn't contacted us since then. The silent treatment isn't purpsoeful on our side but cutting us off so abruptly (after promising to pay both our tuitions and my student loans) defintely didn't give us any reason to reach out and she has mirrored that. We do call on holidays and birthdays. 

My dad is far more reasonable. He is our guarantor and gives us a couple hundred for rent every month as a promise to help out until we finish school. It's less than 30 percent of the whole payment but it is throughly appreciated. Though now that I'm out of school, I'm not sure if the agreement still holds. Losing this advantage and possibly utilities 

All this is not to express any animosity for having to be financially independent. I most defintely want to be. I just don't have any financial stability or guidance of any kind.

I wasn't raised in a household where graduate school was something I ever learned about. Now that I do, it doesn't make sense considering things financially and also being in school made me miserable. I do pretty well academically but I had chronic sleeping issues and I didn't feel like I learned a lot. Plus, as a Creative Writing major I don't think it's especially necessary. That said, I have thought about pursuing Computational Linguistics or Library Science if somebody could convince that grad school was worth it.

My other thought is to simply move. I'm tired of the NYC mentality, gentrification making prices too damn high, and also living with my sister. She doesn't clean and gets violently angry with me for not going to late parties/club nights with her and she thinks I'm uptight for that and asking her to clean in the first place. She just got a cat without discussing it with me first and I'm forced to feed it everyday and clean the litterbox. The one time I asked her to clean the litter box it took her 4 days to get to it. Just an example.

I've expressed interest in getting a studio apartment to which she was offended initially but she seems to have accepted it. Withal, this is essentially a fantasy considering housing here and my job prospects. We once joked about moving to Philly since the rent is tremendously cheaper but doing my research I've found that you can easily find a 1 bedroom for under $900, or even $800-- no joke. Again, this is another fantasy as I would have to move without a job in sight and without any support network in close proximity. As ridiculous as it sounds, this actually is the most appealing option for me. I do want to leave New York. Not right now, but in the next year with savings. I've also found a lot more Technical Writing positions in Philly. One problem, though, is I'm not even sure how savings can come about given my job. I may have to find another job just to quit and move, which seems equally dense.

So, any suggestions on what I should do with my life?",26Sep2019,1
496,"Hey Reddit, sorry in advance for the shitshow of a post this is going to be. But, I genuinely thank you for taking your time to read it if you do. Anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

My current ex-girlfriend and I had started dating right around the new year of our junior year of high school, and we had been best friends since sophomore year. We were each others' first everything physical from kiss to beyond -  you get the idea. Our relationship, overall, was pretty fantastic. We were very openly communicative, we tried very honestly and truly to talk instead of cold-shoulder and silent treatment, and we knew when to give each other space, as well as when to hold the other person and let them know it's okay. Our only real issue was her parents. They were, to put it lightly, racist. And we feared that they wouldn't accept me as her boyfriend, so the entire time we dated, they never knew. We would sneak around, and be coy, but we never told them anything. As far as I know, they don't even know what I look like.

&amp;#x200B;

The summer before senior year, her parents found out we had sex and her mother freaked out (justifiably so, I would imagine) that her daughter had been manipulated into sleeping with some guy. My ex tried her best to explain to her that just wasn't the case, but it was no use. She was grounded for the majority of the senior year, but eased up near the end. We had the same classes and went to the same school, so that wasn't too much of a problem on our relationship besides the emotional toll. Which I would say, personally, we handled pretty well. We got by, and we had one another.

&amp;#x200B;

As we were closing in on senior year, I was worried about the impending though of college: What if we didn't go to the same college? What if we had to break up? And we had the talk. If we go to the same college, we'll stay together. If we go to different ones, we'll break up. After all, it had been a year-and-a-half, right? So, time passes and I get anxious, but we pull through. It was down to the wire on where we go to college, but we both made it to this pretty-prestigious but not ""THE best"" college and we were happy. Over the summer, we were fairly busy, but we managed to hang out every once in a while, and at least phone call once a night. Things were strained, slightly, but she reassured me in college we will be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

And, then came college. It started out rough, but we pulled through. But, the weekend before classes started she told me she was feeling super anxious. She's struggled with anxiety disorders, so this wasn't a new thing and I'd usually flare them down, but this seemed different. She wanted a break, and I agreed. We went on break. Exclusive, still- but not really ""together."" It was absolute hell. She wouldn't tell me why, but I figured eventually she would tell me because she always did. Soon after, in about week 2 of classes, I told her that I couldn't take this. She agreed with me, and said this limbo was absolute hell and she still loved me. But, she broke it off anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Skip a few weeks, and we are tonight. A lot has happened, I talked to her friends and my friends and mutual friends and have gathered all the information I can. I had a long conversation with her, too. She still loves me, and I genuinely love this girl too. But, she's scared of her parents. She thinks that (and part of me doesn't want to believe her) if her mother finds out I'm the same guy from those few summers ago, her parents will not accept me as family. She's scared they won't pay for her college, or her wedding (assuming that was the end game), and they would not be in her life. And, I don't know how to handle this. One one hand, I really fucking love this girl. She's been with me through so, so much. I can't lose her completely. She still loves me, but she can't date me (or anyone) right now, for that matter. She no longer wants to lie to her parents, but she thinks she can't bring me to them. She's so scared to lose me as a friend, too. I can't bring myself to drop all contact because I genuinely do care about her well-being, but I can't bring myself to be her friend again because I can't separate my girlfriend and her. I want, and I pray to everything that I can make this work again, but I really don't know.

509,"Hello reddit, I am currently traveling abroad with my sister and we recently landed on an island off the shore of Korea called Jejudo. Two days ago we took the wrong turn on our way to a restaurant and so we ended up having to take an alternate route down a dim, shady-looking street. After we walked for a bit we came to an intersection in front of a small convenience store where we heard meowing from under a delivery truck. We squatted down to get a better look at the cat (we‚Äôre both cat people) and it approached us and began rubbing on our legs and following us. The man who owned the convenience mart saw us with the cat and told us that its former owner had abandoned it near the area and it had been looking for its owner ever since. Now I have a huge soft spot for animals, particularly cats, and hearing about this cat‚Äôs backstory broke my heart. I seriously considered taking it with us but we are currently staying at a family friend‚Äôs house and thought it would be very rude and inconsiderate to bring a stray animal into their home without permission, especially since they already have a dog living with them. I even considered temporarily housing the cat at their place until we flew back to mainland Korea and taking it with us when we left but my sister keeps telling me that it‚Äôs a bad idea because we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what diseases it might be carrying‚Äù. I know that if I leave her (or him) there and try to forget that this whole thing ever happened she will very likely never experience the warmth of a home and the love of another human being ever again and the thought of that kills me on the inside. I really wish there was something I could do to give her a good home. If you have any advice other than ‚Äútake her to a pound‚Äù or ‚Äúcall animal control services‚Äù it would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR - found a cat abandoned by its owner, can‚Äôt provide shelter for it because I am currently staying at a house that isn‚Äôt mine.

510,"I am wanting to get back into school. I love school. A lot. But my last semester at The University of Kentucky was driven off course my some long-run, unacknowledged depression that took over. I quit going to class which I am aware is my fault. So, my GPA dropped from a 3.4 to a 2.3 in International Relations. I can't take back that semester either, seeing as the window for that was 2 years and I let it go too long (again, my fault). Right now, I have my Associate's in Arts from a community college I attended through a dual credit course in High School. I have about 85 credits if I remember correctly so, I need about 2-3 semesters worth of school if I want to finish my bachelor's. I'd like to switch from International Relations, though, seeing as I doubt I could actually get a job in that field. I'm considering going to Owensboro Community and Technical College across state (I'm in the Eastern part of Kentucky and it's Western), though, to get an Associate's in Veterinary Technology.

On to my questions y'all might be able to help me with:

Should I pursue the Vet Tech route even though it doesn't pay much (Median is about $25,000 annually)? Or should I try to change routes from Int. Relations to something else and finish out my bachelor's?

If you think I should go the Vet Tech route: Should I go to the Community college that's further away and cheaper or to Morehead, which is closer but harder to get into? I have prior commitments in the area that I would like to be able to keep which are just IRL D&amp;D sessions. (I suppose they can be facetimed if absolutely necessary, though)

I also have a boyfriend, who I can't imagine life without, and he doesn't like the idea of moving far away. His and my family are here and he's also worried about being able to find work elsewhere. He's the only one of us two working at the moment and he's the one keeping me afloat and fed. I'm searching for work right now but if you're familiar with the area, you would know that the pickins are slim.

If you think I should finish my bachelor's: Wtffffff should I pursue? I have no clue and at this point, I just want a lucrative job.

As for school financial stuff: I'm 23 and still considered under my parents according to FAFSA and it refers all the way back to when they worked and now they do not so they cannot help me pay for school at all. I'm essentially completely cut off from them as far as money is concerned. Anyway, because of that, FAFSA doesn't help hardly at all and neither are they. I need help figuring out/finding scholarships or grants that aren't for Freshmen. Possibly a job that may pay for me to go to school? This also throws a wrench in the bachelor's route as it's much more expensive.

Or should I just sit tight and wait the excruciatingly long year until I'm 24 and independent from them on FAFSA?

I'll probably have more questions that I will edit in later if I think of them. Until then, ask me anything you might need to know to help. Thank you so much if you have read this far- I really appreciate it!",26Sep2019,1

When she's mad she says how she wishes I was never born, how my dad should have worn a condom (I'm an unwanted baby), how I'm worthless, useless and stupid

I honestly don't think I'm a bad kid, I study good, I don't have problems with justice, I never go out nor ask for money, I even have a job and I give her money when she needs, all I do that's wrong is never talk to her and be disorganized (due to mild autism), but I really do my best and I don't think I deserve to be hated that way

Whenever I do try to talk to her (about my day, her day, what we did at school) she just seems to not care, everytime I do something nice for her she barely thanks me

515,"My girlfriend (21) and I (21) have been dating just over a year now. Last month I moved into her and her father's place cause of some family issues I was dealing with back home and had no where else to go. We've been wanting to be closer to one another cause it was long distance with me being back in Texas and her in California and we got what we wanted. It's been hard for the both of us, her having to deal with me moving in, stuff with school/getting ready for grad school after this semester and hard for me cause I'm trying to work again/go back to school. That's just a little backstory for what the title is.
So a couple of nights ago we had a talk and I forgot how it came up but pretty much my girlfriend said it'll be okay if I wanted to sleep with another girl(other girls) because I never had the experience of sleeping around with girls, hooking up and stuff. I was that guy who didn't hook up on tinder, meet a girl after a party, I was literally a virgin when I met my current girlfriend. I guess she feels bad that I missed out on all that before getting in a relationship with her and she said she doesn't want me to hate her or become resentful. Pretty much I'm that nice okay looking guy who didn't have much of a sexual life before meeting my current girlfriend. She said she never cheated on me and never will, if she wanted to sleep with someone else she would just break up with me cause she's been cheated on, I have too. But I don't know man it left me feeling weird cause I didn't expect to hear that from her, someone I've fallen in love with. I brought it up again last night cause it still has me just feeling odd like I know it sounds like ""oh she cheated bro, she just doesn't wanna feel guilty"" which I get that's how it seems but it doesn't seem like her to cheat. But who knows, our relationship was long distance and maybe she does feel guilty about something, maybe she really doesn't want me becoming resentful but I have so much shit going on that I have to worry about it's like really fucking with me. And it's hard to talk to her about how I feel about certain situation cause she gets in a sour mood to where I just keep shit to myself. Honestly I could care less if she cheated, I would just like to know who it was. If she did, I'll prefer her holding onto it to where it tears her apart from the inside out, that seems like decent payback if she did fuck around during our relationship. I simply can ask her about it again but then it'll seem like I'm acussing her of something and even if that I feel like she wouldn't tell me if she cheated cause she really does love me alot, I live in her home now, and she knows it'll a big arguement, but everyone deserves the right to know if they got fucked over. It wouldn't be the first time but I know it'll be the last time I look stupid cause the whole saying ""nice guys finish last"" seems corny and clich√© but honestly feels like my entire life in those four words.

533,"One of my college goals is to make more irl friends. 

I have bad episodes of social anxiety and I'm afraid of coming off as a creep or extra weird. The best way to describe what I go through is that I overthink an action to the point where I feel like I've become an inferior giant, over-inflated ball of gross. It makes me feel like hiding away a lot, which translates to people as standoffish or even snooty. 

To combat and overcome my anxiety, I am trying to compliment at least one person a day. I've started trying to be friendly with a couple people from my classes but nothing really seemed to come from it. I feel weird going up to groups of people and asking to join them because I don't know how. It has been almost ten years since I graduated high school but I feel like I've been thrown right back into that type of social hub.

534," Let me start of by saying, my relationship with all parties involved is good. I hate conflict and got into this situation by avoiding it. 

  I got my first job at a grocery store about a year ago, and have been put into progressively more unpleasant positions eithout complaint. I started out part time and after about 6 months, I decided to move to full time (two $ raise and benefits). During the transition to my new job, I was set temporarily doing a different job without any change to pay(this job usually gets paid more, but I had literally no experience). I have been in this position for a couple of months. It was okay at first, recently however I was set up doing this job during overnights. (Due to someone needed to be present to watch the doors during construction). Im finding it difficult to do my job and watch the doors without issue.

  Meanwhile, my paycheck is going into a family members bank account. I have lived with said family member and my mother for nearly 5 years. But they have been supporting my mom and I for more than 10. If I leave, the financial situation will crumble and I will be at fault. Another family member has stepped in to help allocate funds to pay bills (very kind to do so). But we are barely starting to save money after going through all of the savings and apparently not acknowledging the problem. 

  The transition to night shifts happened without any form of pay raise, which I guess is normal. But I am not holding up well. I have no social life off of the computer and I basically live to do my job right now. Im coming up on my yearly evaluation and holding onto hope for that.

Ive been consistently making mistakes I never would have made before working nights, but I know there isnt really anyone else in a position to do it.

  I want to help my family and the family member who stepped in says it will get finances in check. But without another source of income, I see this going forever until someone dies. My paycheck has only been going into this account for about a month, but I have stepped in to help with bills before this. I can genuinely notice my mental health deteriorating. I think im considering suicide, but it might just be a nice thought of escape.

  I have friends willing to let me move in in another state, but I dont have a car (walk to work currently). I want a way out of this situation, but have no idea how to do it without making confrontation. Sorry if this was very vague, this is my first post like this.

536,"Hi! So I‚Äôm not sure how to think properly about my life right now. Am I handling things the right way? Am I causing more problems for myself? Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up: it‚Äôs me, my husband and my 6 month old son and my disabled mother. My husband stays home with our son. My mother gets disability and enjoys being around her grandson but is basically budget neutral so doesn‚Äôt really apply this this problem. Every paycheck our account goes negative just paying the bills. Not even all of the bills, just enough to get by. We are trying to do several things to fix this. I am looking for a higher paying job. (Also not sure my current job is stable with the way the company is going.) We are looking for a cheaper place to live. And we‚Äôre considering filing for bankruptcy. 

The first thing that bit was a cheaper place to live. We pay $1200 right now and the new place is $950/month. We do not have anything saved anywhere and we have to come up with a $950 security deposit. We are also not through with our current lease, it would be up in February. 

The second thing that‚Äôs kind of biting is I have two phone interviews tomorrow. One is in the next state over and the other is in our home state that we would love to move back to so our son can be close to his extended family. 

I‚Äôm usually very clear and decisive. But right now I‚Äôm not sure what exactly I should do. Do we take the cheaper rent, break our lease, move down the street, and then if I get one of these jobs move again in less than 2 months? Do we stay put and wait for a job to come through?

Because I have made previous attempts to delay my service I know for certain that if I exempt from the military people would percieve it as draft dodging and I know that a big chunk of the society in Israel hates and shames dodgers constantly (although it usually doesn't affect getting jobs or anything in your career). On top of that, there might be a lot of veterans from other countries who will hate me for ""draft dodging"". And on the other side I know there are also a lot of muslims that would hate me for choosing to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces because of it's violent reputation.

549,"I recently got into a huge fight with my mom, and don‚Äôt really know the best way to handle it. Currently we‚Äôre not speaking, and I‚Äôm really angry and hurt by her.
I‚Äôm financially in debt, have been having a really rough time in my field trying to get a job so I‚Äôm in rough position right now. Recently I had to spend all my money on my old semi broken down car, and essentially had a breakdown after everything culminated.

I called my dad for advice on car parts, but started having a panic attack and essentially breaking down. My parents insisted they were there to help me if I needed it, and basically that I can always lean on them for support. My whole life I‚Äôve been super independent, my parents offer to give me money, and buy me stuff but I always refuse because they have a bad habit of being extremely guilting and hyper critical of me if I do. Even though my sister doesn‚Äôt get the same treatment whatsoever, she gets paid trips to Europe every year.

Basically I got a ticket in the mail for running a red light, it was a 1 second red that I failed to break because my calibers had seized apparently and I couldn‚Äôt afford to fix them so I opted to try to make the light which I failed. My mom got the letter and became very frustrated, she threatened to remove me off her insurance plan (which I pay her for) it‚Äôs just so I have a reduced rate, because I‚Äôm a young male with a perfect driving record it‚Äôs still 250ish a month on my own. I insisted it didn‚Äôt hurt her insurance, but she didn‚Äôt really care. I asked her to request a court date so I could try to get the ticket reduced at least, but she said it‚Äôs not her problem. At which point I blew up at her, I told her how abusive she was to tell me to open up more, and as soon as I did she shamed, and threatened me.

Now she said she‚Äôs extremely saddened and wants to change, but she was consistently passive aggressive in her apology. Saying stuff like Im twisting her words, and I shouldn‚Äôt be as upset as I am.

I told her I need space from her, and begged her to switch the insurance to my name so never have to speak to her again, which she was very upset by.

Was I in the wrong? How should I tell her I want to rely on her, but feel like I can‚Äôt without being judged?

556,"TLDR: Just graduated and I have no guidance and/or idea of what to do with my life and if I can afford to do anything. Does moving seem like a good idea?

To start, I just graduated (with a major in Creative Writing and minors in Linguistics &amp; Computer Science). This is basically a point where people start looking for a career, which I've done before and after my graduation to no avail. 

I'm currently a Math instructor at a learning center. The pay is good but there aren't a lot of hours since it's only weekends and after school hours. Most of my previous jobs have been like this-- private tutor, teaching assistant, peer mentor-- as it worked best with my class schedule and I had experience tutoring within college but by assignment via professors. (Jobs that require customer service like fast food, retail, coffee, etc. often don't work for me, as in I don't get them; perhaps because I'm simply bad at interviews but also I think social anxiety gets in the way. Teaching jobs usually only require background experience, a demo, and knowledge in the subject, so it works differently.)

Given my academic studies, I've been looking for jobs like Technical Writer, Editorial Assistant, and IT Specialist. The last one is because despite learning programming I've mostly taken theory classes over the past 2 years, and I didn't have the motivation to practice coding on my own. Thus I don't have the confidence or skill per se to look for a role in software engineering. However, in any case, I haven't heard back from any employers, presumbaly because an employment history in teaching is probably not the best fit. Ideally I want to write fiction although at the moment I just want a stable income. 

Of course, that's another concern. Like I said, my wages aren't the best but I still have to pay for rent, food, and now student loans. My parents aren't super involved in my life. Let me elaborate.

I moved to NYC to go to school after my mother told me to transfer because she didn't want to pay the admittidely expensive tuition for my other school. My mother paid for my tuition and dorming at first in the city. Then she said she didn't want to pay for dorming anymore. By the end of the next year she said she didn't want to be fiscally responsible for us (me and my sister/roommate) at all. That said, before this we convinced her to pay utilities and I'm pretty sure the only reason she hasn't taken it off automatic draft is because she's not computer savvy in the least. (Believe me, stuff like this has happened before.) She called after several months to tell us she was taking us off the phone bill (same story here) and complained that it was too high. I told her that she would have to pay off the rest of our phones in that case and then I checked the bill online on which her phone had the highest bill and told her this too. She hasn't contacted us since then. The silent treatment isn't purpsoeful on our side but cutting us off so abruptly (after promising to pay both our tuitions and my student loans) defintely didn't give us any reason to reach out and she has mirrored that. We do call on holidays and birthdays. 

My dad is far more reasonable. He is our guarantor and gives us a couple hundred for rent every month as a promise to help out until we finish school. It's less than 30 percent of the whole payment but it is throughly appreciated. Though now that I'm out of school, I'm not sure if the agreement still holds. Losing this advantage and possibly utilities 

All this is not to express any animosity for having to be financially independent. I most defintely want to be. I just don't have any financial stability or guidance of any kind.

I wasn't raised in a household where graduate school was something I ever learned about. Now that I do, it doesn't make sense considering things financially and also being in school made me miserable. I do pretty well academically but I had chronic sleeping issues and I didn't feel like I learned a lot. Plus, as a Creative Writing major I don't think it's especially necessary. That said, I have thought about pursuing Computational Linguistics or Library Science if somebody could convince that grad school was worth it.

My other thought is to simply move. I'm tired of the NYC mentality, gentrification making prices too damn high, and also living with my sister. She doesn't clean and gets violently angry with me for not going to late parties/club nights with her and she thinks I'm uptight for that and asking her to clean in the first place. She just got a cat without discussing it with me first and I'm forced to feed it everyday and clean the litterbox. The one time I asked her to clean the litter box it took her 4 days to get to it. Just an example.

I've expressed interest in getting a studio apartment to which she was offended initially but she seems to have accepted it. Withal, this is essentially a fantasy considering housing here and my job prospects. We once joked about moving to Philly since the rent is tremendously cheaper but doing my research I've found that you can easily find a 1 bedroom for under $900, or even $800-- no joke. Again, this is another fantasy as I would have to move without a job in sight and without any support network in close proximity. As ridiculous as it sounds, this actually is the most appealing option for me. I do want to leave New York. Not right now, but in the next year with savings. I've also found a lot more Technical Writing positions in Philly. One problem, though, is I'm not even sure how savings can come about given my job. I may have to find another job just to quit and move, which seems equally dense.

So, any suggestions on what I should do with my life?",26Sep2019,1

We are moving soon to an apartment in a mid size city where all of the balconies are connected to each other with a wall blocking the view into the balcony on either side of you.

i have an online friend that i met as a penpal. We're around the same age.I know where he lives,studies.We've been friends for almost like 5 months.He never asked for my personal info or said any creepy stuff.Often sent me pics/snaps of him and his friends,family,comics that he bought (because of similar interests)

When we first met he didn't have accs  on any social media because he deleted, but like 2 weeks later he opened and if only for his online friends. Didn't post anything,only pp pic.He was going to visit the country i live in, and asked me if i would be scared to meet up, i said no (i know stupid of me for not bringing up my concerns at the right time) but then due to some health issues he couldn't come.

We were talking today again.Suddenly the social media topic was brought up, i told that i just recently re opened my socials and asked if he uses any other platforms.He told me that he used to,but now just uses IG,because he got exhausted about people using it to increase popularity and felt like it's not authentic,just a competition.

Actually this person stopped texting to me for a while until i sent him a message,then we started talking again.

Now i guess this is a chance for me to ask some questions that will make me feel safer. Like i love being friends with this person, we usually have similar perspectives and interests.I don't wanna say something wrong and lose a good friend, i'm kinda convinced that this person is legit and a good person, but you know, it's always better safe than sorry.Also told me that he kinda feels bad that he doesn't have any pics on insta and just uses it to text people.

563,"just looking for some second opinions :( 

trying to make the backstory as short as i can:

i moved in with my bf, and it didnt work out. so im staying with my mom for now. 

i dont have any legal options here because his friend is the one who got us the apartment AND, its just my name on the lease. (ex CLAIMS he was put as a co-leaser but i think thats bs) he is willing to leave, but i refuse to stay there due to some traumatic stuff thats happened. 

our agreement right now is that he can stay there and continue to pay half the rent, but ill stay with my mom. it sucks im doing him a huge favor by doing this. he cant afford the rent on his own. but helps me because i have to pay the rent anyways, so cutting it in half saves me a lot. i can afford it by myself but id rather not.

so, i have the option to break the lease, and his friend claims that it wont affect my credit or anything if i pay the full fee. but of course, if anyone were to ask, the company would have to disclose that i broke the lease. i want to break the lease and find my own place. 

so what i'm asking is,**do you think i could lie and say i still live with my parents at my old address?** 

my parents moved a month ago. is there a way they can verify this? i want to act as if my current apartment doesnt exist at all. what if they ask for bank statements? then they'll see ive been paying rent and ive lost my chance... :(

Since him I‚Äôve had two other boyfriends, one of which I‚Äôm currently dating. 

When dating Ex number 2 (2), I stopped talking to Jake completely out of respect for 2, or at least I thought that was the only respectful thing to do. I only stopped talking to Jake because I felt bad for 2 and thought I was being a bitch if I kept being friends with Jake. I didn‚Äôt want 2 to feel bad and I decided to be the only to compromise. My relationship with 2 was a total disaster and I completely regret the entire relationship. (Us breaking up had nothing to do with Jake, we broke up due to him changing and not being the sweet guy I met)

When I stopped dating him I thought long and hard about what would happen in regards to Jake whenever I dated someone else. I decided that I would continue being friends with Jake and that my next boyfriend would just have to trust me because I only see Jake as a friend and not an ex. 

However now that I‚Äôm dating my current boyfriend (my bf), it‚Äôs not at all how I had planned it would be. I noticed how me talking to Jake made him feel uncomfortable and it made him bummed. He knows I stopped talking to
Jake for 2 and thinks he isn‚Äôt good enough if I can‚Äôt stop talking to Jake for him. However I think it was unhealthy for me to completely compromise for 2 instead of him trusting me to talk to Jake which is why I don‚Äôt want to do that again. 

But I told my bf I wouldn‚Äôt talk to Jake because I don‚Äôt want my boyfriend to feel bad at all. I did this thinking that it would be easy since Jake normally doesn‚Äôt contact anyone since it was something he was bad at, so all I had to do was not contact him. Or so I thought. Jake has been working on his communication so he has contacted me once already and I answered because I found it rude to not reply. That made my bf bummed because I had told him I wouldn‚Äôt talk to Jake. I tried arguing how we were only friends and I didn‚Äôt want to leave him on read but he was stilled bummed. I then told him I wouldn‚Äôt talk to Jake because I didn‚Äôt want him to feel bad or think I didn‚Äôt love him.

Jake contacted me again today. I haven‚Äôt opened the message because I don‚Äôt want it to be left on read. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. Is it right for me to still be in contact with him. Do I just ghost him. Do I stay friends and if so what do I tell my bf? 

I love my bf and don‚Äôt want him to be sad at all. But Jake is my friend and I don‚Äôt consider him my ex. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",26Sep2019,1
565,"So I want to start a YouTube vlog reviewing metal music, and have a parallel blog on a website (I already bought the domain). I‚Äôd also like to get into podcasts with my material. Ideally I‚Äôd set up a patreon to help finance.

Now, this YouTube channel only has like 10 videos, 37 subscribers and less than 100 views per video, and they haven‚Äôt posted a video in 6 months. Looks like a failed startup.

566,"This is a long story, but please hear me out. 

My friend ‚ÄúNatalie‚Äù has been in this club for over a year now. Last year she was on our Junior Varsity team for this club. She got the starter position by basically poisoning her competition‚Äôs reputation (honestly, I‚Äôve seen her behavior towards him. She just berates him at every chance she gets, I feel awful for him). This guy has now been unofficially excommunicated from the club, but now people are realizing that he really was an alright guy and didn‚Äôt deserve what happened to him. So he‚Äôs been around more and people are talking to him and I‚Äôm very happy for that.

Natalie has also been banned from tournament servers for her toxicity (taunting and harassing other teams). I have first hand witnessed her stand up in practice and start pointing and screaming at her teammates for their ‚Äúegos‚Äù and sitting down like her performance was phenomenal (my other two roommates witness this as well‚Äîit was horrific and she has never looked like such a narcissistic ass). There were more instances between all of these that are too many to mention. The year ended soon after.

This year, it was decided that her last chance would be on a club team and not JV again, even though she is a better player than who she was replaced with. So she was placed on a club team with, frankly, very inexperienced players, so she has to coach them in the game a lot. She has taken a severe hatred towards one, ‚ÄúJames.‚Äù She talks about how nasty and terrible he is every day. One day she told me he said he doesn‚Äôt listen because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you know what you‚Äôre talking about because you‚Äôre a girl.‚Äù Red flags for me. I asked who else was present for this, she says ‚ÄúChris‚Äù (who happens to be an ex of mine I don‚Äôt talk to). So I ask my SO to ask Chris about this, as well as the other members of her team to be sure. They all come to the same conclusion‚Äî‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lie, we‚Äôve all been present, she‚Äôs so aggressive to everyone here and the only thing James said was that he doesn‚Äôt like being talked down to so much.‚Äù 

I say, okay, this isn‚Äôt acceptable. So I get the ball rolling with SO (also roommate) behind me and tell the higher ups in the club. I beg for anonymity because (forgot to mention) she doesn‚Äôt blow up or yell at anyone as often and as personally as she does me. After a few days, it‚Äôs been decided that she is removed from the club. At 5:30 today the meeting will happen. 

I don‚Äôt know if she will ever know it was me and my SO who started this, but I‚Äôm not sure if she needs to. On one hand, I‚Äôm afraid of her making my life hell. But on the other, my SO will stand up for me no matter what and she doesn‚Äôt treat him like she treats me, and maybe hearing that her own best friends couldn‚Äôt put up with her behavior will make something click. 

So: if she doesn‚Äôt find out it was us on her own, do we ever come clean? If she does/we tell her and she comes for me, what do I do? 

TL;DR: Best friend/roommate has dug herself a hole and I finally sealed the deal in getting her kicked from the club. I worry what she will do to me but I also feel that she might need to know her own best friends felt the need to report her behavior as it is so bad, and I don‚Äôt know what to do if she corners me for it.",26Sep2019,5
567,"I need advice on how to start up new conversations with people in my class. I'm in my last year of secondary school and basically since I started in this school I haven't made a single new friend by myself the only friends I had were friends of my ex-girlfriend and now it seems like I was really just a friend of a friend to most of those people because we haven't talked much since the breakup. Anyway what I find stops me talking to people in my class is if there's nothing I really know about them the only questions I can really think of are like ""how has your day been?"" and other really boring sounding questions to me that I think would normally get the response ""Alright I'm just pretty tired"" or something along those lines so it's probably a weird question but how do you start to talk to someone you don't know to become friends?

Any advice would be super appreciated and I feel super stupid having to ask something like this.",26Sep2019,1
568,"TLDR: Just graduated and I have no guidance and/or idea of what to do with my life and if I can afford to do anything. Does moving seem like a good idea?

To start, I just graduated (with a major in Creative Writing and minors in Linguistics &amp; Computer Science). This is basically a point where people start looking for a career, which I've done before and after my graduation to no avail. 

I'm currently a Math instructor at a learning center. The pay is good but there aren't a lot of hours since it's only weekends and after school hours. Most of my previous jobs have been like this-- private tutor, teaching assistant, peer mentor-- as it worked best with my class schedule and I had experience tutoring within college but by assignment via professors. (Jobs that require customer service like fast food, retail, coffee, etc. often don't work for me, as in I don't get them; perhaps because I'm simply bad at interviews but also I think social anxiety gets in the way. Teaching jobs usually only require background experience, a demo, and knowledge in the subject, so it works differently.)

Given my academic studies, I've been looking for jobs like Technical Writer, Editorial Assistant, and IT Specialist. The last one is because despite learning programming I've mostly taken theory classes over the past 2 years, and I didn't have the motivation to practice coding on my own. Thus I don't have the confidence or skill per se to look for a role in software engineering. However, in any case, I haven't heard back from any employers, presumbaly because an employment history in teaching is probably not the best fit. Ideally I want to write fiction although at the moment I just want a stable income. 

Of course, that's another concern. Like I said, my wages aren't the best but I still have to pay for rent, food, and now student loans. My parents aren't super involved in my life. Let me elaborate.

I moved to NYC to go to school after my mother told me to transfer because she didn't want to pay the admittidely expensive tuition for my other school. My mother paid for my tuition and dorming at first in the city. Then she said she didn't want to pay for dorming anymore. By the end of the next year she said she didn't want to be fiscally responsible for us (me and my sister/roommate) at all. 

My dad is far more reasonable. He is our guarantor and gives us a couple hundred for rent every month as a promise to help out until we finish school. It's less than 30 percent of the whole payment but it is throughly appreciated. Though now that I'm out of school, I'm not sure if the agreement still holds. Losing this help makes me think that I seriously cannot afford rent anymore.

All this is not to express any animosity for having to be financially independent. I most defintely want to be. I just don't have any financial stability or guidance of any kind.

I wasn't raised in a household where graduate school was something I ever learned about. Now that I do, it doesn't make sense considering things financially and also being in school made me miserable. Plus, as a Creative Writing major I don't think it's especially necessary. That said, I have thought about pursuing Computational Linguistics or Library Science if somebody could convince that grad school was worth it.

My other thought is to simply move. I'm tired of the NYC mentality, gentrification making prices too damn high, and also living with my sister. She doesn't clean and gets violently angry with me for not going to late parties/club nights with her and she thinks I'm uptight for that and asking her to clean in the first place. She just got a cat without discussing it with me first and I'm forced to feed it everyday and clean the litterbox. The one time I asked her to clean the litter box it took her 4 days to get to it. Just an example.

I've expressed interest in getting a studio apartment to which she was offended initially but she seems to have accepted it. Withal, this is essentially a fantasy considering housing here and my job prospects. We once joked about moving to Philly since the rent is tremendously cheaper but doing my research I've found that you can easily find a 1 bedroom for under $900, or even $800-- no joke. Again, this is another fantasy as I would have to move without a job in sight and without any support network in close proximity. As ridiculous as it sounds, this actually is the most appealing option for me. I do want to leave New York. Not right now, but in the next year with savings. I've also found a lot more Technical Writing positions in Philly. One problem, though, is I'm not even sure how savings can come about given my job. I may have to find another job just to quit and move, which seems equally dense.

So, any suggestions on what I should do with my life?",26Sep2019,1

Read my other posts to get better understanding because I'm at work and don't have enough time for a long post 

So apparently he just thought we were together when she sent him something, and he said he was like 100% sure nothing happened

He just thought they did because he thought I was her ex

But according to both of them it was in August

And that he said that she sent me nudes because he wasn't completely sure and he doesn't care but then what she said also
Backs up she didn't say anything to him while we were together

Because before she said don't tell my man and then when she was with me she said she's wasn't going too

I asked why he kept insisting that she did when she said she didn't and it was because he thought she did because it was in August

But then he said I thought I was her old ex and then he realized I wasn't and that don't really make sense or add up or maybe I'm slow or something

Idk why he didn't tell me this in the first place or something, I feel like he's lying because I said I'd give him something but I didn't and he threatened to kill me and then blocked me

But then again she is pretty confident she didn't send him something in her old relationship, so I really don't know what to do at this point and she also said they didn't talk in September even though this guy said nothing happened but before he came clean he insisted something happened and asked for he Snapchat for proof and she wouldn't give it to him
But because of what he told me it makes more sense why she called him out asking for proof and saying She's been with me since September and called him out on her Instagram story so idk if someone got detailed wrong because I showed her the texts and she said it was all right and when I asked if she was lying she said no",26Sep2019,0

572,"Let me start with a little background information. I am John, 17, Male, in public high school. For privacy reasons, we will say this girl's name is Mia, shes 16 and we go to the same school. I recently got out of a relationship that lasted about a month. The thing is it shouldn't be over and here's why. It all started last year, we were Sophomores, I had just transferred in that semester from an all boys private school. So it was halfway through the year and I only knew a few people. I quickly made friends with a small group of people who I still hang out with. There was this one girl though, Mia. I had no classes with her or anything. The only times I saw her were after my 2nd hour changing classes and before my 5th hour class. She was cute but I never thought anything of it until this year when I asked her out. When we were dating, she told me she had had a major crush on me all last year. Like, a whole stalker crush. But there's nothing wrong with that. That just means I don't have to worry about her cheating or breaking up with me over something stupid. That brings us up to the present. We were together and happy. We were both into the same things and enjoyed spending time with each other. Her friends became my friends and everything was great. But a few days ago she broke up with me out of nowhere. She's been going through some family stuff and I'm convinced that's what caused the breakup but I don't know how to approach her in such a way that it wouldn't seem clingy or forceful. My intention is to share with her that shes not alone and doesn't have to push me away despite the situation with her family. I want her to realize that she should hold me closer or better yet let me hold her closer because she doesn't have to be alone in whatever is bothering her.

574,"Back story:

This employee, who I refuse to call my coworker, got brought into a position that did not exist. They were only brought on to the company solely on the fact that they know one of the owners. They have the word ""manager"" in their title, which makes it seem as they are higher position than most of us. When they got brought on, the coworkers I talked to, were upset because this position never existed and it took some of their duties. 

&amp;#x200B;

They definitely are not qualified to be in that position: they have bad communications skills both orally and written, have little understanding of how our company runs, and do not retain basic information when told. In reality, all they can do is clean, but even then, does a terrible job at it. They complain about our cleaning service we have on the WEEKENDS, yet the mens bathroom is always out of paper towels, sinks are dirty, and she decides to ""clean"" them when all the guys are in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within the couple months they have been here, they have already got rid of some vendors for services we use, because they ""know cheaper"". Sometimes cheaper isn't always better, and it shows with the new vendors they hired.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in the accounting department so it is hard not interact with them since I oversee the vendors. Recently, they have been given a task that has to do with accounting, because the president sought it fit for them. This task has cash that is going out, making it an accounting function. The fact that they went in there and told the president I was doing a bad job, infuriated me. I had taken over the task and was in the process of cleaning it up due to a prior employee not making updates to the task.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, they decide to gossip with one of my coworkers in the accounting department for hours. I timed them one day and they sat there for at least 30 minutes, laughing and going on about their truck. Our HR person has talked to them about it but they keep doing it. I have already talked to our HR person about other things, and even our HR person complains about them how they don't listen. It's ridiculous and hence the reason I call them untouchable. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I bring this up and to who? If i do bring it up, I will seem like an asshole for the way I think, yet I feel like I am not. HR has already been informed but nothing has been done. I get really annoyed when they walk by because they are loud and obnoxious, multiple employees have already had the same complaints.",26Sep2019,3

577,"I was a stupid kid in middle school so I believed that if I work and study hard enough I could achieve any high school. The reason of why I believed that was teachers in my school saw some kind of potential in me and they encouraged me to study hard. So I studied hard and got a good result from my entrance exam and finally I got in my dream school. When I started to socialize with students of my class I learned there were students that didn't studied as much as I did. I didn't consider this as a weird situation since being lucky is not something unusual. The idea of being dumb didn't cross my mind until I had socializing problems. Every student I met always surpassed me in general knowledge. I thought the reason of that was my interests and other pupil's interests weren't overlapping with each other. That wasn't the case. And now I am not sure whether I should change my school or not. Teachers always trying to accelarate the pace of classes in order to make subjects more detailed. I sometimes struggle to catch up lessons and I think this is gonna become a bigger issue since upper grades have harder subject. I am always stressed of answering with I don't know to questions of teachers. I don't have any close friends but I have learned to manage my emotions so it is not a important issue as previous ones. Should I change my school? If I change it, probably I will be happier but I can struggle to get a good score in college exams. If I don't change it , the people at there will look down on me and I will be depressed and stressed as always but I will have a higher chance to get in a medical school. What should I do? Should I suffer 3 years to get in a good college or change it in order to being with people that I like.

578,"I fell in love for the first time in my life. It was different from crush because not only was i still aware of good and bad and okay and not okay, i also was sincere, loving, compassionate, caring and if a disagreement happened i sat down and asked them to talk and reach a compromise. Not a win-win. Nor a win-lose. Rather a lose lose. When he forgot something i worked hard on, and felt horribly guilty i tried to explain that: you can't remember everything because what matters to me may not matter to you and that is okay but i also can't help but feel dejected over this -it just is what it is and i know you genuinely care about me so it's okay so please continue to be warm towards me. Then he'd say okay but i still feel really bad. He'd ask me how he can make things better and i'd explain that he couldn't and didn't need to because some feelings just happen. But i didn't want him to ever be sad or feel like he made me sad so in the same conversation i 'played up' forgetting something he told me earlier then said 'see? i forgot something that mattered to you too. There. Now don't feel bad na, we're even.' And we became closer. That's the kind of dynamic we had except...

I confessed my feelings to him. He came off as very confused about his own feelings of wanting but not feeling good enough or just not wanting a relationship right now. But then he started saying he saw me as a very attractive friend that was too hot to be attracted to. I was hurt...alot. I asked for some space. He started saying he felt bad. I tried really hard in trying to let him know that 'not liking me isn't your fault. You did nothing wrong. But i'm also not wrong in being sad over being rejected.' I told him i'd be his friend but we'd have to change our dynamic then. We had, up until that point, a very not platonic friendship. We never did anything physical but he made it very clear he...the man literally called me his ideal girlfriend. I really thought our feelings were mutual. He'd want to talk to me all the time and text me a good morning every day for the five months we were friends. Point is...i cared about him. I wanted to like him as his girlfriend but if he wanted me to like him as his friend, i was okay with that but i needed the dynamic to not be so stiflingly not platonic. He tried for a while. Then we ended up falling back to our old dynamic...obviously i was enabling him. 

So i told him i wanted to leave. I told him we can't be just friends. i don't want to be just friends but even then i asked him what he wanted to do. 

I've been working on moving on and it's been 2 months. My brain keeps telling me i was evil to him and making him feel guilty and burdening him with my emotions. Was i abusive towards him? Why is my brain putting warped up memories. Was i evil for liking someone? Was i evil for leaving when my love was unrequited?",26Sep2019,1

i moved in with bf--didnt work out. staying at my moms now. his friend works for the apt company and got us the apt in the first place. unfortunately its just my name on the lease. ex CLAIMS he was added as a co-leaser but its probably bs. regardless, obviously his friend is going to do everything he can to let him stay. 

anyway, the friend says if i were to break the lease and pay in full, it wouldnt affect my credit or anything. but obviously, if someone asked, they would have to disclose that i broke the lease. i have 7 months left (lol -\_-)

**my question is, can i lie when applying for a new apartment and say i still live with my parents?** the address is still on my license if it makes any difference.. is there a way for them to verify this? the problem is neither of my parents live there as of last month. my mom has her own place now, should i say i live with her there instead?

i'm scared they'll ask for a bank statement and see that i'm clearly paying rent somewhere else. i was thinking of saying the lease ends in a month but if they call and verify im screwed. 

can i pretty much act like i never moved out at all? or just keep waiting it out til the lease is up? :/",26Sep2019,4

I slowly turned numb and just mindlessly scrolled through the internet. I faked a smile and laugh everyday just so nobody knows.

My friends did not talk to me. They treated me as if I was air. I hate when they ghosted me instead of talking things out. How can I move on knowing that they will not try to talk to me?

581,"My girlfriend's sister had a baby 4 weeks ago. They live 8 hours away. We planned on heading up there this weekend (Friday night through Wednesday morning) to see them and the baby. I have my daughter on Sundays only, and planned on leaving her with her mom so she could get to school Monday (this caused me some heartburn as I hate missing time with her). 

Two weeks ago, my GFs sister texted us saying that with their lack of sleep, general frustration with the numerous visits they had already had, and her husband's OCD (which makes everything more complicated), they would prefer to limit the people on the visit and asked for just my GF to come up. I have a good relationship with them and took no offense to it, newborns can be tough enough without everything else. So I didn't reach out to my daughter's mom to make plans, and told my daughterlast week that we'd have a daddy day this Sunday since GF would be out of town. I also made plans to help my brother with his car.

Today, GF's sister texted saying that she did want me to come. I can either scramble to make the plans needed for Aria and drop the plans I already made to go up with her, or keep the plans I made and potentially disappoint my GF (she wants me to go)

The only other complication: work. I have not requested the time off, and today my company went through a round of layoffs. I'm not sure that right now is the best time to take an unscheduled vacation (although my boss is flexible with PTO and said for now everything is business as usual)

584,"TL;DR Favorite child sister convinced family I am a thief and my own home is being destroyed. I got nowhere to turn to.

Title explains it in a nutshell.

I am 20m

Details:

My sister (25) has never really accomplished anything because she is always ""too stressed"".
No job, No friends, No SO, 50K in student debt etc.

I always felt bad for her and tried to connect her with my social group so she can be a tad happier. She and I connect on a level beyond anyone could understand. Whenever I get frustrated or angry I just know that my sister would think the same Toxic thoughts as I do

However I got my diploma, A girlfriend, somewhat of a social group, A job etc.

She has always been jealous of anything that I accomplished through hard work, sweat and tears. I am a bit of a loser so the fact that I got a girlfriend still amazes me.

She tried to break me and my girlfriend up by being extremely rude to her: She would blatantly call her childish or simply ignore her at New Years Eve which broke my girls' heart

Anyway fast forward to the biggest issue.

We went on a vacation to bond together and it was amazing, I got to really feel like shes happy. Which made me feel proud.

However when we return home, she convinced my entire family that I had stolen a 100 bucks from her. My family sees me as a thief right now which is ABSOLUTELY not true!

I would never steal, let alone from my sister!

She knows that I did not steal from her but ever since I was little she would bring me down to make herself feel better.

She would be the person to take me apart and tell me ""I know its a lie but I hate you so much""

However in my strict family, girls have always been the parents favorite. So they believed her immediately.

Housing

My home is being replaced in January to make way for a tram station. I literally have no place to go.
I am not a refugee nor an immigrant so I cannot request skipping the line for a social home.(nor should I)

I am in Amsterdam and worked so hard to get an good paying job. No matter how good this pays, it is not enough for the ""directly available housing""



Does anyone have ANY advice as to what I could do?

586,"I guess I was diagnosed with a weakness of inauditory  + Attention Processing. 

I have a horrible time trying to pay attention, since I lose focus so much, it's very easy for me to not sustain focus. Another problem I am more of a visual learner than a auditory learner, so I have a hard time processing to derive meaning to oral direction. I have very poor memory as well. The last problem that I have is Simaltaneous Processing.

How do I fix this ? Or at least how do I minimize the damage/weakness ? Is there like a brain exercise advice or app or whatever. Should I drink some supplements, say like some specific vitamins ?  How do I even cope with that my mind is so much inferior than my peers ?",26Sep2019,1
587,"I recently discovered my towns local sub and to my surprise it is an absolute dumpster fire. My wife had a question a couple weeks ago regarding an abandoned house that hat has overgrown weeds and shrubs that are blocking a line of sight for a nearby intersection. Well she decided to use this sub to ask our Reddit neighbors where would I go or who do I call to report this? And holy cow people actually had a huge problem with this. She got one or two replies that helped and the rest of them ranged from calling us lazy and entitled to the local hate of ‚Äúgo back to California.‚Äù (Born and raised here btw) she reported the hate comments and ignored the others somewhat. Post gets locked.

The next day her problem was taken care of and she asked the mods to unlock the post so she can update everyone. They didn‚Äôt so she made a new post about how her problem was fixed within a day and that (local city web page) has loads of services available for us to use, cool right? Post once again became mostly trash with the same damn crap from different people because she blocked the first people, AND the mods got mad about the update post saying it should have been under the original and they removed it because of such. First post was a pic and is still today even, locked, so the only way to update would be a comment. So they deleted quality OC about how to access and use our city services.

We have been active on the sub still and notice the same pattern under all the posts and have seen others make comments about it‚Äôs amazing how a nice city has a shitty hate group for a subreddit. I got the idea to start a new sub that‚Äôs less specific to one city and more the area for example like an east texas sub or a NW Washington sub but obviously for our area. But I‚Äôm not sure if being a sub creator is something I‚Äôm cut out to do and I know I would have other mods but launching a sub is a big deal and requires a lot of work I‚Äôm not 100% I want.

Not really sure what kind of advice your all about to give me but I figured i might get that one amazing answer or might not but it‚Äôs worth a try.

My questions specifically:

Is there anything I can do as a simple Reddit user to help clean up this sub?

I‚Äôve never modded or created a sub but have read about it, is it as much work as it sounds?

Any other ideas?

I told her I would send her the committee info and we exchange numbers.  Big regret.

30 minutes later she leaves. 

A month goes by and nothing.  She happens to be walking in front of my house as I'm leaving and she seems super awkward and we say hello. That's all. 

I can't imagine having that happen over and over so I text her and ask if I got my wires crossed and was she waiting for me to reach out to her?

591," 

Please bear with me, this is long, but my relationship might depend on advice and validation from this post.... I got too invested in this relationship and I need to reevaluate my commitment.

1. We got drunk last weekend and had a long discussion about where we want the relationship to go. I thought things were going phenomenally well and I really thought we **might** end up married with kids and all that. (I wasn't set on it, but I genuinely thought it would be a possible outcome).

She told me that she has a negative outlook on relationships and that they all end eventually. She even laughed at the idea of having kids with me. I wasn't 100% determined that we would grow old together, but it hurt to see her reaction to the thought. She believed that saying ""but I like hanging out with you!"" would make me feel better, which it obviously didn't.

2) A few weekends ago, we were drinking at a party (we're not alcoholics, this is just when stuff comes out). This was a party that we were planning on attending all week. She told the group ""I had tons of plans for this weekend. There was a road trip, a concert, a soccer game..."" then she looks at me and realizes.... ""I didn't tell you about any of these plans!""

These were plans that she made with her two best friends (both gay men (yes actually gay, I'm not suspicious about her hanging with them, but it makes me a little more jealous when I'm left out simply because they are men and she is sexually attracted to men.)) WE MADE PLANS FOR THAT WEEKEND. Although the plan we made actually came to fruition, why would she make other plans and why would she not tell me? She is planning a road trip with these guys next month, to which I was not invited... I'm trying to be cool about it, but I am starting to feel very jealous.

3) Finally, when I asked her to be my girlfriend (this was before any of this stuff happened), she was really weird about it. She said, ""Can we just be soft boyfriend and girlfriend for a while?"" I told her let's drop the whole idea and we can revisit it later. She insisted that ""I want to be your girlfriend, I'm just going to be weird about it for a few hours."" And she was. She then texted her closest friends and announced the relationship. Then we deleted our dating apps from our phone.

I just don't understand her thought process and I hope that it is glaringly obvious to someone here. We have met each others' friends and family and we spend a lot of time together, but something is up.",26Sep2019,1

593,"Very long post, TLDR at the bottom.

Please don't dox me or anything I'm still a student here. Throwaway acc just incase the school somehow sees this?

I joined the Art Institutes of Dallas in summer 2017. I picked animation, probably the worst major you could pick in America, but I wasn't worried because I knew most students change their major after being in school for a bit in hopes of a better more profitable career (as in, you've only ever heard of the job ""animator"" before you go to college, but after you're in, there are jobs like in-betweeners and clean up and previs that you'd never heard of before that are now options to you, but that's besides the point). I knew better than to go here; I did my research, heard all the stories, but I was so terrified of taking a break year between high school and college that when I didn't get accepted into either CalArts or Ringling, I panicked and chose the Art Institutes. My parents more than anything wanted me to be a first generation college student, and neither I nor they wanted me to take a break year. 

I really regret picking this school. I will admit, the first year gave me some valuable advice, the perfect kind of advice that would let me make a sketchbook and hope for the best in trying to reapply to CalArts. But at this point I've already taken out thousands of loans, and it's almost 2020 now. I would graduate in 2020 or 2021. Is it really worth it to leave and take all the debt with me? I mean, the school might work...

I'm one of the better students in this school, but that's only because:
1. I did a lot of practice and looked up how to do a lot of the things that interested me on YouTube. This school runs year round in intervals of 11 weeks. Basically, one 4 hour meeting is not enough to learn how to animate in 2D but so be it that's how long we have. Luckily I dipped my feet in in 6th grade, so I'm already light years ahead if the rest, for example. I'm not the best by far, no fucking way. I'm only good in comparison to my peers, which, lets face it...
2. The school takes in anyone, ANYONE, who wants to go into this school. Never drawn before? Yeah, we get a lot of those. ""Sure we'll teach you!"" Teach them how to draw in 11 weeks? My ass. Don't know how to use Photoshop, much less Word? Nah don't worry about it. 11 weeks and we'll get you running. I heard someone got into this school drawing pony erotica. No teacher looks at your ""entrance portfolio"", the recruiter who's never taken an art history class glances at it and goes ""Yeah, this is good you've got potential."" I doubt you even need a portfolio to get in considering so many people can't draw here. 

This school really just takes in anyone with a wish and says they can do it. I had a theory earlier that this school might actually work, if they only restricted who went into their school, like CalArts and Ringling or any other legit school would do. CalArts only accepts people that are already the best of the best, and helps fine tune them into something better. AI takes in the best and the worst and anyone in between off the street who breathes in their direction.

Because of that, I thought, you know, maybe this school does work, considering I've already got a headstart in a lot of areas here. If they only weeded out the lesser skilled students and asked them to come again later, instead of sucking them dry, then maybe. I mean, the teachers are great of course. They are real industry people who knows their craft well. The only thing is, I've HEARD, is that they just pull them in and that they don't need a teaching degree. So, a lot of teachers, while THEY know what they're doing, might have a bit of a hard time explaining it to someone who's never done it before. 

*Summary* : Anyways, those are all the things I'm taking into consideration when deciding if it's better to just stay here and ride it out, and if it fails it fails and I just take a back up job (like a plumber or something, I dunno) or if I should try to reapply for CalArts (I don't even know if I can do that while still enrolled here) and see if it works, get even more into debt but go into a more reputable college and leave basically everything here to go live over there and basically HOPE that I don't fuck myself over with the school work and stuff, and stay in school even longer, graduate later, etc etc etc. Would it even be worth it? I could also wait until this school eventually shuts down like the rest of them and hope I get borrowers forgiveness or whatever it is.



I just wish I never went here. 



#TDLR: Is it better to stay in a scam school that MIGHT work (and ""might"" is an extremely small percentage of success) and go down with the loans, or try to reapply to a very reputable school, get even more in debt, and hope I don't flounder over the school work, graduate so much later than I would've ever wanted but possibly get a better shot at the job I wanted? I don't think just leaving will do me any good, so right now, that's what I'm stuck on.

596,"23. Grad. with a shit weekend job.

I lost weight a year ago - was doing really well and then my grandmother died and it really killed me. I looked into eating food as my support - my parents aren't the type to show affection or support, more critic everything. I have never, ever hugged or kissed my dad. As for my mum, I hug her like once/twice a year on special occasions. 

My mother feels it neccesary to always focus on my weight. She, herself is obese. I genuinely don't ask for much from her, and I help her out when/if I can. I don't drink, smoke or go clubbing. I stay at home because growing up, my parents didn't like us having friends and saw it as a bad thing.

But today - I lost my shit. 

So, I was in her room with her and she asked me to pick up my brother (he is 15) and I said no, I have horrible chaffing around my thighs so he is ok to come alone. He always comes alone, btw. She went crazy: 'you're so big, like massively big, how can you just sit at home all day and do nothing, how have you gotten so BIG, so OBESE, well yeah because you sit on arse at home' etc etc.  I lost it. I picked up the donuts that she asked me to pick up a couple days ago, and its entire sugary glory, through it all over her in her bed. I swore at home, told her I wish she was dead, told her some horrible, horrible things. 

But I am on the second day of my diet, and I am TRYING to better myself. I get no overtime at work and grad. jobs are hard to find. 

How do I deal with this? Literally ALL THE FUCKING TIME my mum points out my weight, the size of my legs, the size of my arms, my stomach, the boobs, etc. I AM TRYING. I ask her to go gym with me, she says no. Growing up - we were fed a lot of junk food, we have it once every other day, at least. Never a salad. I am trying to get out of that mindset but when she obsesses over my weight, she puts me down. No matter what. I hate myself as it is.

The reason I say sort of is because I'm still not sure, I'm not sure if it's just some stupid passing thought that I've had, because it's stuck around for a while and if it was a passing thought, I would've just forgotten about it. I've really started to get into Rugby, with the world cup and all and I talk about it regularly with a friend of mine. It's important to add that I'm a 15 years old , I've never played a sports before or joined a club, I was in a boxing club a year ago, that only lasted like half a year, and boxing has nothing to do with Rugby, so I'm completely aware of the fact that I'd be out of my league, probably playing with and against people who've been doing rugby since they were 8 to 10 years old. I'm not completely inactive, I go to the gym three times a week, and try my best to eat healthily for gaining muscle, I can squat 75kg, dunno if that's impressive or not.  I don't really know the rules and how to play rugby entirely, I couldn't really explain it to anyone, and I asked my friend who I mentioned earlier if he thinks I'd be able for it, he's played rugby before and he plays it well, he's got a lot of experience, and he says that it would be pretty difficult because I need experience and the know how of the game, he said it wouldn't be impossible, it'd just take a while to get used to, or on the level of the other players, he told me it would take to up to a year to get used to it.

621,"\*If you can read it all, please do. If you can't, I understand. If you're a girl and have sisters even better.\*

We grew up in an abusive household. My older sister got it the most from our dad. My younger sister, later in life, had to take care of our mom and brothers, working 3 jobs and just holding down the fort while my mom dealt with her depression. Like a true middle child, I was ignored. I protected my sister from my dad, other than that I didn't get hit much. And I was in college when my mom lost her mind essentially. They know it and I know it--I didn't have it nearly as bad. And I feel guilty every. single. day.

But boy, did my sisters bully the fuck out of me. For my older sister, it was because my dad was abusing her and with my younger sister--she was just tagging along. The other day my younger sister (somewhat) apologized because she realized they treated me badly. My older sister (somewhat) apologized too, but I still say fuck it tbh. I'm coming to realize I never fit in with my family and have spent my entire life trying to prove to them I'm supposed to be there. Nothing major, I just always felt I was playing catch up.

Looks and academics are the only things my family had control over in our lives. We were poor and abused so there wasn't much else. My sisters were prettier than me and my older sister let me know that. My mom, though she wasn't really trying to, would treat them differently. And my relatives treated them better too. My sisters, even the younger one who came out as gay, get men left and right. I don't and we'll leave it at that. My mom (and my sisters--yes the gay one too) value attractiveness and men so much--they are priority. It's validating for them and my mom used to worry about me because she thought I never was going to date. I'm pretty--not as much as my sisters--but the way they treated me you would have thought I was Quasimoto. To make it seem better, they used to say I was going to be the most beautiful but I'm 23 and look pretty much the same and I feel like my mom is disappointed and my sisters relieved.

I've attacked both my sisters twice. My older sister because she just would not leave me alone. My other sister because she said something along the lines that I never suffered, I just sit there--and it pissed me off. I've only laid my hands on them when I have had enough. It's only happened those two times. I had really bad anger issues growing up but it was because they used to call me a beast, gorilla, and ogre, because I was the fattest and angriest lol and they'd exclude me a lot. My mom didn't like that I was self-conscious of my body and made little comments. She's a great mom but just didn't realize what she said. And because I was so angry and anti social they used to say I was just like my dad which was the worst insult because he was terrible. I wasn't angry I was just frustrated and sad.

Anyway, I was the first to graduate from college but I'm not that smart (I'm working on my work ethic though!). I was hospitalized my freshman year and it took them the rest of the 3 years to figure out I was bipolar. I spent those 3 years depressed and the last few months manic because some anti-anxiety meds triggered my first (that I know of) episode. My older sister has PTSD from my dad and my younger sister figured out she had bipolar disorder when she was taking care of our mom. But they are doing very well in their career and in life, and I feel like I don't have an excuse to be as far behind as I am. I live with my mom right now because I needed a break. The first year after college I was a mess --I also went off my medication for a while (won't do that again) so I did the right thing. I just feel like my family is always having to watch be struggle to stay above water.

Now, I am doing much better. I am stable, take my medication, am losing weight, and I am coming into my own, finally. I meditate and do yoga, I have structure in my life and am even thinking about going back to school for my masters. And as I shed my past, and as I come to terms with what I did during mania and depression (I did some terrible shit), and as I leave my bad work ethic and self hate in the dust, I am realizing how little self-worth I had in the first place (zero to quantify it). And a lot of my self-hate was based on things my family told me I was and what my sisters bullied me for. I'm realizing I need to take responsibility for myself but also that a lot of who I thought I was, mainly angry, wasn't really me--it was who I was forced to be.

My family is grossly dependent on each other. It's harmful tbh. I love my sisters and I wish them all the success in the world. The women in my family are *warriors* and I mean that in every sense of the word. Everything they receive and continue to receive they have worked hard for. But what's done has been done and though I'm 23 I don't want them in my life as friends and I want them to be distant as sisters. I never had trouble making friends. Couldn't keep them though. And I struggle showing love to others, even though at my core I'm a loving person and love intimacy--my family told me growing up that I was an angry beast--like all the time lol So my ideal situation is a strong support system of small friends a loving romantic partnership. I'm tired of feeling alone and I want to be able to recognize love, receive it, and return it. It would be a nice way to live haha.

I say all this to say--everyone in my family is doing better. Even me. We are healing and moving on from our poverty and abuse. So I'm beating a dead horse it seems. I want to make sure that I am making the right choice and not being reactionary. I don't want them around tbh but they are my sisters. I don't know who I am without them, sad to say. I fear I'll fail without them and that they'll be fine. I just don't know what to do or how to feel. I'm supposed to move in with my older sister in NY in January but she's gotten really bold and her personality sucks ass lol. She's on some hot girl summer shit and wants us to be bad bitches together--but I can't stand to be around her when she's like this, also we have different personalities. I'm not moving in with her--I'll figure it out. But it would be a slap in the face so I don't know how to tell my sisters that I'm through. I just need a break. How do I handle this? Am I being ridiculous?

TL;DR I need therapy, honestly. Should I try to heal alongside the same people who abused me?",26Sep2019,1
622,"I‚Äôm not going to go into the details of why this friendship is toxic and why I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her anymore, cause I doubt people will want to know all about a redditors personal life and also it‚Äôs a long story. 

In summary, being friends with this girl made me very depressed and anxious and at first I thought that I needed to lean on her for support, but eventually I realized she was behind my toxic feelings. She was mean to me and created so much drama that I‚Äôve never had with an ex or family member or anyone. It was exhausting trying to keep up with these fights. Normally my life is drama free, and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that she generated this drama which ultimately lead to my poor self esteem and depression, because she made ME feel like I was the bad friend. 

Anyways, I have a different friend who‚Äôs the best, I love her, we‚Äôve been friends way longer than the toxic friend. However, she‚Äôs still friends with the toxic girl, and now it‚Äôs creating an overlap in who gets to hangout with the good friend. So that‚Äôs issue #1.

Issue #2 is that I find myself almost constantly reliving our arguments and all of the red flags as to why this friendship isn‚Äôt healthy. There were so many times that out of the blue this toxic friend would text me and tell me how shitty of a person I am, and I would respond saying I‚Äôm sorry and asking how I can fix it. Now that I look back at those moments I wish I spoke up and told this girl that she can‚Äôt talk to me like that and she should look at herself for tearing a friend down to make herself seem better. 
A few months ago, after the millionth time of this girl telling me off, I finally told her that I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her, thanked her for the good times, but this friendship no longer serves me and it‚Äôs unhealthy. She never responded. 

I feel like I don‚Äôt have closure...there‚Äôs still stuff on my mind that I want to tell her wasn‚Äôt fair in the relationship, why I tried my best to be a good friend, why she was so mean to tell me off almost every day, why I was getting depressed. I want to finally have the chance to tell her off for once, kind of like getting revenge. 

How do I let go of these feelings of bitterness towards her? How can I find inner peace and let the toxicity go? Also, how do I stop getting jealous when I find out my good friend is hanging out with the toxic girl, how do I stop imaging them talking shit about me? 
I‚Äôm at a loss of this inner conflict. I just want this toxic friend out of my life peacefully.

632,"So basically my school tends to do this thing where they make only a few things pop up for my assignments one day (I go to an online school called k12. and they give me online assignments and online classes.)

Every single time I have a break throughout the hellscape that is my school I get worried the next day is gonna be horribly worse and I am going to have a mental breakdown and embarrass myself, My classes are confusing as well because the teacher uses annoying drawn out terms that they can't even explain correctly a lot so basically all I hear through the whole class is, ""Today class, we will be looking over (INSERT CONFUSING HELLISH WORD THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL TOPIC OF THE CLASS WHICH THEY HAVEN'T EXPLAINED AT ALL BUT TALK ABOUT IT NEARLY EVERY DAY INSTEAD OF TEACHING ME SOMETHING ACTUALLY USEFUL LIKE HOW TO PAY TAXES).""

633,"Hi could anyone help me with this situation? I just need some opinions about this because I'm really sad and I feel guilty.

My girlfriend (now ex), has just broken up with me because ""we are not compatible"". She means that we can't talk about politics or society without ending up in a trouble. Let me explain you and please tell me who of us is wrong.

First of all, she suffers of Borderline, bipolarity and depression which I can stand and understand, but she (maybe because of her mental illness) doesn't have the will to continue with the treatment properly. That is to say:  
\-She doesn't go to psychiatrist as often as she needs.  
\-She doesn't take the pills properly (for example, she forgets to do it, or takes a complete pill instead of a half because she is lazy).  
\-She doesn't eat healthy food at all (spaghetti every day because of the same... laziness)  
\-She sleeps around 11 hours a day which makes her live in a hurry the rest of the day and stressed)  
And of course all of these things make her completely unstable. And we don't live together so I can't take care of her all the time (which doesn't mean I didn't tried to help her... I always tell her what she needs to do to be good and lots of stuff...)

And, maybe because of her condition, she most of the time tries to impose her way of thinking about controversial topics without putting herself a filter. What I wanted to do is to stop talking about these topics because if I do not agree she gets mad at me. But now she feels I ""repress"" her. And I can talk about these topics with a normal person but she is a kind of extremist so that makes it impossible to agree with her most of the time. And that doesn't happen only to me, she has lost A LOT of friends because of her opinions.

640,"Okay, so this post requires some backstory - i will keep the whole thing as short as i can, apologies as it's still a bit long:

My dad is a fairly uptight, quick-to-anger, and often insensitive person -- however, he is very soft at heart and ultimately very understanding so long as you're trying your best and making smart choices.  He has been successful in his career and lives very comfortably. My aunt is extremely lax, kind of a space cadet, and hugely prideful. She lost her job in a series of layoffs right around 2000, and hasn't tried very hard to work since then (at this point she is past retirement age at 68yrs). She has never shown an ability to plan for herself or save money, and she refuses to sacrifice elements of her ludicrously luxurious life.

My dad and aunt are oil and water, and have a rough history -- that history was exacerbated by their respective inheritances, from which my family owns a beach house on the east coast and my aunt owns a multi-unit building in a quickly-developing area of downtown LA.  She currently rents all units in the building she owns (she lives in a very nice rental property in the valley), and despite the generous means this affords her she lives way, way beyond them.  This has led to my dad financially supporting her/bailing her out on multiple occasions throughout the years, including in instances where she would have oherwise lost the building entirely. 

Over time, my aunt's lifestyle has grown steadily more excessive and she nows finds herself without cash on-hand, and so wants to sell the building. She has talked about this for a couple years and we have presented ***every single possible argument*** and in as many ways (gentle, logical, stern, through third parties, etc etc etc) -- but she will not listen.

This week, her current tenant actually gave her an offer and she is likely to accept it (without researching market value, listing it publicly, seeing a financial planner - nothing). The finite amount she would net after taxes and fees would be *exponentially* less than if she kept the building and continued collecting profits from it. The reality is that she is not going to modify her lifestyle and when she inevitably runs out of money it will fall on myself, my siblings, and my parents to support her (my aunt is unmarried and has no children, and my dad is her only sibling) -- that is a huge financial burden, especially when the flipside is keeping the building and enabling her to live off of that for life. 

Additionally, it is unfair to my parents who have worked extremely hard to retire in comfort and without the mental, emotional, and financial stress of supporting my aunt (but they will never refuse her the support if she needs help). *Additionally* additionally, it squanders a major asset that could help secure and support the financial future of my siblings and I for the rest of our lives. It honestly hurts more than a little bit that she is so unwilling to live even a *reasonable* life that she would throw away such a huge asset and simply assume the rest of us will support her indefinitely.  

The bottom line is: **we need her not to sell this building**. *This is hail mary time*. my sister and i are fully prepared to do whatever we need to do, whether that means supplying her a monthly allowance, keeping it secret from our parents for the sake of her pride, letting her live in one of our apartments, reaching out to her friends, anything. At this point, we see it as a short-term investment for a long-term return, and an effort to protect our parents from the inevitable burden she will become.

***So, please, I need advice:***  how can we convince her not to do this?  has anyone had success with convincing an emotionally difficult, prideful family member?  are there other solutions we're just not thinking of?  is guilting her going too far? are we losing sight of decent values, or is this an understandable thing to fight for? 

&amp;#x200B;

***^(All of this said, I do understand a few couple very clearly:)***

*^(1.)* *^(This is a first-world problem through-and-through, and I get that. By sheer luck of the lottery of birth I am fortunate that no matter what happens with this building I will receive far more than the average person in inheritances from my parents. I recognize what a rare privilege this is and count myself extremely lucky.)*

*^(2. I understand that at the end of the day, she owns this building. It is hers to do with what she decides, and neither me, my sister, or my brother are in any way entitled to it.)*

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** my aunt wants to sell a valuable piece of real estate, essentially obligating me and my siblings + parents to financially support her through the end of her life and squandering the financial security the building would offer for my siblings and i in the future.",26Sep2019,1

Finding another job is impossible  because the job market is dead in this sorry country and she automatically gets rejected for even the most simple of jobs because of her surname (racism is very much alive here).

I think Germany is the best bet,because we can just drive there,and my mom has a friend there and he could give us a roof for a week or two.

What Im asking for,if I where to go to another country (probably Germany),how could a family of 3 (me,mom and grandma) survive?",26Sep2019,1
647,So I took some plan b after the common broke. I‚Äôm on birth control but I wanted to take extra precautions because I‚Äôm absolutely not ready for children.

He joined my math class two days ago, and had to sit in the third row (back). 

There was already someone who was supposed to sit next to me but hadn‚Äôt arrived.

The guy I like sat down next to me as the kid who was supposed to sit there was about to argue until he realized he could sit near the side of the room (better part.)

650,Okay so I know because I‚Äôm 18 everyone is going to tell me to just move out but its not that simple. My parents have always been over protective and at times verbally abusive towards me. My relationship with them really isn‚Äôt that great even though I‚Äôve always listened never really got in trouble and made a‚Äôs and b‚Äôs in school. From the time I could get a job or get ahead by taking college classes for free in high school my parents have sabotaged it. When I was about 17 I wanted to get a job and expressed this to my parents who told me I should just work for them and they didn‚Äôt want me getting a job unless it was at their store. The problem with this is to work for them I would have to drive an hour a day and only be able to work Friday and Saturday. Even now when I apply for jobs and get interviews and stuff they always find a way to make sure I cant go and I can only work for them. So I don‚Äôt have the funds to move out nor can I get a job while I‚Äôm living here so I have no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt really have any friends that live on their own nor do I have my own car so I feel completely trapped. I just started seeing someone and they‚Äôre already packing on the rules and I feel like I‚Äôm being suffocated and I really want to move out. I love my parents and they genuinely believe that this is how they‚Äôre supposed to raise me (they‚Äôre overly religious) so there‚Äôs nothing I can say that will change their minds and arguing just seems to dig a deeper hole. I feel so anxious and trapped I just break down into tears thinking about it and I have no idea what to do.,26Sep2019,1
651,"I have this printer for a short while. I decided to print some of my drawings on a thick paper of 300gsm. I put the thich paper in the tray and it worked perfectly. The printer had no problem printing on that paper. My gf saw the whole process and decided to continue the work for me. I thanked her and left to do something else. For whatever reason she decided to change the settings on the printer and it stoped accepting the  thick paper. It gives me an error to ""clean the paper tray"" and the paper is half in there but easy to get out. It prints on normal paper. She tried to reverse the settings back to what I had but it's still not working. We tried everything we found online to solve the problem. I think she ruined it by changing the settings. She thinks I was just lucky it worked when I first started printing on the thick paper and it actually doesn't work. What do I do? Why it worked the first time with no problems? Why it eats the paper but half way decides to refuse it? Did she ruined it for good and it will never print on that paper again? How is that possible?",26Sep2019,1

I am currently 19 and I still live at home, and I am leaving home at the start of December. I was working all summer doing construction but work dried up at the end of august and I was basically unemployed. I was looking for work and my father said I could work for him. I said yes and started working for him at the start of September and continued to do so until this week. Everyone was supposed to get paid on Friday however due to my hours at work not being logged I was told that I wouldn‚Äôt get paid that day. I was a bit annoyed because generally it‚Äôs not the job of the employee to log hours but I didn‚Äôt put up a stink and I said fine. However later that night I spoke to my dad and he said that he wanted to hold onto the money for me until I moved out. Now I see his position and I understand his reason for doing this but the fact of the matter is, I am 19 and I want to look after my own finances. It really annoys me that even though I have been working in some capacity since the age of 14 he still does not trust me to look after my own money. What is especially annoying is that I don‚Äôt have much of safety net built up. So basically I am just going to have to work for him for 2 straight months all while having no money to spend on myself. I don't particularly want to be stuck in my own home like some weird indentured servant so I want to confront him about it but he is a very irritable man and he does not respond well to criticism.

657,"I rent a room from a couple in their 60s, they just found out that he has an aggressive form of cancer and they're starting treatment immediately. Their adult son who lives abroad is flying home to stay with them. 

It's a large enough place that I often don't see my landlords for a week at a time as I use a separate kitchen and bathroom to them, but with their son home it might be more crowded, and if treatment doesn't go well I can imagine them wanting the place to themselves. 

I feel like I should offer to move out so they have the space to themselves as a family, but moving now would basically mean renting a grim room in a student flat, and as I'm in my mid-30s right now that sounds horrendous to me. I was planning to move out in the new year as I'll be free to get a full time job then and be able to afford something half-decent. 

So, do I offer to move out now before my landlord's health potentially deteriorates or wait until they ask me/things improve?

I'm a 15 year old male and I've decided I'd like to join a Rugby Club, the problem is I've never played it before, I've never played any sports before apart from boxing and that was like a year ago and I only did it for like half a year. I'm aware of the fact that I'll be completely out of my league, playing with and against people who've been doing it since they were probably 8 to 10 years old, something that also lowers my confidence is when I hear about professional Rugby Players who've been doing it since they were 8, I don't want to be a professional rugby player, but I'd like to know that I could if I pursued it properly. What I'm trying to say is that, I'm worried I'm going to be horrible compared to everyone else, I know I will be of course, but I feel like I'll always be horrible, I don't have the experience that the other players have and I don't have as much knowledge about the game, I've never even played in a Rugby Match before. I go to the gym a lot, three times a week, I could change my workout to better support my needs of doing Rugby, this won't be of much help I know, but it's a start. What else should I do on my own first, like in the way of training I mean, so that I'll be a little more ready for it when I join? Also am I right in thinking that I'll be shit compared to everyone else?

When I unbend my knee I feel a click, like something slid over something, and when that happens I soon after have aching pain on the outside of my knee. It got better for a couple days and the clicking was much more subtle but one morning I woke up and unbounded my knee and it clicked loud again and the pain came back. So I have hope it is able to heal since it felt better for a couple days but afraid my whole life I will continually agitate it and have it ache on me.

Walking around with this limp and pain makes me view life differently. It feels kinda gloomy, but I have the perspective of well this is life, I'm going to have to life with this forever and have more pain in the future when more complications arise.

663,"
so this guy and i have not been dating for very long at all. due to circumstances, the best choice was to move in together after only being together for a month. things weren't bad, though, we got along super well and we really liked each other. however, we argued a lot over him not understanding what it was to be in a relationship. he hasn't had much emotional experience with being a boyfriend, his longest relationship has been about 3 months while mine last for years. 

so fast forward to a few days ago, he told me he felt he wasn't being appreciated. i got super angry because all i've been doing was appreciate him and even he has admitted multiple times and apologized for not doing as much for me as i do for him. ive explained to him that i don't mind doing more for him emotionally just bc i've had more experience with it, but when he told me he felt i wasn't putting effort into the relationship, i couldn't believe it. i told him to drop me off at my mom's house and to leave me alone. after that he proceeded to go home, pack up my stuff, and drop it off on my mom's porch. 

it's important to note that my mom and i are not really on talking terms and he knew that. i had no idea if she was gonna let me move in with her, much less out of nowhere. now after all this happened and emotions had settled, i asked him why he did this. he said he felt as though it was the best thing to do at the moment. 

i truly don't know how to feel about this. i understand i may have yelled at him to leave me alone in a way he thought i wanted to never see him again, but maybe this seems a bit too drastic of a decision to forgive? i mean, he basically left me with nowhere to go, and left me along with all of my stuff outside while i waited for my mother to come home. my mom has let me move back in and i am stuck living in their storage room so at least it worked out and i'm not homeless, but should i keep this relationship going? thank y'all i really need some advice!",26Sep2019,1

I am finding it really hard that every single free moment outside of work is being met with friends/family asking me/my husband/baby to do something with them. Whether it's dinner, or a baby shower, or a weekend visit, or  ""I'm in town let's hang out!"" ... I just feel like it NEVER ENDS. I am finding that my husband/baby/me get so little time to just do what we want to do, either solo or together as a unit of three.

The tricky part is the ""Just say no!"" mantra is really challenging in this situation, because all of these people are really important to us. We have huge families and good friends. So it's not repeat offenders... it ends up being ""Well, we ought to go meet up with so-and-so, because we haven't seen them in ages anyway..."" and it turns into this checking-of-the-boxes feeling.

672,"I recently started a new job. At this company, they assign new hires a 'mentor' for the first year. They're usually someone who has been in the business for a few years or has many years of experience in their field. They're basically there to get new hires (especially graduates like myself) on their feet in a company, offer advice and support, etc.

I arranged on my own to meet mine last week. His body language seemed negative (no handshake, no nice to meet you, no goodbye, etc.) and generally dismissive from the beginning. I tried very hard to make a good impression but some of the things that he said really caught me off guard and made me stumble. 

We spoke for a while and he said things like:
- ""we've finished speaking to each other already and it's only been half an hour"" harsh? Especially to someone you've just met. 
-""we don't need to meet often, every two months would do. YOU need to be the one to organise this"" 
-""if there's no chemistry between us, then well..."" ??? 

I left the meeting feeling incredibly upset. I sometimes find it hard to speak to new people but have been making a lot of effort to improve. This really killed my confidence. 

The chemistry comment really put me off as I am female. I can understand what he may have been trying to say but it feels inappropriate. It really threw me off since this happened on my first week of working at the company. I also found out from others that the norm is every two weeks to a month for meeting mentors so it just feels like he doesn't want to be involved with me. 

Anyway, I was speaking to someone in HR (it was about something completely unrelated) and the conversation moved to how I was settling in. I mentioned my ordeal with my mentor and they reaffirmed that it will be something that they'll look into. I am not to meet with the mentor again and may have a new one assigned to me. 

I just started this job. I'm not the type to kick up a fuss but I felt like I had to saying something. I went through a lot of instances in high school where I didn't speak up when I felt like I was being mistreated. I've mentored before as well I don't feel like he should be in that position if that is how he welcomes new hires.

Im 24 and have recently started university; im already struggling.

I have a previous diagnoses of dyslexia and dyspraxia among other things, which affect mainly organisation, concentration, reading, and writing.  Although I've been asked to be reassessed for this as I am missing some key documents that they need, as a result, I'm currently not getting support.

The main issues I'm having are due to the way the course is organised, its split into several subjects, and each subject has it's own timetable, several subjects are split further into groups, each with their own timetables. On top of that, the rooms and lectures times are different each week and we've been told to check the website every morning incase of any changes... the website itself is it's own issue as well. Being very hard to navigate.

I'm terrible at organisation. It's the hardest thing for me. And the thought of somehow keeping track of all this makes me shake with panic. I spoke to a lecturer and was told I'd just get used to it; admittedly I didnt refute that as I felt shy.

There are other issues as well, like keeping track of assessments and everything. It's all on the difficult to navigate website, and usually not where they told us itd be, several links also dont work. I can barely remember all the things I'm supposed to be doing outside of class anyway which also means I cant focus on learning as I'm spending all my time keeping up. 

I haven't been able to find a system that works for me to keep track of everything and I'm really struggling.

I graduated this summer and moved out just two months ago. 19 y/o female, living with two other women in a flat.
Currently, I am really struggling to get my life together. It really feels like I had two life‚Äôs to be honest, one inside my flat and one outside of it. 
I barely make it out of the bed for days, rarely make it to shower or to buy groceries, feel unmotivated or sad a lot and I struggle with bad migraines. My background is a bit messed up and I have had these depression like issues before in high school. 
My room is a mess and, well, since I often don‚Äôt make it to the grocery store because this means leaving my room, I live of... eh. Not much. 
Mainly chocolate, I have had canned tuna and white rice for the past week. Fast food also, because I don‚Äôt have to cook for that. 
Despite the junk, I eat rather little of it in general. These aren‚Äôt huge binges. I have the habit of counting calories in my head, today it were maybe around 1400. I had dates and McDisgusting. It‚Äôs 10 pm and I am full.
I also have had anorexia-like behaviour already (I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying I had an eating disorder because it just wasn‚Äôt that bad, I think. On and off phases? For some weeks, then not at all for some more and then again.) 
I am also definitely not underweight, even tho I feel like I could lose some weight. I am 120,8lbs / 54,8 kilos and 5 foot 3 inch / 164 cm. So normal I assume? I think so.
I am actually really into powerlifting. This eventually wore off over the last months, but I made it to the gym yesterday again.

However, I have a lovely boyfriend and he doesn‚Äôt know about the issues I have with food. He does not need to know. He never noticed as well because I never lost any weight in these bad phases. It was just restricting and binging. So I always had a total of maybe 1300-1500 calories. We worked out yesterday together and he said, my stomach got thicker. Well, you have to know that he is a fine guy and I love him a lot. Have been with him for five years. Yet. Well. 
He was correct. 

I honestly don‚Äôt want to live off chocolate and fast foods anymore, I want to have real food and a proper amount of them so that I don‚Äôt gain any more fat. Fast food, especially McDisgusting, make me cough horribly because they somehow leave a kind of slime in my throat. It‚Äôs so bad and I don‚Äôt want it anymore, but I end up going there anyway. I also don‚Äôt want to sleep in a pile of dirty clothes anymore. But I also just can‚Äôt... get up and just do these things. 


Do you have ideas how I can fix this all? Thanks a lot and have a beautiful day!",26Sep2019,1

She's been home a few months now and her doctor is telling me her liver condition is regressing. We will have to wait for tests to see what medication can help her.

I feel like this is not good news and that she will die soon. I am absolutely terrified of losing my mother. I've been drinking a lot and feeling a lot of guilt. I struggle with depression. I lost my father two years ago and had a horrible time dealing with it and now my mom whom I am a lot closer with. I'm afraid I'll be suicidal if she passes. I hope she passes without pain or she thinks of euthanasia..which I believe they have here in Quebec.

687,"Hi, I'm 19 and the daughter of a very stubborn woman. I love her, I do, but what she does to me mentally makes me want to leave way more than I should.

I'm pretty introverted and have been for 11 years at least. I hate large crowds and would rather be inside all day, and I don't really have many real life friends. Most of my friends are online and much easier to talk to. Despite this, I'm generally a pretty happy person. I give people compliments even if I have social anxiety because I like to make others happy too. However, I'm always worried about being an annoyance to others.

I've been overweight for years and was bullied in elementary school for being that annoying, overweight kid that no one liked. All of my friends from these years ended up leaving me behind and moving on with their lives and I have a hard time keeping long term friends nowadays as I end relationships with people. My brother and sister are 9 and 7 years older than me and would bully me at home as well, for being the favorite child. 

She's sheltered me my whole life, spoiled me, and told me not to leave her when I got older. I had a dark time in my life in middle school where I catfished people online into thinking I was way older than I was, and beautiful. I ended up meeting up with a man 6 years older than me at age 12 who raped me. I loved getting attention online, as there I felt loved and needed by everyone I met and was generally popular. My family lost all trust in me and I still struggle today to make up for mistakes I made years ago and regret. 

I'm pretty sure I've had depression for years. While not diagnosed with depression persay, I take depression medications and have many symptoms of it. I feel it's easier to be depressed and I would rather live my life in a shell than deal with my emotions. I have a wonderful boyfriend of nearly 3 years whom I love and would do anything for, as he makes everything worth it to me.

Anytime I'm upset, I run to him. He comforts me and I end up feeling a lot better. I avoid letting my mom know how I feel because anytime I do, she tends to invalidate my feelings over anything. I understand that I'm a pretty sensitive person and she's very emotionally strong and I get upset over the dumbest things, but even if it's not a dumb thing to be upset about she still invalidates my emotions. It's become a real problem. I tell her that I'm depressed and she tells me that I'm always happy so how could I be? She also tells me that I'm just experiencing teenage emotions, thus invalidating me again and making me feel stupid. 

It's awful. She wants to be there for me but just tells me I'm wrong any time I want to talk. I hide my emotions from her and she's really nosy about them, always asking me what's wrong when I don't want to talk about it. When I tell her that she doesn't help me feel any better, she blows up in my face. Every time this happens I dream of moving away from her and being on my own but it's so hard to do when I'm depressed and have no motivation to learn to drive or get a job and I've always been sheltered and never expected to do anything for myself. She wants me to always be close by, but my boyfriend is long distance so we'll have to move at least 2 hours away for the compromise of being halfway between each of our families. It's frustrating and I feel like I'm stuck in an endless loop. 

What do I do?",26Sep2019,1

694,"Hey everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this. So here's my story, and this isn't about my friend, but rather an ex-bandmate. I wanted to leave that out of the title so as to not draw any specific immediate attention. 

So, my ex-bandmate (Let's call him T) has anger issues and a history of physical abuse. In the early formative years of our band, T attacked two other members of our group... in both cases T was getting in drunken fights that were fueled by anger and not simple 'rough-housing'. This was a terrible sign and startled us, but after some resolutions were made, my bandmates and I were confident that our music and fellowship might help heal his disturbed past and inner demons. The band eventually lived together and performed all over our metroplex + out of state. During that time, women would often approach me after shows saying he 'creeped them out' and 'said creepy things to them'. Most of this was unfortunately taken quite lightly as the band knew his flirting approach was very forward, but never anything serious had come of it so most of these concerns were brushed aside while we assured these women that it was okay and there was nothing to worry about (however, we would also explicitly state that if anything happened they could reach out to us and that we would immediately help). Fast-forward another year or so and I get a call at 3am from T's girlfriend at the time. She was quite frightened and had called another bandmate of mine saying T had attacked/shoved her and that she feared for her life. His side of the story avoided the blame and redirected the narrative... after conversations between all parties over a few weeks the girlfriend was no longer interested in pursuing the conflict and  the issue was lost. There were other incidents afterwords as well, for example there was a party where T threatened and kicked out several guests form his room... and so on and so on.  Mind you, this gentleman was never easy to work with musically and had quite the temper. Then came the night when he attacked me. I was the last member of the band to be physically assaulted by T, as I had always been the mediator and calmed him down in these very heated and aggressive moods. Luckily, I was okay after this incident and he apologized. I accepted his apology and we moved on. However, it was at this point when everything changed and began to fall apart. I was admittedly somewhat fearful of him, or rather distrustful of him from then on. Living under the same roof as T was uneasy and slowly eroded the entire relationship of the band. When we signed management only half the band was ever at the meetings. We hardly ever hung out together or did anything together other than play the shows and go home. Finally, we all moved out and went our separate ways. It was unspoken, but the band disassembled and we each began pursuing new creative avenues. Although, it kind of makes me sick seeing T out in the scene now... basically getting away with all of this because I could never speak on it when I lived with him. I legitimately feared my own well-being speaking out and still do living in the same town. I feel guilty and partially responsible for never having said anything.  You would think that people know this about him, but they don't. Only a few people really know about this dark past and behavioral issues. I just don't know who to tell about this or what to do. It really does hurt me when I think about all of this and I feel like it's my fault and then I just think maybe I should let it go? Or maybe should I take a stand? If so, how? Getting away from him to protect myself was the first move, but now I just don't know if there's anything I can or should do. I'm posting this to get the story out of me and just reflect it onto someone else. I just don't know what to think about it all anymore and now that some time has past I really felt the need to open up. Thank you for listening.

700,"Hey everyone - using a throwaway bc my first account has good clues about who I am, so just in case.

So, I live in a family where certain members have always expected good grades and eventually getting a degree; I've been in college for 4 years now (the 4th one something like a gap year, no classes but taking the exams that are left from the previous years) and it's been pretty rough. I've been feeling unmotivated and having difficulties concentrating and studying and finding the will for it all, and it all culminated very recently when I found out that due to some rules and my (lack of) success so far, I'm pretty much getting kicked out of college. Yet, there is one way that I could stay, but it would require something that is pretty improbable of happening, plus it would be on a very tight time frame.  
Now, I've had quite a few ups and downs with education so far, and those before mentioned family members hadn't taken it well, and I'm guessing they won't be keen on me not being in college anymore.

But my mental health has been wasting away lately (something I've always and still hide completely from my family) and I have a passion in writing that I want to pursue to the point of trying to make it a career, which all makes focusing on college very challenging.

So now I'm stuck between trying to plead my way to stay in college and dropping out, finding a job (which will be difficult) and pursuing my passion in my spare time, but most likely facing pretty severe backlash from family members.

706,"I‚Äôm at a turning point of my life and I don‚Äôt know if I still can keep everything for myself.

What are my issues ? First I‚Äôve always been introvert, keeping things inside, avoiding to complain. I have a difficult relationship with my family. It‚Äôs not that bad, but I feel like I prefer to be far away from them. Moreover my mom‚Äôs cancer just added another issue. About my friends, I just see less of them. Actually I‚Äôm more and more disappointed. They all have social media so they think they‚Äôre social, but when something happen they don‚Äôt remember you. Most of them are just here for good moments, to have fun. Even my close friends are sometimes disappointing me. Maybe I‚Äôm too sensitive, but when people don‚Äôt text you at your birthday, Christmas, when there‚Äôs an accident next to your home, I feel really alone. Maybe it‚Äôs typical of my generation : selfishness and superficiality. However, despite that, I still see them or become attached to some people. Nevertheless I also more and more like to be alone, I‚Äôm becoming more and more misanthropic. I‚Äôm not on social media, I don‚Äôt go to parties, I don‚Äôt hang out that much, etc... The few activities I have I do them in order to meet someone. I hope that I could meet a lover, a best friend. Since I ended high school, I‚Äôve started to stop believing in making friends. Actually most of them just move far away and I don‚Äôt have any news. I would have pleasure to see them again, but it would just be for a drink. I don‚Äôt like students‚Äô life, I don‚Äôt like students‚Äô mentality. I have this feeling that they got more immature because now they are ¬´¬†adults¬†¬ª and have no parents around them. Personally, in addition to my other issues, I‚Äôve started my studies with a mistake. After being a brilliant student who could have many things, I chose the wrong formation, one very tough, where I had bad marks, low sleep and assholes as teachers. In addition to saying I‚Äôm too strict with myself, not enough confident, some people say I‚Äôm too mature. Sure, compared to student, I‚Äôm wise : I don‚Äôt drink that much (just beer sometimes), I don‚Äôt fuck (I‚Äôve never been with anyone), etc... In fact this last point wasn‚Äôt troubling me that much until I understood my differences with others and I got infatuated with a girl I don‚Äôt know (yes people made fun of me). She partially motivated me to invest myself in an association and I thought I could meet someone like her. However, at some point, most people just disappoint me. I‚Äôm really starting to be more and more alone, not physically (even if it‚Äôs often), but especially mentally. I don‚Äôt see it as a problem but most people around me do. There‚Äôs a split between me and the others : I‚Äôm waiting more of human relationships now and I think people accept things they shouldn‚Äôt.

Why don‚Äôt I talk about them to others ? Because I don‚Äôt trust anybody and I‚Äôm disappointing by them. My parents don‚Äôt listen to me and all the times I trust them, I‚Äôm disappointed. My friends aren‚Äôt that helpful too. Sometimes I felt like ¬´¬†I should talk about it, maybe I‚Äôll get better, maybe they‚Äôll understand me¬†¬ª, but it takes me some minutes to understand that it was a mistake. Because people don‚Äôt understand me or laugh. I think that‚Äôs why I just want a lover. However when I see what people describe, how people act, I just think I‚Äôll not find anyone. People think I‚Äôm too hung-up or I have too much values, but I‚Äôm just looking for something sincere that will give me a true love.

Finally I just feel like I‚Äôve anybody to talk and it‚Äôs exhausting to only talk about serious topic with myself. I‚Äôm also afraid about having a double face : a nice and cool guy outside, but a pessimistic and misanthropic guy who doesn‚Äôt want to see anybody inside. That‚Äôs why I was thinking that I may need to see someone, a therapist. Nevertheless I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm afraid to admit it and I don‚Äôt know what I should look for, how to start. Today I‚Äôve started a new formation in a new city. It‚Äôs probably the best time to get a new start and I‚Äôll try to be humble enough to understand that I may need help to have the best start as possible. Thus, what should I do ? Did you have a similar experience ?",26Sep2019,3

710,"I'm in my first manager role and since I started, I noticed that being a manager is not simply a step up in your career path, it is more a 'you start from scratch again'.

If someone is pissed off, I bear it constantly in my head, i can't stop thinking about it, start to regret my decision, and start crying as soon as I'm out of the office. I can't sleep, i can't stop thinking that i did something wrong and take everything very personal. 

Fact is, I know I can't please everybody and I know that it simply belongs to my job to deal with unpleasant situations. I know about this but I can't just tell myself to start giving a f...  when I'm faced with this kind of situations. 

I had a very horrible one today in which I had to totally disappoint my manager and created negativity within the team. My hands were bound as command came from upper management. I had a total nervous breakdown a couple hours ago and still feel bad. 

I hope there is someone out there who has an advice how I can change my way of thinking as I'm quite desperate.",26Sep2019,1

I'm 22 and on my last year of college and I went to this interview at a fancy bussines firm because my parents made me. I went tinking they wouldn't hire me, but they actually did, it was about a month ago...and I accepted knowing I had a month to think about it. And I still haven't changed my mind, I don't want to work there. I hate everything about that job, I just want to cry when I think about going there.
My problem is that everytime I try to tell my parents I don't want to go it turns into this big drama fight. They are genuinely great parents, they are paying for my school and I know that they want the best for me. I know all that. And this is really a great opportunity I am aware but it's just not for me. I am extremely introverted and I hate socializing and this is the tipe of company where everything is in teams and there are all this annoying ass young people socializing and they go on team building trips and I just can't handle all of that.

715,"So a bit of background. I don't often get hungover, however booze gives me insomnia like nothing else. My hangovers are just being really tired, frustrated and pissed off that I can't nap no matter how hard I try. After a night out, i'll go to sleep pretty late but will only be able to get 3 hours at best.

So I'm going to a indoor one-day metal festival in another city next month, it's my 7th year going. The festival usually has the most amazing pre-gig the night before and my friends (who i'm staying with) are planning to go to that too. The problem is, whenever I've gone to the pre-gig in previous years I'm always a tired, crabby mess for the actual festival itself.

I know a lot of you are probably thinking *""then just don't drink!""* but that's wishful thinking. I'll be at a gig, with my friends, surrounded by booze, I'm going to drink even if I plan not to. I don't have much self-control, I like to have a good time and go a bit crazy.

So after the pre-gig, I will need to sleep as soon as I get back to my friends place at midnight in order to enjoy the festival the next day. I can usually sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow, but only as long as I haven't been drinking so I'm trying to think of what will help.

I have codeine which I only use when I'm in severe pain with my chronic illness, which is occasional because I don't like that it knocks me out. Is that safe to take after drinking?

I sometimes take night nurse when i need to sleep, but it contains something that reacts badly with MDMA and I may or may not be taking it at the festival... I don't plan to, but I run into people who offer me it a lot.

So any tips on what I can take to get to sleep? Not going the pre-gig or not drinking aren't realistic options.",26Sep2019,1
716,"I have a chronic illness. Having discussed this with another girl on discord server with a girl who also has a chronic illness she told me she was thinking of making a support server and asked if I'd help by being a mod. 

A few weeks after setting it up she started getting bad headaches and feeling crappy and took some time off. I was obviously supported and told her to take all the time she needs. She came back sparodically and I said I'd found a regular to be an extra mod during the hours I can't be around, she said that's fine but she needs to do some stuff first. I gave my input, let her know I'd be going back to work soon so I'd have to scale back and received no response. 

It's been over two weeks now, I've messaged a few times. I don't have the perms to set up a new mod and know nothing about bot stuff. The server is verification only, so I often miss people entering the server and getting them verified quickly. I have a lot going on rn. 

I know she put a lot of effort into this server. But so have I and two weeks is a long time to leave someone hanging. I'm starting to feel a little resentful because I know she's been somewhat active in other servers. I wouldn't mind if there was a little more communication or freedom for me to improve things, but right now I'm basically doing a lot of admin but the server is still crumbling because I can't do it all alone. The worst part is that she knows I was trying to scale back on discord usage almost entirely and I made it clear there would need to be other mods. 

Is it unreasonable for me to basically just stop doing stuff in the server? I know she's not doing great right now but I feel it's the last thing on her mind. As it's very small right now so I wouldn't exactly be throwing away a thriving community.",26Sep2019,1

718,"Backstory: 
My friend, ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù has been with her husband, ‚ÄúSean‚Äù for 8 years. They got married last year, and things have been fine for them until about 3 months ago. Sean started acting weird and distant and picking fights with Sarah. She started to feel insecure about their marriage, and would question where he was//who he was with// what he was doing all the time. He would get really irritated, but overall, they were still okay.
About a week ago, Sean told her that he wasn‚Äôt sure about them anymore. He told her that he wanted space, she was too overbearing, and he wanted to move out. He didn‚Äôt want a divorce, he just needed space.
She was devastated and begged him to stay. She didn‚Äôt eat for 4 days, lost 15 pounds, and barely slept.  He told her they could try to work on it, but he needed his space. He stayed at the house, but didn‚Äôt sleep in their room. 
Over that weekend, they went out and had dinner, saw a movie, and seemed to be working on things. That Monday, he went to work, came home, and seemed anxious. 
Tuesday, he went to work, and barely spoke to her. When he got home, she asked him why he seemed to revert back to being unsure about them all of a sudden. He said she was ‚Äúobsessed with him and still not giving him space.‚Äù She had barely spoken to him in that week, and never questioned where he was.
Last night he called her, crying. He told her that he needed to tell her something and ‚Äúit was a mistake, she was going to leave him.‚Äù
Ultimately, Sarah found out Sean had been sleeping with her best friend Makayla for 2 months. When Sarah‚Äôs grandpa died, she went out of town to the funeral and he didn‚Äôt go. He brought Makayla to Sarah‚Äôs PARENTS HOUSE and had sex with her.
Sean told Sarah every detail about his affair. He slept with her 12 times in 2 months, including the previous Monday, where he slept with Makayla and came home 2 hours later and slept with Sarah. 
Makayla is also married. Sean, Sarah, Makayla and her husband Jeffrey all hang out and go on double dates. They‚Äôre very close. Sean and Makayla also had sex at Jeff‚Äôs house while he was in the hospital with his dad.
Today, Sarah hasn‚Äôt spoken much to Sean, but she is completely still in love with him and wants their marriage to work. He has told her he needs time away from her and they need to be apart for a while. She asked if he still loved her, he said he didn‚Äôt know. 

Here‚Äôs what I need advice with:
-How do I tell Sarah that Sean is only using her for a place to live (he has nowhere to go and the house is hers)
-Jeff still doesn‚Äôt know. Sarah doesn‚Äôt want to tell him, but isn‚Äôt it unfair that he doesn‚Äôt know? Shouldn‚Äôt she tell him?
-Sarah can‚Äôt eat or sleep and is making herself physically ill, all in hopes he will change. He told her he knows he isn‚Äôt the man she married and she deserves better, but is staying at the house. 
-Sean also told Sarah that he loves Makayla. 

How do I help my friend? I don‚Äôt want her to suffer.",26Sep2019,1

720,I‚Äôve been in love with my best friend since the first moment I saw her. It was the first day of college Spanish class and I sat in front of her. I didn‚Äôt see her when she came in and just stared down at my notebook before the teacher walked in. We did a class activity and after it was over we started to pack up to leave. I over heard a conversation that a disabled student had with her. She was thanking her for her patience and kindness. In that moment I knew I had to be friends with her I knew I needed her in my life. When I turned around to see her I was speechless. She was the most beautiful person I‚Äôd ever seen in my life. We didn‚Äôt become friends until a few months after and have continued to be very good friends for the past 5yrs. I‚Äôm still madly in love with her but I can feel her pulling away.

721,"So lets start of. In elementary school there was that girl.She was always cheerful and wanted to hang out with me. (especially me). However, i didn't may much attention to her. I always shunned her. Until the last 2 weeks of the school. I began to develop romantic feelings towards her and fell in love with her. She lives a bit far from my place and she didn't have a phone back then (also her parents didnt let her continue education). I was heartbroken when i learned she wont be continuing her education. I called her phone number and said i was her friend. Spoilers: She got beat up, her parents thought i was her Boyfriend. Also everybody kept spreading rumors that i am in love with her because she always hung by me. She told one of my friends that she hates me because i ""told"" everyone that i am in love with her.

Now after like 6 years i found out she has Instagram. I sent her request she accepted and followed me back. I also sent her a message asking how she is and all that but she didn't answer (doesnt even say that it is ""seen"" so prob deleted it).

I don't know what to do. I simply cant forget her. Should i ""accidentally"" meet her somewhere and apologise to her or what should i do?",26Sep2019,2

723,"So, yeah. I am 22F. I had a sexual and romantic relationship with my art teacher in my junior and senior years. During my senior year, he cheated on me with one of his recently graduated students. That was in 2015/2016.

 One of his friends recently informed me that he was having sex with another one of his recently graduated students last year, ie, immediately after she graduated he was offering her marijuana and alcohol and having sex with her. 

Im genuinely concerned that he is offering to be ""friends"" with his students before or after graduation, when in actuality he is giving them drugs and alcohol with the intent to have sex with them. He attempts to build friendships while they are still his students, and that is why i think he is grooming them.

 If they did an investigation, they would be able to prove he was in a sexual relationship with me when I was a minor. He introduced me to his friends and family under a fake name when i was 17, and we lied and said I was 19. His family all think i am aged 24 when in actuality I am 22.

After finding about the 3rd student of his, I cut all contact with him. I had tried to convince myself that maybe it was a one-off, but it genuinely seems as though he just stays under the radar just long enough to get the heat off him. They have investigated before, but they contacted my parents who were unaware of the ordeal so they had nothing to say.

Have I waited too long to report him? Three students, just that I know of, looks like a serious pattern to me and I dont want him to put any more minors through the turmoil he has caused me. Im unsure if the other two girls are willing to talk, though his friends were aware of their sexual conduct immediately following her graduation with one of the girls. 

I am willing to, but I graduated 3 going on 4 years ago. If they questioned his family, they would reveal that he became involved with me 5 years ago. But I dont know if its too late.

Lots of parents have reported him over the last 5 years and he always manages to slip away from it all.

 I know for a fact he is very manipulative and good about hiding his activities. Prior to becoming a teacher, he stole approximately $3000 from his previous employer, represented himself in court, and won. He was able to get the charge expunged. 

Prior to that incident, he transported disabled people to their doctors meetings and family meetings. He lost his job while he drove a disabled person under the influence of LSD. He claims his employer somehow ""made it go away"", but is very boisterous about getting off scott-free on both of these instances. 

He claims that talking to the highschoolers is his social life. He is 35 years old. His behaviour is repeatedly concerning, and he consistently has sexual relations with his former students immediately after graduation every 1-2 years since he has began teaching. I dont know what to do but I feel like something has to be done.",26Sep2019,2

       My second option is to go to the University of Arkansas. This is where my girlfriend is going to go, and it would absolutely kill me to lose her when we are in such a good place and talk about our future all the time, etc. I have also visited arkansas and it looked like a great school for me as well. Arkansas would be about 3-4k more per year, and while i can still afford it, it is still such a huge factor.

My heart tells me to pick arkansas and my head tells me to pick tech.

Well the past few days I have been increasingly energetic to depressed. Fast forward to now I am extremely energetic. A few hours ago it started happening where I couldn't sit still.

738,"Hey guys! 

A bit of a backstory about what happened. I graduated early from a prestigious high school, and went to the USMC. I went so early and ended up getting ESL (early separation leave). The contents of my DD-214 are as directly reiterated, ‚Äúdischarged due to anxiety and ADHD, Senior DI informed us that his hand shook sometimes and may put his life and others in danger‚Äù and throughout that time, it was actually due to dehydration, and my SDI knew this when I spoke to him. I am not even 20 yet and want to give it another shot, but in the back of my mind, I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. Also if you are curious the code to make it easier, it is an RE-3P. Which i know requires a waiver to be able to rejoin, also it‚Äôs not the USMC again, it‚Äôs the army if that makes a difference at all. I have to most likely get a note from my doctor, and my medical history is clean, no diagnosis outside of boot camp declaring I have anxiety. So how hard would it be if I were to get a note saying ‚Äúno signs of this disorder‚Äù. Also I work full time and if this doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm going to college next semester (couldn‚Äôt start yet due to not taking any standardized tests and have already done it now).

748,"A few years back (4 I think) my mom, brother, pets and I moved to Texas to be closer to my Grandfather (Gf). When we got down there I was still considered too young to know anything. My Gf convinced my mom to move to this house next to his. His house was large and very nice as he had a high paying job. his house was not in a very good area though, as there was a trailer park across the street, it was separated by a fence and small line of trees. My Gf didn't live in his house alone though. He lived with this married couple that had fallen on hard times and let them stay with him until they got on their feet. The problem was they had fallen on hard times years ago. They ended up taking over the house leaving my Gf only his Master bedroom. the wife commonly babysat kids in that house and would put any money they saved up towards buying the rest of this ugly bathroom set and other useless items. They were taking advantage of him.

During the last 4ish my family has been working to make our life better, despite being fairly poor (about 20,000 a year). during those that time my Gf; lost his job, lost his house, got a DWI, lost his truck and lost the van we let him borrow him. I should also note that within those years my uncle had a stroke, started living with my Gf and died.

We have tried to support my Gf my giving him a place to stay, let him use the mobile home on our property, Offering to give him rides, Help pay for some of his finances, among other things. The mobile home is trashed inside and out. he takes no self-care like showers and refuses to eat anything close to healthy, We can't even get him to get a job. Every time he calls us it's to go buy him things and tells us he needs more of our things. since he doesn't have a job he can't pay for electricity and has extention cords running from our house to his. and Despite his lack of contribution to our family, my mom refuses to do anything about him!

I'm sixteen now and have my license. I have a part-time job as well as going to school. our finances our mostly paid through my mom's and brother's jobs. To make matters worse, practically my whole family is depressed and I don't know what to do.

How do I get my Gf to get a job? If I can't, what are steps I can take to help my family start getting on its feet so my brother and I can go to college? Is it wrong to want to evict my Grandfather?",26Sep2019,1

753,"sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. 

i‚Äôm currently very drunk. i‚Äôm f and a young girl. i know that most people will assume that anything that you go through at a young age is just overly dramatic, but as i have depression and anxiety on top of this, i‚Äôm truly being consumed by it. I cant even begin to explain how much this has taken over my body, literally physical pain  from being so sad. 

I talked to a guy online for over a year. we were basically acting as girlfriend and boyfriend for the whole time. I knew that I probably wasn‚Äôt the only one, and i knew i definitely wasn‚Äôt his actual girlfriend. but recently i told him that whatever we were was over. he did something that showed that he was stringing me along the whole time, even though deep down i know he did really like me. 

ever since then i‚Äôve been a mess. I went through the whole ‚Äúmiss me now i‚Äôm gone‚Äù phase but i can only pretend that i don‚Äôt need him for so long before it starts to take over me again. we did meet up once and it was just so amazing and that‚Äôs whats killing me inside. it was like a taste of what could have been. i felt genuinely safe for the first time in my life. even though he did something shitty, I ended up messaging him again just so I could talk to him. I genuinely cannot live without him it feels like. I would get drunk, message him, regret it, tell him I loved him, then ghost and act like i‚Äôm over him, then the cycle continues. it‚Äôs been like this for nearly 3 months. i wake up every morning and cry as I walk my way to college as it reminds me of the day i met up with him. I know how fucking embarrassing and sad that sounds but i just don‚Äôt care anymore. 

this is affecting my work, education and everyday life. i cant remember a morning where i didn‚Äôt cry on my way to school or a night i didn‚Äôt cry myself to sleep. it feels like i‚Äôll never meet someone like him again. 

i know people say it will pass, but will it really? i have no idea on how to get over this. i truly truly hate myself for messaging him but i just cant live without him and having him talk to me. if anyone could give me advice on how to deal with this i‚Äôd be so so grateful.",26Sep2019,1
754,"I have this weird problem where I often feel like nobody likes me. It's something I've struggled with since the beginning of high school (I'm a sophomore in college now) and I don't know what to do about it. Whenever I find myself in a troubled place mentally, this is mainly where my mental health problems stem from. For some reason I feel like the world is against me and it induces these feelings of depression and anxiety.

Well, let me reword that. It's not that me thinking nobody likes me *makes* me depressed, it's more like, whenever I am *already* depressed or anxious, that's when I feel this way.

I'm an overall **very** sensitive person, I have been since birth. I take everything people say to heart and it's difficult for me to take a joke, even if I know that person is just joking. I don't know if my sensitivity has anything to do with it but when I look at who I am as a person I feel like when people think of me they say to themselves ""I can't stand that kid"", ""he's weird"", etc.

I know the simple solution is to just not give a fuck what people think about me, but that's easier said than done. Over the years I've gotten a lot better at not giving two shits what people think of me, because trust me, this used to be **a lot** worse. But the fact that I have felt this way for so long (and still do from time to time) makes me concerned. How can I get over this feeling?

P.S. I do have a lot of friends if I'm going to be honest. There's really no reason for me to be thinking this way at all. It's as if it's just the way my brain is wired. Does anybody have any advice as to what I can do about this?",26Sep2019,1

760,"Context: I was waiting at a street corner bus stop when an older guy asked to use my phone to make a call. I didn't see an issue with it. He makes the call, it takes 20 seconds and sounds legit, then he hangs up and thanks me. No worries.

However, everything that happened after it was suspicious. I wait for the bus again and look back. He's asking another dude to use his phone. He does it, same quick call, then hangs up and thanks him. I approached this old dude asking why he needed to make another call with someone else's phone. He said he forgot he had to call his wife, too.

I get on my bus and he hides behind a building stanchion - my guess is so I can't take a picture. My bus leaves and he immediately comes back out from behind the stanchion.

I called the cops to report suspicious activity. I haven't heard back from them. I'm guessing at this point I won't. It happened about an hour and a half to two hours ago from the time of this post.

No b.s., please: Do I have anything to worry about in regard to my phone? Is there anything he could do with my number that I ought to be concerned about? I just don't get it.

At 19 I bought a luxury car with a lot of miles for around 16k with a 6 year car loan at 6.3% interest. Even better it's probably not even worth 9k now.

So I have 2 friends, CR and YM. I've known them both for the same amount of them, and we're in marching band together (met at camp).

 During band camp, I had noticed YM was very attached to CR. At first I just thought they were very close (they had known each other for 4 yrs prior) but after band camp ends and classes start, YM eventually tells me that her and CR used to date on and off for 3 years, but they never told ANYONE bc CR'S parents have a restraining order against YM (I'm not sure why). They were both extremely secretive about it. 

They broke up some time before band camp because YM had mentioned that she told someone abt their relationship, and CR freaked out because she didn't want anyone to know. As YM is telling me all of this, she mentions the whole reason she was in band camp/is in marching band is for CR, as YM wants to spend more time w CR without angering CR's parents. CR has shown no emotion whatsoever to YM throughout band or classes. YM is still very much in love with CR, and wants to get back together. I told her CR is probably over YM, and that she should try to move on. She ignored me. Some time passes, and everyday, YM is extremely clingy to CR, and I can tell CR gets very uncomfortable because of this. 

CR and I were hanging out one day, and I mention that YM seems to really like her. She looks at me like I'm crazy and says she doesn't. Fast forward, we're talking again and because of the affection YM constantly shows, I tell CR she definitely likes her, and that it's extremely obvious, and CR tells me about a separate crush and how she doesn't want to tell YM that she doesn't have feelings for her, as YM IS going through a lot mentally. I decide not to push it any further, as she was upset while taking about it. 

While hanging out, I find out that YM wanted to confess to CR, but she was having doubts and was scared of pushing her away. I tell to her face that she should not torture herself anymore, and that she should leave CR alone and move on, as it's hurting both of them very much. She brushes me off again. To this day, YM still very fiercely shows affection to CR, and everyday I see CR extremely uncomfortable, but too scared to tell YM she doesn't like her anymore. 

Should I tell YM that CR doesn't have feelings for her anymore? CR is too scared to tell YM herself, and just leads her on continuously. It kills me to see CR so uncomfortable, and YM so full of empty hope that they'll get back together. I desperately want to leave it to them, but it's painful to watch them everyday.

In short, a girl and I were together for over a year. I moved 12 hours away to live with her. I lived there for right over a year, and in the end, she wanted to try one last chance to work things out with her ex-husband, and I had to leave. I drove back with dollars to my name and moved back home in my parent's house because I was in so much credit card/car/medical debt that I was paying out of savings that were draining rapidly (I had1.5 months of money left). I tried for loans to avoid bankruptcy and denied across the board. I managed to find an excellent job after about a month of joblessness not for lack of applying but for lack of being able to get a job. So my new job was going to pay me enough to tread water. I would pay my medical/credit card/and car. I couldn't afford a place to live, but that was okay because at least I would avoid bankruptcy. So during this time, she is living her own life, but I'm still there for her. I listen to her about her ex, the people and things she is doing, and her life. I tried to take on as much as I could to help her because I love her. So this year from oct to oct has gone by, and I've not talked to anyone else. I've worked, went home, tried to build up my nest, and saw some friends now and then though it is crippling with anxiety. With the new job and some help, I was able to get a loan and get all my debts into one thing that I can manage, and I got some medical help for depression. Things got better for me. I was able to buy some stuff for myself, and I was able to start saving money, I was able to pay my debts. Still couldn't quite get a place but it was getting better. So in that same year, I've been here for her we expressed that we wanted to be together, but she always had someone at the moment, or I expressed that I was still hurt from our last actual relationship cause I am.

	So now, now we are talking again, and she asked about the future and expressed her desire to travel to leave where she is and have a bold, adventurous life. My work is going to pay for college, and I want to finish my education and grow and pay down some of that debt. It will realistically be years before I have that paid down, there is so much. But she wants to go within the year. I can't finish school in the year, and I can't pay even one of my debts off within a year if I devoted 100 percent of my salary. I am treading water, but I'm no longer drowning, I love this girl, and I want her happy. I don't want to jump and fail again.

776,"We had this discussion some time ago and I have tried to be as supportive as I know how to be, but I can see our relationship dying. Since we had our first talk, things escalated quickly and they dressed as the opposite gender in front of me openly.

I think I may have made them uncomfortable, because it didnt last long and now they only do it when I'm not around.

Our sex life was quite good right after the discussion until certain things were introduced that I am not into, but I did try to be into it at least. After that, our sex life faded and I started noticing signs of them masturbating while I was out of town. Our relationship was void of sex for the most part, except their obvious solo expeditions while I was gone.

We discussed it and got back on track for a short period and it started happening all over again. So I expressed to put more of an effort into hiding it, so I would not get upset. But also put more effort into us, so I didnt feel bereft. This helped briefly and we are at a low point again after a year of this cycle. 

Haven't had intimacy in over a month, despite even vacationing to get away from our daily grinds. We didnt even hold each other at night or have a date night (we were vacationing with family).

I got curious the other day and went snooping. I am not prone to this behavior, but I made an exception. I found basically a loot box with kinkwear and new toys I had never seen before. I brought this up to them and we had a long discussion.

It was revealed to me that they have an online account and have been talking to other cross dressers. It was alluded that there are pictures and the conversation goes only as far as talking about their struggles and complementing each others looks. 

I feel very uneasy about this entire situation. We have been together for 4 years and engaged for the last year and a half. I feel like they are not being truthful about a lot of things with me and maybe themselves. I am worried they are confused with the love they feel for me and the double life they are leading while I'm not looking. I think they prefer the other life and not their hetero one, but they feel that they cannot be free to be who they want and possibly with the type of person they want, so they are settling for living a double life with me on their arm. We are best friends, so I guess to them it's not the worst deal ever, but I dont think I can do this.

My goal in the end is to complete my education, but I really want to avoid taking out loans and going into debt. 

So knowing that the military has programs for these kinds of things I decided to go to my local navy recruiter to see what my options were. My recruiter managed to convince me to take the ASVAB to see what jobs I would qualify for saying the entire time that I would not be obligated to do anything afterwards. After getting my ASVAB and finding out I scored a 99 on the test and thus qualified to join the navy nuclear engineering program.

&amp;#x200B;

So I talked to Heather at the cafe, 5 days ago, and heard about her, Gabriel and their past. I left heartbroken and sad, I have been having a  very tough time, I have been avoiding my husband Gabriel so that he  don't notice anything, because I wanted to talk with him when I'm ready. So yesterday after dinner, I asked him to join me in the kitchen and sit down. I immediately started talking about Heather, I said I know who  the woman from the store is, I met her and we talked, I know  everything. He tried to move closer to me, but I raised my hand towards  him and made it clear that I want him to come clean and tell me  everything. I explained that he can't exclude any detail.

&amp;#x200B;

He nodded and told me that he will come clean and tell me everything about  Heather and their past, and that he would do it because he loves me, and want me to understand him. He made it clear that he hates to talk about his past, but he will do it for me. So Gabriel started to talk  about his first year of high school, his freshman year, which was in  2005. He and two other friends from elementary school went to the same  high school. He played for the high school's football team and he met  Heather for the first time at a meeting the school had arranged for all the school's athletes. There he saw this young blonde American girl, the same age as him, she was 6 ft 1, muscular, strong and had a good  looking and athletic body. She was good looking too. Gabriel said that  he liked tall girls, like him, but that he also admired Heather's desire  to win, she hated losing and he admired her competitive spirit and her  sense of competition. She was the school's only wrestler. They started  talking to each other during the meeting in a flirtatious way. She was  just different and more unique than the other girls in school, he said that she was special.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, they started hanging out with each other during both school and  free days. And after a couple of days they started dating and having sex  with each other. It was really serious between them, they showed love for each other in school and outside, and Gabriel said that all the  other students in the school knew they were together. They were together throughout high school, through freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year. They chose the same college and rented a room and they lived  together in the same room. After this had happened, Gabriel told his  parents about Heather, that she was his girlfriend and that it was really serious between them, which could lead to bigger things in the  future. Then he told his parents that she was an American and not a girl  of Syrian origin like him, his parents did not like it but did not want  to stand in his way.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel continued to tell that he and Heather really loved each other, that  they had a lot of sex together, it was because both were young, athletes  and had the strength to have such an active relationship. Heather then  dropped out of college, but still lived with him in the room, Gabriel  said it was because she loved him and he was her boyfriend. After  Gabriel finished his studies, he went back to his parents, along with Heather, to introduce her to the family. His dad owned another house  very close to their real house, so Gabriel and Heather lived there together. And that house is the same house that Gabriel and I live in  right now, so I realized now how Heather knew where we lived and how she  found me. Then he came to the part where he met me and we started to  talk, it was the end of 2014. He promised that when he saw me for the  first time and was told that I was of Syrian origin as him, he wanted me and wanted to marry. He then broke up with Heather in early 2015, he  told her that he wanted to marry a girl with Syrian origin, just like  him, and that he couldn't be with her anymore. He then started talking  and haning with me much more, we then married late 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

He was now done talking, I began to shed tears, I rose up on my feets and started walking away to the other room, he tried to follow me but I screamed and told him, no, and that I needed some time alone and would  have to think about everything he told me, I was mentally weak, and in a very emotional and depressed state. I'm very angry and frustrated about  knowing that my husband have been together with another girl before me,  that he loved before, that he had sex with Heather, she was his first  girl and he was her first boy, they took each other's virginity, I also  hate the fact that they were together for 10 years, and that he and his  family lied to me and my family, about him having relationships before  and him being a virgin. I don't know what I can do and what do to, I'm just very sad. I don't know if I can continue this marriage. I need help, I'm asking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Should I remain married with Gabriel or file for divorce?

If I chooses to remain with him, how should our relationsip and marriage look like and be?

Do I have the right to hate Gabriel for his past with dating another girl and having sex with her in his younger years?

Do I have the right to hate on Heather for what she did with my husband before and for telling me about their past?

Should I blame her for all the problems that me and my husband have right now?

Do you think that Heather wants to hurt me and my marriage, that she hates because I'm married to her former crush?

Did  Heather plan all of this, to tell me about her past with Gabriel?  Because I suspect that she planned it, because she knew I would react  like this and that I would fight my husband, which could lead us to  split from each other, and then she could take him back to her.

Does  she have an agenda to destroy our marriage and steal my husband  Gabriel? I believe it because I think she may see me as the woman who  ruined her life and stole her boyfriend from her, and now she wants him  back to herself. Is that possible?

Should I trust Heahter? Or should I give her a chance and reach out to her and ask her for help to save my marriage?

Do  Heather have the right to still love and stalk my husband? I believe  she should've moved on, it's been 4 years since he broke up with her,  what does she want?

Am I the wrong one for being angry at my husband for everything he did with that woman?

Should I tell my parents about the lies he and his family told us? because my parents doesn't know the truth yet.

Are Gabriel or Heather in the fault for what they did all these years ago? Can I blame anyone of them?",26Sep2019,1

793,"I work at this arcade. This arcade is so big that their is a lot of different jobs.

795,"About 8 months ago, I met a guy on a subreddit that no longer exists. We became good internet friends, and he seemed cool until we video chatted for the first time. He seemed very shaky and jittery and gave me an uneasy feeling. Eventually, we got into an argument over a few of my life choices. He said some very horrible stuff to me, that left me feeling worthless for weeks. In the time before we argued, he sent me a few of his Spotify playlists, and I followed them. After our argument, I still had his playlists on my Spotify and was still following him. Eventually, I decided to log out of my account and make a new one because the app's recommendations weren't great. Anyways, I get a Reddit message after, telling me to unfollow his Spotify. I try to log back in but forgot the password. So I told him that, but he didn't understand and kept making new accounts on Reddit and messaging me, all of which I blocked.  A mistake I made was that I gave him my Instagram username when we were still friends. I run a fairly successful meme account and had put my phone number and email on my account to complete it, which I shouldn't have. He had messaged my best friend, harassing her about me, and has even made 16 Instagram accounts to message me about how much of a wh\*re I am. Then, I get 2 more very vulgar Reddit messages, calling me a myriad of different things. He even catfished me multiple times just to bully me.  This ended up putting me in a very bad mindset, and I became very depressed. I didn't understand how he couldn't process that I couldn't get back into my Spotify. Then, he started calling my cell phone number, but \*67'd himself so I couldn't see his number. He's been calling me for the past 2 weeks, first to harass me, and the most recent (which was today) to tell me I'm beautiful and that he misses me.

 How do I get over this?",26Sep2019,1
797,"This has been weighing heavy on me the past few days. I really don‚Äôt know what the right thing to do is. Here‚Äôs my dilemma:

It all started 3 years ago in 2015. I received a message through a dating site profile I had. It was clear in the initial message this person knew me somehow outside of my profile. I inquired how they knew me as they had no profile picture &amp; the name I didn‚Äôt recognize (which was fake). He then revealed being married, that our children attended school together &amp; that even though he‚Äôs always noticed me, I probably never noticed him. He also sent some very forward messages and advances. I proceeded to block this persons profile. 

Since then, this person has continued to create fake FB profiles to send advancing messages. Each time I proceeded to block those as well. 

He then somehow acquired my mobile number and resorted to sending text messages even as of recent. Again, indicating their marital status (being why they wouldn‚Äôt reveal their identity), their infatuation with me and hoping for something more. 

Well this past week through much determination and research with what little information I had, I got a HUGE break in discovering who this person is. It‚Äôs rather crazy how the puzzle pieces finally came together. Being 99.999 percent sure, I still needed that fraction of a percent confirmation. 

I decided to message this person back via their recent text. I didn‚Äôt instantly out them but with the right questions, etc., their responses were without a doubt confirming my suspicions. Needless to say, after an entire day of going back &amp; forth &amp; throwing in some pun-intended comments that only the person would know, they finally cracked. Fully revealing themselves, etc., as they finally realized I now knew anyway. And no, I wasn‚Äôt being disrespectful of marital boundaries, leading them on or indicating any desire to indulge their fantasies. I creatively was deflective in my replies if they made advances or inappropriate comments. I‚Äôm not that kind of person &amp; put him in his place when he finally cracked. 

I was shocked to say the least as I once lived by this ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù family for 10 years. Our children used to play together, etc., as we lived on the same street. I was friendly with his wife but can‚Äôt even really remember crossing paths or formally meeting the husband. I knew his name &amp; saw him coming &amp; going down our road on occasion. 

Honestly, he just seemed to keep to himself. But apparently by his remarks, he enjoyed every time I mowed my lawn or was outside with my children or saw me at school events. 

I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my place to inform my former neighbor of her husbands wandering, stalkerish nature. I don‚Äôt want to be the reason a family falls apart. I guess I‚Äôm struggling because there are children involved. If there weren‚Äôt, I‚Äôd probably be more inclined to speak up before children were brought into the world &amp; possibly destined for a broken home.

In my search to find the major that better suits me, I spoke with my advisor about this problem. He posed the question, ""if you could never write fiction again, what would you do instead?"" I told him that I love computers, but mostly the hardware part. We looked at the majors offered at my college and none are hardware-based. I am determined to stay at the school I'm going to now so I can't do hardware I guess. He emailed the people in charge of the ITS majors. They're the most ""computer-related"" majors at the college.

Earlier today, I met with the guy in charge of CSI (computer science and innovation) to see if any of the ITS majors were for me. Computer Science sounds really cool to me. Most of it is programming which I have some experience in and I enjoyed when I did it. However, I'd have to take Calculus and Discrete Math. the ""highest-level"" math I've taken was Trigonometry in high school (I graduated high school in 2016). 

Taking CSI as my new major would make it so I would have to attend college for about 3 more years, for a total of around 7-7.5 years total. I'd rather not be in college that long, but if it's a major I will be able to complete, I see it as being worth it. I can't see myself finishing the Communication degree I'm going for as of now. There are 2 classes I have to take that I can't complete because the professors don't teach the way that allows me to succeed in them. 

One of these professors is one of the people who say, ""good morning class, that wasn't good enough. I said, good morning class!"" I just can't deal with that, I'm 22 years old, I'm not in grade school anymore.

TL;DR: I want to change my major in my 4th year of college. If I do, I'll be in college for around 7 years total.",26Sep2019,1
810,"My 6th period classmates I sit with are people I know and have admired for their smarts and humor. I'm in high school.

Recently, they have been pushing work all our group work onto me and have said some things that really hurt me. I'm not sure how to bring it up without getting ostracized or whether I'm overreacting. To be honest, I'm not even sure if I should stay in their group. It really stresses me there. I feel like I'm not heard, that I'm not funny, that my opinions are dumb. I'm afraid to speak up, and my anxiety flares up around them. Since I'm unconfident, my jokes fall flat, I'm unsure of how to react to things, and can't seem to summon my normal personality.

They seem to try to include me, but I'm treated like the dumb friend, even when doing all the work. 

I don't know anyone else in the class. The yearmates who aren't part of our group have already formed their partners for projects and classwork. The rest are older and also are already in groups.  This class is group project based.

How should I proceed?",26Sep2019,1
811,"I posted this on another sub, but I didn't really get any advice, so here goes. :T

Oh, and for reference I'm a college Senior at a public school (idk if that makes a difference?)

I'm extremely passionate about my particular major. It's been a long standing obsession for me for quite a while. The department at my school is relatively small, but I really like all my professors there. They're all incredibly intelligent, knowledgeable, interesting people. I kind of get these hero-worship like attitudes towards them, and when I was younger, I even had kind of a puppy dog like crush on one, that was more of an innocent romantic-platonic thing and wanting him to like my work than anything truly amorous or scandalous. (Aka, I kind of got the butterflies when I talked to him and would have maybe been attracted to him if I was older, but he was old enough to be my father and I hadn't gone completely off the deep end at that point.)

Fast forward to now. I have a different professor in the same department. Same story as the first guy, although this particular prof is even more knowledgeable about my specific area of interest within the department. I get really good grades in all my courses in the department, so the professors tend to like me somewhat (at least as a student), so they'll say hi to me on campus and everything like normal people. But now I'm starting to get kind of giddy if he sends me an email (about academic stuff but yknow) and when he talks in class about intellectual topics that I'm passionate about, it's honestly kind of a turn on? Which freaks me out completely. This man is at least 20+ years my senior and not really physically attractive at all. I guess it's more his mind and typical professor charisma that is attractive to me.

What disturbs me is that my feelings for this prof are distinctly more sexual/romantic in nature than the previous prof. Wtf. He's even less attractive than the first guy...

So the advice I've found online is it's no big deal cuz it's normal, just don't make a move. Well, duh. I'm not that crazy. But I do have sexual/romantic fantasies about him that would suck to ever come to light. (Not to mention how weird it is that I'm even attracted to him in the first place.) I'm afraid I'll give away my crush because I've read that students are not terribly subtle about these kinds of things. Then I heard that if rumors start circulating, it could be bad for his career. Well, I don't want to drop the class or stop talking to the prof because I really like the department and the whole thing is just so stupid. Not to mention that good recommendations and connections from my profs would go a long way in the future.

Is it ok to still fantasize about him or should I stop? Will it be obvious I have a crush on him? Help. :T",26Sep2019,2

1. She likes to overrexaggerate and stretch the truth. 

 2. She's always complaining about how her life sucks in an attempt to seek compliments and sympathy. And whenever you try to give her advice, she creates excuses as to why things can't change and proceeds to complain some more. 

3. When you don't play into her ""woe is me"" sympathy trap, she gives you the cold shoulder.

4. She likes to gossip and talk shit about our co-workers. 

5. She already has beef with one of our co-workers and is trying to turn the others against him by badmouthing him and reporting him to our boss.  

I worry about her behavior because she's already gotten close to some of our higher-ranking co-workers by kisses their asses, which makes me nervous about the issues she's likely to brew in the future, especially for me if I end on her bad side.

We‚Äôve been together for a year now but we‚Äôve been living together for 11 months. This is both of our first relationships and we jumped the gun on settling due to being so na√Øve about young love, we dated an hour long distance and made that work until my car broke down on the way one day.

We‚Äôve been together and slept in the same bed almost everyday and night, so much to the point that not too long into our relationship he stated how depressed he is when I‚Äôm gone and therefore showed nothing but sadness whenever I tried to have alone time or go hang out with my friends, so much to the point I sometimes feel too guilty to even go.

Firstly, I'm in grade 12 meaning I'm graduating high school this year and to be honest I'm worried out of my mind for university. First, I don't feel like I'm good enough for university because I think I'm honestly dumb compared to my peers and even my closest friends (I'm in a program called IB and it's sort of like an honours curriculum). I'm not doing as well as any of them and they have ""lower"" aspirations compared to me as I want to be successful in starting my own company one day, which makes me doubt my own abilities and frankly I don't know how to stop it, and I don't even know if maybe I am right and I'm not going to be able to succeed at that. 

Secondly, university applications start soon and I don't know what program to go into (I do know I want to go to uni for sure). I continuously second guess my own decisions thinking I'm not capable and smart enough for getting accepted into uni.

He just thought they did because he thought I was her ex

But according to both of them it was in August

And that he said that she sent me nudes because he wasn't completely sure and he doesn't care but then what she said also
Backs up she didn't say anything to him while we were together

Because before she said don't tell my man and then when she was with me she said she's wasn't going too

I asked why he kept insisting that she did when she said she didn't and it was because he thought she did because it was in August

But then he said I thought I was her old ex and then he realized I wasn't and that don't really make sense or add up or maybe I'm slow or something

Idk why he didn't tell me this in the first place or something, I feel like he's lying because I said I'd give him something but I didn't and he threatened to kill me and then blocked me

But then again she is pretty confident she didn't send him something in her old relationship, so I really don't know what to do at this point and she also said they didn't talk in September even though this guy said nothing happened but before he came clean he insisted something happened and asked for he Snapchat for proof and she wouldn't give it to him
But because of what he told me it makes more sense why she called him out asking for proof and saying She's been with me since September and called him out on her Instagram story so idk if someone got detailed wrong because I showed her the texts and she said it was all right and when I asked if she was lying she said no",26Sep2019,0

A lovely couple moved into our 1st home upstairs and we decided to live downstairs as it's more spacious and gives us easy access to the backyard because we have a large dog.

They've only been upstairs for 3 months and are reasonably quiet. They have asked if they could get a ~50lbs Sheepadoodle. We have had a face to face conversation about it and a pet deposit is agreed if they are allowed although I'm torn. They are very I am a shift worker and work overnight very often. 

Biggest issue: Noise! Their living room is the only room that is carpeted. However they said they would get rugs for the bedrooms and a runner for the hallway. 
I just came from an awful situation where we had a family with a 2 yr old who ran all the time and when we bought I was so happy to get away from the situation. Although we again live downstairs I was content to find good professional working couple for tenants and deal with it. I know they are here to stay for at least 2 years. 

They have said they are willing to move if it becomes intolerable but that is just a verbal agreement and as a landlord if I give them permission to have a dog then evicting them would be an issue. 

We live right across from a dog park and the dog would get plenty of exercise (when it's old enough) but the puppy stages would be hard with them having to take the little one outside every 2-3 hours. 

Another issue is that our dog loves dogs and I'm a bit distressed he will whine to play all the time. There's also the possibility he won't be happy to share the unfenced backyard. 

So all my concerns that have been very well addressed by the couple. Husband wants them to have a dog ""to be kind and for good karma"". We love dogs, our landlord was kind enough to allow us when we asked. We like them, we want them to stay.
