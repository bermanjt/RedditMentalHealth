0,There’s a guy my age (15) who I really want to ask out. I met him in a theater camp and I get super nervous when around him. How should I ask him out? He’s super nice and a little shy if that helps.,18Jul2019,2
1,"Ok so basically once I graduated public high school I was gonna become a fireman and not go to college, but my parents really told me they want me to go to college, saying they’ll happily pay for it.  They sat me down and we talked about what I could do and I mentioned I was kind of interested in law, and once I said that they were very happy, told me to pursue it instead of being a fireman. So basically I’m on track to law school at undergraduate now and will probably be a public defender.

After I applied to schools, I offered my parents since they’re paying I could go to my local 4 year public school, or a school that gave me near full scholarship. They told me don’t worry about the money and told me to go to the best one that I got into, which is also the most expensive. I am doing really well there, but every day I feel the guilt of their hard work being spent on my education. They make a lot (800k year combined) but the school is 80k every year which is an absurd amount. Honestly I feel like such a spoiled rich kid, even though I literally ask for nothing, I buy my clothes from kohl’s with money I got when I was working as a fry cook, don’t ask for gifts or cars but it all seems to be in the shadow of the giant 80k a year bill. Anyone please help me out",18Jul2019,1
2,"I was recently absolutely humiliated by my boss at work in front of my entire team and his boss and other members of senior management and some of my coworkers laughed out loud and my self esteem and self confidence is on the floor.  I'm struggling to deal with what happened and move forward with dignity, but that's a topic for another time.  I am looking for advice on how to interact with a friend, who also happens to be a coworker, that was present when this happened and knew just how upset and emotional I was afterwards.  This really hurt me, it cut me to the bone.  That weekend (it happened last Friday) I went home and spent the entire time driving myself crazy trying to figure out how to show up Monday or if I even could ever show my face there ever again, and whether I wanted to throw away my career and the opportunity and potential that comes from working at my company just to save face. During that time I never once heard from my friend, not to check on me, no words of encouragement, not even an inquiry as to whether or not I was going to come in on Monday or not and it just adds insult to injury.  It hurts.  So is it ok to be angry or hurt when, to be fair, I never reached out to them either because I felt like I didn't want to bring them down or be a source of negativity?  I'm stuck in a loop of being hurt and wanting to talk to someone who would understand, being too embarrassed to initiate, then getting hurt when they don't initiate...  What do I do?  Do I tell them, if so then what do I say to them, how do I say it?  If not, what should I say to myself to alleviate some of the distress I'm feeling?",18Jul2019,1
3,"Crowdsourcing here and would love your opinion: I’m nearly 30 and a professional in a field that I hate. On a scale of one to ten... I hover around 9. I do, however, have a ton of side passions and interests that I’d love to have the time to explore. And I’m toying with the idea of a gap year to do it. Hoping I’ll find something I enjoy a little more in a tangential area. A year is a not so scary timeline for me, I’ll make sure I have everything in order so I can hopefully return to the field, if need be.

I’m not planning to sit around and do nothing, I need to be experiencing things and interacting with people. I’m looking for suggestions: what are free or nearly free experiences I can have in a year. I may be able to travel a little bit if some things are covered (think: WWOOFing).  My interests lie in philosophy, psychology, food&amp;farming, exercise and taking care of people. People and care of people (self included) essentially.

Are there experiences out there that I could have in this gap year that you all can think of? 

I’ve thought about starting and maintaining a YouTube channel, volunteering at a senior citizen home, shadowing a physical therapist, reading as much as I can about things I’m interested in, systemizing things in my life that can be systemized, learning to live on as little as possible, learning to do things around the house (fix stuff).

Or if you think I’m crazy, tell me that here too :)",18Jul2019,1
4,"Is it okay to be jealous of your friend success even when you don’t mean no harm, I’m in this situation right now and I need advice cause I’m kind of like feeling like a bad friend right now. 

We both went to the same school but I graduated before him so I was already working before him. After he finished school we started doing the same thing ( I introduced him to my work) and things were going on smoothly until recently when I realized I’m kind of jealous, though I wasn’t so sure before but, he was already making more money than me and having more connection than me in a period of one year.

Honestly I don’t know why I’m jealous cause I’m doing totally fine myself i just can’t help thinking about it. though I know I’m 101% loyal to this said friend and mean no harm. Im just kind of feeling guilty of being jealous of my friend because his doing better than me. 

Is this feeling normal or absurd ??  Tbh I try to navigate this thought anytime it pop out in my head but it keeps coming back.

I've had my fair share of traumas in the past of mentally bullying by friends on acid which I think is still going on through nightmares or probably is fading away since I learnt about myself the hardest way . This had given me a lot of delusions in the past as well I suppose ,even instances where I thought the whole world was plotting against me but again learned later on it was all delusions but I'm sceptical I could be on borderline.

Now I'm in a critical stage of life where I got to decide my career, although my legs are dancing around everywhere- be it the Law degree I have enrolled myself in ( classes are yet to start- with refund still can be made) or the Psychology masters degree I've enrolled in and pursuing through distance education and the serious pursuit of backpacking for the rest of my life that's always in the back of my mind, let alone my current employment in a corporate . I'm not materialistic and I'm spiritual and I find it hard to fit in the matrix . 
I don't really know how to go about with all these in my mind. Am I scattered enough?",18Jul2019,1

10,"So I love my job 100%. I love the culture here and the people who work here. There is no bullying and everyone is very supportive. It's an IT job and I work doing email migrations as a small department (right now it's literally just me in the department. I'm getting 1 other guy on Monday). I have to juggle *literally* thousands of customers since my previous boss got fired and I ""took over"" his position without a pay raise from my previous position, where I was supposed to also get a raise and a promotion for meeting requirements for the promotion. It's been almost 2 years and this company doesn't even have anything in place for annual raises. Also my previous boss left a lot of work half-finished and I had to finish up his work with a fuckton of customers the last 2 weeks that I'm still working on to this day.

The work just keeps stacking up for me every fucking day and I feel like I'm just running a facade. I'm working with the COO in my company as well as the VP of Operations and a lot of other team leads and I just don't feel ready for this position, but at the same time I'm almost 30 and need to do something with my life. 

Also the fact that having experience with what I have now (Office 365 and email migrations with a bit of Active Directory, jargon for those who don't know what this is, but whatever) is pretty worthless in the long term for me but at the same time I like this kind of work, but I don't know what exactly to search for in terms of ""other work"" on job websites like Indeed.com/Monster.com and stuff.

I feel like I'm running a facade here where I ""seem"" to have everything together for this tiny department with a huge volume of customers and I'm inches away from breaking down and just not coming into work. I don't feel mature enough for this or anywhere near ready to do things without direction from other people.

How the fuck do I handle this?! I hate running away from problems but my old habit is rearing its head again because it's becoming so overwhelming. I tend to take my tasks one at a time until they are done but just thinking about everything I need to do in one day just makes me mentally deflated and not want to do anything.

Sorry if this reads bad and/or jumps around, I'm really frazzled at the moment and it's getting worse by the day. I can barely enjoy time at home anymore because I know I'm going to come back to work to an inbox of 20 emails asking WHEN IS MY MIGRATION HAPPENING like the entitled pricks these customers are.",18Jul2019,1
11,"I (21M) am going into my senior year of college. I know after college life will not be the same. The thought that I am getting older and that I won't be able to experience the same things or have the same life that I have always had has given me some severe anxiety and depression. I am unsure of how to proceed so much so that I am having second guesses on my major and the path I am taking to complete my life goals. How do I overcome this? I know that everyone gets old and you can't stop the law of nature, but how do you live life when you have thoughts that nothing will ever be the same. I guess what this boils down to is I feel like I haven't had the experience that I wanted to live in my teens and the beginning of my twenties. How do I make up for that, when I am getting older, and I believe that I will regret what I didn't do also how do I overcome the fear of getting older.",18Jul2019,3
12,"The Thoughts
Feelings
Ideas
I feel are so fast.

Am I going crazy?
What am I doing wrong?
Am I psychotic?
Are these thoughts real or unreal?

I have so many questions, my mental energy is depleting rapidly and I’m sleeping a lot more.
What the hell is going on?

So this is what crazy feels like. 🤪

This, wait what is this even called? A letter I’ve written to you with the rare emoji thrown at you? Maybe it's just a random post on reddit by some crazy guy, whatever it may be I specificity wrote this to you, whomever you may be. You could be a two headed sloth with massive balls for all I know. This is to you anyway, another beating heart.

I smoke weed using a dynavap, I use it once a night. When I smoke it unlocks something in my brain, it’s really hard to describe. 😑

I have mental illnesses, OCD and anxiety, and I’ve been mostly vaping for a couple of years now. I also take medications such as SSRI's and a very small dose of an anti psychotic, I also vape nicotine, drink caffeine and sometimes drink alcohol, it really upsets my stomach though. Am I just naturally crazy or all these influences affecting me?

I can’t tell what’s real anymore.

I think my partner is cheating on me, or am I just being paranoid and crazy? Are all these thoughts and feelings my imagination? Is my mind just torturing me because it’s had enough?

Accusing my partner of cheating is pushing him away, he denies he ever cheated or did anything stupid. Yet my gut sometimes tells me something is wrong. I feel awful about it but I’ve been through is devices a couple of times, I’ve told him every time, not that makes it any better. I’ve found very little. He talks to other people online and that’s fine, one of his work mates lost his job so he gave him some money, okay fine but I'm not sure I wasn't aware of it. We’ve been together for more than a decade, he can’t be cheating, we love each other. 😊

I think I am crazy you know. I downloaded Grindr and I could of sworn I saw him on there. His nose and mouth I could see, he was wearing a cap. But it was uncanny how much of his nose, mouth and beard resembled my partner’s face. I told him about it and he denies it was ever him, that I’m just being crazy again. I just don’t know what to do.

13,"Let me know if it’s a bad idea or if it’s too much:


Wow thank you for that video that I opened in a very public space with a very wide screen computer. I’m sure all of the other patrons of “Ye Olde Airport Bar” really appreciated the cinematic nuance of that bulldog humping that dead dear. Is it a reflection of consumerism in our society? Or does it speak to our meteoric societal descent as we find ourselves closer and closer to environmental collapse?  In the words of great film theorist X, “”.
     

That being said, and in a more serious/ sentimental note, I did want to say thank you for this summer. Now before I begin the lamer part of this email I will qualify it by saying that 1. If you make fun of me for writing any of this/ make me feel weird about writing it, I will 100% throw a brick through your window 2. I meant to say this earlier this morning, but I didn’t because I have a hard time articulating feelings without trying to deflect with humor/ bury myself as far into whatever I’m sitting on as possible 3. I’m like 2 beers deep and I haven’t eaten since this morning so please ignore the phenomenon of “the Irish secretary “ (get it? Because the Irish are known for the alcoholism and secretaries are known for their typing?) i.e. major typos.

I usually hate the summer because, for the most part, it’s meant that I’ve had to stay home. If you haven’t figured, staying home means that I have to deal with things there which—you guessed it— usually involves a lot of yelling/fighting/throwing/ hitting/ crying etc. and inevitably ends with me experiencing intense feelings of self-loathing and anxiety. This is probably one of the few summers—apart from Cambridge—that I’ve actually been genuinely happy. I essentially had two choices this summer, go home and try and make money before seeing Matthew or stay here and try to make money before going to see Matthew. Frankly, when I first decided that I was going to stay in Connecticut I really didn’t know what to expect, but I really did feel that anything would be better than going home.

However, and as lame as it sounds, I don’t think I could have ever guessed it would have been this meaningful. I don’t know if it’s because we smoked a lot of the devil’s lettuce, or I got to tell what some would consider horribly offensive jokes and have someone find them funny, or because I almost got you questioned by the cops at multiple points, but I do know that it’s because I got to spend that time with you. It doesn’t feel encompassing enough, or good enough, to say that I’m incredibly happy you’re my friend. I could spend pages and pages listing the reasons why I’m grateful you’re my friend/ why you are my friend, but that’s fucking weird and I’m not writing War and Peace here. I will say though that one of the big reasons is because, besides you being a genuinely wonderful and authentic person, you make me feel happy, and I don’t feel that very often.

You don’t need some 25-year-old intern telling you this, but you’re an amazing dad and your family is really lucky to have you; I wished my family cared about me in remotely the same way that you care about yours. If you’re right and I don’t fuck everything up, I hope I can be even the fraction of the parent you are.
I’m going to end this email here because I’m really bad at conclusions/the flight attendant is about to shit themselves because I haven’t put my computer away, but I’ll miss you and, again, thank you for hanging out with me.

16,I’m so lost and depressed. I have severe severe social anxiety. It got 100x better. Then it got worse. I started a new job. I’ve worked at a daycare for almost 3 years. Now I started working at another on Monday. I love working with children. But the coworkers and parents give me so much anxiety. I’ve gotten so bad that when I talk to parents I shake. No parent wants to see that. I can’t do anything. I dissociate all day. My last therapist said I a dissociative disorder. I go tomorrow to the psychiatrist to refill medicine. Was wondering if I should request something else. I’m on ambilify and Zoloft. I’m scared because I’m starting to get to the point of becoming suicidal like I was last year.

17,"Hi reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

This might be a long one but please bare with me.

I'm looking for advice after a recent incident has turned my life from bad to worse.

My grandad passed away last September and he left me and my immediate family some money, over 50k in total for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this my Nan fell ill and she unfortunately had to go into a home, so me and my Partner had the opportunity to move into my Grandparents house, this is where we're living currently.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst growing up, me and my grandad loved sitting down watching scary movies and TV Programmes and this got me interested in video production myself and after struggling to hold down countless 9-5 jobs ( I am autistic and struggle with change etc) I decided to setup my own business. So when he left me this money i had the thought of investing half of it into the business and giving it a real boost, the rest went towards buying this house.

&amp;#x200B;

The business investment (Just over 25k) was in a safe upstairs and i was ready to go and put it in my bank and buy all the equipment i would need for the business. 2 weeks ago me and my partner were on a short, weekend trip away and i got a phone call at about 5am from my dad saying our house had been broken into and I need to come home right now. He had no idea i was storing the cash in my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost everything i own was taken, materialistic things i can get over. But what i cant get over is the fact that they took everything from that safe...My grandads watch, the money, priceless pictures that can't be replaced. I am lost, in a panic and losing sleep over the fact that 1. My parents dont know the money has gone, i can't bring myself to tell them 2. My business dreams are shattered and 3. Someone out there has my Grandads money. I wanted to make him proud and get this business up and running, debt and finance free (not that i would get approved for finance anyway lol) 

&amp;#x200B;

The police are of course aware, but there is nothing in the form of updates, any evidence etc at this moment in time, i have full faith that they will catch the asshole that did this, but for now its a no-go.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what advice would you give me, what shall i do next? My friends told me to setup a gofund me page which i have done, but i missed out the theft part and the inheritance etc and i won't share it as i'm scared my parents will question it and i'll have to tell them what happened. Its not even all about the money, its the fact that my grandad knew what i was going to do with it ( We knew his death was not far away and we had discussions while he was still here)

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is quite a specific event and not everyone will have advice for me, but i really am struggling to keep it together, especially since i am now running a business on pennies and soon my parents are going to start asking when i will invest the money into a business. We may also have to move house, depending on how things pan out in the next few months

Thankyou in advance",18Jul2019,2

The frequency of those meltdowns has been increased over the last month due to the extensive fuc ups ive made without thinking about what they all combined can do. I had a gf, which i lost due to lack of motivation to be a good partner (and in general) and fear of being cheated on. My brain went from going logical and sensible: ""look i dont think this is going to work out"", to moronic ghosting which i have no idea why it was done. This pulled every single person which i had good relations away and especially one person which i betrayed by telling something to her crush. She was one of the best people i have ever met and ive lost her due to the social stupidity ,idiotic behaviour and a feeling of being lost after the breakup. After that i became inactive and havent even tried making up with those people and started feeling like a piece of the most foul smelling excriment there is.

20,"Hi. I’m 22 years old and I received 300k from the passing of a relative, did not have to split any of it with anyone, but my life is now so different and I don’t know what to do. My family dynamic has always been SO strong growing up. I’ve always been extremely close with my family to the point that I didn’t have many friends because I was always spending time with my grandparents, spending time with my sister, or hanging out watching movies with my mom and talking with her about anything and everything. Me and my mom were especially very close. I was very spoiled growing up not just with gifts and extravagebt birthday parties but with love. Anything I did in life, cheer, dance, basketball, my family always supported me and saw this light in me that had potentional to accomplish anything I wanted in life. I really cherished the relationship I had with my family because I knew that no matter what happened in life that I’d always be loved and supported by them, even if I had no one else. After this windfall things quickly started changing. My mom and dad’s whole demeanor changed towards me and no longer wanted anything to do with me and was quick to try and kick me out of the house once I recieved the money saying I was an adult and had the means to do what I wanted and they didn’t want me here anymore. Even though I’m 22 it was quite out of the blue and her approach was EXTREMELY harsh. My grandparents are now cold and less loving towards me. My sister is always implying how she needs money and that she’s “so broke” even though I’ve already given her $1000 in cash and gifts on top of that. I just came back from a 6 month trip to Asia and have felt so unwelcomed here. It’s so different now. I feel like an alien in my own home that I’ve grown up in. It breaks my heart because I never wanted the money to change me or anything around me for the worst. I have been trying to take advantage of the freedom I have now at this age before settling down elsewhere and getting a job I have to be committed to (thanks to the windfall) and I think maybe this is what’s contributed to this treatment, but I still don’t fully understand why there’s so much hatred and hostility coming from my family and why they’re being so cold. I’ve remained kind, loving and my normal self through it all. The funny thing is the money hasnt changed me one bit, but it’s changed everyone around me who knows about it. It’s almost like the love they had for me was never even real. I don’t know what I’m asking. Maybe I just want to know why this is happening? I wish I could have an answer to this. My heart breaks everyday because I gained money and lost a family whom I love very much in the process. It hurts. Really really bad. I wish I could go back to being best friends with my mom, I wish my sister could go back to being my older sister and not always randomly implying I’m supposed to lend her money, I wish my grandparents still saw me as their loving grand daughter that is still trying to find her place and purpose in the the world, just like I was before the money, and how much I love them unconditionally. Money really is evil",18Jul2019,1
21,"So I made two identical posts prior to this about how today is the first time in years that I've gone without drinking. Me and my gf watched A Star Is Born last night for her birthday and this morning, I woke up and bawled a little while apologizing to her for all the shit I put her through. A few hours later, I decided to get rid of every trace of alcohol I had in the apartment and threw it all out (filling up two recycling bags). I then went out and got a haircut and shave to get rid of my scraggly look that I've had for years now. Why she would stick around with a loser like me is beyond me.

23,"I live in Australia, working casual. Sorry about bad spelling and grammar, I've barely slept lately working for this asshole. Skip ahead to the second paragraph if you don't wanna read the backstory, although I kinda feel it's important.
I first started working for him when I was 16. Always payed me on time and in full, but even back then I had a feeling some of my co-workers weren't getting their full wage. Anyway when I turned 17, my wage should've gone up from $12-$15 an hour. I didn't know about this, being a kid, but he did. Left it around 4-5 months before I caught on and asked him to up it. I also found out that legally I'm entitled to all of the money difference of those 4-5 months (around $400 I figured it out to be). Anyway I let it slide, partly because I was shiny and dumb, partly because I'd been there from the very beginning. It's a franchise so I was trained by the same people (HQ) as my boss. I knew how hard he worked to keep the business afloat and provide for his family, and I was young so didn't need the money as much as he probably did. It just seemed ridiculous to ask for it.
I ended up quitting after he was getting me to work hours equal to someone working fulltime. I never got holiday penalty rates, nothing. I ended up paying tax as a 17 year old, and having to go through the process of a tax return while overseas because he didn't follow my request of Not making me work 45 hrs a week. Which reminds me, I ended up working through my own sixteenth birthday party despite booking it off months in advance.
Well from there on he'd occasionally ask me to come in and help out, and I was fine with that. I'm a bit of a sucker so yeah I went in most of the time. I don't like to use the word ""friends"", because that's not how a working relationship should be, but that tends to be how it feels. He usually cuts me slack if I arrive 5-10 minutes late coming from my other job (I just stay 5-10 min later), and in turn I'm someone he can call if he's low on staff.

Now I'm 18, so my wage has upped again ($15-$18). I ended up working 2 days for him last week, and he asked if he could pay me in cash. I was a little confused, said yes though because I'm not earning enough to worry about paying tax from it myself. I'm working another 2 days for him this week, and at the end of my shift yesterday he gave me last week's pay but ~$50 short (old minimum wage). As nicely as possible, I reminded him that it's gone up, and offered that this pay is fine for this week, but if next week he could pay me the full amount. He claimed it was because he's paying me in cash, so I said pay me through the online thing you usually do. And I was pretty taken aback when he said no. He said I'd get the $15 an hour for these two weeks, and if he ever needed me again he'd pay the $18.

I have a shift tonight and I'm torn about what to do. People I ask about it tend to er towards one extreme or another. My dad says I should go to the ombudsman and claim what I'm sure by now is $1000s worth of unpaid cash (a lot for someone my age, trying to survive uni). My mum said I should just go to the shift, stay quiet but never go back. It really is bothering me, because I don't want to be a pushover, but I also don't want to completely destroy someone I see as a friend. I mean I met his wife and kid and I just always feel bad about how this would affect them. It really kills that he takes advantage of so many employees, I know for a fact I'm not the only one he does this to. And to make matters worse a lot of other employees have families too. And no finding another job is unlikely, have you seen today's job market?

24,"I apologize if this is quite long. 

So long story short, I'm on holiday rn and so is my girlfriend. I find out she cheated on me and I still have another 5 days before I go home and can see her. As per expected I feel super shitty and down ever since I found out. 

Anyways. I'm here with my family and my sister is 14 years younger than me. She wanted to go on a bouncy castle next to our dinner spot so I took her. There was a girl upfront which you pay and she also goes in the castle to look after the kids. She's cute but I don't think much of it. 

So I'm standing there on the side while my sister is playing in the castle and she comes over from inside and starts a conversation. (she's Greek and I'm Bulgarian so we speak in English). She asks a lot about me and seems keen to talk to me, and also seems super nice. 

My sister comes into the conversation and starts talking to me which kind of makes things awkward so she nonchalantly moves away a little. A while later she comes back to me but some woman comes over next to me and starts talking to her in Greek. Our food was there so we had to go, and when saying goodbye she seemed super nice again and I felt like there was something. 

Am I just tripping because of what happened with my gf, should I go see that girl tommorow, use my sister as an excuse and ask her for drinks after work, or should I stay loyal. 

Maybe I'm just happy to have some attention on me after it became apparent the one person I loved couldn't keep themselves to me. 

Again sorry for long post, I'm super confused and any general advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!",18Jul2019,3
26,"I (F) live in an apartment building. Over a month ago, when I was leaving work in the morning, the elevator stopped on the floor below mine. A guy walked on and started talking to me, just friendly conversation and then we found out half of our walk commute to work is the same way. This happened twice in a couple weeks, and a third time yesterday. While we were walking, he asked if I'd like to go for a drink or walk sometime. I said yes and took his number not to make the situation awkward and left on my way. This morning, the elevator stopped on his floor again and we had some more conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really rather walk to work alone and I'm hoping this doesn't become a regular occurrence. He texted me today asking me if I'm available for drinks or a walk. How do I decline politely without making the situation awkward, knowing I'll probably see him in the elevator again? I'm uncomfortable with the idea of becoming friends with someone in the building, and I'm not even sure what his intentions are, so I don't want to assume and come off as an asshole.

27,"*Tldr: supervisor takes criticism as a personal attack. I noticed something is wrong and want to change it. What's the best way to tell him?*

I work under the supervision of someone. I basically do a watered down version of his job. Last month, during a meeting with our team, I noticed something that he was doing that was structurally wrong. Everything would still work, but nevertheless there was a much better way to do things. I brought this up and he turned red. I did not bring up a solution, I just pointed out that the way it was set up was confusing and not standard. He took it as a personal attack. I think he kind of took it as a ""You don't know what you're doing, I could do this so much better than you.""

The meeting quickly turned to discuss potential solutions, and as we went on, he got visibly angrier. The meeting concluded basically acknowledging that there was a better way to do things, but it was too late to do anything.

I thought some more of it, and agreed partly on the fact that it would be a lot of work and partly on the fact that they don't pay me to argue. On a side note, this turned him somewhat hostile towards me. For two weeks, he didn't stop by and chat at all and would quickly shut me down when I tried.

Today, in passing, he told me that he was changing the structure of on aspect to something that was better but still wrong and not anything that the team agreed on. I replied with, ""You should probably talk to the boss before you do that"". He didn't, it was completely foreign when I mentioned it to the boss. I outlined a quick solution and told her that I'd try to get him to stop what he's doing tomorrow until the team agrees on a solution. This was after he left, otherwise I would have done this today with the boss present.

So for the rest of a day, I prepared a diagram that illustrates the problem. I've also prepared a partial solution to some of the problem. I plan to present this to him tomorrow.

He is likely to take this as an attack on his work. By no means would I be able to do his job, but my stance is that if he can backtrack and make the change he was planning on, then we can go back and fix the entire problem.

I'm not the best at demonstrating my views verbally, and sometimes I come off as condescending. There's no way that we could do what we're doing without him. I'm looking for any advice to help me not increase the tension between him and I.",18Jul2019,0

30,"So I (17M) really like this girl (18F) who is super sweet and kinda introverted. We'd been talking for a few months and I asked her out finally. 

She said she just got past some bad relationship stuff and wasn't looking for anything serious but wouldn't want that to affect our friendship. I said I totally understood but then she said she would love to go on the date to get to know me if I was fine with that. 

The ""date"" went really well, we both got all dressed up for it and we were talking and laughing a bunch. Afterwards she told me she had so much fun and we should definitely do it again soon. 

The following week she didn't initiate texting at all. I texted her twice and the first time she seemed kinda cold and gave shorter answers but the second time she was like typing out paragraphs and talking to me abt this trip she's going on. 

Would it be wierd if I asked her to do something again? Do you think she just wants to take it slow or doesn't like me? How big a deal is it that she never initiates stuff? This is the first person I've asked out so I'm absolutely clueless with this stuff lol. Thank you for any help you can give me!",18Jul2019,1

32,"I've been at my office job for a little over two years and about a year ago we got a new boss. This new boss just has something against me and I don't know why even though they don't always show it. They've gotten in a habit of always singling me out and making me the but end of a lot of their jokes. Which I can take a joke. I was bullied a lot during middle/highschool so I have a tolerance for it I suppose. But, like the title says, here recently my boss just won't stop joking about firing me. It was funny the first time and I was able to laugh at it and carried on not thinking to much about it. But now it is getting into the double digits of how many times they have made a joke about firing me. They have done it verbally in front of my coworkers and the rest of the department. They have done it though various group chats. One a slack channel with my direct coworkers and another a group message for the whole department. So there are plenty of witnesses. Plus I have taken screenshots of nearly every instance through the various messages.  


I realize they are only joking, but how many times is too many? Why don't they just actually fire me? The most recent instance of them doing this was the same day they called a department meeting to announce that they had just laid off a coworker who essentially wasn't doing their job and skipping work (which is understandable). Later in the day, there were some jokes being exchanged in the dept. group chat. I sent one as a comeback to one of my boss's jokes. But then they responded with yet another joke basically saying I was fired. I just stopped responding. Later that same day, the boss called a coworker to their office (pretty close proximity to the boss's office and all the cubicles for the dept.) and loudly asked the coworker to go fire me on their behalf. I guess as a continuation of the earlier joke.  


They only seem to do it when jokes are being exchanged, when I try to make a joke directly to them, when I try to make a comment directly to them during a discussion, or when I try to correct them about something. Here recently it seems like it is just progressing and becoming a meme in the office to joke about me getting fired.  


I consider myself to be a great employee. I'm always on time. Always deliver/finish my projects on time. I put in a lot of extra time and bring my work home when it calls for it on certain projects. I try my best to get along with everyone in the office, especially my boss, even considering. I just don't understand why they are targeting me with these jokes. Up until now I've just been fake laughing and going along with it. However, each time they do this it digs more and more under my skin and worsens my anxiety and depression. Especially after that last instance, considering it was right after a coworker was actually fired.  


I've been trying to build up the nerve to confront HR about it and provide the screenshots and witnesses. I'm hesitant even to do that because of the experience of another coworker. This coworker has confronted HR about this same boss, on many occasions, saying extremely rude, hurtful, sexist, and disrespectful things to them. Many of those I have witnessed myself. HR just brushed it off and told this coworker not to worry about it. I feel like HR would just do the same with me. This boss is causing myself and my coworkers a lot of undue stress and anxiety but none of us feel like we can do anything about it.  


What would you do or what would you suggest?  


tl;dr My boss is an okay boss but a horrible person. Won't stop making jokes about firing me and makes a lot of rude and horrible comments to other coworkers. HR is useless. Our stress and anxiety levels are starting to max out. What do?",18Jul2019,11

41,"Try to make long story short.

Became friends with someone I've always wanted in my life. Same interests, introduces me to new things, wonderful to be around and talk to/listen to, always there, was everything I looked for in a friend. Me and my ""Friend"" would hang with her and chill or go out, he was going through a rough patch in his life and it didnt feel right for me to be out having fun while he was pissed and depressed alone in his head, he also would've done the same for me ....but she was also everything I looked for in a partner. Kind, funny, compassionate, always there, and i was the same for her so I begun to get feeling for her. I'm demisexual so it's hard for me to really find someone. I feel head over heels but I worked with her and being the person I am I didnt want our work relationship or friendship to get weird with my feelings for her. She eventually confronted me about it though and she basically told me that she didnt want a relationship right now so I backed off and I tried to fight my feelings. She gets a new job.

 A couple of months after I was told by my ""friend"", who is someone I'm very close to me, that they are together and she confirmed it. I talked to her that night I told her I loved her. She said I didnt because there was nothing I hated about her and to love someone I have to be willing to do things for them. I've done so much for her and she knew I'd do anything for her. I walk out and tell her goodbye. 

A couple of days later I return and apologize for how I lefted but not for what I've said, she accepts and we talk.

A few months later and some hardship with our relationship and me dealing with my jealousy and anxiety we are still friends but it's not the same. We use to talk evryday, we talked about sex, hell we cuddle together when I slept I her bed, never had sex I wasn't bothered by that, but she just treats me like a little brother now and for me to be around her and ""friend"" I have to lie to myself and think that they aren't together and that its just like the old times .....until they have they're ""couple moments"" then my anxiety clouds my mind and I just get horrible feeling and thoughts.

I love her even with everything that has happened and she's still willing to be friends with me even with all the bullshit that has happened. I dont want to lose her but it's so hard to continue with this relationship for me.

Recently I encounter a situation where one of my old coworkers lashed out at me for a moment and told me to go die and then said I should start doing work like the rest of them. I was taken back and did not know what to say. I ended up just going back to my desk and stayed quiet. 

Another manager today mentioned the situation to me that my old coworker painted and (conveniently) left out the part when he told me to go die. Even as a joke, it’s too far.

I'm 16 m 


So what happened was that I joined this class last week. I can he and sat down and there were empty seats all around but me asked if he could sit next to me. Everything seemed normal so I didn't think much of it and said sure. Then while we were having the class, he tells me that he's bisexual outta nowhere I was kinda weirded out but I just said oh cool. 

After school, he  comes to me and  asks me where I'm going, so I tell I'm going to XY and he tags along and says he's going to XX which I close to where I'm going and again it's weird for me but didn't think much of it. On our way to the station he talks about how he's bi and blaa blaa. I just say cool and try to change the topic but he keeps talking about that stuff. I just quietly listen. He then tells me that he has to to the toilet and if I could come with him so I do. He then tells me that he's lost his virginity to both a guy and girl and I was like whatever cool. He tells me that he was in a relationship with someone from our school last year but broke up and recently broke up again with someone else and he's done stuff with him. At this point I was very uncomfortable with this but I didn't say anything. We then get on the train and I put on my earphones and don't talk the whole 30 min journey. 

Next day:
Next day he again tells me that he bisexual     
and I say cool nothing much happens. 
At about 7pm, he messages me about a test we had the next day which I'm pretty sure he already knew everything about. I just keep the conversation short and tell him what he's asked

Next day:
I try to go home asap so I don't have to meet him. Nothing happens so I was relieved and thought that's it maybe it was just a one day thing 

Next day:
It's the last class and I have another class that starts that day. When I go into the classroom, I see him already there so I try to avoid him and sit as far as possible. I go sit on the 2nd row near the teachers desk. He then come to sit in the row in front of me and says 'i think I should sit close to the teacher so I can listen' I knew that was a lie so I act like I don't wanna sit too close to the teacher and go sit on another desk to obviously avoid him. After that just like the day before I go home asap. 

Next day: 
I get to the class before him sit on my usual seat. When he comes, he again sit on the row next to but I didn't say anything. After class ends I go home with another friend so he doesn't come. 

Next day: 
Class goes normal. After class he comes with me again and asks if he can come with me. I didn't wanna sound rude so I just said yes. He asks me what I talked about with my other friend yesterday and I tell him.... And then again he says ' did I tell you I'm bisexual?' I got pissed and said ' yeah you've told me like 5 times'. After that he tells me that he more into guys than girls so I give him this look so he's says ""ha I'm gonna eat you or anything"". He then tells me about how he with another dude that also teaches him math and shit. And that when the dudes mom is at home he teaches him but when she's not they do stuff.  I was VERY VERY uncomfortable at that point. 
I again try to change the topic. After a few minutes, he then asked where I was going I say I'm going to XY and he says ""oh I'm going to YY"" which is 2 stops before mine which was very suspicious to me so I asked what he was gonna do. He says he's meeting a couple of friends in about an hour. When were about to reach the station, I tell him that I'm hungry so I'm gonna get some food he AGAIN says is it alright if I come with you and I say sure but I didn't like it. When were there, I get my food and go sit. The table is pretty much empty but instead of sitting opposite to me, he sits right next to me. At that point I'm really mad but don't say anything.

51,"For tldr read last paragraph. I made a deal with this guy to sell me his iPhone 8 Plus for $320 and my iPhone 7. We both agreed on the deal beforehand since we were traveling pretty far to meet up. 

We met up and dude was like I’m not taking it unless it’s unlocked (which it wasn’t). I was like well you should have asked me about it before meeting up. I tried calling my carrier company to have it unlocked anyway. They said it would take a day or two to have it unlocked.

Since I was sort of desperate for a new phone not willing to go through the trouble of going far again, I negotiated with him. Offered 350 and I’ll pay the rest of the phone when I get home (he originally had the listing for 380 but I didn’t have enough money on me)

He was like alright but I need to keep your old phone so I can be sure that you will pay the rest of it and then I’ll give you your phone back. It took a lot of negotiating and talking back and forth but I admit I put myself in that position. After about an hour and a half we came to that agreement so I gave him 320 cash and 30 on cashapp.

The next day I gave him the last 30. And asked if he could send my phone back. He was nice and cooperative at first, told me he tried getting to the post office but there was traffic and it was closed by the time he got there. But right after that he barely responded to my texts, never told me when he could send it, and eventually stopped replying altogether. I believe he also tried getting more money out of me by filing a dispute to his bank because while I was working, cashapp took 60 more (2 payments of $30) out of my account. I called my bank and got it restored though.

On the one side, regardless of who it actually was, I’m just so ... hurt by the situation. Like, dude, I can’t even relax at my own home?? I know I wasn’t the most careful with my money, but still. This feels exponentially worse when I take into account the fact that whomever stole from me, did so knowing fully well I was unemployed at the time, and that I was living off of savings until I got a new job, _and they still took it, not caring if this was fucking me sideways or not_.

On the other hand, suspicious as I am, I’m not 100% sure who it was that did this. And I feel it’s wrong to consider firing her on account of something I cannot prove. Imagine if she’s innocent, I’m screwing someone for something they did not do.

But the truth is that the data, while not definitive, _heavily_ incriminates her.

I honestly don’t know how to deal with this, or what to do. I’m lucky enough that 1200 is the kind of money I can save in 1 or 2 months and it’s not really going to put a significant dent in my finances, but the idea of having to accept the reality that people that I would trust into my home would throw me under the bus without a second thought ... it’s a bitter pill to swallow.

I’m sad, disappointed, frustrated, angry, and who knows how many other things I’m feeling right now.

How would you deal with the cleaning lady situation? Would you do something? Do you have any opinion of my situation?

I might edit text later on if clarification of something is required.

61,"I feel I've wasted my young adult years and that I can't get that time back. Some background, I'm an aspiring musician and producer who dropped out of high school at 17 because I was dealing with a lot of emotional and family problems. Later that year I got my GED and decided to go to community college for audio engineering. My family's never had much money, so I had to work full time while going to college so I didn't have to take out any debt. Eventually the costs rang up and I was able to leave college with a technical certification in my field but not a degree. It's been a year since then and I've just continued to work my crappy retail job to save money. I'm 22 now so while perhaps the title of wasting my 20s is a bit incorrect I definitely feel old. Most of my coworkers are younger 18-19 in college. Most the people I know my age are either graduated from college and making good money in their careers, or left school like me and are stuck in dead end jobs. I want to save enough money to move out to LA this January and give it a shot at being a musician and audio engineer, but I fear I've already lost my opportunity to do so based on my age. I see so many successful musicians out there who are 18, 19, sometimes even 17. So I fear me moving would just be a last ditch effect to ""make my artistic dreams come true"" and keep my youth. I know it probably sounds ridiculous, but I feel old. And seeing so many successful people around me, both my age and younger, makes me feel like I've wasted valuable years if my life.",18Jul2019,25

69,"I’m sorry if this is convoluted. I’m trying to keep details anonymous.

TL;DR: I’m being denied my new job so they’re keeping me in my old job. My enthusiastic replacement doesn’t know yet and will be crushed.  Who should tell her? 

For the past few years, I worked for the same company at Job B. I have also done Job A, but didn’t like it as much. It was a lateral move to go to job B, but much less stress and more enjoyable/rewarding. The lead boss is the same for all of these jobs.

I’ve been going to school for my master’s to get training for job C. The person with job C is leaving, so I applied for it. During my interview, I was very clear that I had not yet finished the training, I had only one more course to complete (out of 12) but that I would be finished in December.  My boss and department checked with the higher ups and everything was fine - I would need to submit all of my schoolwork thus far (transcripts and a letter saying I was still enrolled) but that wouldn’t be a problem. So, I got Job C!! Nothing would take effect until 2 months from the interview but that was fine with me.

In the meantime, our boss leaves and we get a new one. He’s nice enough but very impersonal. On Monday, he calls me and says he’s concerned because I haven’t finished the program. I explain to him what we talked about over a month ago when I got hired by old boss, and how the final class wasn’t an issue and in fact, others in different departments had done something similar. I gave him the contact info of the higher-ups and the dates we spoke. 

He calls me on Tuesday and says that because I’m not finished, I cannot take Job C. I have to stay in Job B. I’m disappointed, but it’s okay. I like my current job and know that if new boss sucks, I can easily go somewhere else after December. (I really think new boss is just being a dick or he’s confused on something and was just like, forget it, but I’m not confrontational and I feel like I have to let it go.)

But here’s my problem. The person in Job A is ecstatic to be taking over my job (Job B). The transition was supposed to start 3 Mondays from now. I don’t see her often in person, but she has been messaging me about how excited she is for the new opportunity and can’t wait to take over, etc. I was really happy for her but now she’s going to have to stay in Job A. BUT NO ONE HAS TOLD HER THAT. It’s been 2 days and she doesn’t know yet (she messaged me tonight asking about something with job B.) I have ignored it because I don’t know what to say! I don’t feel like it’s my place and I know she’s going to be crushed. What should I do? I have asked my immediate supervisor to ask boss to tell her ASAP, but what else should I be doing?  

I’m also so scared they’re going to make me take Job A back just because she was already hired for Job B. We are both getting screwed here but I am fine going back to Job B until I can figure out what to do next. I just really don’t want to go back to A, but I know she doesn’t either!",18Jul2019,1

Went to GP and she said it’s Balanitis. Put me on antifungal medication, didn’t work.

She said sure, but then had something come up and had to cancel. Haven't talked in about two years, but I see her once or twice a week at my summer job, we say hi, and that's about it.

84,"Background:  I am a 21 year old electrician working in a small town of 36 people. I graduated from college and I'm about to make the next step in my life. 

For the last three years I have been planning to take over my employers business. I am on my way to earning my electrical contractors license so I can fully operate the business alone. The company operates in a 150 mile radius of the main location and is located in a very small town. A town which includes a fire hall, post office, and a bar. That is it. There are a few larger towns twenty-five miles away. One with a population of 7,000 and one 22,000.

90,"I used to live in a big city, recently relocated to a different state for (my first) new job since graduating college.  Never needed a car nor learned to drive while in the city.  Practiced driving for a few months with an instructor (about 15 lessons total) and got my license two months ago.  For a few weeks after I got my license, my dad would take me driving everyday for an hour as a favor to help me get more comfortable behind the wheel.

My boyfriend of three years lives 2.5 hours away from me (about 3-3.5 hours with traffic).  The past few weekends, he's been driving up to visit me.  I rent a bedroom of a single family house, and I am not allowed to have any guests overnight, so whenever he would visit, we would stay at a hotel.  However, this gets pricey fast.  

He shares an apartment with roommates, but they're fine with me spending the weekend.  I haven't visited him yet because I've been nervous to drive that far by myself.  I have driven on highways for long distances before (most notably I drove four hours straight on the interstate when relocating states), but each time I've always had someone in the car with me to help navigate and make me feel comfortable. I drive to work everyday which is a half hour each way, though it is all local roads with no highways and not much traffic.  

I am a competent driver, I think.  It's only been two months of course, but I've taken a defensive driving course, and I practice safe habits like never using my phone and staying at the speed limit.  However, I have some anxiety, and I'm a little worried about driving for that long by myself at 65 miles per hour.  Additionally, no matter how careful I am, I am still inexperienced with driving and definitely not the best driver around.  Plus, it is supposed to rain heavily tomorrow, which also worries me about the driving conditions and visibility issues I'll face.

But I miss my boyfriend a lot and if the only thing stopping us from seeing each other is a few hours drive, why not do it?  He offered to drive up again himself, but I feel bad that he's always making this drive, and we would save maybe $500 on hotel and takeout fees this weekend if I went to see him instead.  On the other hand, my car insurance is already huge because I am a young and new driver.  An accident would make it astronomically high.

So, I don't know what to do.  I don't think I can make an objective decision because I am emotional both to see my boyfriend but also in my anxiety around driving.  I wasn't feeling this anxious about the drive (I was actually feeling quite confident about it up until today), but while driving on the interstate just to practice a little today, I saw two really bad accidents on the side of the road, and it freaked me out a little.

I won't waste your time with too much fluff, so here's the story. My boyfriend, roommate and I have been sharing an apartment for the summer. We all agreeded that we would rent from June until August. However, my roommate just informed me she's moving out next week and wants to know if she should pay last months rent.

I am torn. Here's my thoughts...
1- She won't be living here, that's unfair to make her pay.
2- She's leaving with little to no heads up, and we had planned financially to be splitting the apartment 3 ways.

-My roommate has been wildly inconsiderate all summer.
-My boyfriend and I are going to continue to live here after she leaves.
-Her mom pays her rent, so not her money were talking about, but still matters I think (?).

93,"I'll give the shortest rundown I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I've been in college since I was 14. I'm taking core classes (which gives me credit for both high school and college), with intentions to major in something related to programming, at the least. I was interested in mechatronics, but robots aren't exactly my niche.

&amp;#x200B;

It's truly an amazing program. I don't have to pay a dime, I can take as many classes as I handle, and I can probably have a bachelor's degree by the time I graduate high school (or a little bit after).

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few years since I took the plunge. However, I've come to a bit of a realization. That I might be wasting my ""exploration years"", if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I could insert a long paragraph here about my embarrassing social life, but basically: I don't have a lot of friends, especially right now.

When I got into high school, I just gave up on having a ""clique"", and I inserted myself into my work. There were weeks where all I can remember is reading and writing essays, barely stepping out of my room or my house for anything unless I had a class (I usually take online classes over the summer). Besides my family, I did not talk to anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I got a job. One of my coworkers was a friend I had in high school, and we hung out not too long ago. 

But it brought me to a realization: I haven't even used that term in years-- ""hung out"". Talking with someone other than my family, and going out to eat, and actually doing something normal-- what had I been doing with my life?

&amp;#x200B;

I had so many people tell me to ""slow down, don't try to be an adult now, wait a little, make friends"", but it never truly occurred to me that it seemed like I was wasting my time. I've been spending all of this time, trying to make sure that my adult self lives somewhat an okay life-- saving up money, counting costs on everything, planning for an apartment, a job, and a car that I don't even have.

&amp;#x200B;

College has taken such a toll on me. Of course, this is nothing big, but it seems like every week now, my family finds another gray hair of mine. I'm always so exhausted, pulling all-nighters for college, constantly in a rush to get to my laptop so that I can work on whatever assignments are due. Job is just as terrible. I'm in so much pain, and my mind will be so... discombobulated. I just blank out sometimes. Is this supposed to be the life of a 16 year old? Is this how I'm supposed to live?

&amp;#x200B;

So many other people I know experience so much more stress than I do, and I don't think my case is unique at all-- but I don't think it's healthy. Am I wasting my time? What should I even do with myself, at this point?",18Jul2019,3
94,"Hello guys, I'm 18 going on 19 and I've been homeschooled all my life so I've never gotten a chance to make friends outside of the internet. I have horrible social skills, absolutely no hobbies, nothing I'm good at (because it's hard for me to be interested in something) and I'm not even fully schooled. I'm at a 6th grade level, so I have barely any knowledge in anything. I have the hardest time talking to people, I can never think of anything to continue a conversation :\\ and when I do it's very lame. I'm moving in the fall which means I can start making friends IRL but I feel like I'm never going to be able to if I can barely speak or think of any topics to talk about. I feel so helpless because no matter how hard I try I can never think of anything, my brain is dead.

97,"So this girl I met in my prom group junior year added me on Instagram and I decided the other day to start talking to her since we had a fun time taking at prom. We were having great convos and quickly moved to snapchat to talk more. While she didn’t really start conversations, once we got into one, she would ask follow ups and change topics to something else once we were done with the last one, so I felt pretty good about it generally. We had been talking for about 3 days now and she was hanging out with a group of people and one guy I knew from my school (who kinda dislikes me but we don’t really talk). Soon we were communicating thru snap videos and memeing with each other and I was talking with the guy and the girl in question for a while. All in all, it was pretty good. The next day she was with that group again and we resumed the convos. However, she video called me thru snap and when I picked up and said hi she and the guy started laughing and kinda ignoring me while talking to each other. She told him to tell me what he said about me and he wouldn’t and then she told me to hang up and text him. I text him and he says he doesn’t know what I’m talking about. She texts me that he’s in love with me (knowing her and the guy likely a joke) and I told her I was confused. After about 30 mins she responded and said “hahahaha why?” And I didn’t respond because I was tired and really busy at the time. fast forward to today where I sent her a streak pic and it’s been a few hours and no response, even tho she’s posting on her story. I’m really not sure where to go from here as we seemed to be hitting it off and I’m not sure how to act in this situation as it was really weird  and I don’t wanna fuck it up.

103,"I'm 19, and my dad is 47. 

My dad is a big guy (talking 6'0"" and ~400lbs), and was having some symptoms Tuesday night. Wednesday morning he went into the hospital, and his troponin level was .08. I saw him (today)Thursday morning, and was there when they told him his levels raised to .47 in about 7 hours.

It was some form of silent heart attack. He went in for an angiogram and they found 3 blockages. In his lower right valve it was 97% blocked, the valve that goes around the back was 90% blocked, and his upper right valve was only 40% blocked. They put stints in the two serious ones and left the third alone for now. They say his heart was not badly damaged.

He needed something to kick his ass into gear for losing weight and he is very much going to. I know it for certain.

But he is our only provider, providing for me and my older brother. Along with helping out my stepmom (who doesn't live with us yet and has been struggling lately) and her two kids (my step Brothers).

I'm very close to him, and I consistently feel like crying. I'm so scared he will die and leave us all alone. He was completely awake and having no symptoms since Tuesday night, and was pissed he was still there until he got the troponin level news this morning. 

How should I help him? I have a part time job and will help with money as much as possible. I also want to be a nurse when I'm older and will help him recover as best as I can. But what else should I do for him? How can I help him?

Past that, what should I do about money? How long will he be out of work? What if we can't pay our bills? Should I drop out of college and get another job?

106,"Warning, ramble ahead. 

I work as a pet groomer and while it doesn't pay much (or enough, as I make £10 per pet) I LOVE the job. Right now I'm not in school but I'll be in a month and my school schedule clashes with my work schedule. My school is one hour away from where my job is, so that means that I'll have to leave work early and go straight to school since I have about one hour and a half to get to my classes. I don't have a car, so this adds extra pressure on me to get to school on time. Plus, my clothes end up all wet, covered in hair and smelling of wet dog and I wouldn't have time to change for school. 

Besides time, I have the extra stress of being the only employee besides the owner. It's a small business and there used to be 3 of us, but the owner (my boss) fired the other girl, leaving me completely alone with my boss. I have to work 6 days a week because of this, 6-8 hours a day. I can't miss work since my boss is not capable of working by herself (she's an old lady) and I need the money. This creates a big problem. I don't think I'll be able to leave early because there's no one to cover me after I leave. So, how do I ensure that I get to school on time if I can't leave early? And I can't really change my class schedule without having to leave school late at night (if I push back my starting time).  

I don't know how to sort this out. I desperately wish to go back to Uni; I had to drop out last year due to money troubles and now that I finally have the opportunity things like these happen. I don't want to leave my job, it's one of the best things that has happened to me in a long time. Unfortunately it's brought up so many inconveniences; I can't have vacations, money is always tight, and my boss is a pain in the arse sometimes. I've talked to my parents about this and they say I should quit my job. I don't know, the idea of having to tell my boss that I won't be working there anymore stresses me out (old lady and no one else to work for me). What should I do?",18Jul2019,2

We live in the countryside and usually the rabbits run when you get too close. I wasnt there when they found it but mum found a really tiny bun. Not super young just small enough to be mistaken for a wood rat or mouse It didnt take off at all when she apparched it and cuddled up in her hands when she picked it up.

Grandma certain its orphaned because the whole time weve lived here. Not once was a baby that young left alone so close to the open or really seen in general. Mom would always have the babies with them, but usually when a bit older than this.

At first we were certain it would die within the hour but after we placed it in the tub with straw and lettuce and carrots that we grow. It began to perk up and is now resting under some shredded towel after eating and taking a tiny poop.

We plan on releasing it of course once its better or bigger?

108,Every year my Aunt Tina has a summer gathering. She saves her money to put on a shin dig every year. It probably cost her about two hundred dollars. None of my family members have any money so it’s kinda a big deal that she does this. I’d say half of the people in my family don’t have jobs because there just are no jobs. Nobody in my family would even bother to do something like this. It’s just the way my family is. So anyways every year I have two uncles that just show up high and drunk and end up just stealing the food and alcohol and drinks and bring it back to there place. When asked about it they always say they didn’t. I literally have video of my one uncle loading a garbage bag and skipping out on his bike. My question is what can be done? Nobody does anything because there’s no confrontation in my family also I tell my Aunt Tina just not to invite them but she then tells me that it would just break grannies heart knowing they are not there. One of the uncles has a decent job and I tried talking to him but he says to mind my business where I have none. Should I just stay out of it?

Well she has behaving well and been doing everything without them asking (like chore) and buying them food and drinks. Yesterday her parents told her to send her the plan and she will be able to go. I spent 2 hours planning and we both were really excited as it would be our first trip together. We bought tickets and other shit we had to reserve in advance. She got home from work an hour ago and her parents just decided to tell her she can’t go anymore because she’s irresponsible and untrustworthy, even though they said yes yesterday.

124,"Summary at bottom—

Hi. My parents would have been in a much better position right now if they got a better education, so I should feel I should learn from their mistakes and make the best out of it to get a good education.

I have found that to get into good colleges, to have a couple specific passions would be helpful, because it makes you stand out unlike being well rounded.

I have many hobbies and passions... list: play multiple instruments, soccer, lacrosse, explorers (helps for military school and leadership skills), love to draw, excellent grades, and I’m trying to make a club for tutoring at my school.  I would be happy about playing a sport and practicing hard to possibly get a scholarship... but I am not sure that’s not even possible, being a 5 foot girl goalkeeper in soccer I doubt will get to play in college and I am not sure about lacrosse. Also, I love the subject of biology, and think that it is very interesting and would love to learn more about it.

Ive talked to friends about it, I could go into a community college and then a four year, though it doesn’t really make sense with my high grades. Having great grades in high school somewhat compares to a couple years in community college.

Also...my parents can’t pay for an expensive college, so scholarships and grants are my best option. I’ve looked around, and some schools provide full scholarships to students of high excellence yet low income, so there’s that too.

We've been friends since high school and grow closer ever since, but our relationship has had its ups and downs, mostly because of my love for him.

Like, after we graduated from high school I shut down any communication with him and our common friends because he never really showed any interest on me and I thought it was the best way to get over him.

And for 1 year it kinda worked, I was able to focus on me and my new University life, until one day our paths crossed again at the entrance of my university, at first I wanted to ignore him but it was like all the feelings came back and there I was talking to him again. (This happened on late 2016)

After we mend our friendship and got more confidence, we planned a trip to a near village at the shore of a lake. It was him, me and 3 other friends. Before the trip he promised me that the first night at the hotel we could take some drinks to our room (We shared the same room) and spend the night drinking and talking, that of course make the trip a lot nicer for me (And saw an opportunity to get close to him and see if he liked me too). And that night came and we got the drinks and all, but for my surprise he invited our 3 friends to join, which didn't bothered me at first, but later I felt it like a real bad treason to his promise. After the trip I felt bad all the way home, I was and miserable because of the memories of that night, so I cut him out again a week later. (This happened on late 2017)

After the shut him down again, I was not very happy, I miss him badly but I felt like I had to stick with that decision. But like 6 months into 2018, he talked to me again and we retake our friendship from where we left it, but his disinterest for me continued to bother me for the whole year, which I suck it up to keep our friendship good

Now 2019 has been a crazy year for me, I've been through some rough times and I need to regain control in my life. 

Like on May/June of this year, I almost shut him down again because of his disinterest on me was getting on my nerves, which finally blew off when he cancelled our plan to go to the theater. I felt bad that day and I didn't talk to him like for 2 days and then I tell him that we needed to talk.

We met a Thursday and I told him how I felt with his disinterest and that I didn't know why we where friends on the first place. To what he reply saying that he thought our friendship was better than ever and that he really care about me and that he treats me different that any of his other friends but he doesn't know how to show his feelings to other people. He also ask me why I shut him from my life years ago, but I really couldn't tell him that it was because I love him. But overall he was happy that I talked to him and didn't shut him out for a third time.

Now I think we are in a good position, we see each other every Saturday and this two first weeks of July we saw each other almost everyday.

But I think he know I liked him, I think he knew the whole time, and as I was saying I need to regían control in my life. So here's my request for advice: recently I came out as gay to one of my closest friends, Laura, everything went well and she supports me. I also told her about how in love I'm with James and she thinks I need to tell him everything, but I'm not sure. 

James is straight, but he likes to get touchy-feely when where just us two and sometimes I think he is bi. 

Well at this point I don't really care if he rejects me or not as a boyfriend, I need to close this chapter, but I'm afraid that if I tell him the truth our friendship will be really ruined and I can't stand the idea of losing him. 

So what should I do, tell him the truth and close this chapter or keep this secret and keep his friendship?",18Jul2019,1
137,"I'll try to keep this brief. 

About a month ago I got my oil changed by a mechanic by my house. Everything seemed to have been fine and I carried on. A few days ago I started to notice a puddle of oil in my parking spot coming from my car. I decide to take it to the dealership who proceeded to tell me that my oil pan gasket was stripped by whoever changed my oil last. Well, clearly it must have been the mechanic before and just didn't tell me. Otherwise, if it was clear my gasket was stripped why didn't they just tell me?   


So now I'm out $500 since I had to get all that replaced, and I'm pretty miffed at the previous mechanic. I notice they have a pretty big presence on Yelp(they typically respond to all negative reviews within 24 hours). However, my friend suggested confronting them in person (I have both receipts) and demanding some kind of compensation rather than leaving a poor review. I'm not sure what route to take.

140," 

My first long term relationship, and first relationship ever came crashing down after half a year of long-distance because of college. I initiated no contact and after 4 months of silence we met up once I was back in town. I had seen other girls after it ended but kept this from her when she asked. I'm not sure why, I guess I just didn't want her to get jealous, I didn't want her to see me as some sort of player, but of course, she found out and this caused a rift. Still, feelings remained and we made up and entered this weird one foot out the door pseudo-relationship where she constantly kept me at arm's length while continuing to pull me in, once or twice she'd try to end it but she'd change her mind or I'd convince her to keep trying. By the end, it was causing more pain than pleasure, her reluctance, and indecision about wanting me especially after I broke her trust stunted any chance of developing feelings, and her distance made me afraid of getting to close that I'd break my own heart when she left, so I kept mine aswell. We spoke one night and she ended it, 100%, saying she viewed no future with me, she saw me as this sex-addicted guy who only thought with his dick, and that she could never see me the same way, and that I was unaware of it. I cried, it hurt, hearing her say these things about me, knowing she believed them 100%. I wasn't in love with her but I still loved her, strangely enough despite the breakup and the silence she still knew me better than anyone and I considered her one of my closest friends.

I did learn that, at least at this point in time, as the people we are now, a relationship between us would only breed more pain, and that I don't want to be with someone who's constantly unsure if she wants to be with me, someone who makes me think love is hard.

Now though, I don't know what I want. I want multiple things but they all contradict. I want to liberate myself sexually, to explore myself and the wonders of pleasure with all the beautiful girls I turned away while in the relationship. I want to not worry about breaking someone's heart or having mine broken and just talk, fuck, and cuddle with beautiful interesting people. I want to meet fun people and expand my sexual horizons and have experiences with them that I can learn from and really enjoy. I'm so horny all the time and I want to find people to release that with.

But at the same time, I want to love someone. I want to be caught like a deer in the headlights by the blinding burning passion of it again, to be able to kiss someone and lose myself in their lips. I want to feel nervous about a person because I just think they're so amazing, to just absolutely freeze when they look at me and melt when they smile. I want to meet someone who can make me feel pure, innocent love again. No second-guessing, no indecisiveness, a leap of faith, to fall in love and be caught.

So yeah, that's my dilemma, I want sex, I'm young, hot, and horny and I want to find young people like me who just want to have fun and create experiences and explore each others' bodies without emotional repercussions. But I also want to feel unbridled love and avoid meaningless empty relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just cut myself off from women for a while and focus on myself? If so how do I resist the temptations that appear before me?

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel conflicted and lost. I don't know what I should want, or what I want. What do I do?

143,"I’m a 17M high school student and I have a good-ish amount of friends, but I’ve been feeling down since the latter half of the school year, leading into summer. After I got to know a bit more of my newer friend group, I’ve started taking a look at myself a bit more and I realized I don’t really have a personality, and when personality does show I feel like a burden or an asshole. 

I’m very deadpan, can’t make a decision to save my life, don’t have any hobbies, anger/annoyed easily,  don’t know what I wanna do with my life and I’m too afraid to speak my mind because 80% of the time I either say something dumb or insulting by accident. My looks don’t help either, being “heavy” doesn’t really boast my confidence and being a picky eater is just salt in the wound.

Even though I’ve known this newer friend group for over a year now, they still feel like a group of strangers to me. I even went on to do this contest thing with one of them where I got to spend pretty much all my time with them, and I still feel like they’re on a completely different social status then I am.

I’m hoping to get therapy but honestly, my family often forgets/prolongs shit unless it’s on a list, and even then we have a white board we’re we write down stuff and forget(We’ve been meaning to develop photos from my laptop for about 2 years now, and it’s still on that damn white board)

147,"I am away from home at an undergrad-level internship for the summer and have a few weeks left. It's slowly worn down on me, I like what I do and I like being here, but I value human relationships a lot and I haven't been able to make friends with any of the other program participants (my age), or even really get along with the people I've been working with (a bit older). Even when I just ask a quick question to someone I work with, they look at me funny. I feel awkward around them since they have an established friend-group dynamic at work and then I'm just there; I'm very introverted to new people at first and they're all very extroverted.

If a memo sent to my entire work group (including people who work here all the time) says something like ""ok guys try to improve this or I'll need to start talking to you all privately,"" I'm convinced it's all about me. Also me and the other participants are working a lot obviously so there is very limited time to make friends. This has led me to feel very alone all the time.

I feel alone having nobody to talk to or be friends with, then start spiraling a bit, by losing my confidence and getting anxious all the time. I like what I do but I'm tired all the time, want to go home soon, and I miss my family, boyfriend, and friends back home/at school and it's negatively impacting my work performance and self-esteem.

I try to enjoy my time off work but I inevitably have a couple hours of work to do when I get off work hours and I'm too tired and don't have enough money to go out every night to distract myself.

I'm only here for a few more weeks so am unable to see a counselor or therapist. What are some short-term replacements for going to therapy?

148,"So we have a dog that we've had for about 2 years now, we have disciplined her to do what she is told and what is has to do like peeing outside and on ONLY newspapers. 

But for the couple of months of having her indoor (she's an outdoor dog) she has been peeing everywhere she also bites the cat which I think would give the cat trauma because of all the hard biting she gives. Our cat stays in my grandmothers room (for some time in a day) to keep our dog from biting. 

She also bites us multiple times (every morning and night) very hardly and it always hurts to the point my grandma has bite marks on her feet. Today our dog showed her teeth and started growling at us while we were eating my grandma and her had a hustle and she was barking at her. My mom told me to slowly go upstairs which I did and immediately put the cat in my grandmothers room. 

She is completely fine when she isn't so hyper and we're alone but my mom and grandmother are getting stressed we have trained her but I don't think we can do it anymore with all the moving we have to do.  

Extra bits of into : she has destroyed  our furniture which have been with my grandmother for years. (Very expensive) and also broken all our shoes which also are expensive to get with our money problems.

149,"TRIGGER WARNING
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE


this genuinely a pretty fucked up thing i know. so, i’m somebody who was sexually abused when i was very young. because of that i have some quite horrible thoughts and at times... glorify abuse and my own childhood sexual abuse. it makes me feel disgusting and it’s very dark but i’m trying to work through it with a psychologist.


okay but i worry my boyfriend is only with me because i look young for my age. we are 18 and 19 and have been dating for a year. when he was 17 he was talking to a girl who was literally 13. 
it makes me fucking sick.
he says they talked for a bit but decided it wouldn’t work because of the age thing.
this girl presents her self to be quite mature as she is in the fashion/modelling industry. 

even worse because of my fucking brain i’m actually insanely jealous of this girl who is now 15. i feel like he’s only with me because it’s too fucked up in societies eyes for him to be with her. 

i know her pretty well and she opened up to me about her own sexual abuse when she was a kid. 

the whole situation puts me in a very, very dark place mentally and i as much i almost don’t want to bring it up with him because i can’t help glorifying this type of behaviour, i know how this is effecting me and really fucking with my head.

150,"Hey guys, I’m in need of advice about relationships with friends. I’m in high school and have two groups of friends, one group of friends from school and one group of other friends that don’t go to my school. Throughout the school year I slowly drifted apart from my school friend group due to peer pressure with drugs and awkward nervousness when hanging around new people. I feel that the longer I go without hanging out with them the more I feel like an outsider or outcast. The problem is that my school friends sometimes a lot of fun and are the ones that I would go to parties and to meet people with but are also the ones that pressure me into doing things and are generally more toxic and negative people. On the other hand some of my closest friends don’t go to school with me and I feel far more comfortable hanging with them but we don’t go to parties and meet girls because neither of us are very popular. My friends that don’t go to school are not as frequently available meaning that I have spent a lot of the summer alone and bored.

My dilemma is that I wonder if I should try to rekindle my relationship with my school friends that are fun but also toxic or should instead find a group of friends at school that I like more and keep hanging with my out of school friends.

154,"I recently began a new job in sales. It's my first ""sales-y"" job in the typical sense of sitting on the computer, sending cold emails and making cold calls all day. Up until the past couple of weeks I was receiving copious amounts of praise for my progress from my boss - not because I've made any sales, but because of my work ethic I guess. She bragged on me constantly to my peers and her higher-ups. Suddenly though, it seems it has stopped, though I feel my work flow has improved greatly (had a lot of trouble concentrating and did not feel I was very productive the first several weeks). 

&amp;#x200B;

From the beginning, I have noticed inconsistencies with what she says and does. For example, during the five-step interview process, she asked me if I would be comfortable keeping up with an expected 80 cold emails per day. In another interview, she said she expected 50 emails per day. This immediately struck me as very odd, but I really needed a job so I told myself it was nothing to be concerned about and I said nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, numerous examples of this mind-changing has come up, and she never acknowledges it. Being new to the industry, the conflicting advice and expectations were very confusing to me, so I finally started asking for clarity. I made sure to be very respectful and not throw blame in any way so as not to get on her bad side. Every time I bring something up for clarity though, it seems she's never actually listening as she's champing at the bit to talk over me, saying things like ""Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey -- why would you do that? That's silly, do it the way I'm telling you instead."" It wouldn't be so bad if she acknowledged that she did previously give this advice/instruction/expectation, but has since changed her mind. But it's almost like she actually has no recollection of ever saying any of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was concerned the problem was me, so I spoke with a coworker about it and he agreed he's noticed this pattern, but would prefer to just roll with it. I am someone that needs clear direction though - I like to have a method and list of to-dos, that way I can focus and be my most productive. During every meeting I started taking notes on her instructions, expectations, company updates, tactics, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week we had our weekly team meeting and she had us write up our own 12-step sales method plans and present them to the group for review. She approved each of our plans, then said we needed to start our method-cycles tomorrow by sending out 300 cold emails to new prospects. THREE HUNDRED. 3-0-0: I wrote it down. Everyone was silent. She called each of us out and said, ""that's doable, right?"" My coworkers mumbled in agreement, but I voiced my concern that 300 was quite high, far more than I was averaging daily, and I wasn't sure I could reasonably meet that expectation. She wasn't intentionally condescending, but I felt very dumb when she responded, ""You should be able to send out that many. I can send 100 personalized emails in about two hours. You just actually have to *work* a full day"" - implying that I do not work 9-5 daily. She ended it by saying we need to be sending at least 100-200 a day. Ok, noted.

&amp;#x200B;

After the meeting I spoke with my coworker about the increased expectation, asking if he didn't think it wasn't actually a little unreasonable considering we were told anywhere from 50 to 80 before. He agreed it was but he was going to give it a go. Ok, me too. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started really busting my ass, hardly taking a break from the computer, starting work earlier, taking shorter lunches, and working later. I managed to pump out 150 emails the first day and about 300 the next (and it was extremely stressful).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, one week later. Time for my weekly 1-on-1 meeting with my boss. The moment we start talking she seems very skeptical of all my work. She is reviewing my profile in our CRM from her admin portal and questioning everything, pointing out any negative she could. I get it, she has to be diligent and be sure the work is being done, so I calmly explained everything I had been doing. She told me to bring up my profile and show her there, so I did. She asked how many companies I've been emailing each day and I tell her 150 since we began our approved individual sales methods. She said ""That's great, great progress."" Okay, good. But because I have been so stressed with this new expectation I bring it up again that I don't feel it's sustainable for me and I would feel more comfortable bringing it down to about 100 per day."" Suddenly she's in a tizzy and asking, ""Why are you sending that many in one day? That's too many, you should be doing 40 to 50, and then a few days later adding maybe 20 more. 100 a day is way too much!""

&amp;#x200B;

Uh. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I remind her that the reason I'm doing that many is because during our meeting last week she instructed us to reach out to 300 leads in one day, and I expressed concerns about that, to which she responded that it needed to at least be 100-200.

&amp;#x200B;

Her response: ""I would **never** say that. I would **never** tell you to send 300 in one day.""

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know how to respond. I didn't want to be disrespectful and call her out, but I also wanted to defend myself. I just ended up saying okay, I'm going to keep going the way I am now, and in the next cycle I'll do less per day. But honestly I was so frustrated I wanted to cry. I literally have it written in the notes from last week's meeting '300???', and under that 'at least 100-200'.

&amp;#x200B;

Our company is pretty small, and there really isn't anyone else I can speak to about this aside from my coworkers. I would like to be like them and just ""roll with it"", but that just isn't how I flow and the inconsistencies are creating lose-lose situations for me in conversation with my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still new to the job and want to stick it out, plus money is really tight so just quitting isn't an option. But this is really stressful. And it might sound like a silly stretch, but the unacknowledged mind-changing thing + talking down to me when I'm confused about conflicting info is something my ex did while gaslighting me, and this situation with my boss is bringing up some really painful feelings from then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought trusty Reddit might have some good advice. How would you guys approach this situation? Say something? Say nothing? Jump around with the ever-changing instructions or ignore them and do it my way anyway?

&amp;#x200B;

Bless you for reading this far, or for scrolling in search of the TL;DR.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My boss gives conflicting information/advice/instructions/expectations constantly, and then denies it when I ask for clarification. This makes me feel both dumb and like I will never be able to meet her expectations, because they are always changing. How would you handle this?

&amp;#x200B;

After we got the water we left, and an hour later I saw the same guy again, this time he was walking with his friends towards us, and once he passed us, I turned my head around to look at him, and at the same time he turned his head around and we made eye contact. 

After that happened, I told my friends that I thought he was cute and that we kept making obvious eye contact. They wanted me to approach to him, but I was too shy to do that. Later, my friends told me that he was walking towards us again, and when he was about my shoulder distance I looked at him and we made eye contact again. This time he approached to me and asked me why I was starring at him, I told him that I wasn’t but then he grabbed my hand gently and he told me “let’s go dance.” He asked for my name, and basic questions, he also asked me if I was going to an event that was happening the next day, and I told him that I wasn’t. After the song ended he told me that he needed to go to the restroom, so I went to dance with my friends who were dancing right next to us. I told them what he told me, and they said that he looked a little egocentric, (because he said that I was the one starring at him) and a little too full of himself. Those words made me doubt if he was going to come back to dance with me, so I told them that we could leave (since we were about to leave before he asked me to dance). When we were leaving, I saw him walking from the restroom towards the place we were dancing at. 

When I got home, I realized that I used to have him on an old ig account so I searched him up, and my sister followed him without my permission because she saw that I was interested in him. I unfollowed him right away, but now my question is, should I send him a request? Should I try talking to him? He really got my attention last night. 

I told my sisters the story above and how my friends said that he looked like he was too full of himself, my sisters said that I shouldn’t judge him before getting to know him, because him saying that I was starring at him, could have only been a way to flirt with me. Now idk what to do.",18Jul2019,1

My sister usually tends to go for white or hispanic (but mainly white),tall, bearded men around her age. As far as them having their shit together idk. Not too long ago i saw a text msg convo between her and bestie talking about how my sister doesn’t really find him attractive but she thinks hes sweet. The other day she went on date with the guy and when they left he kissed her. I know because txt convo with her bestie. So i was pretty fucking mad because she didnt tell me anything, she never does.

161,"I’m 20, and I don’t want to be 80 and wish I had “done more”, as this is what most people regret of their younger years. However-I also want to be financially responsible. I’ll explain further-

My all time favorite band (since I was around 7)  broke up when I was 12. They were never super huge, but had a cult following from MySpace. Because of this, I never got to see them or get any merchandise. I thought they were broken up forever, and was heartbroken as their music had gotten me through a lot of trauma and a rough childhood. However-last year around this time, they announced a one night only reunion tour in their hometown several states away. My boyfriend and I went, and it was incredible. Easily the best concert I’ve ever been to, and one of the best experiences of my life. 

For the past few months, my boyfriend and I have been saving up to get our first apartment together. We’re in no rush, but it’s still something we’re working towards. 

A few days ago, however, this band announced they’re doing it AGAIN, this year will be a LOT more organized, and they’re essentially pulling out all the stops for this “reunion part 2”. 

This issue is-even if my boyfriend and I go as cheap as possible, we will still be spending a few hundred dollars on hotel/flight/transportation/food/etc. While that won’t break the bank, that money would get us one step closer to moving in together. 

As cheesy as it is, this band saved my life multiple times and got me through a really dark time. I experienced a “once in a lifetime opportunity” by going to their show last year, but now that they’re doing it again, I really want to go. The tickets go on sale on Friday and last year they sold out in seconds. 


Should I just say fuck it and go? Should I make the “adult” decision and save the money for getting an apartment? I’m split between logic and longing.",18Jul2019,1

I am only a casual so at any moment I can be cut, however, I trust my boss enough not to do that currently.

Not long after I applied for said second job, things started going great at my original job. Boss needed me a lot more and was really grateful for my help as well. Pay was good, everything was fine. Now I've just returned from a two week holiday and have found out this second job has been trying to get in contact with me for the last few days about a possible casual position as well. I'm worried with university beginning soon again and the possibility of having 2 jobs where each week I don't know what hours or days I may be working may conflict and mean that I perform worse overall in both my studies and work.

My current job also recently hired a couple of new employees, no real problem but my hours definitely took a hit (normally I would get 20+ but have only received 11 for the week). I have only just returned from holiday though so they may not want me working my usual 20 hour weeks as of yet... I guess that is problem with being casual meaning you never know for sure.

I'm at university 2 days a week and ideally don't want to work weekends as I tend to study on weekends and spend time with girlfriend.

176,"Hello everyone, 

I was neglected and abused until I escaped at 19 ish so I was severely behind on dental care when I got into uni. Over the past years I finally caught up on the cavities (except one tooth had to get ripped out on the way), still in debt but hey, only one had to get ripped out.

I am on a strict budget. I work as many hours as I can and even with that I can just barely pay the bills and food and rent. I have maxed out emergency bursaries at uni. I barely have enough money to make it until next semester. I cannot afford an x-ray to see how serious it is (the last one was done 2 or 3 yrs ago).

About 3 months ago, for a few weeks, the pain became almost unbearable. I almost went to hospital, but I'm used to surviving excruciating pain so I sucked it up. Then it went away, and for a while it hadn't been too painful.

As for my ""family"". Most are very dangerous people. I have been almost strictly no contact for almost 4 years. I needed to cut even the not so bad ones off, you could only understand that of you were me. All of them are pretty broke from what I heard, except for my grandparents. They give their children inheritances, so yeah they are pretty decently off. I do not know if it is even appropriate to ask them, if they could help, and if they would. Would it be selfish to ask them?

Almost a year ago, a kind person was able to get me on a waitlist for probono work. They keep saying ""it will be any day now"".

It is probably stupid for me to have waited so long without considering serious consequences, but hey, I do it all by myself so I didnt exactly have anyone to support me or give me advice.

From what I hear if you wait too long it could cause serious complications (e.g. more teeth have to be ripped out). 

Sometimes I seriously want to set up a gofundme, but perhaps that is selfish. After all, it is not like I am an orphan ' I have ""family"" - I just need to stay away from them. But if my grandparents are well off, shouldn't I at least ask? 

For next semester, I get a little extra student loans, which means if I take the minimum courses I will have almost $1000 to spare (If I only survive and never do anything fun at all). That could cover almost half of it, but still I probably need them all out at the same time. 

All I know if I will never let myself have more healthy teeth ripped out. I cannot go through that again (not to mention it would just cost more in the long run).

Am I supposed to do this all on my own and suffer the consequences or am I supposed to ruthlessly seek out help? Forgive me for not knowing, I am very much not familiar with how people do things due to my abusive past.",18Jul2019,1

He left after a while, &amp; I lost contact with him until my junior year because my mom wanted me to talk to him again after keeping me away. They still love each other &amp; everything (I guess you could say that that) just not like before. But eventually my mom didn't want me to talk to him anymore because he got married again, and I almost got kicked out a few times because I was just texting him during that time. I was just saying ”hey” and he was making sure I was alright, and she got mad, I knew she's was still hurting after everything even though it seemed like she moved on so I  stopped talking to him for over a year, the only time I saw him was at my graduation. I've been wanting to ask him for help financially because I've been having to pay for the bills and I can barely save for college. So I guess I've been a bit stress about that &amp; the fact that my mom was in the hospital which kind of triggered some memories of my grandma and my two uncles that passed away from cancer. My grandma passed last year, my uncles the year before that and I've been dealing with some issues afterwards with myself. I was just scared of losing her, and I'm still scared because I'm gay and kinda in the closet. People could hate me for it, I don't mind. But yeah, I've been struggling to tell them that. They aren't accepting of it, and I was going to tell them at one point during my graduation but I couldn't. So I'm just waiting until some time while I'm in college. I don't know. I regret not telling my grandma because she was the closest. I know she would've whipped the hell out of me for it but I regret not telling her or spending time with her like I used to and now I'm just going to have to deal with it I guess. I've been picked on a lot as I was growing up for it. I never really made friends. I never had anyone to hang out with. Everyone avoided me so I was always by myself. One point when I was little I almost got jumped for it. I guess I feel like everyone gets tired of me eventually. At some point even hate me. I feel alone honestly. I struggle with making new friends, and every time I do, take Steve for example, I get excited and happy about it, and then I panic and worry. 
  And I know how it sounds, I know I'm not going to make many friends going into my adulthood. I know I'll be alone especially since I know my family won't be really accepting whenever I do tell them. I was just honestly excited about making an actual friend. I don't think anyone would understand that it meant so much when Steve told me that we were friends but now I don't know what to do because Im scared, I tried talking to Steve about everything that I’ve been going through but he's been too busy and I feel like every time I try I don't know how to explain it, I get tongue tied about it. And I don't wanna make it seem like I'm trying to make everything about me, or make it seem like I’m begging for attention.

186,"Backstory: My fiance and I live in the same apartment complex as his mother. She helped us get the apartment and referral bonuses helped us all for the first month yadda yadda. We moved from another state so it seemed easiest. In a normal week we'll visit her probably 3 times, and at least one of those I'll cook dinner for the three of us. We seemingly have a nice thing going and I really do enjoy seeing her. She parties and it's fun.

&amp;#x200B;

My future MIL owns and a group home for the elderly.  She also works there full time to keep employee costs low. She found out **today** that one of her residents has scabies. It's the human version of mange. Can take up to **8 weeks** for symptoms to appear for people who have never had it before, but the infested person **can transmit mites before symptoms appear** because the symptoms are an immune response to fecal matter left burrowed in the skin over time (gross). Topical treatment can be gotten with a prescription from a doctor, and although it kills the mites/renders the patient non-contagious within 24 hours of starting treatment the ""intense itching"" **can last for up to 4 weeks**, or until the skin grows out enough to rid the top layer of all that fecal matter.  Also to avoid reinfestation you need to wash everything **after treatment begins**, everything that can't be washed needs to be sealed in plastic which starves the mites to death after 72 hours. I've been doing a lot of research with my fiance about it since she told us at about 1pm, and frankly, on top of being super grossed out by the whole thing, I am not in any mood to deal with a month of miserable itching or 3 days of deep cleaning my entire apartment to keep the misery to only a month long. We called her back at about 2pm after some research to tell her that we would not be visiting her until we were sure she did not have scabies too (8 weeks) or until after she went to the doctor for a prescription and was rendered non-contagious (24 hours after starting treatment). While hardcore this seems reasonable to my fiance and I, especially considering that the CDC recommends anyone who has prolonged contact with the infested person should also undergo treatment. And she definitely had prolonged contact with the resident. Even helping this resident go to the restroom concerns hugging her tightly to lift her from her wheelchair onto the toilet.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway that 2pm phone call did not go great. She was very upset at us for not wanting to see her, claiming we were treating her like a pariah. After explaining the severity of the situation to her because she, by her own admission, had done no research of her own into the matter and had no idea what scabies actually entails, she hung up on us. We continued on in deep research mode because we are researchers at heart and wanted to know everything we could find about this parasitic disease. Also we're slightly germaphobic, so there's that. Fast forward to 4pm she called us back to tell us that she had a doctor come to the home who concluded that nobody, including the staff, was exhibiting symptoms but the one resident. She also told us that the doctor said the resident had been suffering from the disease for over 6 months, but that he was reluctant to prescribe medication due to the fact that the treatment would be a severe form of antibiotic that ""rips through the immune system"" (she literally said that). She then went on to tell us that because the resident had the disease for over 6 months and that nobody was exhibiting symptoms that we should be fine to go and visit her because there was no way she had the disease too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am not sure if she just does not understand how incubation periods work or if she straight up lied about having a doctor come and check up on the situation (which would be completely in character for her; she lied to my fiance's uncle about our wedding plans so that he would offer up his mansion for us to use for a reception), but I don't believe her complacency for a second. We even told her about all of the information we learned about the disease and that we could not conclude that because she's asymptomatic she doesn't have the mites and won't spread them, at which point she asked us in a very condescending manner if we really thought that she could have it after she had been in contact with the resident for 6 months with no symptoms. I told her that yes, she could, and until she deals with it we would not be seeing her. She then goes on about how the doctor wouldn't prescribe the immune-ripping medication because of how severe it was and how it was not an option, and I told her that was just one of many treatment options most of which being topical ointments that you put on like a lotion and leave on for 8 hours at a time. I also pointed out the CDC thing about giving prescriptions to those close to the issue and questioned her on why this doctor would ignore the close contact rule and only mention the one treatment that is used in the most severe of cases without also talking about the other, less severe, options. This made her very angry, and she told me that ""just because I'm from California"" and ""see everything in black and white"" doesn't mean I could keep her son away from her for 2 months. That I was cherry-picking information to convince my fiance that this is contagious and serious and that we shouldn't see her anymore. For the record I am not keeping her son away from her, and this is a decision that we made together because neither of us wants to deal with getting scabies. Hell, there's even a chance that she already gave it to us, and if that is the case then there is no reason to stay away from her, but until we get some definitives we don't see why we should expose ourselves further. She was absolutely fuming when she hung up on us the second time.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do love my future MIL in spite of her flaws. She has done a lot for me personally and my fiance and I together to make our lives significantly better. But she seems to be beyond all reason and is blaming me for brainwashing my fiance, when really I am just worried about both of us getting a miserable and long-lasting set of symptoms when we can possibly avoid it. I don't want her to hate me or think that I am controlling her son, but so far that is what it has come to.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overreacting? Should we be seeing her through this mess?

&amp;#x200B;

188,"I'm going to try to keep this short, but some of this will just be me letting out/venting some of the thoughts in my head that I haven't been able to get out. What better way to get ideas out like random folks on the internet? Sorry if it is too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the end of November, I started talking to this girl who was in a few of my classes. And for months, we would talk literally all day everyday with out stop. When we weren't in class together, we we're texting constantly. Everything click in a way it hasn't before. I swiftly developed **very** strong feelings for this girl. But she had a boyfriend. I tried my best for weeks to stay respectful and keep my feelings to myself. I tried so hard, but it ate me up and destroyed me inside. I couldn't take it. I had to confess my feelings to her.

I did it, and she reciprocated. I'm not proud of this cheating relationship. honestly I should've known it was all fucked from the word ""go"". I'm not proud of how I acted and treated people. We ""dated"" for a few months behind her boyfriends back, until people started finding out in February and she ended it. To get away with it all, she convinced people that I sexually assaulted her as a cover up.

I was completely destroyed inside. I learned later she lied about most things she told me, essentially everything she was was all just a lie. I also learned of the darker ways she treats her boyfriend and how manipulative she is. She graduated school, and I've been left to my own devices for 5 months now.

My trust and general love for people has been destroyed, I've been socially chastised, my social skills have further deteriorated, and my mental state has been the lowest its been in years. On the bright side, despite forming multiple negative issues, I've learned a lot about people, myself, about how I acted, etc. and I've actively worked to make myself a better person. I do consider myself a better person now.

&amp;#x200B;

 I know she did horrible things to me, and I know it was all a lie, and everything else that happened.. But no matter what I've done or tried, I haven't fully moved on from her, and she still haunts my mind daily. I don't know whats missing and I don't know what to do anymore. I've toyed with the idea of telling her boyfriend of her cheating, but I fear its been too long and my evidence isn't substantial enough to make an impact.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I've progressively been trying to work on my social skills. I try to strike up at least small talk with new people, mostly unsuccessfully mind you, but an effort none the less. Socializing has never clicked for me, and I don't fully know how to handle new people. I'm terrified of silence, awkward pauses, not having anything left to say, not knowing what to talk about, etc. If there isn't a constant interested conversation, I'm terrified. I don't trust anything people say to me, and will continually question each word.

I've dabbled with different people, but they didn't yield fruit.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to stay away from home and get out in the world as much as possible. I feel happier every second I'm away from home. Despite my efforts to get out there in the world, things haven't worked out too well. I don't really know where to go to meet people, I don't drive and am too embarrassed/anxious to do a lot of things, like clubs, groups, etc. I've asked a few friends to help find a potential lover, but they didn't pan out.

 I've considered meeting people online, but I never liked that idea and I don't see much trust over the internet. Even then, I still don't know where to go. I've taken a look into Tinder and similar apps, but I don't trust the people there. The idea of online dating/meeting people online doesn't sit well with me, I don't trust it.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I fell madly in love with a girl who lied and destroyed my mental state. I've been trying to move on for months, but I don't know whats missing and I don't know how to get her out of my head. 

I don't know if  its ""too little too late"" to tell her boyfriend she is unfaithful.

 I no longer have trust in people, and I'm struggling to learn and fix my broken social skills. I have a fear of silence that I don't know how to deal with.

I don't know how to start talking to people, I don't know how to introduce myself, and I don't know where to go to meet people.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to leave all of this behind. I want to find a new ""clean"" love in a new place. I don't want to cheat, I don't want to lie, I don't want to hurt any more people.",18Jul2019,1
189,"So I'm gay, but logistically it's not the right time to come out (re: my ridiculously religious parents are still paying tuition). This question isn't really about them though.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm in college, some of the relationships that I've formed throughout K-12 have kinda been stressed because we're all in a new stage in life. One friend in particular who I considered myself pretty close to has only spoken to me sporadically in the last few months. I really don't think some of these friendships will survive in a post-coming-out world, especially this friend. He has already ironically detailed to me how one of his male friends made a pass at him and that friendship went through the wringer.

&amp;#x200B;

190,"Hi Reddit! Super new please be nice. 😂 I very much appreciate any help...can’t even sleep for the past week. 

Ever flirt with a coworker over IM? We’ve all done it to an extent...right? Hashtagabove :-)

This has slowly (very slowly) progressed and he said next time you come to the office we should get dinner. I WFH so we’ve never met IRL. (I have only been to said office on occasion, as in every few months, but not since it felt like we might be flirting....) So which does it mean if anything?

My 3 best guesses in order of likelihood:

1– let’s plan to meet and talk outside of work because you’re chill and we’ve been working together awhile but I don’t actually know you

2– lets get dinner. Cos people need to eat, we’re cool with each other, and random

3– lets get dinner because I want to see if the underlying sexual tension between us exists IRL or just over IM because we need to make work a more bearable thing to do all day 

I know I know, never met IRL but what starts as an affinity can turn into attraction once both people consciously pick up on it. (I’m 35+ this is not rocket science). Over IM it starts out with extra emojis, and the little friendly pick me ups that you wouldn’t IM to just everybody - today it was ‘I believe in you’ - and then the omission of your names. Like say if I were to IM Joe Shmoe I’d say something like ‘Hey Joe, happy Friday, about that email from ABC client... ‘ but with this guy it’s just ‘hey’. (Kind of like when you call your friend you don’t say hi this is INSERT NAME, you say hey, then they say hey what’s up. Cos you know, they know your name.)

Ever since he used the word dinner last week I feel like we are both a bit more casual with each other, letting our guard down and talking about a bit more personal stuff, but I could literally be imaging all this because like I said we’ve never actually met and he might just be really friendly!!

(Obviously I’m attracted to him so please be gentle in your honesty.)

I'm only 20 so I can't go to bars or anything to meet people and even if I was I wouldn't have anyone to go with or know what to do. I just feel completely lost with no social circles.

196,"My story goes a while back. I have had a rough life and had a lot of crap happen to me. I was molested by my God father and a foster father and foster brother. This went on for years. Later I was adopted by my sister and brother in law and once it was found out they started beating me. My sister had been molested too and I don't know if finding out triggered something I'm just not sure. 

Later in life I got back to my parents and during this time I was pretty fucked up. I was in middle school and at this time i started cutting myself. After a time it was no longer enough and in my sophomore year I attempted suicide. I was admitted to a hospital for a month until they felt I was safe to myself and was able to leave.

I have been recovering for years and mostly now I'm 25 and everytime something happens it is a thought that crosses my mind but I am able to push it away. However recently I have been going through a lot. I have lost three family members recently, I have had a couple of pets that needed surgery. One for being attacked and one needed a full mouth extraction. 

Now recently I have had a rough time at my job. And it's all been too much to handle. So I was at work holding a knife and all I wanted to do was cut myself. It was so hard to fight the urge. I just couldn't keep everything in. I was overwhelmed and it took everything I could to resist. I spent the entire day fighting it. 

When I got home I couldn't fight anymore I grabbed a blade and cut myself. It was almost euphoric. I felt better than I had in a while and I finally felt control where I hadn't in longer than I could remember. I thought it could just be once, but I can't let it go. I want that feeling again and I feel myself slipping. I don't know what to do or where to go anymore.

For 6 weeks I didn't receive any of the credit card tips on my check, the checks I did receive were always wrong. I communicated it to Lisa and her response hasn't been great, she seems more annoyed than anything to have to fix my checks. Then I worked a large wedding, 200 plus people. She relieved me of bartending so I could eat dinner during the wedding. When I came back to the bar I noticed a lot of the cash tips were gone. Then she right in front of me grabs a couple 10s and 5s out of the tips jar and says ""these ones were given to me while you were gone"" I mentioned that it seemed like a lot of the cash was gone and she said ""oh? I wonder who would have taken it?"" So then I decided to talk to a different manager, asking her to keep it off record and what I should do.

Giant foundation cracks have started to show themselves (which we never saw during inspection). Water has been coming through underneath the breaker box and through the cracks, potentially starting a fire, or ruining the HVAC/washer dryer/water heater/etc that is all down there. We decided to get a repair estimate, which is in the ballpark of $20k. Of course, we can’t afford it. Not even financing. Only to find out the previous owners knew about the flooding(social media), lied on the disclosure, and went to incredible lengths to cover the existing cracks.  
We went to a lawyer, and due to circumstances he might not be able to represent us. He told us we might not make it far as the previous owners probably cannot pay to repair it either. 

Where do we go from here? Walk away? Put the house on the marker and disclose everything? Would we even get what we paid for it now? Find a new lawyer? Living in an apartment was the absolute worst, and I don’t want to go back to that. I just need some advice on the best route to go.

I continued standing for a few moments while she was drawing something in a sticky note, (it's getting better I promise) and then she suddenly looked at me and smiled, I smiled back and sat down. The class ends and we both go to different paths. 

*DAY TWO* 
On Tuesday, I sat on the same chair I did on the previous day, and so did she, however, we all switched spots because of a game we played, and she was now in front of me. The class goes on and I notice she looks at me and turns her eye (and so do I). The class goes on and by the end of it she asks when I wants the book (and I say whenever she wants)

*DAY THREE*
Today nothing really interesting happened. We both sat on the same spots we did on Monday and I paid her the 40 dollars for the book. She thanked me and that's pretty much it. I couldn't really notice if she kept on looking at me again because of the position I was. (That part is my fault and yes, I know I'm dumb) By the end of the class she was inviting the people who were at our table if they wanted to have milkshakes at a diner,  she asked me last and I said I would see if I could. (Now it starts being kinda sad) I said nothing to her after all and just left. However, she was at a convenience store next to our school waiting for the other guys and when she saw me she smiled (and yes, I know it was probably good manners so I shouldn't really count on it).

So that's it. I still have 2 days before she goes back to Europe and I have no clue of what to do. Please, help me.",18Jul2019,1
221,"Hey, it's me. I'm back. I asked for advice about getting a burger last Friday, I think?

Well, I'm getting home late tonight, and really craving some takeout pasta from the Italian place by my house.

The only problem with this plan is: it'll make my sleep a little rough, and it's already getting to 10:30-ish PM. Then again, I don't have to be at work until 11am tomorrow.

So, Reddit, should I stop for some delicious takeout Italian pasta on my way home?

223,"I have had counseling all my life to be able to have the courage to be selfish. It takes a lot for me to not listen to what would be best for others because of some child abuse. 

So how do I handle a man that will be on my resume but treats me awful? I want to learn from it and stand up for myself, which I’m proud to have done a little bit. On the other hand should I keep my head down and just take his verbal abuse? 

Here’s some examples, and yes maybe if I didn’t have childhood trauma with verbal abuse these may not affect me as much.

When I quit, “I’m very disappointed you didn’t speak to me about it first”  

“I knew you were a risk” 

“I know you’re just thinking what’s the best for you but put yourself in my shoes” 

When I got injured and I had to leave early “is this going to be a regular thing?” 

“Well I need you because I’m short on people”

“How dare you suggest I hire someone when so and so is out for surgery. You want me to just fire them” 

I gave him four weeks because I wanted to be nice when he basically guilted me to but I’m not sure how much more I can handle. I try to stand up for myself but he always misconstrues my words and talks over me. I either go home crying or guilty that I stood up to him but it’s always a battle.

Just some background, I am an 18 yr old female, with a white mother, and a Palestinian father who immigrated here in the 1990s. I am very involved with my culture. I have been studying classic Arabic for 3 yrs now, I am heavily involved with a cultural club at my school, am planning to study Middle Eastern studies in college, and enjoy learning about my culture in general, I’d say. Last night, we were watching TV and a Lebanese model/singer came on in an interview. Something she did seemed to turn him off, and he instantly started a rant about how Arab women were loud mouthed, gaudy, “headaches”, and ugly in general. I was shocked, at first. I’ve never really heard him talk like that, in my life. I asked him calmly, would you ever marry/date an Arab woman? He replied, no. I kind of had to sit back and think. I never really put much thought to my father marrying a white woman. I love my mom, and I knew they were in love as soon as they met. I just felt weird hearing my dad spew literal shit about how Arab women are ugly and bad in general. (I identify more with being Palestinian because I don’t look half white at all, really, I’ve never gotten asked if I was white). I then asked him, do you think I’m ugly then? He responded with “you’re not in my shoes”, “you don’t know what I’ve been through”, “you need to see from my side”. I kinda didn’t really talk for the rest of the night.

236,"Okay, so I live in the West of the United States(the stereotypical desert part) it usually gets over 100 degrees Fahrenheit on average. This isn't really asking for advice, it's moreso giving some. Now some people here may joke around about calling people in the Midwest ""weaklings"" because they can't handle 100, but (excuse my ignorance) I'm pretty sure most people in the Midwest are used to more humid cooler temperatures. Here in the west, when it gets hot we avoid being outside COMPLETELY unless it's extremely early or sundown because that's when the weather starts calming its tits just by a little bit.(Kinda, I saw it stay at 90 when it was dark; it's a strange feeling). No need to get all super fancy, you just need to carry a lot of water with you because you're going to dehydrate fast. Air conditioning is going to be your lucky friend, especially in the car. NEVER DRIVE IN THE CAR WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING!!! If your air conditioner is broken, leave the windows open and keep water with you. Well that's common sense everywhere BUT people do faint in the car when it gets too hot; most people don't even notice. Try to park in the shade and try to leave the window slightly open when you're making a quick trip (If you're worried about your vehicle then don't worry about it). Also for you plant lovers out there, try to sprinkle them for an hour, move your succulents to the north side (If you have them) because they're pampered thanks to greenhouses.

237,"Hi I'm 19f and my boyfriend is also 19

Recently we had a talk about our relationship and he pointed out that I lack initiative. 1) in our.. intimate lovey moments and 2) in just general being together. 

He usually is the one to make or offer plans and I almost always agree to them. The only reasons I haven't said ok to his plans is when I had other responsibilities like doing my and my sister's laundry all day or driving my sister around because our dad wasn't available that day. Things like that. 

The thing is, I'm always thinking of plans. I'm not good at it... You ask me ""whatcha wanna do?"" It's gonna take me a while and some googling to figure out what to do. But sometimes I'll be like ""hmm I wonder if BF wants to do this right now?"" And I'll consider asking him, but then a second voice in my head is telling me no. ""he's probably busy. He has co-workers who are probably with him right now and he likes hanging out with the guys. He won't want to do that with you it's lame."" Etc. I hate it but that voice usually wins. 

But in our recent talk he told me that it's hard for him making the plans most of the time. He's worried that if it comes to the point where he gets too tired, I won't be there to pick up the slack. Honestly, I wish I could make it balanced too. But I keep fighting with myself.

I love him, I really do. We don't have any serious problems other than this and I don't know what to do. 

I'm writing this literally 10 minutes after our talk so ""recent"" is very recent and I'm still a bit emotional (and crying?) Because now I'm worried too. He's my first boyfriend but it's been 6 months of happiness together and we love each other very much. I'm just scared I won't be enough and now it feels like it's coming true. 

I'm just a very closed and awkward person in general and it's taken me time I open up with him. Between when we first met til now, I've grown very comfortable with him. But it's unbalanced. Basically, for example, he could have no problem accidentally farting in front of me and I'd just laugh it off, but I'm super scared with the idea of accidentally letting one loose in front of him. 

I might be leaving out details about our relationship in this post because I don't know what is relevant to my problem. If y'all have any advice for me, how to overcome that second voice, how to fix this problem or something, please let me know.

A couple weeks ago I was at a party with a group of friends, one of the girls in my group (who I’m really close with) brought her boyfriend whooo, honestly, I can’t stand. I won’t go out of my way to be mean but the less time I spend around him the better. And I’m not the only one, absolutely nobody in our friend group likes him, he’s dishonest, manipulative, no job, lives with mom, loves to dole out the shit talk but god forbid you throw it back, and worst of all he has absolutely zero respect for my home girl and takes advantage of her forgiving nature. He’s a classic POS. 

HG-Home Girl/SB-Shit Boyfriend

Now, at this party a close friend of mine brought some cocaine for us to mess with(we all know our limits and are smart about not pushing them and it’s something we very rarely dabble in) I know, I know, degenerates. HG is adamantly against the use of cocaine by her significant other due to past experience and SB unsurprisingly asked for coke while HG was off at some other part of the party. I told him where it was and that he was more than welcome to it but warned him that HG would immediately drop him if he did. He said he knew and “decided against it.”SB then came back around and asked me if I wouldn’t tell HG if he did coke. My dumbass said, “If I don’t see it, plausible deniability.” 
SB did it, and made me promise not to say anything and moronically I agreed.

Yesterday, I was asked directly by HG if SB did coke at the party. I told HG the truth, I told HG he asked and I said SB could have some but never saw him do it. I knew he had but I hadn’t seen it. 

Now the moral dilemma, 3 of my friends were with SB when he did it. I’m the only one who knows about HG’s rule for an SO. Do I go back on my word and tell HG  that SB did Coke and rid our group of SB once and for all or do I continue to let SB be a SB, and pull our friend farther from us? I don’t want to meddle and be “that guy” but I’m also sick of him, the way he treats HG and people I love in general. 

For some this sounds like an easy decision, but I’ve always been taught a person should stick to their word and it something I’ve held tight to throughout my life. I also facilitated it and realize that I’m in the wrong no matter what. Any advice and reasoning for the advice would be extremely appreciated.",18Jul2019,2
243,"So for some context: at my job you go through 4 days of training with a trainer. Each day you work in a different spot of the job and learn all the positions. Before learning a position we have a guide book we must read. So essentially we read the guide, work in that spot, read the next part of the guide, then work in that spot. 

Each day the trainer signs a sheet staring that you completed the requirements of those positions. You also then sign stating you did complete it. The thing is my trainer never had me read the guide book. I didn’t even know there was a guide book. Instead of reading the guide we instead took extra breaks. 

I clearly didn’t know this was wrong since I just started and knew nothing. I then started dating the guy who trained me. At my job there’s about 8 trainers. Awhile ago I was talking to a coworker about how I never read the guide. At that point I found out that it’s considered illegal for me to be working. 

I’ve talked to every person he’s trained and they all said that they also never read the guide book. I knew this could potentially risk my job so I read the guide on my breaks. My boss saw me reading it so I know that he is aware that I have read it. 

Well my boyfriend cheated and left so I don’t care about what happens to him. I no longer want to keep this a secret. This isn’t me trying to get revenge. It’s the fact that like 15% of our workers are illegally working.

254," 

Whenever i watch a movie or a tv show i have to rewind a scene over and over again, sometimes it is mild, just repeating one scene then watching the rest of the movie and another time it gets really bad, to the point where i repeat the lines of a character and see if im listening correctly, then i open a script of the show to read if what i heard was correct and i ponder on tiny details. This only happens with shows and movies and not videos. And i can read a book perfectly fine (although slow). Whenever im at the theatre this problem doesn't exist, i don't panic to rewind and repeat things then and even though sometimes i get lost in a scene and ponder on a detail for a bit longer, it doesn't overwhelm me. Another thing is that i usually take a break from watching a movie to watch a short clip on youtube, but it doesn't bother me, and i know a lot of people do that too.

At first, I was proud of this because as a result I knew a lot more details and I could theorize a lot more, so I would understand a lot more of the show than my friends. But now it is really annoying, a particular episode which is 40 minutes long takes me 2 hours to finish. I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time doing this.

255,"For context im an incoming high school junior and my parents are first generation immigrants who expect a lot from me in school. 

I understand I have a bias so I will try my best to keep it as objective as possible.

Ever since middle school, my relationship woth my parents has been deteriorating in the form of more arguments and tensions over my school life. They expect me to always have A's or better and to always work harder. If not they would say I need to work harder.

I realize that it is for my future but sometimes I don't always think doing it is what is right for me.
For example, I am interested in linguistics and psychology and want go into that field but my parents are really pushing for me to be an engineer. They tend to lecture me sometimes on how I cant make any money in those fields and that I can't be happy with a job like that. 

In addition, my mom will yell at me many times throughout the day saying I need to do sports or play an instrument. With the instrument I joined my school from 4th grade up until 9th grade when I quit because I no longer enjoyed it and she was extremely mad at me and said I need to take up another instrument, so I did: Piano. Then a few months later she pressured me into taking a sport, so I did Tennis for a year. I don't really enjoy these activities anymore and when they think I am slacking off they blame it on video games.

I enjoy video games usually and by myself I play around 5-7 hours everyday on the weekdays and on the weekends usually a couple hours less than that. My typical schedule over this summer in the past 2 weeks I have been waking up at around 8 and then going to sat school at 930 and ending at 1230. Then i will play video games from 1-5 usually and then go swimming at 6 until 9 and then play until 12 oclock. 

Recently they have been blocking my internet every other hour or so I cant play video games and locking the computer rooms door because they want me to exercise or study more but I have already been doing those things. 

They tend to expect more and more from me and never are content with how I am doing and its shown through their lectures telling me what extra academics I need to do or that I need to play sports. 

One day my dad asked me why I play so many video games and I started to cry  and yelled at them saying that i'm tired of how they treat me and that they cant expect so much from me and how i'm doing everything for them. The next day  they blocked my internet at 10 and I overheard them talking about me playing to many video games and how it made me lash out.

In addition, I have been doing good in school getting all A's with the highest classes I can take and am in the top 20 of class and I went to afterschool reviews everyday in the last 3 weeks before AP exams and it is still not satisfactory.

I want to tell my parents how I feel about the whole situation and to give me some more freedom regarding school and my outside activities. How should I go about this?",18Jul2019,2
256,"I (16M) have worked at my current job for over a year now, and I have a friendly relationship with all of my co-workers. There is one particular girl that catches my eye both at work and outside of work. She is 100% out of my league, but even that hasn't stopped me from talking to her a fair amount. She is caring, hardworking, beautiful, and an over-all amazing person.  


Anyways, she used to be an amazing person. Of course she partied a little bit, but never did anything bad. No drugs, no drinking, no vaping, you know the usual high school garbage. But ever since her boyfriend and her split, she has changed. At first after the breakup she was depressed and vulnerable and I definitely could notice it while I was working with her and talking to her. But after about a week after it she suddenly became very happy and is making sure everyone knows she is living her ""Best life."", which is what I am here to talk about.  


The reason why she is very happy is because she has started to do recreational drugs. She told me a couple of days ago that she bought some edibles and did them with her friends. I was completely star struck when I heard that because I knew she had never done those things before, and as someone who is completely against recreational drug use, I was angry, but I didn't want to show it as she told me this while at work. She also had said sort of jokingly after the fact ""Next is Acid."" I wanted to talk to her after work about it but she had already left by the time I got off so I didn't have the time.  


Now to yesterday. She was talking to me and another co-worker about this guy she had been seeing, as in boytoy. Apparently he might be the reason why she has started doing all these drugs and getting into trouble. He is providing and she is using it with him and his and her friends.  


I saw him later yesterday, after I had dropped my co-worker off at home after work, walking with her. I had no idea who he was and my co-worker didn't either. But he did say that he was her ""boytoy"".  


I want to help her, but I don't want to be like a dad yelling at her. What can I do in this situation to help her out, and to get her out of this situation?",18Jul2019,1
257,"Okay. I feel like I’ve messed up big time. I was interested in a girl and she was interested in me for over a year but due to certain circumstances we were never able to date. Now, I’ve told her I’ll be able to ask her out soon because I’ll be able to and we began to hook up, nothing more than making out and touching one another. I fully had the intention of asking her out and being with her when I said so, but recently I’ve fell hard for a girl who clearly has feelings for me too, and I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. I want to be with the one I’ve recently been talking to, but the one from before is emotionally dependent on me and has said that I make her love herself, and that she’s only opening up for me because others have hurt her. I feel stuck and the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone but I can’t be responsible for a persons worth and their happiness. Any advice?",18Jul2019,1
259,"I didn't know her very well before I found out she was suicidal, we only ran in similar circles. I do not want her to die. When I found out, I tried DM'ing her individually. At first she didn't talk, so I also added her to a group chat my friends and I have. Then, she said a few things, very little, mostly depressing. 

I've started to try and get to know a little more about her by asking questions. I know she's in college, but on summer break right now, has no siblings, but that's mostly all she'll say so far. She's told me that she feels she is alone, and I've not been able to convince her yet that she isn't, even though I've triwd and will continue trying.

Our paths intersected because we both enjoy a certain artist's music. That artist has a bunch of stuff coming out soon- a trailer Friday, a new single probably next week, an album next month, and a movie near the end of this year. I don't know if it's dumb to say, but I tried telling her how she has that to look forward to. She told me to enjoy them for her, and said she won't be here for it. I also tried changing the subject from questions about her to silly topics like memes or edits, to hopefully make her happy for a moment. I really don't know much else to do so far, besides telling her she's always free to talk to the gc and me individually, and I plan to DM her every day as I have been since two days ago when I found out. 

I have no way to contact her parents to tell them, and I do not know enough personal information to ascertain what country she is from, let alone get their authorities to do a welfare check. I really don't want her to die. Do you have anything I can say that might make her reconsider her desicion?",18Jul2019,2
260,"My dog has had urinary incontinence since she was 8 (likely before then, she was our foster dog who was severely neglected prior to being with us). She has been on every medication for it (DES, Proin, supplements). She is now 15 and has become tolerant of it all. She has some pretty serious aggression issues (dog dementia) but she is fine if she keeps to herself. 

At what point do you know you should put a dog to sleep? I’ve had two traumatic experiences with euthanasia and one positive. She is literally my everything as I got her at the hardest time in my life, after she had come from the hardest time in hers. We have had friends ask why we haven’t pursued euthanasia with her when she can’t keep any urine inside her along with her aggression. For me, I feel like it’s not a good enough reason. Yes, I have to do laundry every day. I have had to take showers because she peed in the bed while we are sleeping. She rips diapers off during the night. We can’t kennel her as she has a dog version of PTSD as she was left in one for almost her entire first 8 years. 

What would you do? She isn’t necessarily suffering but her quality of life isn’t great. She is on a anti-depressant but it doesn’t seem to help. I just can’t tell if my judgement is clouded by my love, or if these really are reasons a dog should be put to sleep.",18Jul2019,1
261,"My husband and I have been having a rough patch here recently. I (f) am having a sexual awakening and have wondered what it would be like to be with other men. My hubs is the only partner I’ve ever had. 

I expressed my thoughts to him, being very clear that I wasn’t asking to open our relationship, but that I was struggling with the idea. I also made it clear that I would never do something that would hurt him because I love and care for him.

Our wedding anniversary is coming up in a couple weeks and I thought I’d do something sexy to surprise him. I enlisted my friend to shoot a boudoir session of me so that I could make a book out of it for my hubs. So last night, I’m getting all my pieces together...grooming real nice, painting my nails, etc... and he’s asking why I’m getting all dolled up. I say that I just wanted to do something for myself, but he gets suspicious. So I defenselessly tell him that I was going to surprise him with wearing sexy lingerie when he got home from work today. He tells me that I didn’t have to ruin the surprise and that he appreciates the gesture but not to do it because he doesn’t think he’ll appreciate it as much as he wants to. 

So today, I take off work to go with my bff to do the boudoir shoot anyways. Feeling a little reluctant since he didn’t want anything sexy, but I had already planned it all out so I went ahead with it. I get a hotel for a couple hours, pay in cash so it doesn’t show on our cc and that it can still be a surprise. So me and my bff hang in the hotel room for a bit after we shoot since we already paid for the room. He is supposed to be at work, which is why I planned it for today. My hubs calls me multiple times...I don’t answer because I don’t want to give away anything. He calls again, me thinking something is urgent answers the phone. 

I can tell he’s in the car. He asks where I am. I lie and tell him I’m at home. He says no you’re not. I lie again, say I went to go see my horse. He says no you aren’t. He says he looked up when I opened the doors of our house through our security system and has called the barn manager and asked if I was there. He says to be honest and to send him my location or else he’s getting a lawyer. 

I start to get really pissed. It feels to controlling to be tracking my every move. I feel violated. At this point I didn’t even want to tell him the truth because I am so mad. Something sweet turned into a whole mess. So now basically, he says he’s done with me and is going to file for divorce.

My question is, do you think if I tell him about my surprise that it will actually help him to stop being so controlling and paranoid? I love him and want to be with him but this behavior is crazy.",18Jul2019,0

I was only planning on being there for the summer but I fell in love with the work. the energy, the people and to top it all off I'm liked very much. I went from performing simple tasks for my supervisor to complex problem solving and research (they gave all my old busy work to another intern). 

Eventually I began to exhaust all the tasks from my supervisor and began working for others. So much so I took assignments that other interns failed to complete and I work with two different departments in the company. Right now I'm doing work for a well high up fellow in the company, like you could Google them if I dropped their name but again I refrain.

I've been encouraged by family and friends, I'm oddly known as ""the smarty kid"" by people I've never met in the office. It seems obvious to everyone but me that I should reach out but I feel this weird mix of Humility and Pessimism about it all.

Elephant in the room: yes I'm still a college student I have one more year if nothing changes. To keep it simple let's just say if I did get a job I could avoid debt and still finish a semester later. 
There are job openings and they've been adding new ones. Even a recommendation for their best entry level position would suit me in the worst case of a reprisal of my effort.

I'm not unconfident but I fear I can be too brash and perhaps jeapodarize my relationships at the company. The company also has a culture that values sticking your neck out, many people who work their in higher positions dont even have degrees so that won't stop me too much.

Am I overthinking it? Is there another way to look at it? I frankly just need feel an unbiased opinion.

Thanks",18Jul2019,1
274,"I will provide context to this. Also TL;DR at the end.


A couple of years ago, I met a girl online who I kinda liked because she had a nice personality and was kind to me. I was like 12 years old at that time, and so was her. We became friends and talked sometimes, I made other friends, everything was very nice, but there was one thing: the girl I liked had depression, she posted some bad things sometimes but not so extreme. After like 2 years, I finally said I really loved her and all of that, but she warned me about her depression and how it could affect our relationship. At first, I didn’t think it was very bad, so I said to her that I would help her always and remove the depression of her life. We became a couple, after that.


The first 6 months were very good, I was everyday texting her like an addiction. We loved each other and I helped her with some things she told me. She slowly started to show me how messed up she was with some anger issues or lack of patience, but I didn’t care too much and I helped her. But after that period, one day I saw how messed up she was. She opened completely to me. She told me she was bullied to death on her old school, and her parents didn’t care at all for an extreme period of time, even worse, she told me that they were dicks to her and insulted her, called her weak, things like that. When they showed a little bit of interest, they changed her to another school but only that. At the moment, she was devastated. She had low self-steem, anger issues and EXTREME depression, which she hided from everyone. She told me she had suicidal thoughts and that she frecuently cutted her arms and legs. I was shocked to hear all of that, but I had hope that I could be the light of her life and helped her with absolutely everything. But there was a problem with that.


I developed something like an anxiety for some situations. When she had an episode of anxiety or panic attack, I was always EXTREMELY nervous but tried my best to calm her, and it worked a lot of times. It started to get worse after some months, at least one or two episodes per week. That devastated me. I was always nervous and paranoid that something would happen to her, or to our relationship. She had some anger episodes because I wasn’t with her sometimes, or because she thought that I lied about my love towards her or things like that. I even started to think that she hated me when she had her anger episodes, or that I was guilty for not being sometimes with her and  all of that devastated me. I had a ton of pressure in my back, but I never hated her and I had all the patience of the world just for her. Her mental state, the state of our relationship and my own mental state were killing me. 


Fortunately, her parents listened a bit and gave her medications and a psychologist. She got well for a couple of months, and also me. On that time, I changed. I went to the outside world to improve. I got better grades, made new real friends, I had time for myself to enjoy things, and I got closer to my family while also texting her and loving her a lot. But then, the medications and psychologist of my girlfriend were no longer working.


Episodes again 2 times per week, and even worse now that I was kind of distant from her. She almost killed herself one day if it weren’t for me. She started to insult me, manipulate me emotionally and all of that when she was angry. Slowly, I started to grow hate towards her for all of that, but ironically I still loved her a lot. I was never rude at her, and stayed patient, until december of 2018. I was so tired at the moment that my advices were empty and I started to care more about myself. Fortunately, in all that time my good real life was still very good, but I still had to be the “babysitter” of my girlfriend. 


I was so tired that we had a disscussion and broke up, and after that we became just friends. We were more calmed, we talked to each other sometimes, all of that in a week. Then, it started again. The whole thing of “you never loved me” and all of that. We argued a week and she blocked me. I felt bad, but at the same time I didn’t. Then she messaged me a week or less after that saying that she was sorry and those things. I said we could continue to be friends, but only that. I continued my life and texted her sometimes per month, but in those months I didn’t even want to see her, but didn’t want to hurt her, so I continued until I got a message three weeks ago from her that if I still like her, and that she wants to talk.


I didn’t open it, I continued my life. I didn’t want to live all that mess that tormented me some years. 


But did I? 


I still have remorse of ghosting her, I never wanted to hurt her, but I also want to be happy. I am still thinking if I should ghost her, fake my death, something, I don’t know. I just don’t want to get back.


What should I do?


TL;DR: I met a girl with depression online and we became a couple. I tried to help her always but it was a lot of pressure for me, and she also hurted me because of her insecurities insulting me or manipulating me emotionally. I started to leave her slowly after some time, but she wouldn’t let me and I wouldn’t let myself because of the guilt of hurting her. I broke with her, stayed away from her but still texting her sometimes as friends, until now, when she asked me if I still loved her and that she wanted me and I didn’t respond for three weeks, thinking if I should ghost her or not because I don’t want to get into trouble anymore, and I want to live my life, but I still don’t want to hurt her.

276,"Hey, I don't know how to start this off, but I just graduated college last April, and few days after that, landed a job as Associate Software Engineer (SAP ABAP). I was out of school for 5yrs. from 2013 to 2018, and came back to finish my degree after saving money from my part-time jobs and finding myself a good scholarship program. I live in a 3rd world country, but the company I'm working for offered me a competitive salary, so I accepted it. I earn P25,000 or around \~$490. Some of you might think that I'm earning way too much for a new grad, but here's the catch, my expenses are taking up a huge portion of my salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the breakdown of how my salary goes down:

\-P5,000 / $100 for my Company Voluntary contribution (think of it as savings).

\-P2,300 / $46 average deductions for tax, government contributions.

\-P2,500 / $50 I give to my mom

\-P2,500 / $50 I give to my little brother, little sister

\-P1,000 / $20 I give to my grandmother

\-P4,000 / $80 Monthly Food Allowance for myself (Brunch, dinner) I only eat 2x a day to save money. 

\-P1,300 / $26 Fare for month

\-P500 / $10 Pre-paid load for mobile data

\-P1,000 / $20 average expenses when eating out with my girlfriend

\-P4,000 / $80 personal savings monthly

The rest goes as my emergency funds.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that I'm only saving 16% of my monthly salary and I don't think this will lift me up in the future. We don't have a permanent house, we just live in an apartment and my mom is paying a whole ton per month. It's so hard to live like this every day, constantly thinking when will I ever get a life living in my own house, without having to pay a rent. I'm thinking of getting 2-3years of experience off of my job and work my way into working abroad hoping to get better pay for what I could offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice whether or not I should lower the amount I give to my family, or is it truly enough and just? What can I adjust my budgeting sheet so I could save more?

For the last year or so, I've felt as if my life hasn't belonged to me.  There have several massive life changes occurring at rapid pace and I'm feeling worn down.  


* My wife and I have a two year old child.

&amp;#x200B;

* I moved to her country about seven months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

* She moved, with the child, in the middle of last year to start a new job.  I stayed behind for four months to prepare the house for the move and finish up my work.

&amp;#x200B;

* Now, I work from home, and take my daughter to daycare every day (3 hours a day commuting).  I'm basically a stay-at-home husband with a job.

&amp;#x200B;

* I work across EU and US hours, taking calls at night after LO goes to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have to learn a new language, which has been difficult, I don't have time for classes and barely leave the house during the week.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have no friends here.  They are all my wife's friends from way back when, and it's hard to communicate with them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Saturdays are usually seeing her friends, which kind of kills the day for me.  I do my best with the language, but am usually lost during conversations.

* Sundays are ""family long lunch day"" here, which kills that.  This is basically mandatory, if I suggest that I skip a week, culturally, it's considered an insult.

&amp;#x200B;

* My wife works 60 hours a week and is almost always stressed out.

&amp;#x200B;

* We just bought a house, and now have to deal with a renovation.

&amp;#x200B;

* Lots of immigration paperwork and things like getting a driver's license (a \*huge\* ordeal here) occupy a lot of time.  Even the simplest civic thing like changing an address (that in the US is just a few clicks online) takes appointments, offices and in-person visits.  This place is a bureaucratic nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

* I do have a full-time position interview next week, so I'm hoping that maybe having coworkers will give me something for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

* This is a whole other level of stress, since I'm picking up the slack from my wife's insane hours, we honestly have no idea how we're going to handle us both being out of the house during the week with the kid.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I feel as if I've lost all autonomy.  I go where I'm told, do what I'm told and have no outlets for myself.  My wife isn't in a much better position, and I have to pick up a lot of the slack with her job.  At least she has her own friends she can talk to, but I feel as if I have no one.  She's stressed, so if I talk about what's going on with me, it only adds to the tension, but I can't hold it all in.  She's suggested therapy but, again, I have no time to actually go (and there's the whole thing of trying to find the right one over weeks by trial and error, and who speaks English).  I'm not depressed, but I am constantly exhausted and stressed out.  It's not therapy I need, it's a life of my own.

  
If anyone has felt like this, or been in a similar situation, I'd love to know how you've handled it.  I'm at a loss and I feel as if I don't regain my life soon, that I'm going to fall into a pattern where I will never get it back.",18Jul2019,1
287,6 months of dating. She still talks to me alot it a positive normal bubbly manner. She just doesn’t say I love you anymore. We’re both orthodox and don’t have a sexual relationship. I mostly told her every nights she did it sometimes. But she stopped. What should I do?,18Jul2019,1
288,"First off, forgive me for the bad english. This happened a couple of weeks ago. Me and a couple of friends went to my parents' vacation house. At dinner, my friend was using the oven to roast some pork belly. He heated it at 275 degrees. Around an hour the oven caught fire. We tried to suffocate the fire in the oven but it only got worse. My friend fucked up even more when he opened the oven and the fire got even worse. That's when I went upstairs to get the fire extinguisher. By the time I got down my friend was able to put out the fire by splashing some water on it. I did some researching after and learned grease fires are a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I hid this fact from my parents because I didn't want to cause them to freakout (especially my mom) and of course I didn't wanna get in trouble but looks like they caught on to what happened by seeing some parts of the oven burned. My dad is furious by the looks of his messages he sent me. I told him the truth but he's still pretty mad. Honestly don't know how to make this situation any better.",18Jul2019,1

Hello all, 

I came to Reddit to find out if there is something wrong with me. It seems like every work place I go to I make enemies quite quickly. Even when I was a teenager, I would find that the boys in the neighborhood just didn’t want me around. I would often be challenged to a playground fight or something of that nature. I’m not confrontational and I try  my best to make others like me. I’m also very talkative and friendly. Please don’t attack me here I just need some insight; but Ive have also noticed that tomboys, for lack of a better term, are not too fond of me either. However, I get along fine with women, especially older women who could be my mother,  are the only people who seem to tolerate me. I always get along fine with women but never men or tomboys. Someone help. I’m going into a new job and I don’t want to repeat these mistakes.",18Jul2019,1

302,"I will try to be as detailed as I can, without taking too much of your time. 😞

Before I get into what I need advice about, I think I should tell you a little about my circumstances so you can offer me the best advice possible. I am a 37 year old single Mom. I have three children, all girls. I also take care of two permanently disabled family members, one of which is elderly. They do contribute financially the best they can, as the only source of income they have is disability. So most of the financial responsibility lies on my shoulders.

I work from home as a freelance graphic designer, as I am no longer able to work outside of the home. I haven't been able to work as much as a I normally do because this last year has been extremely rough for my family and I. We have lost two family members in death, both were unexpected. We also lost two of our beloved pets within the last four months of one another, which were also unexpected. 💔 The stress has caused my own health to deteriorate as well. I am doing all I can to get myself back on track health wise so I can get back to working full time.

The problem I am now facing is losing another one of our pets. Our other male cat, Rufuss has become extremely ill within the last week. Since he is 17 years old, I don't think he will last much longer. Unfortunately, I have no means to get him to the veterinarian to help end his suffering. I am completely broke right now and I am currently looking for some design work so I can try to earn what I need. I have looked into veterinary care assistance programs but all the ones I have gone through do not help with this type of service.

What I need advice on is if there are any other resources that I can look into to help me get him help so he doesn't have to continue to suffer. I honestly don't think he can be saved because of how fast this has progressed. I suspect it's some type of cancer, like our other male cat had. He passed away about 4 months ago.

I am desperate and will do whatever I need to do, I just don't know where to look. I can't post in r/Assistance because of some mistakes I made there, I got myself temporarily banned from the community. Please help my family and I with any advice you have. 😢",18Jul2019,0

306,"Hi,

I’m transferring from community college as a junior next semester and I got into a few schools. I really enjoy filmmaking, but I know that’s not realistic so I plan to do TV production/broadcasting, or maybe even something in advertising.

I have offers now from University of Michigan, Ithaca College and UT Austin. Though I’m more into TV production, and UT is more film oriented, I feel like I’d rather go there because it caters more to my major. Michigan’s program doesn’t feel right when I look it up and see it. It’s kind of a gut feeling that the program isn’t as prioritized, so I don’t think I’d like it that much. However, Michigan would be free, and Austin would put me in over $15k debt plus I’d have to work part time for a year for in state tuition to get that lower rate.

But whenever I bring this up to family and some others, they seem to think I’m nuts. They keep telling me how Michigan is more prestigious and that I can sample more things (which is true, UT would pigeonhole me to that subject) and that I may change my mind about doing film/tv down the line. Also of course, Michigan is free. I mean, I like the campus a lot, actually more than Austin, but I don’t think Michigan’s film/tv program is enough for me. I mean, I could be wrong, but just going off my gut feeling. Every time I think about it it just doesn’t feel right.

Am I really crazy to choose Austin?
Thanks.",18Jul2019,1
307,I'm asking for advice on what to do right now. Late last night my best friend of 3 year's decided to lie straight to my face over messenger. I haven't seen them in about 1 1/2 due to them moving away. We kept in touch almost daily for awhile. Up to about mid last year when they said that we couldn't talk because of something. I managed to mend the friendship back together for sometime. I figured I'd add this they do have some mental health problems. I myself suffer from ptsd and and bipolar among other mental health problems. I'm concerned for my friend that something is wrong it's not like them to do this. I have no idea what state they live in at all since they moved in March to New Mexico but might have since moved to Arizona. They have blocked/unfriended me on everything.

309,"Recently got into a fight with my best friend (I’ll call Lucy) due to me wanting her to put more effort into our friendship. 

Now me and Lucy both have feelings for each other (more then friends), they’ve been there since we met two years ago. We haven’t dated due to us both being 14, girls and me most importantly not ready to come out as bisexual yet. Lucy’s not a very socially active person, she’s got around two close friends. Me and another girl (I’ll call her Lola)
Now she always hangs outside of School with Lola, on weekends and holidays. She never seems to hang out with me unless I suggest it.
Recently went out to with a group of friends to dinner, opened up a text from her saying:
“Movies this Saturday?, Oop wrong person”
I replied back saying:
“Hah, lol speaking of. We ever gonna hang?
”Lucy: “I’m socially awkward, you know that”
We never fight, 2 years of close friendship and 
Never had a disagreement. 
I started to get angry, saying: 
“I feel like you never put effort into our friendship, it’s me that starts conversations, makes plans, etc. Could you try and put some fucking effort? I feel sometimes I mean nothing to you”
Am I being petty, I just don’t ever feel like she supports me, sometimes there are parts of her. That make me feel amazing and confident about myself. Like I’m on top of the world. 
Should I give up on our friendship, we’re close as shit in school and over text. Saw her today and gave her the chance to talk to me. She sat there awkwardly looking at me.
Now my question is, should I give up on this friendship? For my own mental health, (recently been diagnosed with anxiety. Which is great for a girl my age). Is it petty of me to want more out of her?

310,"I was observing myself these past weeks and I’ve built a barrier.. Im scared to be open or let anyone in my life. 

My ex and I were supposed to do everything. Hell, we traveled the world together and then it ended so bad that I couldn’t recover, not even now. She loved someone else and instead of just ending it I cheated on her because I was sure she already cheated on me with that guy, and I feel guilty because I wanted revenge. Why the hell should I feel guilty when she was in love with someone else? Idk.. I still loved her but damn she fucked me up. It killed me finding out she loved someone else..and I wanted her to feel how I felt.. I know that’s bad.......

I met someone this past 4th of July, and she’s gorgeous and we’ve got the same sense of humor and damn, I’m happy to have met her because she is down to earth and has so much loving! But then I get these trust issues, they surface and I close myself off from communicating to her how much I like her because I’m most certain she likes me. She’s SMOKING BEAUTIFUL AND FUNNY!!! She’s wow!!! But...

I’m sad about this, because she’s always so happy and joyful and messages me to get coffee and hang out, and I dismiss her because I’m still vulnerable and still hold on to the guilt and don’t know who to talk to about all this. I told her “oh I’m working on a project” or “I’m with family” I just keep pushing her away, when really I want to be with her..

I wanna tell her that I haven’t got over my mess, because I truly am heartbroken and I got lost, I still can’t hide the pain I feel inside and I just wanna tell her I wanna date and be with her but just can’t.. I wanna forget my ex and all but I just can’t.. I can’t forget how she hurt me.. And if I don’t do something about this, I’m sure this beautiful woman will find someone else pretty quick, people don’t wait..And I’m sure if I confessed all of these things I’d scare her away. 

I just wanna hold someone and cry sometimes because I got so much baggage that I can’t hold on my own anymore. It’s the worst feeling that I’ve ever had in my life. Guilt, topped with debt and depression and heartbreak.. This is fucking hard man.. I am insecure because of my ex.

Idk how to start over.. idk how to hit reset and forget all the conversations and life I shared with someone.. I gave someone so much of my time, and it was all for NOTHING.. I’m afraid.. I don’t wanna go through that again.. :..( 

Maybe I’m putting too much pressure on myself but I know I met a real genuine person, and I haven’t came across anyone like that in years until now. It hit me like lighting and jolted my heart.. But then I get scared, like I’m not good enough, that there is someone better for her and I’m just.. I’m just a loser.....I get in my head and feel all this pain..  

and yet, here I am asking what I should do? Should I let this pass and keep moving with my life until I’m right and not insecure? or am I gonna be the guy asking myself “what if” with this girl and just leave this behind me as well?? 

Sorry this shit was long guys, if you read all this, appreciate you so much and many blessings. See? Baggage..",18Jul2019,1

I have these clown dolls, and I’ve been collecting them over the years. Anytime I saw one I connected with at thrift stores I’d take it home with me.


Fast forward, dolls are fine, but I met someone who I’ve fallen in love with. When I first brought up the dolls he was hesitant about them because they carry the energies of different people who owned them before.

I told him they meant a lot to me, and he then said it wasn’t a BIG deal, as long as they don’t cause any danger. But the more I think about it, the more I realize I’d rather him be comfortable rather than keep the dolls, even if they don’t cause any trouble. I love him so much, and I know he has a history with unpleasant energies and situations. AND I’ll be moving in with him soon. I don’t want to bring these dolls with me when I know it makes him uncomfortable. BUT. I do believe in superstitions..

312,"I posted this on r/offmychest, but I'm also very open to actual advice. Tl;dr: I had a date where we were very flirty and into each other and when it came time to have sex I suddenly lost the erection I had for hours making out. And this has happened at least 3 times before with other girls. ...what do I do?

Full post:

I'm really proud of who I am nowadays. I used to be a depressed little boy, but over the past few years I think I've become a young man I can be proud of.

I'm inexperienced with women, having had minimal sexual relationships in the past, but I'm confident enough to be a decent date. I met this girl on tinder and we hung out a few times, lots of making out and we ended up in bed fooling around at the end of the 2nd date. And the end of the 3rd date we ended up deciding to have sex.

I had been turned on for hours and enjoying it, I was erect the entire time, and I lost it as soon as I put the condom on. I managed to get it in her, but I completely lost the erection. We tried again and it didn't work so I walked her home. She's being cool about it, and wants to see me again, but I'm pretty upset at myself.

This has happened the last 3 (and only) times I've tried to have sex with different girls. I'm turned on and into it until the moment it comes time to perform and it goes away. I really thought this time would be different, I felt very comfortable with her and I've become a lot more confident in myself lately. It was going good. Until it wasn't.

Part of me wants to uninstall all my dating apps, apologize to this girl and tell her I can't continue, and give up on women for a few more years again. But I'm almost 25. I'm a man. I need to learn to have sex. Without fucking it up for myself.

I hate this.

Before anyone asks, I don't masturbate or watch porn excessively. I exercise and I'm well rounded. I have a healthy sex drive before it comes time to have sex.

 i lived like that for a few months until summer. any lonely person knows that summer is terrible when you never have anybody to be with. i am trapped with my very toxic family, i'm insecure, sometimes i feel like i am just a meaningless spec of dirt to everyone, im just numb to happiness and sadness at this point.

 i stopped cutting because it never helped my emotional pain, i still have scars though. i have prepared my suicide notes if i ever decide to kill myself. i would not want to kill myself. if it were painless there is a good chance i would. i feel like it would be easy.  just send the notes, and then black. i would never have to worry about anything anymore, i would just be sleeping through the rest of my life. even though this is a comforting idea to me, there is never the overwhelming urge to just end it, life still seems like i should give it another chance?

316,"*This post might be sensitive for some, it deals with depression and its symptoms.*

So, my brother is really struggling right now. He's having trouble in college and hasn't ever really felt super happy at home. He's home for the summer and he's trying to figure out his school situation, but he's been having some serious problems recently. He has seen a therapist a couple of times and he said that it helped, but he isn't super open to having a few more sessions. He has days where he absolutely blows up, others when he's suicidal, and still others when he just cries and wants to be left alone. We've had our fair share of fights, but I've really been trying to be there for him over the last couple of years ever since it got bad. 

Now I just don't know what to do. He won't open up to anyone in the family, which I kind of get because he doesn't have a very close relationship with me or my parents. But I'm afraid that he's not talking to anyone. Any time I try to approach him about these issues, he shuts me out, yells at me, does everything to avoid talking. The same goes for my mom. He talks to my dad sometimes, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything (they really don't have a good relationship, it is often very toxic)

I really need some advice on how to get him to talk to ANYONE about these issues. It doesn't have to be anyone in the family or anything, I just want to get him some help.

323,"So I'm 24F and my SO is 32M and we've been together for 5 years, married for almost two and we have a daughter together.

Throughout our relationship we have had multiple conversations about our sex life and how he has LL and I have HL and everything I've spoken to him about this things change for about a week then go back to normal. (for reference we have sex maybe every 2-3 months )

I have said to him a few times I'm not happy and I don't see us together for very much longer which has been difficult but he'll say something to convince me that's not really what I want, eventually I asked if he would mind me being with other people to get over this issue in the relationship, he agreed and seemingly everything was fine for a little bit.

Skip a few months - I've only been with two other people once since the conversation and SO didn't mind at all, if anything seemed to get excited by the thought.

However; more and more often I have realised its not just sex, its affection, compliments, doing things together etc.. There's quite alot missing (but also a lot there - he's like my bestfriend that I can tell everything and don't hate being around him)

More and more often I've come to terms that I would prefer to be alone and that I feel I'm wasting my early 20s because I decided to get married too soon even though I mentioned marriage was not something I wanted (I agreed because I thought I'd be with him forever and he wanted to get married)

Sometimes I'm fine for months and I float by and keeps everyone else happy, my family love him, he doesn't want to split and our daughter is none the wiser so what I'm wanting advice on is:

Do I stay in this marriage to avoid hurting anyone and deal with the lows it brings or do I ask to split and everyone will be hurt a lot to begin with but maybe get better over time? - what if splitting is not what I wanted in the end? Is the reasons I've given enough to give up?


TL:DR:

I 24F am married to 32M in dead bedroom, multiple conversations and quick fixes but I'm miserable. Do I ask to split knowing it will cause a lot of hurt but may make me happier or do I stay to avoid hurting people and deal with the occasional downs?",18Jul2019,3
324,"Sorry for length, a lots going on. A lot of this is gonna be jumbled and out of order but ill do my best.  I didn't know where else to go to talk about this so I came here. 


(25yo m) 
Last week I flew in to Rome to begin my study abroad trip. It cost a shitload of money but I thought it would be worth it despite the extra 8g of debt. my whole family and myself were excited for it. I arrived on the 7th and Im supposed to come home on the 18th of August. (studying architecture) 

Before coming I already had existing anxiety due to school related stresses, but it was manageable and I could handle it overall.

But for some reason the second I got here it skyrocketed 10 fold and it gets worse.
The 1st day we tour the roman forum for a couple of hours in the heat, and I get what I assume was heat exhaustion after climbing a steep hill. I sat down and tried to cool myself off for a few hours. Felt hot, nausea, heavy breathing and all that, but after an hour or two I was ready to continue.

But following that, my anxiety was way worse. Prompting myself to tell my sister that I need to see a therapist when I get home.
And I just had a strong discomfort in my chest and palpitations that was on and off throughout each day.

It got so bad that I snapped at a waiter at a restaurant during a lunch... I've NEVER done that before.

By the time I made it to last friday, I was basically just trying to hold myself together, I was still experiencing discomfort, and we had been visiting some museum that was mostly outdoors.
After climbing a lot of stairs in the heat, it happened again, i was extremely hot and woozy and I couldn't catch my breath. I had sat down and finally voiced to the group that I really wasn't feeling good. My professor talked to the people at the museum and they brought me into a first aid room.

I still couldn't calm down, I was trying to do breathing excercises like my sis taught me, but nothing was working. My heart rate was crazy, and they took my blood pressure and it was high.
I spiraled into what must have been a full blown panic attack.

I had had one before, but not like this. During which my left arm started tingling. I thought that was an indicator of an impending heart attack.  I thought I was about to die. My battery was low and I started texting loved ones saying goodbye through tears. It was bad.

The ambulance was called and they took me to the ER. Another problem was that no one in the hospital spoke english. I know a little Italian to get by in day to day, but not for situations like this.

After an hour or so I was able to calm down, but I still had that tightness in my chest. They took 4 EKGs and 2 blood tests while I was there over ther course of several hours as well as an xray. Nothing.

While waiting for some of the test results, I had another attack, this one was worse than the last. But this time, both arms and half my face were tingling. I was thinking stroke and was equally scared as before. They put me on oxygen (which did nothing because I didnt need it) and hooked me up to a heart monitor. Bpm was jumping from 95 to 114-125 while laying down.

The doctor gave me valium drops and after a few minutes I began to slow down, still tightness in the chest, but I was no longer panicing so to speak.

They were about to let me go because the tests didn't show anything and I was calm. But once I stood up, my bpm jumped back to 125 and she had me sit down. They put me on an IV to slow my heart rate and then they let me go. She gave me a bottle of valium drops and told me to take a certain amount if I felt an attack coming on. (i knew i had to be careful with that stuff)

From then on I tried to continue my trip as normal, but its honestly been a huge struggle. The strong discomfort and tightness feeling kept coming in waves off and on at seemingly random points.

I was so confused about all this because I couldnt figure out why it was happening, if it was heat stroke or anxiety or a combination of the 2. It seemed to happen completely independently from my mind. 

I still tried to power through it, but its so unpredictable, I went up another set of stairs and felt it coming on, I took the vallium and it helped a little, but then an hour later it happened again when sitting down in the shade. I told my professor and headed back to the hotel and rested for the rest of the day. I missed st. Peters basilica because of that :(

I finally got in contact with my doctor in the states. And he thinks that it's my asthma being affected by the heat, he told me to use my emergency inhaler in those situations as well as to use my normal daily inhaler. I tried for a day yesterday and it seemed to help.

Also, I noticed that it feels like I have sunburn but I dont actually have sunburn. I looked it up and it had to do with the nervous system basically freaking out. 

But last night I talked to him again and he told me to take 2 doses of my daily inhaler instead of one. So this morning I did that, but the time I got down stairs, the discomfort was bad, I tried to eat breakfast but I just couldn't. I took maybe 3 bites.

I went to wait in the hotel lobby for us to start the tour but I felt so shitty I had to tell my professor that I had to sit today out.

And that brings us to now, im in bed while everyone else gets to tour Rome :(

Its gotten so bad, i've considered flying home in hopes of getting better and getting better treatment, but if I do that, my school wont refund me. Not only would I be 8 grand in the hole, I would then have to take 1 more class where I would otherwise be done.

This shit is completely ruining my trip and I don't know what to do.

329,"TLDR: Coming home to help stabilize family business. In a couple years, I want to go to grad school and pursue my things, but if I do, the business might collapse by my abscence, possibly wrecking my family's lives and my niblings' education. What do?

Hi Redditors! It's like 2 am in the morning here and I am stuck with an existential dread for a long time that I don't even know what to do. Hopefully hearing other people can shake me off of this deadlock.

Ok. So for some context, I just graduated uni in Science and am moving back to my home country to help out with the family business. This should be all well and good, but I would be switching to Management and Real Estate Development-- two things which I don't really have a passion for (I mean it gets the money in I guess...).

Regardless, I do have to go back since I have to fix the system (at least I can do CS stuff back home temporarily!) that my bro broke and pick up the slack of my sis's mismanagement. I also got to learn the ins and outs of the business since my dad wants to retire soon (I mean bless his heart since he is already working past retirement age).

I guess here comes my quandry: I want to at least pursue grad school and work outside for a bit (nothing worse than a boomerang kid with nothing to show for it and grad schools I'm aiming for put me halfway around the world). I no doubt can see the system and management getting stabilized to a degree in a year or two. However, I can't see myself leaving because once I do, my sis would take over and probably cause mismanagement again, and my brother wants nothing to do with the family business--even wanting to forego the education of his kids (we are currently paying for it). My father is also looking at semi-retiring by then, which leaves me to pay the bills.

I don't really want to drop the ball and leave. If I did, that would just wreck their lives and put more stress on my father. On the other hand though, once I come back, I'll be a workhorse trying to sustain their lives at the expense of mine.

A different perspective would definitely be wonderful, and advice from people who were in a similar situation would be the best! Sympathy and empathy would be also much obliged.

335,"I (18f) have a bit of a life dilemma right now. Ever since I was young, I wanted to be an artist--specifically an animator. I made short films, illustrated books, entered competitions--took many personal steps towards this goal. My Asian parents encouraged the hell out of me (a rare and wonderful blessing), but cared about academics. 

When I applied for college, I was evenly matched in both my grades and portfolio, so I applied to half art schools and half universities.

Come April, lots of rejections (as life goes), and I decided to put down a deposit for UC Berkeley (I was rejected by UC Irvine so you decide if it was luck or not), mostly because it was an instate public school, and I figured I just wasn't good enough to make art a career thing. I'm grateful to have gotten in, but the idea of going to Berkeley was kinda miserable--it was the opposite of everything I wanted in a school (grade deflation, close to home, competitive culture, huge classes, middling art programs) but who could be picky? It was a cheap and excellent college and I was lucky to get in. 

Well, about 2 days ago, I got off the waitlist for Sheridan College in Canada. It's not a household name, but in the animation industry, it's irrefutably one of the best programs in the world. It feeds into major studios and has a laundry list of prominent alumni in the industry. If I don't go, pursuing art would be way more difficult, and I would throw away my best shot at succeeding in animation, which is already hard enough to break into.

Both schools are the same price, both parents enthusiastically support whatever decision I make (really!), and both feel like opportunities I was equally lucky and undeserving to get. 

Another note is that Sheridan is a four-year non-transfer program. My parents have enough saved to send me to four years of public school, and thats it. If I go to Berkeley, shop around, spend my tuition savings, I'll have to take out predatory Sallie Mae-eqsue loans to make it through another four-year degree (and to pursue art? I'm not comfortable having that anchor on me). 

A lot of kids have to pick between good schools, but I feel like I'm picking between two very different versions of my future self--one who would probably find stability in a job that allows me to pursue art as a hobby, or one who would be overworked and underpaid but working towards ""meaning"" and ""fulfillment"" and doing what I always wanted to do. Or alternatively, pursuing art at Berkeley and fighting a constant uphill battle with a much higher chance of having nothing to show for it. I honestly can't say which life is better, or which consequence is worse--regretting that I gave up UC Berkeley's prestige (?? 🤮🤮) and safety net, or regretting that I gave up on ""my dream"". What do you think I should do? Or even just bring up points for me to consider before I make such a rash decision. I need some opinions from people who don't know me.

338,"Hey, so not that exciting but my whole life I've wanted a pet. My mum and I also suffer from allergies which made it harder. I'm now 21 and I'm finally allowed to get a kitten and also got a hyperallergenic breed and both my mum and I are perfectly fine with them, other than if we get scratched - that itches ahah. I get the odd rash where I get the best face rubs in the mornings and at bedtime but these are things i was willing to deal with as it wasn't that often at all and it goes. I love both of them so much.

My boyfriend of 5 years didn't suffer allergies when we visited the kittens each time at the breeders house. But now I see him suffering. His nose is always either blocked or running and he is basically ways sneezing. He sometimes wakes up with a tight chest in the mornings. There's the random days where he doesn't get them that bad but majority is bad. He says it's okay, it's too late now and he loves them too, and that he would never tell me to get rid of my kittens cause he sees how happy they make me. But honestly it's got to the point he sometimes jsut wants to go back to his houseI've spent so much money I dont have, on an air purifier, anti dander allergen sprays, home cleansing sprays, I hoover twice a day and dust every other day. I have oils for the cats fur which I do weekly and I put a small amount of cod liver oils in their food to help moisten their skin cause the younger one had dry skin when I got him home. My bf leaves obvs and goes back to his home too and its been so nice having my boys as company and it honestly helps a lot with my mental health, but also I am constantly feeling bad and horrible for putting him through all these allergies to the point he goes and stays in my brothers room. I definitely think he is more allergic to one than the other but it would be horrible to split them up - they're 5 weeks apart in age and are inseparable.

It has affected me deeply over the years and I told my husband. I told our mom around the time it happened but she didn't do anything about it. 

I want to do it but I'm hesitant about filing a report for a few reasons. My sister is currently in a really dark place right now. Her boyfriend that she's dependent on is emotionally and physically abusive. I've heard stories about him driving really fast with her in the car to scare her when he's mad, he locks her out of his house, he threatens to commit suicide on a regular basis and is generally very manipulative and abusive. You can see the damage the stress has done to her face when you look at her. We also suspect he's forcing her to sell her body so that he doesn't have to work. I think he's the one who broke her arm and gave her a concussion. He has her so badly damaged and brainwashed. She is delusional and losing her mind.
She rambles on about having magical powers and her boyfriend being her ""savior."" I am 100% serious. 

So I'm afraid that if I file a case against her at this point I will look like a bad person because our family already sees her a victim to her own life. I doubt anyone would support me because they're so busy worrying about her and trying to get HER help. But family opinions aside, would it really be a dick move to do this NOW?

347,"It's gonna be a really long one. Please comment after you read it all.

I'm a junior year highschool student, 15 yo male, single, and looking for amazing experience in my highschool. I always want a good friends, outgoing, fun, open, easy to talk to, caring, and just overall a good and fun friends like the ones my siblings have. They would go out almost every night, chilling in some restaurant, mall, internet cafe, or just in a small nice tavern to drink some hot ginger tea, and other casual beverages.

Everyone always say that highschool is the best time in their youth, and I am looking foward to that. I wasn't always be the best person to socialize, and I lack some experience in it. Don't get me wrong, I am not an anti-social, but I did found a hard time to socialize with other people in the past. I'm not the 'coolest' guy in the group. I never smoke, drink crazy, got into a serious fight, sex, drugs, or touring with fellows like one of those motorcycle ganster.

It's only the 7th day in my school, and I already made a lot of new friends, but there's a catch. I have this friend, let's call him Herick. Herick is my classmate, outgoing, and fun, just like what I want in a friend. I also have this other friend, let's call him Jerry, he's also an outgoing person, but restricted by his budget since he live in some kind of rentals near the school. Just yesterday, me, Herick, and Jerry, along with some other friends just went out to chill out in a nearby cafe. There I found out that, Herick and Jerry often smoke, but now they have gone to vapes. That didn't bug me since they're nice enough to blow the smoke somewhere, and they adviced me heavily to NOT start smoking and/or vaping. The thing that did bugged me was their other two friends, which I didn't knew were coming. They're both do smoke and are into somekind of motorcycle gang, but they were 'okay' to me. This may make Herick and Jerry sounds like a jerk, but Herick is only smoking because he needed a place to 'run' from his dark past, and the vape/smoke sticks until now, and he's loves motorcycle, and he never ask/force me to join his motor gang, and smoking stuff. He is not that type of person.

I started feeling anxious when I was left out in a conversation, not because I can't socialize, but because I didn't know wtf they were talking about. They're always talking about motorcycle, vapes, and stuff I didn't know much about. Whereas I'm more interested in stuff like: tech, world news, economy, history, mtb, and casual talks. I feel like I don't belong here with them. I feel like we're not going to hold onto each other for long because I feel like I'm not good enough for them. Not long after that, their two other friends went somewhere because of something, and our other friend went back to his home because he needed to take care of something. And then; it's just the three of us, me, Herick, and Jerry. We talked about our past experience, and we can relate pretty well, and I did felt like I had done a good job there. But still, we never share the same interest. I do like motorcycles, but not to the degree that Herick, and the others do. I feel left out.

This problem is exarcebated by the fact that my schools consists of mostly girls, and most of the students —both male &amp; feamale— are so focused into studying, that many of them just don't have the time to go out, and hang out with their friends. Which is not the type of friends I want. The girls, I don't plan on having a gf, but the girls here are barbaric. They're louder than the boys, more perverted than most other boys, don't have much manner, and most them are quite ugly, while other good looking ones, are usually in the other class.

The thing is that, this is just NOT the highschool I dreamed of. I want to have not just friends, but good ones. And I want a friend that I can relate to, not just someone I go with everyday, but can't relate much of our lives. Back when I was in jhs, I had some friends that could relate to me, like one also liking world news, or the other who also liked mtb, or some others who liked tech. I could feel home there. But here, my problem are:

- I feel like I'm not fit with Herick and Jerry. However; they're truly are a good person inside.

- If I decide to look for another friend, not many of them would go out like the type of friend I want.

When I was in my senior jhs year, I needed to decide what hs (highschool) I want to attend. My big brother attended a hs close by, only 5 minutes from out our house, let's call this HH. And my other candidate is a hs far away, and a strict one, but has an amazingly high reputation, let's call this AA. At first, it was clear that my pick would be HH, but then my big bother said that the 'younger generations' don't look very promising, and since my cousins will attend AA, I switched to AA, and now I'm here. 

My brother always said that ""You will meet people with simillar mindset as you."" And yes, out of everyone I know, I go out more with Herick and Jerry who have the same mindset as me (outgoing, looking for fun, and want to enjoy our youth), but I feel left out because we're not at the same interest (not mindset).

My choice already take a toll in me, minimum amount of outgoing friends, people in different mindset, ultra-strict school, and feeling of being left out. But I don't know IF I went with HH would make anything better. 

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!

[KZ] All I want is a few (7-20) good friends that are outgoing, nice, kind, have the same mindset as me, share the same interest as me, cool, caring, and accepting.

So far, Herick and Jerry already fit except for the 'share the same interest' part, and their smoking habit (which is fine by me, but would be so much nicer if they don't)

I know that not everyone is perfect, but WHY? My siblings FOUND them (friends in KZ paragraph), so WHY couldn't I? 

I still have a very healty socializing points, I make many friends, and I certainly not being left out by my friends. But why do I have this feeling?! Why I am breaking down to the point that I have to write this post, and create this account? Why is this world so unfair?

Please don't tell me to visit a therapist, but I you do have a suggestion, please tell me. It would really help!

348,"Sorry in advance for the long post... My gf was contacted by Kyoto Swim, an Australian swimwear company, on Instagram. The company offered her a buy one get one free deal so she went to their website and purchased a bathing suit. She purchased one assuming that free one would be included in the transaction. Kyoto told her to do another purchase with two bathing suits and they would refund her in an hour. 

My gf reached out to them about the refund and they ignored her for four weeks. She ended up going to her bank and filing a claim to be refunded. Her bank refunded her and then the company reached out her via Instagram since there was a Paypal refund claim on their end. The company is claiming they sent the bathing suits to the wrong address and they now delivered them to the right address. They’re requesting that she cancel the claim, return the product, or they will have to take legal action. 

TL;DR: Does a company having legal standing after ignoring you for four weeks after you reached out to them for a refund and they shipped out a product after you already made a claim?",18Jul2019,1

We haven't been friends for too long, and if I could describe our relationship, I would say he's more of a discussion buddy than anything (major talk + roasting people). He's introverted, critical, cynical, but really considerate towards his circle. He's worn a pink t-shirt with a unicorn on it once haha. And he's into cartoons too (but not anime unfortunately TT).

351,"When I started high school I had two best friends, we’ll call them A and B. We did everything together for three and a half years. Then half way through year 10 I moved schools due to some unrelated issues. I moved from the local private to the local public, I didn’t move house or anything, just school. 

When I left another girl came into the group in my place, we’ll call her C. We lost contact and I’ll admit that the loss of contact was lack of effort on all parties. I’d see pictures online of the three of them going out together and doing the things that we used to do. This bothered me but I never said anything because I’m the one that moved. 

 I reconnected with A around 6 months of not talking (I would’ve been 16) and we started to get really close again, then B surprised me for my 17th birthday by getting in contact with my mum and decorating my entire house with streamers and balloons. This really got the communication rolling again. 

I was having a lot of problems at my highschool, I didn’t have many friends at this point, I’d just had a massive fight and ended up losing majority of them. So for a few weeks after my surprise I was really starting to feel like I was part of a group. We had a group chat and we’d talk in it a lot. Then after a few more weeks I got added into the group chat with A,B&amp;C. This was a group chat with the four of us and it rarely got used after I was added. 

A few days later I was hanging out with A and I saw (I wasn’t snooping, I just happened to see her phone) that they had a new group chat for just the three of them and they were talking heaps. Throughout this time the conversations in our A,B&amp;me group chat were becoming less and less common. 

I started to lose contact with B again and A was trying really hard to keep in contact with everyone. 

I’ve never really had any time to get to know C as she came into the group after I left, but every opportunity we’ve had, she’s made zero effort, even ignoring me when I’ve tried. 

Every time I’m with A she complains about C and sometimes B and whenever I see B (which I admit isn’t often anymore), she’s complaining about C, yet they always go out and do things together and post pictures and seem like best friends. 

I’m never invited to things, yet they still joke to me that “the OG is always better” and complain about C to me constantly. I’m worried that they do the exact same thing to me with C. Complain about me behind my back about how they don’t wanna be friends with me anymore but they cane shake me or something?

I’m still very close with A and I’ve spoken to her a little bit about it and she kinda gets it, but B is a very different situation and idk what to do? I miss hanging out with the two of them. The last two times I’ve tried to organise something with just the two of them, one of them always invites C so she doesn’t see it and feel left out, yet the three of them hang out without me all the time?? 

Sorry for the ramble, I just really needed to get that out and see what people have to say. 

TLDR; used to be super close with two girls, A&amp;B. Moved schools and the girls replaced me with someone else, C. Now the three of them go out and do the things we used to do and I never get invited to anything even through when the three of us do anything, they invite C so she doesn’t feel left out. They both also complain to me about C behind her back and act like they don’t wanna be friends and she’s a chore, and I’m worried they do the same about me.",18Jul2019,1

353,"Hey guys. Throw away here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So around the time I was four my Dad decided that he didn't have any interest in being a father and was essentially gone. Every now and then he'd pick up his visitation in between trips to the county jail but in all honesty I'm glad he's out of my life. Aside from the links to his mix-tape and random advice that is 10 years too late, he has nothing to offer me past the traditional relationship of father and son that he abandoned. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother however has been a constant presence in my life. She supported us as a single mother, was the head of the household that my aunt and grandmother also lived in and was generally the only real parent I had. She went to nursing and law school but ended up quitting her practice due to discovering rampant fraud at the law firm she worked at. Quit is a nice way to put it, she was essentially gas-lit and intimidated into leaving as an investigation into the firms wrong-doing would have been a national event. 

We were incredibly poor when I was born but over the course of my life she'd been able to make a decent amount of money. She did have a massive amount of student loan debt from nursing and law school. However she quit law in 2013, ran out of money in 2015 and my grandmother essentially supported the family from then until last July when she passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2013 she's seemed *off.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of like she's somewhat mentally ill. She'll would talk to herself, trees, the wind. She types paragraphs into google as if somebody from the CIA is on the other side of the monitor reading everything she's typing like a direct message. She walks around at strange hours, refuse to work despite being competent and educated enough, was obsessed with getting married and having a husband take care of her. Just weird things that were out of character her whole life. She's been an incredibly independent woman. My younger sister once said a homeless man came up to her and said ""Hey Sally (not real name obviously), you still trying to get married? I'll marry you!"". She was appalled and my mother tried to play it off like he was a homeless man out of his mind. But I've seen her talking to homeless folk and making friends with street people a lot over the past seven years. Also, the man had a rapport with her, and knew her name...  She wasn't homeless. Most of the time period she had money, but would go out and feign homeless and drink and wander around all day then come back to my apartment to eat sleep and bathe. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past 2 months I told her she had to take the money from my grandmothers death and get her own place. Rather than do that, she moved out to a hotel last month and two days ago I got a text message from one of those pre-paid visas she linked to my phone because (gov't is monitoring her?) and it said she bought a ticket at the bus station for 250 bucks then another the next day somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called her and she said she was in Colorado like it was normal (across the country). Then she insisted I just tell her how my day was like she didn't just leave. I'm grown, I'm 22 years old folks. But I can't really shake the feeling that letting her go off to another state un-supervised is wrong. She's running out of the insurance money from my grandma's death and hasn't worked, payed her loans, nor taxes in nearly 7 years. She can't get a job due to work history and the fact that she's only half grounded in reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a grown up but I still would like to see my mom. Aside from her my brother, my aunt and my sister I have no other friends or family. I know the relationship has gotten harmful as I'm parenting my parent. However I feel like if I don't do something my mother could never come back and I'll be haunted by it for the rest of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't shelter her, and I also can't let her run wild. I'm very poor myself (make 25k a year and 22, a bit of medical and student loans myself) so a home isn't an option. Every time my aunt mentions crisis services she gets extreme and go's missing for a few days because she's terrified of being committed. She was 4 years back but left diagnosed.

354,"Im going to keep it as short as I can but I genuinely need some advice on this and I know a lot of people experience this but it’s just the first time for me.no huge details but I’m suffering anxiety and depression bought on by a huge burnout through disgusting conditions at my workplace. They were found to be at fault and doctors told me I could suffer a stroke or heart attack the condition my body was in. Over the past 7 weeks I’ve built myself back up from the lowest point I’ve ever been. My wife supported me, it helped more than anything. We have been together for 13 years and she suffers from chronic pain mostly from intercranial hypertension. This bring in bouts of depression for her because she is never going to get better and the pain in exhausting for her. We found ourselves mentally and physically ill at the same time for the first time. We have a daughter and the housework still needs to be done. We are in pain, don’t feel like being here and we are both constantly drained. But most of all we are both frustrated with our own bodies and we are trying dam hard. The problem is that the frustration we feel is being projected onto each other. A silly argument turns into a mountain of shouting. Every day has been arguing and we can both identify that it’s the frustration but we both have no filter at the moment. I decided that if we had just a few days away from each other it may make is change our thinking. We are a couple that are glued to each other, go everywhere together and are never apart. It’s the first time in our relationship we have argued like this and I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or not. Will a few days away make us wake up and smell the roses.

Currently I'm thinking of going to the district prosecutor's office and talking to them to hopefully explain that she was only trying to grab the phone and did that by accident.

368,"so I went to see a doctor who recommended a colonoscopy because I've had constipation and issues with my lower left area, usually related to after eating food or heavy meals almost all my life (especially constipation). And my dad had bowel cancer but most likely was related to his heavy drinking and smoking. I don't smoke or drink. I know people say if someone in the family has it then you need to get a colonoscopy.

In general I feel fine with no pain. only had pain on a couple occasions after a huge meal and it comes in waves kind of. Most days I'll have this annoying feeling down there from something heavy I hate or even if i barely ate (depending what it was) I honestly feel like it's slow digestion or reaction to some foods. Usually it happens when I eat pasta/wheat/breads/cheese? It's really hard to diagnose. My doctor doesn't want to get into that until I have a colonoscopy but I like to do my own research before any of that. Also he didn't offer me a FIT kit but I think that's because you need to be over 50 or something. I'm 35. But I've had issues with my lower left area (intestine/colon - I think) since late teens maybe. Constipation pretty much all my life with the very rare soft normal poo, maybe from something I ate. But I never knew what made me do soft poo at those times. Right now as we speak I am having this uncomfortable annoying feeling in my lower left area and it could be because of cake i had earlier. Sometimes ill get these episodes sort of where it hangs around a couple days after some foods i had. A couple days ago after dinner my brother came over really late like 9pm with pizza and dessert (i wasnt even really hungry) and after a few hours of eating it all this started. I couldnt sit down and had to stand up for hours because of the full bloated feeling. It happens quite often where i cant comfortably sit down because of that lower left feeling. Im sure its a combination of constipation and food. I can even feel something there which im guessing is poo because its gone after i went to the toilet for poo. And most the time if i empty completely I will feel pretty good. But i take something called movicol on and off because nothing else makes me poo soft and normal.

Just some points before I finish this up. -No blood in stools. -No pain in general unless eaten too much (very rare) -No mucus -Constipated almost all my life (mother even said rabbit poo as a baby -Feel worst when eating flour, pasta, bread, cheese, etc (i think?) -There are many days I have felt normal down there with no discomfort even after food/meals -Dont exercise much but i do move around all day walking a bit and chasing my kids around the house or when i work i walk up stairs a lot on the way to work. Not much but its some movement. -Maybe i dont drink enough water. I try but its so hard to even drink a liter i just dont feel like drinking water much

Like I said, I've already been to the doctor but he won't look into these problems until after a colonoscopy so I just wanted to look around online to see what I could find myself. Honestly, colonoscopy is last resort for me since Im not really fond of idea of someone putting a camera tube up my ass and possibly being sedated. I guess I'm just wondering if you would have any ideas on what I might be experiencing.

We don't know how bad it is yet, and she likely won't be able to see her oncologist before I have to make a decision about the job offer. I feel like I'd have regrets if I didn't take the job, but I also don't know how I would cope if I moved and things back home got worse.

377,"Hi all,

I’m going to university in about three months time (or so I hope) and I’m having difficulty with the thought of having to leave people behind when the time comes to do so. I realise it’s only realistic for me to have to drop a lot of my friendships (some of them really don’t matter to me that much) and that it’s really just the way life goes sometimes, but there are a couple of cases where I’ve thought about preemptively detaching so that I can to to uni without feeling so bad about having just separated from certain people.

For most of my friends, sadly I don’t really care. I’ve had a hard seven or so years and I’m relatively detached already. I feel as though I keep most of their company out of obligation or duty and because I fear they’ll get upset if I were to cut them off. Sad, but true. In group settings I often wait for everyone to have left and generally get impatient for this moment. 

There is one person, however, who I am incredibly attached to and I think not seeing them again will hit me hard. They’re... not likely to want to stay friends with me throughout university and it’ll be difficult to maintain that considering they’ll be in another country. They’re somebody who I’ve had a complicated relationship with for a while and who I adore wholeheartedly and care about like no other. I’m scared of talking about this with them because I’m pre-empting the dismissive ‘that’s just how it goes’ answer and hearing it from them now would hurt more than if it would just happen. I think cutting them off now would give me more time to deal with it before I go to university for a fresh start, but I am doubtful and would really like some advice. 

Thanks for reading this and any advice that I receive.",18Jul2019,1
378,"We moved in together earlier this month and we met over reddit. I had read on his reddit that he didn’t like harsh cleaning products like bleach and that he suffers from severe health anxiety. Two things we never really talked about it person - but I was aware. He wanted to live downtown but I couldn’t afford it until I found a cheaper but older two bedroom apt. The apartment is in good shape except for the kitchen and I think the owners before us used to smoke. He signed the lease but 4 days later after our move in date I saw that he wrote on reddit that he hated the apartment and wanted to get out of the lease. I felt bad. This is my first time having my own place and I tried hard to find a place I could afford in the expensive part of town. I bought some stuff in home depot and did some rental hacks to better the kitchens look and while I was setting this stuff up with my friends, roommate came over and complained about his bathroom and the smoke smell ( his bathroom has mold because he never cleaned it )
So what do I do after? I get some stuff and clean the carpets to try and get the smell out. Roommate gets home late at night and I can hear him cussing. He comes to my room and tells me that the smell is making his body itch and that I can’t use anything with scent in the apartment.  I knew about the bleach stuff cause I read it on his reddit but never told me I couldn’t clean at all.  This morning as I was getting ready for work he texted me saying he stayed in a hotel and i owe him $200. Not only do I not have that kind of money cause I just started working again and spent a lot of money moving, buying furniture for us and fixing up the kitchen but I feel like this is the kind of stuff I should have been told before I even moved in with him. I didn’t know I had to call and ask if I could clean the apartment either ( that was what he said I should have done) He also seemed normal when I saw him. I didn’t notice anything on his skin but he kept complaining about the clean smell. How do I navigate this?

Tldr: I cleaned my apartments carpet to get rid of smoke smell roommate kept complaining about,  but roommate claims it caused him an allergic reaction and he wants me to pay him for his hotel stay.",18Jul2019,1
379,"I'm on mobile. 

I've suffered from chronic migraines for 10+ years but for the most part they had been under control and I function well. I also live in a townhouse/attached house whatever you want to call it. 

That being said my neighbors bought the house next to me around 6 months ago and since the day they moved in have been blasting loud bass heavy music that shakes my windows and floors. I have lived here for 3 years and have never heard anything from the previous neighbor or the people who live on the other side of me. This is not a thin wall issue. At first my boyfriend and I knocked on their door and explained that it was too loud. They said they would turn it down and then did not. The next time we went back over there and knocked on the door and someone answered and demanded to come in our house and hear it because ""there is no way it's actually that loud."" We politely declined that. The next time we went over they refused to answer the door. Eventually we moved on to filing noise complaints with the local police. I have filed at least 6 and other neighbors, whose houses aren't even attached to this house it's just that loud, have filed at least 2 to my knowledge. I've seen the police outside twice and they also refused to open the door for the police for around 15 minutes and when they eventually did the police just gave them a warning and left. 

The music is on 4 or 5 times a week most weeks. It physically makes me ill. Loud bass and interrupted sleep are two of the things that are guaranteed to give me a debilitating migraine. Monday night their music was on from 11pm to 8am and that was enough to keep me in bed sick for 2 days. This morning it started at 5am. I keep missing work due to being sick. At this point I have no idea what else to do. These people don't care and filing noise complaints has changed nothing. 

Sorry this is so long. 

Tl;dr - Neighbors loud music/bass is causing me migraines, no attempts at getting them to stop has worked.",18Jul2019,5
380,"There’s someone I’m working with on a project. It’s potentially a great one; it’s something that would be good not only for me, but for a lot of others. The creator is a generally decent guy with a big vision. 

The problem is that he’s overly flirty with women who aren’t into him. I don’t think he’s a rapist or anything, he just says things that he really shouldn’t. 

In some cases, I would say that this is none of my business. But I took him to an event recently, and another man who was there mentioned this to me. 

I also think that he might be doing this on Facebook. I noticed that he became FB friends with a girl I knew in high school – I don’t think they would know each other besides him seeing her via my posts – and now they aren’t anymore. My gut says that he did something creepy, though I haven’t asked her yet.

Questions:
1. How do I approach him on this? I feel like I need to discuss it. First, he was at the recent event because of me. (He would like to be invited to more things like this, and he has said so.) Second, I want this project to proceed, and if he’s creeping women out, that will jeopardize it.

2. Should I ask the high school friend whether he did something that creeped her out? If he did, I feel slightly responsible because I’m the only person they know in common.",18Jul2019,1

I'm at a dead-end, fellas. I'm 19 and have never worked a job, I'm great at my academics but compared to the people around me I feel worthless because I have no idea how to get (much less hold down) a job. It's not like I study marketing or commerce or computer science or anything practical either, I'm studying fucking physics and mathematics (and I love it, but there's no clear career path with that because I don't want to go into academia). My degree is full time and I use all my time in the semester to study so the only time I can work is in the summer holidays (Dec - Mar). These days a degree is not enough and the norm is to have a job or internship while studying full time (might not be true in the US but in Sydney, Australia it is). 

My resume: I am physicist, very good mathematician. Hire me pls I will clean the fucking toilets as long as I can get some experience. 

Sorry for the rant.  

What industry would be willing to hire an undergrad who has never set foot in a work environment? Who do I talk to if I want a holiday job? Where do I go?

383,"Just a question, I work in a private environment. When I was hired I had about 35 locations to manage. I was told they may add more if they acquired another company, and the did. Now I have about 85 locations, no change in pay greater change in responsibility.

That person doesn’t work out, bad hire.

389,"Hi there! I'm 22 with around one year's worth of university and two years of intensely acquired German under my belt, and I'm really unsure as to where I should go from here.

After completing my first year of uni at the University of British Columbia back in 2016, I realised a few things:

1. Computer science is not for me, as someone who absolutely loathes maths.
2. I really want to do something positive for people and the environment. Finding ways to live more sustainably has become sort of a habit of mine, and I'd love to make it my life's work by way of working at a government environmental protection agency, for example. Thus, I decided I'd aim for a BA (and probably MA) in geography.
3. This one I've know about far before I finished that year, but I love Europe and deeply desire to live and work there permanently. I find it fascinating that one can often be in an entirely different country with an entirely different language and (relatively different) culture after just an hour or two on a usually electric, super eco-friendly train, all without extra customs or data roaming charges. I've been lucky enough to have explored a fair bit of it, but there's still so much more to see and *so* *much* history to learn.
4. I'm quite small and apparently look extremely young for my age, which leads to people often not taking me seriously or being patronising. (At 20, I got carded for buying a beer in Austria, where the legal age is 16.) Internalising this has made me rather anxious, unconfident and more susceptible to depression over the past few years - especially in Austria, where most guys seem to look like they're my age by the time they can start drinking. I keep telling myself I should try working out to boost confidence, but half of me rejects wholesale the idea of having to change myself in order to justify my existence to others who over-prioritise appearances, whilst the other  accepts that reality and is curious to see what'd happen but also too intimidated to start. I run and love hiking and being amidst nature, but otherwise I'm happiest learning, discussing and baking indoors (all that a heat-sensitive person can ever do in Texas, really), so it's tough to get into lifting weights.
5. I am terrified of taking out student loans. I'm originally from Texas, but living there was awfully depressing for me due to the culture, sprawling, car dependent cities and above all the scorching heat, which I find [mentally and physically debilitating](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/people-get-seasonal-depression-summer-too-180955673/). I fell in love with the gorgeous, relatively temperate Pacific Northwest on a family road trip, so my family and I decided it'd be best for me to study there as it's a good compromise between staying at home and, well, utterly hating my life, and being on an entirely different continent. We initially looked into the University of Washington, but thanks to the US's ridiculous concept of 'out-of-state' tuition, it was going to cost my parents - and me, after graduation - $50k a year. UBC, just across the border in my favourite region of North America, was a bit less painful at around $31k thanks to the exchange rate, so that's where I applied and was subsequently accepted. I enjoyed the beautiful, foggy autumn on campus, made some friends, did some hiking and managed well in my courses unrelated to CS. Thanks to two scholarships I received, the total for that year was a wee bit (roughly $8k) less agonising and my parents made due without saddling me with loans, but it was nevertheless preposterous to my mind.

With the prospect of not being so financially lucky in the years to come, along with the knowledge that a) my dad would very much like to retire soon and b) my sister would soon be going to her own crazy-expensive-but-initially-subsidised uni back in Texas as well (she's just finished her first year now), I decided that I simply couldn't bear to burden my parents or myself with such ludicrous sums for three more years - at the *least* (remember, I switched majors). And all that aside, I find the idea that we're meant to go into such debt to obtain an education that is nowadays required for virtually any professional, non-vocational job utterly absurd. In most other Western countries, it's seen as it should be: the natural step after secondary school for anyone who desires higher learning and isn't getting an apprenticeship. As such, it's funded as such and made either free or nearly free to all citizens (like it was when my parents went, go figure!) - and in the case of a select few like Iceland, Norway, Germany and Austria, it's a nominal fee for anyone who speaks the language and can prove they've enough money to live there for at least a year. And, of course, who can either gain admission via previous merit or, in the case of Austria, passing the exams of the introductory semester.

So, off to Austria I went! My grandfather was from there, so I've quite a bit of family with whom I wanted to reconnect and who were happy to welcome me in and assist with all the bureaucracy. I took intensive German semester courses, so around 3 hours per day, 5 times a week. In my free time, I mostly hung out with a great friend I made in class, ate delicious vegan food and tried my best to avoid the ant infestation caused by my messy flatmate by exploring the city, neighbouring Bratislava and a few great cities elsewhere. Life was good! But the end of my second course coincided with the onset of my first real summer in Vienna, which I quickly discovered could get just as oppressively hot as in Texas, although manageable indoors thanks to Austrians knowing how to build comfy, sustainable Passivhäuser. I began to worry about lethargy, but fortunately, courses were over for the summer and my lease was up, so my parents dragged me home, where at the very least I could practice bake therapy, enjoy the necessary, highly counterintuitive evil that is air conditioning and occasionally overcome my hatred for cars, malls and heat in order to visit friends.

Shortly after I returned to start what I thought would be my final language course, an even more intense one designed for uni applicants, my dear friend up and left, and this was pretty tough for me. Relatives aside, I was now pretty much alone in the city, with my nearest friends thousands of kilometres away. I'm not one to simply leave friends - at least not completely; we stay in touch via social media and I visit when I'm around. Despite the arrival of the half of the year in which I usually feel my absolute best and most brilliant, I felt nothing of the sort. I put on a smile and gave my all in class, but this quickly faded once I stepped out into the courtyard and observed all the happy groups and couples sipping their warming Glühwein and Punsch at one of the city's many picturesque Christmas markets. I would have been doing the same a year before. After many frigid post-class evenings spent sweating in the roasting U-Bahn and trudging through the slippery snow to my super-eco flat in the city's newest, most isolated district, my days brightened only by short jaunts to Bratislava and Prague, I began to get desperate and could see no future for myself in Austria. I developed a hatred for Vienna, which is just preposterous; as cities go, it's pretty much the best all around. Just before the course ended and I passed the exam needed for uni admittance, I decided I wanted to go back to UBC. I'd be drowning in debt, but at least I'd be able to cry about it with friends, so my thinking went.

So, back to Texas I went! Yes, Texas. I stayed at home over the summer, doing my usual baking and whatnot until July came around. The excitement and joy I felt when I caught my first glance of Seattle's glorious, verdant landscape is indescribable. Vancouver's housing market being insane as it is, I only managed to arrange a 1.5-month sublet, with the intention of finding a more permanent place during that time. Things were pretty great: My housemate became a great friend; my old friends graciously welcomed my return; I felt ready to dive into the books and join clubs once school started; and although the heat still wasn't great, I learnt to accept that the only summer I'll ever love is one spent in Reykjavík, and I can't afford to move there just yet. But alas, as the wildfires polluted the city with record levels of smoke, as the heat grew hotter and as the days left to find a place that wasn't insanely costly melted away, my depression grew stronger, and I didn't think to expend the money to see someone about it. I had less than a week before school was to start, my housing search was all but impossible and the existential dread about my future debt began to set in again. So, what do you think I did?

Yep, you guessed it! Although doing something for the sake of brevity seems ridiculous at this point, I'll spare some details. Suffice it to say that I felt more or less just as sad and lonely as before. I took another German course as an effort to ensure I'd not forgotten too much, and indeed I hadn't (I love the language and absorb it as much as I do English nowadays). By the end of the course, I had trapped myself in the same situation as the year prior: Under the Austrian system, it's not so easy to start uni in the summer: you can take the exams, but otherwise you're on your own with no lectures to augment the material and prepare. With that in mind, it felt a waste of time and money to stick around for much longer.

Resigned to a life of indebtedness, I headed back to Canada in May, happy to see my friends again and to hug some big trees, albeit fully transparent about my persisting hesitance toward staying for the long haul. I took my first course in Geography and determined that I'd enjoy pursuing my degree in the subject. Still, that one course was like US$4k...

So, here I am today, sat in my tiny, poorly insulated Vancouver apartment, stuck in a deep funk after hiding from the sun for the fourth day in a row and not getting any summer jobs for which I've applied (too short a time period for so much training). Most of my friends are away on holiday or about to be, and although I've been officially diagnosed with depression and have been taking antidepressants which have helped a bit, my mood's still pretty erratic. I just received another $5k scholarship offer I applied for months ago, but it's still in my inbox as I try to make up my mind for what simply has to be the last time (not least because I hate myself for all the flights I've taken):

&amp;#x200B;

**After investing so much time, effort and (some) money into learning German to near fluency, should I not overcome my anxieties, go back there and finally start studying, knowing that I'd eventually make friends and become more comfortable with staying there, especially when I'd save myself and my parents** ***SO MUCH*** **money and ultimately end up with two degrees, fluent German, a unique experience and connections on the continent where I want to be anyway?**

&amp;#x200B;

***OR...***

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I accept the fate of being a US citizen in 2019 and take the loans (roughly $44-64k before all the mortifying interest, I'm estimating) in order to finish my degree here at UBC in the hopes that, with the help of my parents (covering \~$20k/year), some more scholarships via luck/academic success and some part-time jobs (and, optimally, the chance that President Sanders comes in and saves us all from this insanity with his debt-elimination plan), I'll somehow manage the still-pretty-overwhelming sum well enough to make it all worthwhile?**   
('\[I\]t all' being courses in my native tongue, a degree from a fairly prestigious uni and more time with good friends I've already made...at least until they all get jobs and move on in a year.)

&amp;#x200B;

^((To help with the financial case, you should know that I'm gay, fairly minimalist and quite anti-consumerist, so I see no children, cars, mortgages, regular iPhone upgrades or probably even weddings in my future. I've been more than fine subsisting on around $10k per annum for the past few years in Austria, so although I don't expect a job that involves environmental) *^(protection)* ^(rather than destruction to pay all that much, wrong as that is, I'm fairly certain I'd have some disposable income to pay down loans after all's said and done. I'd just much rather donate that to causes and people who need it.))

391,"So I’ve recently joined a company and have been placed in a team with a manager who has a bit of a reputation for micro managing. I have to attend a family event next week for a couple of hours in the morning and asked my manager whether it would be possible to take the morning off as holiday/unpaid leave and work from home in the afternoon. This was for two reasons, firstly because it seemed pointless taking an entire day off for a 2/3 hour event and secondly, as I’ve recently just joined I want to be as present as possible (it wouldn’t be achievable for me to get back into the office for the afternoon). 

When I asked my manager whether this would be a possibility, he said no (which is mildly annoying, but ultimately his decision) and explained that he didn’t support working from home for new joiners due to the fact he believed they needed supervision. This was the part that came across as extremely patronising to me. I am degree educated in a relevant subject and have some previous experience in similar roles. 

When speaking to friends about this, they’ve all said that it was a very patronising comment and not fair I was unable to work from home. The company I work for expressly states that it supports flexible working and I have the facilities, both email and laptop access (provided by the company) to do my work to the same standard as I would in the office.

I feel strange posting this because I feel like I know the answers but I’ll just post anyway. Writing out seems to relax me a bit. Any advice or tips are appreciated regardless.",18Jul2019,1
398,"Alright, so some backstory:
I'm 20 years old. I'm pretty unattractive facially, not overweight or acne covered, just bad facial bones. Girls have never really been into me for my whole life. But recently, I kinda got into seeing escorts as a means of dealing with that. I've seen about 4 now. 
Recently I saw one, and not only did I do the stupidest thing by going completely raw, but I also engaged orally with her. I now have a sore throat and I'm wondering if I messed up pretty bad. 


At the moment I don't have a job or a car of my own, and I blew essentially all of my savings seeing escorts, so I can't really drive myself anywhere. Hence the need to tell my mother. 
I think she already kinda knows something is up, because she asked if she could borrow some cash so she didn't have to go to the atm, and I told her I had none after I had just recently got some. Ended up lying and saying someone must have stolen it while I was out somewhere. 

All that aside, I'm really just unsure of what to do. If I tell her, there's gonna be hell. I've been considering maybe just waiting it out until I can get a job again so I can take myself somewhere, but I'm not sure if it would be good to wait. 


What do I do?",18Jul2019,1
399,"Hi. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I just got my first job, and it’s a really fast paced retail environment and I’m not coping at all.

I have had GAD and depression since my pre/early teens and haven’t found anything to help with them yet, despite trying medication and seeing lots and lots of therapists. (I am going to go back to my psych to ask about new meds when I get my rota but since this will be medication number six I am finding it hard to be optimistic, and I am on the waiting list for yet another therapist, so I am doing what I can on that front.)

I’m a uni student and I wanted to find a job because I’m completely dependent on my Dad right now. He’s not got a problem with it from a moral or financial standpoint but I hate how useless I am especially compared to my friends who all have jobs and are working really hard, so I wanted to change that. 

My mental health- and I was already thinking about suicide several times a day before I began- has taken a huge dive since I started. The environment is too much for me and I feel completely demoralised. I have absolutely no idea how to cope and the desire to quit is overwhelming, because I don’t actually need this job. I’m not making enough money to put even a dent in my school fees or anything so it feels incredibly pointless. I don’t care about uni either, and obviously I don’t care about this job. But I feel so fucking pathetic compared to my coworkers who are actually living off this job and working way harder than me while they’re at it. I’m not even at uni right now, because it’s summer. I don’t have anything close to their commute. I don’t have to use this money to pay for rent and food and etc. 

I’m not sure what I’m asking. How to cope better? Whether or not I should quit? This is all just the whining of someone who has never had to work hard, and I know it. I just don’t know how to deal with it.",18Jul2019,1
402,"He pursued this girl for over a year and a half. He told me he asked her out over 50 times. They talked a lot, but she never even agreed to go on a date with him. In the end she told him that it was never going to happen and she unfriended him on Facebook and removed him from her Instagram follow list.

They stopped talking about 5 months ago. And we started dating about three weeks after things with her ended.

The last post she made on Instagram was from 7 months ago, so she doesn't post frequently at all. He also no longer follows her because she removed him from her followers list, but now her account is public. Yesterday she made her first post (on instagram stories). And I noticed that despite not following her instagram, and her never posting, he had noticed that she had posted, and watched all of her stories and liked her FIRST ever instagram post from years ago.

What could this mean?? Could he still be interested in her?

Yesterday someone came up to my co-workers and I and told us that someone here had some swastika tattoos on his neck and face and said it was making people feel uncomfortable. I immediately knew who it probably was as someone had just come in to sign up and he had face tattoos. I went to go talk to this huge man expecting some anger and potentially a fight, as I am a 5'7"" Asian male and he was around 6' with easily 25 kg more than me. I explained what was going on and wanted to hear his side of things. He explained that he had them from when he was young and dumb and was looking to get them removed, he talked about a couple local businesses that were helping him with payments to see special dermatologist removal services. I told him it was fine if he worked out but just try to cover the neck tattoo a bit if possible and that I understand we all make mistakes and I appreciated him talking to me and not getting upset. He shook my hand, another thing to note in my mindset because if he was vehemently racist would he shake an Asian persons hand?, and thanked me because a lot of businesses understandably ban him. I told him he could workout whenever but I would be doing my best to track his progress in the future and if he could keep me updated when he comes in, which he said he would.

My issue comes from the guy who talked to me about him, he said if the tattoo guy tells me that he is getting them removed he is lying and that he has said that before. But a random girl came up and told me that she has known him for a while and that the guy is doing his best and getting them removed and it just got pushed back.

What would y'all do? I like to believe that we all make mistakes and not to condemn someone for them, but I also hate the idea of someone taking advantage of people.",18Jul2019,16
406,So I’m on vacation right now with my family and there are very cute lifeguards at the beach on duty. Apparently one took an interest in me and at the end of the day he asked for my number. He was very cute so I happily agreed. We have been texting and he invited me to play mini golf. I also found out that he briefly went to the same college as one of my friends for a year. So I asked him his last name to tell her and see if she knew him. But when he gave me it we couldn’t find him on a single social media site. No Facebook Instagram or anything. We both find it odd in this day and age to not have one. But it is a possibility that he’s not into it. My question is do I go on the date taking proper safety precautions like him meeting my family and sharing my location with my family so they know where I am.

Recently it's been getting much worse. When I type or read, my eyes don't focus directly on one point. Instead, I look all over and have to read through my peripheral vision. I was tired of dealing with it so I went to an ophthalmologist and got checked. I have something called convergence insufficiency and my eye muscle health is rapidly declining so I need to get surgery for it. It's rare in adults (I'm 18, though) and more prevalent in children so I have to see a pediatrician to get a more thorough checkup and understanding.

413,"So I decided to tell the full story, I’m going to be completely honest and not give a shit if somebody finds out my identity through this post.

I am 16 and finished my Sophomore year. 

From December 2017 to August 2018 I dated my first girlfriend ever, our parents made us break up after we were caught mid-blowjob in July.

This is not the person I am trying to reconnect with however.

I am a very emotionally unstable person and my emotional support came purely from said girlfriend when we were forced to cease all contact I crashed and could barely get out of bed in the morning. 

This is not the person I am trying to reconnect with however.

I have co-morbid Conduct Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder and every day is a struggle to act appropriately and get up in the morning. I am pretty attractive and charming and my family is pretty rich so I have a few things going for me in the dating department.

When school restarted I immediately befriended a new group of people who I had never met before. I hit on every person in the group but eventually dated one of them.

Now I was a terrible person with them I hit on every girl in the group, I got to 2nd base with two of them before even getting to know the girl I ended up dating, I’ll call her Ray. I was a massive fucking douchebag piece of shit and there’s no god damn reason any of them should have kept me around.

While we were dating and I really got to know her she became my new source of emotional support, I told Ray every single thing that happened in a day and I listened to her. I was content and happy. 

We worked together to mess with and ruin the reputations of people that she didn’t like, she’d have me get nudes from girls that she didn’t like so she could spread them around the school, I emotionally manipulated several people to get their nudes so she could do this. 

It was around this time that one of her friends started to spread a rumor that I had raped her at a pool. We had messed around sexually at pools and gone to third base a few times in private but that was all consensual and never when there were other people around. 

The group (that I had treated horribly) decided to stop talking to me and Ray was made fun of for dating me and spending time with me. We broke up in October of that year and stopped talking until December. 

I dated a third girl from a few days after we broke up until she wanted to be friends again, I didn’t feel anything for this third girl and she was in love with me. She was just a sexual partner of mine and I feel like a monster looking back because I emotionally manipulated her into having sex with me and even though she did give enthusiastic consent it was still fucked up for me to pretend to love her to get in her pants. This is something I will never forgive myself for.

When Ray wanted to become friends again in December during winter break it was because the group of friends that told her to break up with me became sick of her and she had nobody else to be around. We started dating briefly but then decided we were better off as friends.

When school resumed Ray refused to be seen near me in school, however when school ended we were the only people we spent time with. She started a club and began dating the president of the club. 

Then in March Ray blocked me on all social media then had her boyfriend tell me that if I tried to contact her again he would jump me. 

I immediately dated a fourth girl and pulled the same fucking shit I did with the third girl, I emotionally manipulated her into having sex with me and never cared about her. I won’t forgive myself for this either. 

While I dated the fourth girl her ex-boyfriend regularly threatened me with threats of physical harm and talked about ruining me. He knew what me and Ray had been doing and had all the screenshots and text messages to prove it from the girls that I messed with. He reported me to the school and I was talked to by the school administration and police. 

However, I was absent from school on the day before they brought me in, the school brought in Ray, the girls I received nudes from, and the ex-boyfriend.

Ray went out of her way to warn me about what happened and we worked together to come up with some alibi that cleared us both of what had happened. We made fake social media screenshots and all sorts of shit that made it look like the ex-boyfriend pretended to be the two of us and got their nudes. 

The alibi and fake screenshots all worked and me and Ray were cleared from the shit we did. However once it was all over she immediately blocked me again and has refused to talk to me since. 

When we were working together to make our alibis and the fake screenshots just spending time with her made me so happy and even though what we were doing was fucked up it all made me so happy. 

However the rape rumors from the beginning of the year got big after the ordeal with the police because it was the talk of the school. Nobody in school would talk to me, and from April until school got out only a few people in the entire school would even look at me. 

I attempted suicide during the end of the school year on school grounds using prescription medication. I was in forced hospitalization for two weeks and was only allowed to attend school again because finals were approaching.

I started therapy and was evaluated by a psychologist and after a few weeks of therapy and a few psychological evaluations I was diagnosed with conduct disorder and borderline personality disorder.

I have been taking anti-depressants and taking part in cognitive behavioral therapy and group therapy along with one on one sessions with my therapist.

416,"Let me preface this first by giving you an idea of what I look like. I'm 4'11"" and 85 pounds, a little curvy. 

I've been a temp at this small company for about five weeks. I love my coworkers and the environment I get to be a part of every day. They include me in everything and treat me like a human being, which is hard to come by.

Unfortunately, since day one I have been asked about my weight in one way or another. Here are some examples:

""Are you eating?"" or ""I'm glad to see you're eating!"" ""Did you eat today?"" ""Can I get you something while I'm on my break?"" ""What size are you?"" ""Tell me, how much do you weigh?"" ""Have you always been this small??""

And any variation of that that can be imagined has been said. I am constantly being offered candy or given a small cake because ""you're so sweet"", but it feels like more than.

I've never given a reason for them to be concerned. I will occasionally eat breakfast in the office. I have at least two cups of coffee with a little cream and sugar. I have some kind of lunch that day, occasionally taking up the offer when someone offers to buy me food. I tend to eat at my desk as I eat very slowly, which is commented on often, ""you eat like a bird!"".

This isn't the first time I've been ridiculed over my weight. After trying to kill myself I was given double portions at the hospital due to the assumption that I had a problem with food after being searched and weighed.

And it's funny, in a way. I've been smaller, much smaller. The weight I am at today took almost five years to achieve after a battle with dismissing bronchitis and being prescribed steroids that made it impossible to keep food down for months. I was 62 lbs. I tend to share this story with anyone new who is concerned about my weight to get them off my back, but sometimes it just gets worse.

She had already told me that she had nothing planned for that week so I took the hint that she wasn't interested (I figured I would rather not go out with her then put her in a situation where she didn't feel comfortable), she is very shy and so am I so our conversations can be quite awkward at times, not painfully awkward though. So I apologised for putting her on the spot like that and we continued messaging as if nothing had happened throughout the following week.

Life is just slow, you know. I want it to speed up but it's out of my power and it's just frustrating. This chronic boredom has pushed me to do very questionable things in the past and it's just not good for my overall wellbeing lol.

423,"My sibling and I grew up very close, they are 1 year my elder and we did everything together - hell, they were my best friend growing up. Since we graduated from college, we've lost a bit of contact but still manage to see/speak every other every other week or so. We are now in our late 20's and have established professional lives (myself in business and them in teaching), our own apartments, and are in long-term relationships. I have been transparent with my family on my salary increases from raises/promotions/switching companies throughout my career, my family is very tight-knit and I didn't feel strange sharing this information with them - we celebrated everyone's success. I am aware that my SO and myself pull in significantly more money than they do, earnings in the 95th percentile - although we do not live extravagantly. My SO and I began to notice my sibling and their SO had recently begun to compare their lives to ours while we shared stories when catching up. As a recent example; we were reminiscing of having dinner together on our front porch during the week and later making smores and having some wine in our backyard when they interjected that they ***also*** have a porch and enjoy using it as well (we rent a house, they rent in a complex and do not have a yard if that matters). The flow of the conversation was odd and died off, both my SO and I felt uncomfortable. We aren't looking for validation from them - we are both very secure with who we are and aren't looking to impress anyone, we were just sharing a story from our week. I realize this may seem insignificant reading through this, but something to this effect seems to happen every time we're together &amp; catching up. I treasure my sibling/family and my relationship with them more than anything, I certainly don't want to have some silly sibling rivalry.

425,"I’m 16 and I have been dealing with depression these past years. Before it got this bad, I was doing average in school. But now that I have fallen deeper into this hole of negative energy, it’s ruining my life. I never talk to my parents about how I feel, or how I do in school. Especially school, because I don’t want to deal with that added pressure to get my grades up. Just yesterday an email got sent to my parents about my D+ in my summer school class, because I haven’t been showing them the progress report to sign. So the same day, they pulled me out of my room and to have a “talk”.

Please keep in mind that I have a lot of trauma from my childhood because of physical abuse with my father. They don’t hit me anymore, but I still get really anxious and paranoid when I’m alone with my father. Sometimes I even feel nauseated. 

Just like every other “talk”, they were basically scolding me before they even gave me the chance to talk. Telling me about how I only have one job, and it’s school. It’s like they think that school is easy, despite the stressful environment and terrible people. They kept on rambling about it, and then they started talking about my future. Saying that if I don’t want to go to college, it’s fine, but I would need to graduate high school to get a job and be a “nobody” like them (they didn’t finish high school in Mexico).
Then they were giving hints about kicking me out of the house, saying that they wouldn’t maintain me anymore once I am able to work fully. I don’t know, they were just murdering my self esteem and motivation.

Prior to the talk, I was already working on ALL of the homework I had to catch up on. As I am typing this, today is the last day of summer school so I’ll have to make this quick. But I finished all of my work last night, and it turns out my dad asked for a meeting with my teacher today in the morning. I haven’t been doing most of the work in class, but I would finish it all at home. I have just been slacking off the past few days. You are all going to hate me for saying this, but we had a quiz yesterday, and I didn’t take it because I didn’t have a pencil. Before you ask why I didn’t ask someone around for a pencil, I am extremely anti social, and I knew none of my classmates. So I can’t wait for my teacher to bring up my missing quiz today. ^(/s) I’ll of course have to think of an excuse for that. Telling them the truth is not an option.

My parents have tried to talk with me before, but it never worked out. It was mostly my dad that would come into my room and close the door shut. As soon as I heard the door close, I would physically and psychologically freeze up. I felt completely vulnerable and exposed, despite the fact that it was just to “talk”. The thing about these talks, is that sometimes I try to get my thoughts together to at least say something valuable, but it takes me a long time, and my dad is an impatient diabetic so he almost clenches his teeth, saying my name in a serious way and commanding me to speak. So I literally have to speak at that exact moment and end up saying something that is not true, or something that isn’t worth anything, for the sake of my concerned safety.

My summer school teacher has confronted me in class before all of this. Telling me that I am a smart kid, but I just decide to not do the work. Yesterday when he told me during class that my dad wanted a meeting, he started talking about how he is still a college student and has 16 page essays to write. He tells me about how he doesn’t want to do them, but it’s something he has to do. To be honest, he really opened my eyes from then on. Which is why I finished up all of my missing work. I just wish it didn’t have to turn out like this. I wish my parents didn’t have to know about my struggles, because I am going to pick things up for the test we have today. I feel prepared, and it’s worth 40% of my grade. Hopefully I can get a C off today. If I do really good and my grade jumps, I will definitely ask of him to send another email to my parents with the updated and improved grade. Because they don’t accept things off of my pure words. They don’t trust me, but I guess I gave them some reasons for why that is.

Can anyone help me with my situation with my parents? Or tips to not fall off on school work because of depression?",18Jul2019,1

429,"The other day when I was visiting my parents house my brother (24) came in with his girlfriend drunk and headed upstairs - after a while we heard commotion and he was abusing his partner in his room (throwing things at her, calling her, etc).

My parents tried to help but his temper rapidly multiplied and he ended up breaking mirrors, punching holes in the wall, smashing the tv, etc. 

In the process my mam (57) convulsed on the floor and he walked past me trying to frantically bring her round, he swang to punch me and my dad (56) and he ran out into the street with no clothes on shouting and screaming. 

He’s only ever violent when he has had drugs and alcohol but he’s doing both more and more and it’s happening more often...  I definitely think he has a mental health problem.

My parents are heartbroken and close to giving up on him and he’s been warned to stay away for a few days but they’ve invited him round to talk and try to resolve things tonight.

I don’t really know what I can do to help other than let him know he needs help and that he has a problem. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this here. I guess I’m looking for some advice - what do I do? What do I say? What don’t I say? Has anyone ever gone through something similar?",18Jul2019,3

I happen to be one of the 500 kids who pass the test. If tomorrow I agree to go, the agency takes $900 and see if I pass the interview. If I don't - cool, I get my money back. If I do, and I refuse to go then that $900 is gone forever. Anyhow, this might not seem like a hard decision, but my mind right now is going insane. In my country, a military training which takes place over 3 years (and during school years, only happens 1 day a week) and can be enrolled until age of 21. If you enroll the training, you don't have to be in the military for 2 years. Even though studying in the U.S. for roughly 10 months won't make me miss my chance to enroll the training, it sucks to know that your friends are 1 year ahead of you in term of training and such.

432,"For context, I have this long term friend who randomly comes in and out of my life, then is pushy with boundaries. She lives 2 hours away from me, and we rarely see each other. For many years, I made the trip to see her, and she would often be very, very late and not respect my time. Fast forward, I have owned a house for almost 10 years, and now have a baby. She went from never visiting to all the sudden coming for a random visit after the baby was born for over an 8 hour visit. It was too much for my husband and I, and it wasnt a visit where she was helping out with the baby (she just sat there and watched me do everything; it was kinda annoying). Again, she arrived many hours later then she said she would (she said she would be there after lunchtime and arrived 5pm), had no idea she was staying for dinner because I was under the impression it was going to be a quick visit. She then proceeded to hang around till almost midnight. It really threw my infant daughter off. My husband was super irritated because he was trying to be a good host but she was not timely with when she said she would arrive, stayed a lot time, and he scrambled to run to store/cook so we can have dinner for her.

That was in November, ironically black Friday. Her husband works in retail and my guess was he wasnt around and she was bored. I felt at the time it was nice that she was visiting, she had outfits/gifts for baby, and she brought over hand me downs from her sisters kids (albeit over 10 years old but that is another story). But I felt she was visiting because she has no one else to hang out with. It was awkward because I was changing the baby, breastfeeding, couldnt go anywhere as I was still healing from c section...and here I was feeling like I had to entertain someone.

So it's been over six months, and I hear from her again with a phone call (she rarely texts and doesnt respond well to them; ignores them). She now wants to come over in a couple of weeks because she ""needs to get away."" Her husband is away, and at first she said on a Saturday. I agree...then later in the call she says ""Is it ok if I stay till Sunday?"" I was thinking, here we go again! Just hanging out for hours and hours on end, I have a baby and house to take care of, and now I have to host till the next day when ever she plans to leave. 

I tell her it's a bad idea because I dont have a spare bed. Her response is no worries I'll sleep on couch. I said my husband usually takes the couch and she giggled...he seriously does though! My husband is super irritated because he sleeps odd hours as a SAHD to counteract the hours I need to work so I get enough sleep with baby for work (he goes to bed 3am, and I take the morning shift with baby; he stays on couch during these late times with baby monitor nearby). My husband has a great point, and then he brings up the obvious ""I guess she is bored and her husband isnt around? Where was she all these years we owned this house and never visited (like I said, almost 10 years, and I've known this girl for 25+ years; she finally visited us last November and stayed almost 8 hours)."" 

We know she was nearby over the years when she was with her husband, even within five miles away, but didnt bother to visit until last year.  My husband doesnt really know her that well, and really only met her once at a funeral. He doesnt feel comfortable with her staying overnight, and would like her to have time limits on her visit. I dont see how she is not going to try to push the boundaries with what my husband is saying, and it's going to create an issue (she has always been a pushy person). 

I have to admit, I hold onto this friendship because I've known her since we were teens, but I am thinking it may be time to move on and NOT let her come over since I try to implement boundaries and her response is always a work around.",18Jul2019,1

440,"Hello everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Months ago, I was arrested for DUI. I amazingly was graced and am going to beat the case. I was in a really dark place then, and now I'm a very different person. I'm thankful I'm not in that place anymore but not I'm having problems. I am a rising college senior. I have an internship right now with a big company, and next summer I'll be at a big 4 accounting firm. I made all As this semester, and I have been exercising everyday. I also have stopped masturbating, I no longer take any drugs or drink. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the problem? I feel very empty, without direction, and unfulfilled.

&amp;#x200B;

The first problem is that I don't know how/why I am disciplining myself so hard. I have been waking up early like before 5am and exercising nearly everyday and going to bed early and eating healthy. I do not know why though. At its core, I'm uncomfortable with my body. However, I have lost 25 pounds and gained muscle mass so I wonder if the vanity I feel will ever dissipate considering how much progress I've made. I feel locked in place; I don't know how I want to push myself in the gym anymore or if I need/want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't have any time. This summer I've worked 40 hour weeks and my commute is 1+ hour both ways to my internship. Between exercising and work, I have little time to give myself personally. I used to read and value reading, but I haven't touched my summer reading list at all. I have deleted all social media, reddit, and youtube from my phone but still feel like I spend too much time on my phone. I am weary about spending time with my friends because of how much I work and exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I am super lonely. I definitely have been avoiding masturbating and have been exercising more in the hopes of making myself more presentable. Also, not doing drugs helps. I have reached out to three girls this summer, all three haven't been interested in me. I want a girlfriend who I feel like I can anchor my life around, at least to a degree. Beyond a girlfriend who I can feel companionship with, it's been a long time since I've had sex and I'm super super super missing it.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, I am now questioning my career trajectory. This is probably the best problem I have because I love planning and working on my life. But, it still adds to the tumult and list of shit I feel like I need to figure out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I want to know who can empathize with me? How did you get out of this situation? I know life is hard work, and I know that's what it takes to get better, but at this point I don't know where to put the effort.

442,"I just... don’t like people.

I mean, I get why I *should*. I know that, if there are any moral duties at all, the top one is “love thy neighbor.” I realize that we are social animals, and it’s not healthy to be a recluse and shut myself off from human society. But that doesn’t bring me any closer to liking people.

It’s like broccoli. If I don’t like the taste of broccoli, it doesn’t matter if you tell me all about how healthy it is. It’s not going to make me like broccoli. I may even eat the broccoli, but I’m going to make a face the entire time.

Well, human beings are my broccoli.

I know I need to be more friendly. More social. But people, by and large, just annoy the hell out of me and make me uncomfortable. 

Trying to carry on a conversation with anyone is like taking a pop quiz in school, in a subject I know nothing about, and the consequences for not getting an ‘A’ is that everyone thinks I’m an asshole. 

I don’t care about the things most people care about (sports, pop culture, etc.) and if I do care, it’s usually big things that I disagree with them on (politics, religion) and I just can’t imagine a circumstance in which those cans of worms are remotely worth opening. 

And like-minded people are no better. OK, so you and I both like Black Sabbath and both support such-and-such policy. So? What am I supposed to do with that?

Say I join an online forum or FB group devoted to one of my interests, for example horror movies. Talking about horror movies with other horror fans sounds like the sort of thing that should be fun, right? That’s the whole point of fandom. But... it’s not. It’s just a bunch of Freddy Krueger memes and posts like “hey, what did you think of such-and-such movie?” Person A likes that movie, Person B thought it was overrated, Person C hasn’t seen it yet. So what? What’s the fun part of this conversation supposed to be?

And I know I’m the maladjusted asshole here. I know I should enjoy human company more. But I don’t, and it’s making me pretty miserable.

What should I do?",18Jul2019,1
444,"We are about 5k short on closing costs. It really did throw a wrench in the process. We were anticipating closing costs to be around 5-7k. My brother said he can lend me another 7k to help. I don't think I'll need that much more. But let's say he does lend me the 7k that's already 10k that I owe him. I don't like to borrow money especially from family bc it can ruin relationships. I intend to pay it back asap bc I hate having any debt. With that said 

1. Should I borrow the 7k from my brother even though I probably won't need that much. So totaling 10k from him. 

2. My father in law just says pay him back when I can. 

3. My brother is a little different. He wants a commitment and rightfully so. 

4. We are using a down payment assistance program where it's tacked on to the mortgage. 

5. If we back out now we will lose that program bc it's an FHA program and they're pausing it for now. 

6. The seller is not willing to help with closing costs. 

7. So either we take the 10k in help from my brother and move in. 

8. Or we back out. Lose the down payment help and have to include that as we are saving. 

9. So we may have to save up around 20k for closing costs and 3.5% down payment. 

10. Waiting means we have to wait a while to save that up.

I’m gonna list the facts. 21 year old guy. Quite goodlooking, but not very built. never had a problem with girls. Studying Medicine and it’s going fine but I’m not achieving Honor results. I am passionate about the career and don’t want to give up. I have 4-5 years left.


I have a girlfriend. This is where things turn bad. She’s in my college course. She’s very pretty. We were together for a few months last year but ended when I told her I was having doubts about us which I was. We didn’t get along so well. I was abusive to her and I actually slapped her one time. This left my reputation and relationship in tatters. And it was entirely my fault. I admit I was very sorry and wrong. I begged her back for months and we would frequently sleep together. I had also had a girlfriend before this who I was very bad to not physically abusive but mentally abusive and I cheated on her many times after I took her back after finding out she’d kissed a boy behind my back. These are the facts. I had a terrible reputation with girls leaving that as I recklessly cheated on her for 1.5 years. I’m in a normal size city so it’s not like everyone knows but a lot of people I know do. But that relationship ended two years ago.
I love my current girlfriend but I can’t see past her being with other people when we were broken up for several months even though it was my fault and I was too. I don’t mind so much that she was with others just that she slept with a guy in the course and I have to see him and I feel awkward around him as he’s quite popular and I feel like second best even though she never cared about him just did it to stop me asking her back. She eventually came back when I gave up on her.
I’ve been such a dickhead to everyone. I have a bad reputation in my college year. I amnt that good at making friends. I am confident at times but shy at others and a bit arrogant and stand offish and a little awkward at times. I find it hard to properly maintain a good relationship. I always find I listen more or they find out i’m a pretty bad person. or that’s what i think. or i’m boring and not sure about myself because i believe I’m not a good person. I don’t know how to salvage it. I have friends, but I don’t really like them or feel too close to them. I love my girlfriend and I wish I could see past her having sex with that boy from the course but I can’t let myself fully open back up to her and I constantly worry if the relationship is right and want to leave it but fear I’ll look even more of a dickhead by leaving. I have a wandering eye still and find myself not really being the best of boyfriends to her still and every time I scold myself and think I’m a terrible person. and I just feel I shouldn’t be in relationships as I’ve pretty much been in them non stop since I was a young teen. I can’t stay loyal. I find it hard to be good. I find it hard to trust people because I believe I am a bad person and worthless and I feel awkward and disliked by people in my university year.
I have relied a lot on weed and a lot of my friends are stoners. I would like to improve myself a lot I just need advice objectively because I fear the echo chamber above is all just negative and I might be swayed to the dark side and consider suicide. I want to be liked. I want to have girls but I also want the girlfriend. But I still play the facade of everything’s fine in life to my family who I am detaching from. and to my girlfriend who takes up a lot of my time and I haven’t put much effort into friendships. I play the facade it’s fine but constantly consider breaking up because I feel embarrassed by the whole thing and also like my reputation needs to improve and I think removing myself from that situation nicely and quietly (unlike the first breakup) would help. But am I throwing a good thing away because I have too much pride? and I don’t want to go through the heartbreak of having to see her all the time because she’s in my course and maybe having to worry if she’ll go back to that guy or one of my friend or something else. so i consider breaking up and just saying fuck it to everything and not caring about any of it or anything to do with her or I’ve even considered telling her the truth that I can’t see past the other boy. But i don’t want to seem insecure and like he won. I’m all messed up. I also have shit going on mentally I’m in a dark place and I constantly want to be alone. I think therapy could work but it’s expensive and I don’t have that much money and the only free ones would be only a monthly basis in the university.
If anyone reads this I’d be so grateful, I’m at rock bottom and need advice. ideally I would like to be in better shape, more popular, get better grades, have a better reputation with girls and people, maybe drop my relationship if it’s holding one or both of us back a lot even though she’s very set on marriage and is very nice, loyal and pretty. It’s hard to leave her if she’s so into it and she’s such an objectively good catch. But i feel awkward in my year with her being with that other guy and it’s a relatively small uni course. I would like to make real friendships and be more confident in myself and not rely so much on drugs. I would like a drama free breakup should it come to that and not obsess over her after it like the last time. I would like to meet s girl I don’t constantly have doubts with too and can finally actually love and respect and not be unfaithful and awful to.

Content warning for the post in that it may contain subjects potentially distressing for some people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm halfway through 20, doing relatively well in Uni and holding pretty well with my job. I have wonderful friends, a loving family, and am on a good road to getting the fit body I've always wanted. In a few weeks I'm heading overseas to assist in an international media project. By the end of this year I'm heading to the dream vacation I've wanted since High School.   
One problem. I am under insane paranoia every single day.   


Last year I developed bad anxiety as a result of some events I don't feel like getting into. The symptoms were pretty bad, particularly with the depersonalization and delusional overthinking. I thought I was the only existent being in the universe for a solid month.   


I managed to beat it out for a good while. But this year, after a few panic attacks, I'm falling back into bad places. And now my attention has turned from existential solipsism to doomsday anxiety. And unfortunately, these thoughts aren't as objectively delusional.   
Everything is going to shit. The Climate is going more extreme and politicians shrug. Tensions are rising between nuclear powers, going back and forth from soft simmers to near-imminent WW3 starters. Technicians are building advanced AI with no regards to it potentially turning on humanity despite every single physicist, inventor and intellectual vocalising this huge risk. People are building bio-3D printers that can be sold to anyone, despite being able to literally create diseases that can halve populations. Though that may be overkill anyway, now that simple bacteria is getting strong enough to resist antibiotics. And we've forgotten the mass ecological problems soon to come from all the species we've led to extinction.

And now we have the problem of automation, making most jobs of the future useless. I'll be robbed of my labour before my eyes. No doubt leaders will blame the people for their poverty. And that's assuming there's no great violence or revolt or continued rise of fascism that makes everything fucking worse. I'm well aware that every device I use has three thousand eyes of businessmen and their tools watching me and analysing me for my consumption. And every fucking day I'm attacked with news reports, bulletins and flashy doomsday messages looking to spread the word and offer absolutely nothing of solution, instead looking to purchase my fear and enjoy the short term attention.   


I live every day in fear. I don't know what's my anxiety and what's just me being realistic. I don't want to be afraid. I want to live! I want to have a career, a wife, and kids. I want to hang with my friends, I want to travel far-off locations, grow strong and wise and die accomplished. But now I feel everything has been fucking invalidated before it's even had a chance to happen.

I can't enjoy anything anymore without my head telling me every disaster that's going to happen. I find it hard to look at my friends or family, knowing they're about to see everything horrible soon to happen. I don't why I should invest in anything I'm passionate about anymore. I keep having this obsession following me with everything I do. 

Please understand: I don't want to submit. I want to enjoy things and worry about what I can control. But I'm constantly followed around by this obsession, and everything I do feels undermined when it's always at the back of my mind.

I’m the oldest of four children and my parents (guardians, I call them mum and dad as I have lived with them longer than my birth parents) show more support and love to my younger siblings, everything that happens in the house happens to be my fault. 

For my 18th birthday, my birth parents asked my guardians if they could take me on holiday in August. I text my guardian dad the date when my birth mum sent me a message with the dates, however my older sister (15) was reading his texts and found out. I will add that guardian dad didn’t want any of my siblings to know as they’d be understandingly jealous. My brother (13) brought it up in school today and now my guardians are pretty angry with me. 

I have been out of college since the end of June and being stuck here has been driving me insane, my brother (13) has special needs and he knows exactly how to get what he wants, when he wants so he messes about in the taxi to and from school so my parents have to take him (laughs in mine and my siblings faces, because he knows we have to take a bus and we hate it) my parents blame everything he does on me (because I’m older) it’s now the last week of school for my siblings so I’ve got to deal with them until the beginning of September and I’m worried because I don’t know how I’m going to cope, I have been looking for jobs desperately as I’m trying hard to save up so I can move out (I currently only work on Saturdays and I’m restricted to where I can work as I cannot drive) I’ve taken everything into account and I’ve looked at places to rent where there are good access to buses however, the only problem I’ve got is if I move out, I have to take one of the dogs, because I chose her and everywhere is so expensive if you want to keep your dog.
Nowhere wants to take 18 year olds either, I can’t stay with a friend and I wouldn’t ask as I’d feel awful. I’m crying myself to sleep every night because I’m unable to deal with the constant arguing. I’ve tried talking about moving out with my guardians but I get told I’m just being selfish, am I wrong?

455,"Hi reddit, 
So I am a gay male, and for awhile now many gay men have really gone out of their way to talk to me, get to know me, get with me, etc. Even though it is very flattering that all these guys have tried and approach me and seem to be interested in me in one way or another, I can’t help but feel like once they meet me or have me in some sort of way, they get bored of me pretty easily and move on with their lives. Very few have reached out since initially meeting and try to stay a part of my life, and it kind of makes me feel like they just don’t even care about me or had bad intentions with me from the start.

What is something that causes this? Is there any way to stop this cycle from happening? Is this all in my head?

457,"I've been living with this guy for 4 years now, I didn't know him before he moved in. We developed a bond almost automatically and we were lovers for the first 2 years. After a while he just started to reject me, saying he only saw me as a friend, but my feelings were different and he knew that, so he just didn't want to hurt me.

I've learned to accept that he will never love me the way I do, but we are still incredibly close, we have what we could call a co-dependent relationship. We text, talk everyday, we go to movies, restaurants, we hang out a lot and we share everything.

He became my best friend before everything else,  he helped me with so many things including finding my current job which I love, pay out debts, and much more.

Today I found out that he was planning to buy a condo and move out in the next year even though we had talked about eventually taking a trip to Japan, and I know that he won't be able to afford both, so I'm crushed. I've always been anguished by the idea of him leaving or even meeting someone else, but it still hit me like a truck and I honestly don't know how I feel about it.

The main point is, I know it's going to be inevitable, he will leave one day and most likely soon, and I don't know how to deal with it, I don't know how to let him go. I think the actual truth is, I don't *want* to deal with it... it hurts when I think about it, but some part of me seems to not even believe it's going to happen.

He also promises we will still be close friends, but I don't see that happening and I'm not sure why. He is such a huge part of my life...

463,"Hey everyone, 

So i used to live with a roommate in a 1 bedroom apartment and we used to share the room and split the rent 50-50.being
We were going to get a 2 bedroom apartment for a lower price as soon as our lease would end. 

Then my GF decided she wants to move in with me so of course we share a room and my roommate has his own room. 

The thing is: I am convinced that because my GF is moving in with me and we are sharing a room, we pay 60% of the rent and he pays 40%
And we split utilities 3 ways. 

However my roommate sees that we should divide everything by 1/3. 

Also keep in mind that none of them can afford to live alone.

466,"Hello reddit. This is a throwaway account. 

I’m not a pretty girl and I’ve always been self conscious and insecure about my appearance. 

Today my male friend/colleague, in an attempt to be funny (it’s a long story), aimed his phone camera at me, pretending to take photos of me. He stopped when I asked him to stop. 

An hour later, we were at a different place and he tilted his phone towards me and I honestly thought that he was doing it again so I told him not to do it and he said “I’m not doing it” 

I know that he was pretending, I know that he wasn’t actually taking any photo, I know he wasn’t mocking me. It was all just a joke to him. There was no malice intended but he is aware that I’m VERY self conscious. The incident later - I honestly wasn’t sure if he was doing it or if I was just over reacting.  

(FYI- He has done sth similar before and I recall on the last occasion, I pointed the middle finger at him - which was not the most graceful response but he seemed to “enjoy” my response.) 

Anyway I confronted him and he was very defensive. I told him that it wasn’t just me, but a close friend also said that she wouldn’t like it (though she would do the same thing back to him.) 
His response was: “then maybe there are fundamental differences between me and you &amp; your friends because my friends would definitely be okay with it”

I guess what I really wanted was for him to say that he won’t do it to me again. I honestly wasn’t angry/sad at first. 
Instead his reaction was more along the lines of how I was the overly sensitive person who couldn’t take a joke and if he did this to his other friends, they would be able to laugh it off easilyZ 

I kind of broke down (outright ugly crying) subsequently. I told him that of all the people in the world, he should know exactly why I’m not comfortable with that action because I’ve shared my particular insecurity about my appearance with him (which wasn’t easy on my part.) 

I didn’t mean to cry but I cry easily and I have always hated this aspect of me, I hate that it makes me look weak and pathetic and I worry that it appears to be manipulation (any guy would say anything when a girl cries). 

I’ve friends who enjoy being photographed and they genuinely enjoy the camera and wouldn’t have mind what he did. I also have friends who are shy of the camera and I wouldn’t have done what he did to them. I thought he should know that I’m one of those people who are shy of cameras. 
I want to clarify - I’m not opposed to taking photos. I’m perfectly okay if we were taking a group photo or if I were asking him to help me take a solo shot. 

Sorry for the long essay. 

I need some advice: 

Am I the only person who would feel uncomfortable with such an action? Did I overreact? Am I just humorless? 
If I didn’t overreact, how do I get him to see why it bothered me so much or should I even still bother?  Can I ask him to ask his female friends if all of them would really feel comfortable and find his action funny? 
How do I handle this friendship? He is a good friend... 
Also, how do I face him at work after this? I feel so embarrassed that I cried so badly.",18Jul2019,4

470,"We've been living together for 2 years. My child is not his....we met when my child was 11.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner has a lot of anger issues. He is working on them (and he's on medication) but his reaction to a lot of things (shock, fear, annoyance) comes out as anger.  There have been a lot of incidents in our lives where he has displayed disproportionate levels of anger. He will shout/swear about stuff or get angry at me or his kids (not my child) about things. It's happened a lot. He apologizes after, but in the moment it's unpleasant to say the least. I truly dislike it and I've told him I hate feeling like I'm walking on eggshells. He only gets angry at me or his own children -- never at my daughter. His kids are used to it, but they definitely have become people pleasers, trying to read their dad's mood, always worrying about their dad's reactions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my daughter told her bio father (he does not live near us, is unable to provide any support, and is not in any position to look after my daughter) that she doesn't like living here with my partner. She told my ex that my current partner is mean to me and angry a lot of the time. I asked her about it and she admitted that she doesn't like living with him because he gets angry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner is going to therapy for it, and I have seen a reduction in his angry responses. But I truly doubt they will ever fully go away at this age. This is who he is. He displays this anger with his extended family as well at times (ex: his aunts, his father, his brothers). Everyone knows he's a hot head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not in a good position in life for several reasons that I won't get into at this point. I've been struggling with health issues and I no longer am working. My partner provides for us (very well) and I know he truly loves my daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am caught in between a rock and a hard place. My daughter has displayed signs of depression and I know she has a lot of anxiety. I'm scared I'm exacerbating (or maybe even causing) this issue by living with someone she doesn't want to live with, especially during such vulnerable years. But I also truly love him, and wanted very much to spend my life with him (despite his anger issues). If we leave, my daughter will be going to college in 4 years anyway, at which point I'll be completely alone. On top of it, I'm not in a good position financially. My partner and I aren't considered common law yet (it's 3 years here) and he's under no obligation to support me if I leave. I have no savings, no family, and we would struggle very very hard. I do know about social assistance programs but no matter what we would struggle with poverty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not under any illusions that my partner can truly change much at this point in his life. I personally am able to deal with his angry outbursts, but it's unfair to expect my daughter to do the same since she's now told me she doesn't like it here. I've spoken to my partner about her feelings, and he is upset but part of his disorder (or whatever it is) is he doesn't see how bad he is....he minimizes scary anger by calling it being grouchy. I just can't see him ever truly being able to fully change this.  Am I a horrible person if I keep my daughter in this environment until she leaves for college? I love her more than anything and it breaks my heart that she's unhappy.

I argue about this, because THEY are still giving me restrictions on some things. Rather than, letting me find out my own limits and I will learn to control myself because I know my limits.

485,"I need some moral advice. 
I've been working at the same company for 2 years now. Shortly after I got hired, I was promoted to management, which I worked my ass off for. I was quite excited about the promotion and things were going well. After a year working in my original store, the opportunity opened up for me to go to another store, as their manager had left. So I thought, why not? Change of scenery might be good. After agreeing to transfer, I felt good, it felt like I was starting a new job, although it was just a different location. About a week after I started at the new location, I realized why the previous manager had quit. The store was a mess, staff would do whatever they wanted, it was impossible to keep new staff and the customers were giving their business to other stores because even they could tell that the place was going down the tubes. After 5 months being at the new location, I had built a solid staff, I had cleaned the store up and customers were starting to come back (it takes a very long time to regain a customer). I thought things were going well. The only thing I had to fix at this point, were the sales. Because of the decrease in customers, the sales had taken a huge hit. I was working on this as my new goal. I forgot to mention, when I came to the new location, I had no supervisors or assistant managers, I did all this on my own. Anyways, I just recently had a manager meeting with the franchisee, along with the managers of his other stores. In the meeting, he told me that I was failing as a manager, that the sales should be double what they were last year and that I don't get another chance. I explained to him that before I focused on building the customer base back up, I was working on building a good team and cleaning up the store. He yelled that that ""is pure, unadulterated horseshit"". He said that the store was failing because I didn't have supervisors. Okay, of course the store would do better with supervisors, but here's the thing... they don't let me do hiring. I didn't bother reminding him of that, as I didn't want it to be seen as back talking. Up until this point in the meeting, I was wanting to just go back to the store and rethink my strategies and move the store up, but then the franchisee decided to start name calling. As I'm sure you know, there's an expression ""screwing the pooch"", it means, you're messing up. It's an expression that I'm not keen on, as I have a dog and he's one of my best friends. It's just a weird, distasteful expression. Anyways, the franchisee took it further and decided to start calling me ""dogf*cker"" two or three times in front of a room full of my peers. That did it for me. I finished the meeting. I applied for a job, got an interview two days later, and was offered a management position on the spot. The same day, I gave the franchisee and upper-management a very respectful two-week's notice. They called and asked me to stay, told me that ""you'll only be making $7K more a year"", but then never offered me a raise (which I wouldn't have taken anyways).
It's been a week and a half, I promised the other job I would be able to start on the 22nd of July, but I know that this store is going to go under as soon as I leave. I've talked to my direct boss, and she's told me that they have no one lined up to take my place and that I need to pick someone and start training them how to be a manager.... in 2 weeks. 
I'm not happy here, so why do I feel like I should stay and help them? Should I?

I knew that one of them was going to have an exam this Saturday, so I spoofed (I'll get to that) the teacher's email and sent her an email like ""Hello. Due to several reservations and doubts among your colleagues I have decided to send you the questions for the exam this Saturday"". And I sent her the email along with a picture recruiting for Scientology. And I was thinking ""This can't really go wrong"". The joke was contained within 3 people. It was clearly not a serious email. She was going to meet us in 2 hours so it wasn't like the joke could go on any longer than that. And she was in constant contact with the 3rd friend, who was right next to me, also playing along, so I figured she wouldn't do anything that could spiral this out of control.

Now. THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL. What ended up happening was that our friend, without saying anything, thought she was really being converted into Scientology. So she replied to the email with ""I think you sent the wrong file"". And this spiraled things downward fast. As soon as I knew she was in contact with the teacher I contacted both by call to come clean, but it was kind of late because things had already move forwarded. Teacher mad as heck, and the Uni's IT lab threatened with criminal action if the teacher gave them the order to forward the email to the authorities.

Now, obviously, as soon as I came home, I contacted a 2 lawyers friends of mine and a law teacher I know. Again, THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL. I did not commit any crime. The reason for that is that the only identical crime (falsifying email addresses, writing under someone else's name digitally, etc.) requires proof that the action was undertaken maliciously. As in, I had to have something to gain, or I had to have made the teacher lose something. This can't be proven, this was clearly a joke sent to 1 person only. Whether it was a good joke, a terrible joke, a smart joke, or a dumb joke, is up for a debate. But nobody can look at this and go ""Oh yea you clearly did this to destroy her reputation"" or ""Oh yea you clearly did this to make a profit"".

This is so dumb. I truly do not understand what all the fuzz is about. I can't even understand why the teacher is so freaking mad. What the hell's up with it? I understand he could be somewhat annoyed at me, and I would apologize for that. Not to this point tho. I'm more infuriated than anything right now.

This messed up my relationship with everyone involved, I really don't see myself sitting or talking comfortably to any of these people ever again. The teacher is just... I don't even know. The first time I called him to come clean I remember he said ""Do you think I deserve this?"". DESERVE WHAT? Just move the fuck on mate. You were not hurt, your career was not hurt, nothing happened, move on. I ended up calling him again after meeting with the IT lab to apologize and he just went ""Ok, cya"" and hang up on me. Seriously man go take a hike. You won't hear from me again. Had an exam with him this Saturday as well, going to miss it because I sure as hell am not going to pass that. I was absolutely fully willing to apologize and admit I was in the wrong up to that point. I'm just angry af now.

The person who received the email and was fully convinced she was being converted into Scientology can't be blamed. She's the one making this whole thing freaking hilarious and I still can't help but laugh whenever I think of her. The other person can go take a hike as well. She spent the whole day yesterday convincing me not to bring her name up when I went to talk to the teacher today (ended up not finding him) because she didn't want to ""get into war with a teacher"". And I obviously wasn't going to switch any blame to her, but she didn't even want me to tell the truth: that she was messaging the other girl and playing along, because otherwise the teacher would, rightfully, ask ""Then why did you play along instead of coming clean with her?"". So she called the teacher behind my back to tell whatever story, when were supposed to go together. Fuck you too.

I'm still mad as hell about all of this. What do you guys think?",18Jul2019,1

488,"I'm using an obvious throwaway however if you know me personally most people who read this would probably know whats up. Anyway lets jump into it....  
So recently I had to withdraw from my University (I was in a graduate program, direct-entry from HS skipping my bachelors and a fast tracked doctorate degree). Recently I was facing a potential dismissal from the college due to a silly situation (I know i'm in the wrong, have owned up to it and accept it). When I learned the new about a potential dismissal I was admitted to a local hospital, on their in-patient psychiatric floor for my mental health. I knew having a dismissal from the college or a suspension on my transcript would damn me in the future if a college or HR department requested my transcript; they would see either a dismissal from a college or suspension and throw it out the window as I would be a liability; so I decided it was extremely important for me to obtain legal advice.

  
After much talk with a lawyer who managed to bargain with my University stating if i plan on withdrawing for my mental health that the college would drop the hearing and not proceed forward. I was elated however now i am tens/hundreds of thousands in debt with the equivalent of a HS education and with the summer coming to a quick end I need to act fast to get into another college/program similar to mine. I have been making some recent phone calls around to different admissions offices and one question I have run into is whether or not I was asked to leave, (which according to my transcript is not the case as I personally withdrew). However many questions I have received from other programs is ""are you able to go back to your college if you would like"" which I am able to attend my University i've been at however I am not able to attend the specific program any longer. I do not know how to proceed when asked this question as I would rather not lie and them uncover information and then barr me from entering the program because I lied but also I would rather not like them to use information of my past college as my attorney and I talked and she stated moving forward this is your new life, so I guess I'm at a crossroads internally on how to proceed. I'm having a hard time deciding if moving back into my program would be the best or if I should try and proceed with a different profession. I'm not even sure if i'm formulating this in a good manner right now but any non-discriminative information moving forward would be fantastic and much appreciated.

497,"Hey everyone! 

I work at a small college in the south. Recently EVERYONE has been quitting! Literally people are dropping like flies every week! It’s actually kind of scary! I work in a small department with 2 other people. On Monday of last week, my direct supervisor quit (put in her 2 weeks). Her last day is tomorrow. Many people at my school assumed I would become interim even though I have only been there 10 months. 1. I’m damn good at my job, 2. The other person in my office just wouldn’t be right for the position, even she thought I would be come interim and was shocked that I wasn’t chosen. 

Instead the school decided to bring back a woman who was in the position.... 20 years ago! They are pulling her out of retirement for the 2nd time! She has decided to come back part time, but doesn’t know how to do anything my current supervisor does. My current supervisor has been training myself and my other co-worker on her responsibilities, and I know upper management will except us to pick up her slack, but I don’t want to! 

Am I a little bitter I wasn’t chose an interim, yea... but the fact they are bringing someone in who doesn’t know how to do anything we don’t already do is pointless to me! And we already get paid crap and have a lot to do in our own positions. I am currently looking for a new job, but I don’t plan to take on anymore than I already do. This place will run you into the ground and continue to pile work on top of you for no extra compensation if you let them, and I’m don’t plan on letting that happen.

I feel unwanted and it's pushed me in to distancing myself from him and my friends and I don't want to ruin anything anymore than I probably have. It caused a big fight earlier this morning because I was reflecting my own insecurities on him.

No matter what I do I don't feel comfortable in my own skin, I avoid looking in the mirrors and I spend a lot of time sulking on the couch instead of doing anything to fix it.

504,"My sister- MS henceforth(37F) is barley an adult, she doesn’t have a drivers license, no bank account, she’s been a server/bartender for all of her life. Up until February of this year she has depended on our older sister -OS henceforth(48F) for rides for herself and her 9 y/o daughter, assistance paying bills (she’d give cash, OS would pay the bill), bailing her out of situations, etc. 
OS lives across the street from MS and is a narcissist and very controlling so she didn’t mind the dependence that MS had on her.  In February things took a turn and MS and I (31F) removed OS from our lives.
Since then my cousin and I have been trying to get MS back on her feet. I have helped in any way I can, I took MS to get her temporary drivers license, I pay for her phone bill now, her car insurance, I’ve helped financially in numerous ways, etc. 
At one point OS called the police and removed anything she had receipts for from MS house (even if MS paid her cash, if OS has receipts she took it) furniture, appliances, you name it she took it. When this happened I told MS she needed to get out of there immediately or OS would keep doing things like this.
MS was actively improving her life, applying at various jobs to get a better/stable income, practicing driving, etc. I wanted to get her away from OS and at one point offered to pay her deposit and first months rent so she was no longer living across the street from OS.
Sometime along the way the plans change and MS was going to move into my house to save money so eventually she could purchase a house instead of wasting money renting.
MS daughter stopped staying with MS around the time we were getting ready to move her into my house because she didn’t feel like MS current house or my house was home (Daughter has anxiety and issues with MS drinking but that’s a different story). I tried explaining to MS that it was the situation that didn’t make anywhere feel like home and not the location but didn’t have any luck.
MS has since found a house to rent that I believe is out of her price range. She can’t even afford $140 for her phone and car insurance let alone $725 for rent. I believe MS is expecting me to pay her deposit and firsts months rent in order for her to move but I no longer think it is a good idea. Especially since MS has seemingly stopped trying to find better employment and spends her money frivolously from what I can tell. If the situation arises and she asks me for the deposit and first months rent how do I tell her that I don’t want to help her. I believe it would be pointless as she wouldn’t have the ability to pay future rent and would be evicted because I refuse to bail her out every month.

TL;DR Sister is probably expecting me to help her with deposit and first months rent for her house and I don’t think it’s a good idea because I don’t think she can afford it. How do I say no?",18Jul2019,1

I’m really worried because I know she has suicidal thoughts and I’ve been trying to get her to ask for help but her mom doesn’t believe and she doesn’t trust anyone else. We also kind of use the word “yeet” as a code word for- I hope it’s obvious what it’s for because I get really iffy having to talk about it. She has also been more rude to me lately. One example would be I was ranting to her about some reposter on reddit that snatched my post, and she said through text “I don’t really umm... what’s the word. Care.” That had me pretty pissed for a while. I might’ve been acting dramatic, I don’t know.

After all those things she sent me, my an- she just texted me saying oop I’m back. She just said “I unblocked you because you’re the only person I talk to :).” She is literally my only friend and I care about her, so I can’t lose her.

They said it was about 5 years old and probably needed to be cleaned up a bit but they said it was a good gaming computer and I was welcome to have it. I talked to customer service at Walmart and they said it shouldn't be a problem returning the laptop I just bought as long as I did it in the next couple weeks.

510,"For most of my life (I'm 19M) I've suffered from mild to severe social anxiety and depression and it is heavily affecting the way I maintain relationships. I've been out of therapy for a year and stopped going because I wanted to move to a private practice as I felt I wasn't getting anywhere with Headspace, a youth access and treatment clinic for mild to moderate disorders and issues (mine are too severe, I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for years now and I also have OCD, potentially PTSD as I was raised in an abusive household). I'm in the process of trying to re-enter treatment but the earliest appointment I could get with a psychiatrist is late September, before someone tells me to just get treatment, I'm already on it. I recently seperated from my partner of almost 2 years who was my first SO, who told me that she no longer felt any love for me as I had emotionally drained her due to my poor mental health and depression, and she fell out of love months before she broke up with me, the final straw was that I attempted suicide and she couldn't deal with it which I understand. What really hurt me was that she had been telling me she loved me when I now know she didn't, and encouraged me to make plans involving the two of us for the future, which has led to me being hung up about the already over relationship. This was a major hit to my confidence and deeply affected my already rampant trust issues and my insecurities about friendships. I'm at the point where I know it's reckless to end all my friendships because I know I'll regret it one day soon, but everything I hear that doesn't involve me is emotionally devastating. Twice this week my ex (who is still one of my closest friends) has been hanging out with my closest friend and multiple times the past few weeks and I've not been invited. I can't ask my ex not to tell me about it because she gets upset that I'm not letting her talk about what excites her as friends, but I feel cut every time to the point I want to kill myself. Should I tough it out or just rip off the bandaids.

514,"Ok so this is currently ongoing and I need advice on how to effectively deal with all of it.  I'm changing some details around to protect the innocent and guilty.

A month ago, the neighbors wife J comes over and asks to sit down and have a serious conversation.  I didn't know wtf was going on, probably because I'm a man but nothing clicked.  She starts pouring her heart out to me about how she realized a year ago that she loved me.  

Now I've known her for 3 years.  Her Husband A and I are friends and hang out quite a bit.  They have 3 kids and we play DnD and other tabletop games together.  So yes I've hung out with J a few times but never without A being present.  So it's already weird enough to have her suddenly show up and basically offer herself.

So I'm shocked.  I awkwardly thank J for being honest with me and I try to gently remind her I'm in a relationship, over a decade in, J has 3 kids already with a great guy, never gonna happen.  As I'm telling her all of this, I see the illusion that she had built in her mind, of what we had together, slowly unravel.  She then starts talking about suicide.  Holy fuck I was looking to see if she had a weapon or something.  I get really uncomfortable and show her out finishing with 'if we were in a relationship like you want J, you would want me to remain loyal so you understand why it has to be no'  She leaves and I contact her husband A to let him know.  I owed him that much because he's a great guy with 3 kids.  I would want to know.  

Needless to say the marriage blew up.  They are now getting divorced.  I feel like absolute shit because I'm stuck in the middle of it.  I've tried to stay away from her as much as possible but being neighbors means we see each other a few times a week and obviously my relationship with A is stressed but we still hang out and try to act like the mess isn't there.  Salvaging our friendship as best we can though I'm realizing it might be better to cut off contact altogether.  

I've been there for him ever since whenever he needed support because we're still friends.  He appreciated me coming to him right away.

Now to the reason why I'm posting this.  Last time I was hanging out with A and the kids, 5 days ago, the youngest decided to use a pool floater ring as a weapon because she couldn't get what she wanted.  What she wanted was a different colored floater ring, the one her older sister had.  Older Sister wasn't super happy but being a good sport she said she was willing to trade.  That prompted an attack which missed.  That made the youngest even more frustrated and she started swinging multiple times.  A and me stepped in and explained she shouldn't do that because she could hurt someone and that being angry or jealous wasn't a reason to attack someone.  Unfortunately though J decided this was not enough and started bending over backwards trying to please the youngest by offering whatever she wanted.  This didn't help anything though and just made the child throw an even bigger tantrum, swinging at adults with the object with intent to harm because she aimed for skin and avoided clothing.  It's not a great weapon but it can still hurt if you get hit in the face.  

The night ended pretty quick after that.  For J though it wasn't over, and so she decided to come over while I was in my yard. 
 She brought over a book and explained that the anger and jealousy of her youngest were justified and that since it was targeted towards Dan, he's a bad parent apparently, it was ok.  I answered that no it wasn't ok.  She then said 'well listen it was justified, imagine because stabbed by a knife' I said what the fuck are you talking about?  Asking her why we went from her child throwing a tantrum and swinging a pool toy around, to her saying it's justified because of A and his parenting, to talking about imagining getting stabbed and murder.  She changed the subject and then walked away when I questioned her some more.  

I called A and he explained that she frequently goes from 0-100 at home.  That it's a cultural thing.  She's Russian and I don't know anything about that being a cultural thing in Russia.  I explained that I felt threatened and she had now talked about killing herself and others by stabbing.  He said he would talk to her tonight when he got home from work.  

So what should I do here?",18Jul2019,1
515,"The brief back story is that my husband and I have been unsuccesfully trying to conceive for 2+ years. We have tried many strategies, including one round of IVF, and have failed. We have one more viable embryo to try in the upcoming months. We are in our early 30s and are fit, nonsmoking, and otherwise healthy people. Sometimes IVF just fails due to bad luck, which is what our doctor thinks. IVF is physically, emotionally, and financially exhausting.

When you are doing IVF, you go in for lots of ultrasounds. A few months back, my doctor noticed that there was a small clump of cells in my uterus and didn't think it would impact our IVF success. After it failed, this topic has come up again. They had another look at it and still don't think the clump of cells are a big deal. They barely count as a benign polyp. The doctor said she had no medical reason to believe they would impact our chance of success. 

There is a procedure I can undergo to get the clump of cells in my uterus removed. Our doctor said she has no strong opinion about whether to do it or not. HOWEVER, she also said that if it were her, she would probably just do it. The procedure has many downsides, but it's unclear what the upsides are. Downsides include cost (probably around $2,000), going under anesthesia, having to take a day off work, and risk of something going wrong during the procedure that creates a bigger problem than the one i have (which isn't really a problem). Upsides include a clear conscience before we try our second round.

I was leaning against it, but both my husband and doctor were thinking that we might as well just try it so we don't have any regrets. Except there's also no real reason to believe it impacts my chances of pregnancy, so there could be no actual gain from doing this expensive procedure.

I was unfortunately caught going 65mph in a 40mph zone. (In reality I was going 70 but the cop was nice enough to put 65) I sometimes speed if I am running late. But I wasn't in any rush that day. (Before the cop pulled me over) I was at the front of the current stoplight, so when I started driving I had no one to set the pace. *I recently got a new vechile as well. I used to drive a Honda hybrid insight, which you literally have to slam the pedal to drive at the same speed everyone else is. The car new car I am currently driving is a saab 93 with 2.0 turbo. So I am not accustom to the speed my new vechile has. I also had to many things on my mind and wasnt paying attention at my speed as I thought it didnt matter, I am barely touching the pedal. (In my older car I used to slow down or keep the pace when I did that) Then I saw the cop and looked at my speedometer thinking I am probably going like 5 or 10 over. But I then I saw I was going 30 over, my heart sank and I just pulled over before she even put on her light (but she did drive out to me before I did that) 

I have a perfect driving record and I have been driving for only 3 years.

517,"Hi, so i have a dilemma that is honestly pretty small in the grand scheme of things but i'd still like some help with.

So, I (19m) smoke weed. Not a ton, but here and there, when someone around me offers. I live in a different city than my parents and for the most part I've smoked in my college town, although occasionally I've been high around my parents. Up until recently, it was either a secret or just something they were suspicious about. I'm the more party oriented of me and my brother (same age) so I figured even before I started smoking that they'd be suspicious.

Recently I got home high after driving (stupid, i know, but i feel like every stoner I've ever met is more than happy to drive high. Hell, there's songs about cruising around high), my dad offered me a beer and like the idiot I am, I accepted and sat down with him outside. Lo and behold, I'm passing out in my chair every 5 seconds, and he calls me on it. Commence 30 minute lecture about ""You can't do shit like this"" ""You could go to prison"" (weed's medical here, but basically recreational) etc. However, he was drunk so I'm really unsure whether he was mad about just the driving or the driving and the weed. I don't think he told my mom (divorced, still on friendly terms though), which may have saved my life. My mom has had some friends and family get addicted to things much worse than weed (namely K2) and as far as i'm aware, thinks that weed is the devils gateway drug. I'm pretty safe about my smoking, doing it primarily with my buddies who all get medical grade stuff, but I don't know that she'll care about that.

It just sucks feeling under watch in my childhood home, so i'm trying not to do it in that city anymore, and instead keep it to my college town. What can I do to keep this situation under control and continue smoking without upsetting my parents? So far, my strategy is to make sure I won't drive, try to not be around my parents, and overall just keep it to my college town. There may be situations where I think it's alright to get high in the city, assuming i wont drive and wont see my parents at least till i'm sober again.",18Jul2019,2
518,"Two weeks ago was my birthday and this friend said that we should go out for my birthday, which ended up being me taking pictures for her, and we went shopping for her, and she wanted to drop me off at our college building (which had no one there) before I made her stay until my Lyft came to which she said she'll take me home (which was 10 minutes away from her) if it feels dangerous in the lyft (I was in an essentially deserted college campus at midnight). This got me in a lot of trouble with the folks at home. Whenever we're talking too it's always drama and gossip and ""did you see what so and so did? he's so disgusting, isn't he supposed to be religious but blahblahblah"" and I can only take so much backbiting, and gossiping, it just drains me and makes me feel sick after talking too much. I think she's more interested in telling me her stories than me as a person. I'll talk about something personal, or even what happened in my day she'll nod, then go ""im jumping topics but"" and talk about something different! I was talking about how I was struggling to connect to one of my most cherished friends because of this issues, and she just goes oh I think she's jealous of you and then changes the topic to talk about her coworkers! The ONLY time she listens to me is when I talk about our stupid project thing we were a part of, and when I talk about how some of the people in it are upsetting me bc of the way they're treating me and that's the ONLY time she listens.

519,"I have a best friend who I’ve known for about 4 years now. But since 2 months he is into a relationship with my Triplet sister, and I honestly don’t know how to feel about it. 

Before they got into a relationship my friend used to be around the house at least once a week, not only because me and him were so close, but also because he has a great bond with my parents. 

Since a few weeks he also works with me on a parttime job, but because of the holidays it is more of a full time job then a part time job, anyways. This concludes in seeing him almost 24/7. Mostly at work, but since he sleeps at my place as well, there is no avoiding him because we’re also carpooling to work everyday.

I am not a fan of having my friends over at my place for almost 7 days a week, because I live my own life and I don’t need my friends to be there with me all the time. So it really starts to annoy me because A, he is there all the time and B, he has a relationship with my sister who I see up close with him all the time.

And since it is my “little sister”, although we’re the same age, it’s still not okay to see your best friend with your sister...

I have tried to talk about this with my sister, but all she can say is, that I don’t need to whine about it. 
And I ,indeed, can stop whining about it, but every time someone asks me about it, it’s about how shit they would feel in the same situation. And that really makes it worse for me, because I do feel that way, but don’t want to break their luck together.

So my question is, has anyone been in the same situation that knows how to deal with this?

TL;DR: Best Friend has a relationship with my Triplet Sister that I feel awkward about and I can’t seem to avoid it or address it with them.",18Jul2019,1
520,"**TL;DR at bottom**

There's this guy, I'll call him T, who just will not fucking stop trying shit with me. For the record, I'm not into men whatsoever. I've known T since we were kids. He came out of the closet when he was a teenager and nobody gave a shit. We pretty much already knew so it wasn't a big shock to anyone. 

We live in a town with around 7,000 people, so we would see each other quite often, especially at the bar and parties. About 12 years ago is when it all started, I was at a party and T was there. He started coming on to me telling me how attractive he thought I was and whatnot but I politely told him I wasn't interested. It didn't bother me, figured whatever can't blame the guy for trying.

Ever since then, every single fucking time I see this guy out, he would say stuff to me like ""hey sexy"" ""fuck you're gorgeous"" ""my god you're beautiful"". At first I ignored him but eventually I started telling him to quit saying stuff like that. But he persisted. He would message me on Facebook or text when he was drunk asking if I was out or where I was or just make inappropriate comments. He just kept getting worse and worse. He started cornering me at parties asking me to go in rooms with him, asking me to kiss him, asking me to let him suck my cock. Just completely out of line. I've told him numerous times now to leave me the fuck alone. Told him if he comes near me again I would punch him in the face. He would always back up and say he was joking just to see what I would say but clearly he wasn't joking.

The last straw happened a couple weekends ago. I was at a friends place playing poker and having some drinks when the night got late and some of our friends came over from the bar. Low and behold, there's T. I haven't seen him and had him blocked on Facebook and text for quite awhile now so I figured it wasn't a big deal. He kept his distance all night which was what I wanted. As the party went on, I got tired and wanted to go to bed. I went into the spare bedroom to pass out. While in the middle of falling asleep, I started feeling a hand squeezing the inside of my leg near my crotch. I instinctively started pushing it away but I was still half asleep. Then I hear T's voice. ""just let me"" ""just let me suck your cock"" ""hurry up"". When I finally fully woke up, I told him to fuck off and get fuck out of the room before I knock him the fuck out. He left right away. Luckily I still had all my clothes on. I so badly wanted to go and kick the shit out of him but I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. I just locked the door and went to bed.

The next day, I went to the police. I told them exactly what happened and they blatantly told me there wasn't anything they could do. So now I'm just left with this violated feeling and nothing I can do about it.

I should also mention that T has done this to many other straight men. Off the top of my head I can think of 4 people he's tried to touch in their sleep and countless others that he messages inappropriately.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I'm straight and a gay man has been inappropriately harassing me for years even though I tell him to leave me alone. While I was passed out, he started touching me and the police said there was nothing they could do about it.",18Jul2019,1
522,"I am 17 and they believe that I'm super smart (which tbh I'm not... I'm much smarter than most at my age that you see nowadays in the public eye cause they don't care about education) and ask me for any help with a lot of tech issues... But that's the only thing they believe I know..

They are super country, racist, self-centered, and closed-minded (and also never watch anything other than fox news)

If there is any change to their believes they absolute despise of it. 

I just tried explaining to my grandmother that global warming is why the US has seen the hottest June in a long time and she didn't believe me saying that ""global warming cannot just make the earth in ten years blow up"" which is true but she takes everything she hears and makes it her own way. 

Same with the discussion of the legalization of marijuana. Saying the basic beliefs of ""it kills brain cells, it makes people want to hurt others"" and other beliefs and says it's only for black and Hispanic people.

Also, I popped my knuckles the other day and told me I was going to get arthritis (which may be true with how much I use the PC in my daily life, not due to popping knuckles)
And I gave her a bunch of articles and research showing it was never linked to arthritis. 



This one may sound weird and kinda gross but hear me out on this she yells at me EVERY SINGLE DAY I don't take a shower to take one. Because oily hair kills ""this and that and that and this"" and is very very bad for you. I take a shower every 2 days due to the research that showering every day is bad for your body due to natural oils and a whole bunch of stuff. Plus I've had my hair severely damaged for showering everyday for a long period of time. (Ik sounds weird) (I also shower every day only when I know i gotta go to school or work or an important event)

I gave her all these studies saying that it's bad to shower everyday and oily hair has benefits (and also helps the earth with water consumption)

524,"Hey there, this just happened to me like 15 minutes ago and wanted to hear some advice on how others would handle this.

Im currently staying at a hotel (which I will not name) and wanted to check some of my bags to go out on the town once I checked out of my room. So I go down to the luggage check, and it is $3. Okay, no big deal, but I dont have any cash on me. So I hit the ATM to get some cash. At this ATM (like most I have used), the lowest amount you can pull out is $20. I grab the $20 bill and head back to the luggage check. 

I give him the money, he hands me back my change (so I thought) and I go on my way. As I am putting the money in my wallet I notice he only gave me $7, not $17. Again, not a big deal, he probably forgot to give me a $10. I go back and ask if he forgot to give me some change and he says no and claims that I gave him a $10 bill, not  $20.

This is obviously impossible because I just pulled out the lowest amount I could, which was $20. I explain this to him, and that I literally could have only gave him $20, it wasn't possible any other way, and that he must have made a mistake. He denies it and insists that I gave him 10, but that he would count it at the end of the day and ""make sure he was right."" 

He seemed like a nice dude, we had friendly conversation before this happened and during it even, there was no hostility on either side. I just wanted my money. 

In my opinion, it feels very obvious he stole this and tried to play it off like I gave him a 10. He tried to say the ATM messes up sometimes, but cmon man. I ended up just saying okay because he wasnt going to budge, and walked away. Its not a lot of money so I dont care that much, but what would you have done differently?",18Jul2019,2

I said yes and immediately regretted it. All day at work before the date I was trying to come up with an excuse to get out of it.

On Sunday, a woman who has been in my life 23 years, who took me in and pretty much raised me, I watched her die. I live in Canada, and she has been fighting cancer for the last 10+ years now, and on Sunday, she is finally at rest thanks to the M.A.I.D. service (Medical Assistance In Dying). I signed the papers, and was with the handful of family members there to be with her as she was put to sleep, then after she was unconscious, they stopped her heart. I'm sure to more it than that, but that is just from what I saw.

But, my problem is this, that happened Sunday at 10:38am, but I can not get that image out of my head. All I can see is her body there, seeing her breathing, and then it stops, and then seeing the life is pretty much pulled out of her as her skin changes colour, and her body lays there lifeless. 

Does that ever go away? Currently I'm better then I was the last few days, and I actually made it to work today so a complete win there for me. But, I can't focus, feel numb as hell, even tried to spend some time with my wife and just couldn't even bring myself to that. All because of this image that just won't go away. 

And it only seems to happen when I'm not focused on something, just a slight moment of distraction, and it's back. I have helped at a funeral home, I have seen bodies like that, but never lost anyone close to me ever, and never seen someone alive and moving and talking one moment, then gone the next.

I’ve been friends with her since we were 8yrs old. She moved away for college but it’s only five hours away, she was in a long term relationship all through high school and they broke up (thankfully) last year. The town she is in is really high maintenance and we come from a kinda hippie dippie town so she’s changed a lot. I’m really concerned because she’s lost so much weight and constantly is saying she’s fat, she told me she almost passed out while working out the other day (she’s not eating enough to even work out). Her hair is falling out/thinning and she says she’s going bald and wants to shave her head, the new friends she has are really toxic and don’t care for her as much as she cares for them. And the job she has is draining her. She’s been there for at least two years now and is graduated with her bachelors but wants to stay longer. 
I’ve tried telling her ways to keep her hair healthy like actually eating, but I think she is pulling it out without realizing. She’s left handed and is constantly touching the left side of her hair which is the “bald” side. She’s even restored to wearing a head band to cover “her bald spot”. Her mom and I are very close and we talk about what’s happening to her and we’re trying to get her to move back home because she is not okay at all. Her mom said she was actually screaming at her about how she’s bald and fat and ugly and how nothing is working. I don’t know what to do she is so thin and unhealthy how can I bring up that I’m scared? I’m worried if I try to tell her she’ll stop telling me things because she doesn’t want me stressing about her. I love her very much and we FaceTime almost every morning to keep her in good spirits.

When husband and I first started dating she literally laughed in my face when I told her I wanted to be friends. When my husband and I started living together she sent him an email with a sermon about how it was wrong for us to be living together and having sex before marriage. Note...she was pregnant at the time with the baby of a man twice her age and no, they were not married. When she had her baby I brought her one of my hand crocheted blankets from when I was a baby and she refused to let me see her son at all.  Recently she has made some attempt to be friendly with me, but has never apologized for anything.

Now she is coming to visit us, toddler in tow. Let me just say, I do not like kids to begin with. And she is not an authoritative figure with her son. He throws fits constantly, never does what he is told, and she is fiercely defensive of his behavior. On top of that, my home is in no way child friendly.

545,"Two years ago, I saw something that I’d never forget. I was at this hotel’s restaurant, when I saw/heard this baby crying. The baby was reaching out for food, sobbing, clearly hungry. The father, whenever his baby reached out for the food, would slap the baby’s arm away violently and yell at him whenever he reached out. No one sitting with them would do anything about it, they wouldn’t even care. I remember losing my appetite, I told my parents, and I had cried for some reason. I don’t even know. It’s such a stupid reason to cry. Hell, even writing this, I feel like crying but I feel like an attention seeker for it. A year later, I heard a baby crying in a cafe. At first I was just annoyed. After a few seconds, my memory was triggered, and I started shaking. I tried to ignore it, but I was shaking and eventually I tore up. I left that place and I couldn’t go there again. Whenever I hear a baby crying, it triggers the memory and the same thing happens. I can’t ignore it, I can’t make it go. Whenever it happens, I can’t go back to the place it happened without feeling like it will happen again. I don’t know what this is. I don’t know if I should see a doctor or anything. I am 15.

549,"Hello Reddit. 
I need advice on how to get my act together. 

I’m going to list the root causes of my behaviour/thoughts and the resulting issues and where I am at now. 

Parents separated before I was born. Didn’t get to start knowing my father until around 5 or 6 yrs old. 

Apparently a trip around Europe was more important. I’m beginning to suspect he was in jail or something else, given his ridiculous temper and inability to do anything fucking useful for anybody but himself.

So. Mum was already a widow before she met him. Her husband passed away sadly of cancer and left her with two sons. She was broken before I ever got to know her as a whole person.

And then I arrive. 

We lived in the poorest area of a horrible town. Community housing. I would get beaten up by the neighbourhood kids occasionally. My older brothers hung out with local gang kids and one time their friend decapitated a blue tongued lizard with an axe inches from my face as I looked at it in awe. Everywhere I looked, life wanted to brutalise me. 

I was knocked unconscious and sexually abused at one point but can’t remember it thank goodness. I know it happened though. I still remember waking up in the bushes and dirt near where I would go walkabout, wondering what this unfamiliar taste of dick in my mouth was. Sometimes I get confused and wonder if that memory is a dream. 

Anyway. Mother was drugged out on something most the time. Unavailable and angry all the time. Most of my earliest memories are of her smoking cigarettes and yelling. Or drinking and yelling. There are good memories of the beautiful and nurturing woman she is at heart but she had her own demons that took hold for most of my childhood. 

She wouldn’t pick me up from school. I’d just wait. Principal drove me home after getting sick of it. At this stage my father was somehow able to swoop into my life and move me into a nice suburb in a nice house before I could be moved into foster care. It all would’ve been dandy but he was a badly alcoholic coke fiend who would do everything but physically harm me. His abuse was a more insidious form of mental treachery. His mood would flip like day and night and it made me scared of him. It made me scared to be a kid and make mistakes or to be curious. ‘STUPID BOY’... would be uttered with such contempt. 

I would wet the bed most nights. I would cry and lock up from anxiety if I was left alone. Especially at night. I was so horribly afraid of the dark that I basically just didn’t sleep and laid there in fear all night. Fear of something that was obviously repressed.

Despite all of this I was somehow a seemingly happy and charismatic kid a lot of the time. I had some good friends in my old town that I missed. I also missed my brothers and my mum. So weekend visits were arranged. 

Eventually however, mum’s issues came back. I would sit in my driveway until it grew dark, on the days that she was supposed to pick me up for weekend visits. She never came. I would ring the home phone repeatedly for hours with no answer. I just wanted to know if my fucked up family was okay. I wanted to know why I wasn’t worth coming to pick up. I’m starting to tear up as I write this now. Dad could have taken me, but he was too cheap to afford petrol - and part of him I think wanted me to dislike my home. He wanted me to love him in spite of my mother and brothers. 

Sigh. I was about 7 years old by this stage. I wasn’t able to relate to any of the kids my own age. And so my isolation began. 

The only luck I had was that I was a fast and athletic young boy. This made me slightly popular whenever there was a chance to demonstrate my abilities. Unfortunately I totally lacked the social skills to deal with the attention I got and I became more of a weird novelty to the kids around me with my weird personality. I was so eager to not be sad, that I would try to make all the kids around me laugh all the time. 

But inside I was fucking hollow. 

Due to these factors; manipulation, physical emotional and sexual abuse, abandonment, I developed some horribly self destructive habits and extremely low self worth. 

When I was around 10 years old, my second oldest brother was put into a psych ward. Drug induced paranoid schizophrenia. So, whilst dealing with my own issues, now it was weekly visits to the psych ward to talk to my fucking delusional brother whom I loved dearly. 

On top of this my mother developed a serious gambling habit. I starved a lot during those days. I was between my father and mother’s house a lot. Weirdly I always wanted to be around my mum and brothers and actively despised having to live with my father. So even though I was starving and had an absent mother, I felt like I’d rather be there than dealing with an alcoholic dad who tries to have adult discussions with me when he’s always wasted. 

At least there I had my other brother to commiserate with. We were in the shite together. My brothers were the saving grace of my life. They raised me. Took care of me when my parents weren’t able. We starved together. 

Being locked in a car on a hot day for a few hours while your mother sits in the pokies isn’t great. And as I write this, knowing I was born quite prematurely? It is dawning on me whether or not she’d constantly been trying to let me die. I’m wondering if I have fought harder to be alive than I originally assumed. 

Anyway... There is plenty more. Gosh. To boil down the rest - I faced the prospect of both my parents being thrown in jail when I was 14. By then I’d seen a man try to kill my father in the kitchen and learned that I have a weird blend of fight and flight mode. 

I had learned more about myself by the age of 15 than many do in a lifetime. 

All of this has resulted in horribly low self worth. An incredibly anxious and neurotic mind, and a habit for smoking copious amounts of weed. 

Right now I’m in day 5 of cold turkey no smoking weed or cigarettes. And to be honest I need some help. I need to hear from someone who has been in my shoes that it can get better. I went off my mood stabilisers around a month or so ago, after 4 or 5 years of not achieving anything better than when I wasn’t taking them. 

I’ve been rather irritable lately, having some shitty nonsensical and erratic thoughts too. Being quick to anger and shouting at my family when they’re just trying to be nice and respectful in addressing me. 

I’m 28 now. My mother has improved herself drastically but is still a bit shite at times. Brothers still live with her and their lives are just so dull and sad. They still live in community housing. I rent out a little room behind my dad and his partner’s place. He’s mellowed out in his age. I have the best relationship I can muster with my family members. 

I know my thoughts are all over the place. Someone mentioned that to me recently too. 

I can’t motivate my self to want to achieve anything. I’m feeling very weak and incapable. Even though I’m trying to detox I just can’t help but feel as soon as I get home I’ll smoke a joint and fuck up all this hard work. 

I long for death to release me from my mental torture. I would never take my own life as I firmly believe that life is precious and we are here to learn what we can. 

So... If anyone has a similar story and managed to overcome it. Please talk to me.",18Jul2019,1

I need an advice from as many people as possible.

As a web developer I'm looking for some passive source of income. I would like to create a page/web application that I could upgrading in my free time, but also that I can leave for some time and it would just ""be there"" and working, earning some little amounts of cash on ads or maybe users donations.

Maybe it's not so bad idea, however I wouldn't go for it as my first choice.

554,"So in my freshman year in college, I found myself a pretty good friend group. We are all English majors and enjoy writing/reading and have a lot of the same interests. However, I’m the only one (in a group of 8) that is not in our school’s Honors College. Many people, including them, have assured me that this doesn’t mean they’re smarter than me or harder working than me, and I’ve accepted that. 

However, Honors College people all have some required courses to take that are just for them, so they all have classes together without me.  And sometimes when we hang out, everyone talks about their classes and I feel completely left out. 

In addition, I found out that next year, they’re all living in the Honors College dorm building together. I can’t live there since I’m not in Honors College and I already feel left out enough. Now that they’ll all live together, it’s even more likely they’ll end up hanging out without me just because they’re all living together and just happen to run into each other and how can I blame them for that?? 

I have spoken to a couple of them about it and one in particular was rather rude to me and said I have no right to make them feel bad for being happy that they can live together but I feel like if they had an ounce of empathy, they’d realize that 7 people of an 8 person group living together is rather unfair.

I work for a small company and this year our staff did not receive any raises, bonuses OR cost of living increases. 

2018 year was the highest gross sales our company has ever had, but the owner claims he doesnt have *any* money to give us because of operations expenses and debt.  He even went so far as to give us multiple numbers that literally did not add up when I audited records and when confronted he claimed Its a ""misunderstanding"" 

I wont get into too many details but there is a highly customized vehicle that was purchased under the company, multiple vacations aka ""buisness trips"" etc.  all standard fair. 

With that said here is where my current problem lies, our boss (the owner) made it very clear that if we produced a few certain items he would split the profits with the staff because they ""didn't hold value"" in his eyes.  These products were meant to be a replacement for our bonuses going forward. 

The first two sales we had back in May were paid out no problem, and one of our staff members quit their full time position shortly after, but kind of stayed on to do marketing on the side for a couple hundred dollars a month. 

Upon the coworker leaving my boss, coworker &amp; myself had a laugh that my coworker would no longer be getting any cuts of these future sales. 

As of today, two more of these sales came in worth a decent amount of money. About %18 of my monthly pay.  When I asked my boss about receiving a check I was told this was a ""one time offer"" followed by it being a ""complete misunderstanding""

569," Is there a polite way to get a new neighbor to purchase window coverings? I live in a townhouse that had gorgeous views. Sadly, a developer came in and built a townhouse directly in front of ours so we lost our views. The townhouses have only an alleyway between them for garage access.

There are six townhouses in our building so technically he's not going to know for sure that it's from me. I have the closest view since I'm directly across from him but I imagine that everyone else in my building has a pretty good view of him also. I don't know anyone in my building though. What to do? It's extremely hard to just ignore it.   \*\*\*Based on responses in another group, I'm not going to replace my shutters with gauzy drapes.  My shutters were super expensive.  I bought them out of courtesy for my neighbors.  My question is there a way to approach him about this politely?  I don't want to make it more awkward than it already is.",18Jul2019,1
570,"My husband is active duty military. He’s been in for 6.5 years. Two years ago he had to switch MOS (military jobs) because his old MOS was at 200% capacity and nobody was getting promoted. 

He had to go to a four month school, then overseas for a year unaccompanied. 

We were told we’d get one of our top three choices when he came back, but instead they sent us to the capitol to do a job that only %2 of the people in his MOS does which was another month long school. 

Then when he finally started work here it was 7 months of 12 hour night shifts.  He slept during the day and left every night at 4pm.

Now he finally got a new commander (I don’t know if this is the proper term. Just think important person in charge) and he got angry that one of his guys was stuck on night shift like that and moved him to a day shift. He leaves every morning about 5am and doesn’t get back until 9pm

We have two boys aged 2 and 4. They wake up about 7 and go to sleep about 7:30. They do not nap and I cannot keep them up any longer than that.  He works 5 days a week and those days he doesn’t even see the kids. I take care of everything morning and night. My husband left when my younger boy was about 4 months old and didn’t come back until he was almost 2. He had no idea who he was when he came back. 

I can’t get child care because it is took expensive where I live and my profession calls for working weekends and evenings. Daycares around here are only mon-fri business hours. The job he does is a 24/7 and he can be scheduled to work literally any day of the week including traditional weekends. 

After 2.5 years of pretty much not having a husband I’m burnt out. I’m tired and he apathetic about the whole situation. He says he can’t complain to his higher ups about the long hours because that will ruin his career. 

When he’s home he does homework and is almost done with his BA. he works so hard and I’m grateful for him providing for our family. But I have put my chances of a career on hold for our family and devoted my life to helping him in HIS career. I’m 16 hours drive from my family.  I can’t go to work because of his schedule. He’s potentially going to another 6 months worth of schools in the next year. I’m so stuck.

Maybe this is a rant, but I’m so tired. I’m depressed. I love my husband and I know in the end we’ll only be here for 2-3 years. But I don’t know if I can do 2-3 more years of this. What can I do to help me through this? We’ve both sacrificed so much for our family and his career.",18Jul2019,1

576,"Sorry this is so long. TLDR at the bottom. 

Some back story for context - I have a friend I've known for about 6 years. He was with his high school sweetheart when we met. We got closer over the years and all of our friends became one big close group. After a couple years he expressed that he and his GF wanted to open up their relationship and they both thought I was cute and sort of had crushes on me. (shortly after they got engaged) I was up to trying it out and we all had sex a few times but I grew uneasy. I asked them what their boundaries were, like is it only ok if we do this with all three of us, or is it ok one on one? Any other things they needed from me. It got strange after that as neither one of them explained to me what their rules were or if they ever discussed it and then they pulled back a bit. They explained later that they thought I meant boundaries because I thought they were smothering me, but that isn't what I said. Their relationship also seemed a bit rocky after that because his now fiance was sleeping with other people and going out a lot without him. I pulled back because of the lack of communication and I didn't want to be involved if their relationship wasn't going well.

 I also was still dating other people and my relationship wasn't going well. They also only ever wanted to have sex, we never did anything else anymore. We ended up all becoming friends with the group of friends of the guy his fiance was sleeping with. He always said he was ok with it and frequently invited me over when she was out with them. He never went out by himself or tried to sleep with anyone other than me. I didn't like sleeping with him alone, we tried once and it freaked me out so much that I wanted to stop.

 I kept hanging with him because he seemed like he needed a friend. Probably a bad idea. I think I was worried about what would happen with our mutual friends which was stupid. Then they got married. I missed it because I was at a festival. At that point everyone knew we had a weird throuple thing. They tried to invite me up to tahoe for their honeymoon which I thought was a TERRIBLE idea so i didn't go. Meanwhile, she is still sleeping with the other guy and there was a weekend that she was away with him so her husband tagged along to SF to a show with me to get out of town. We ended up getting drunk and sleeping together, which I assumed would be fine since she was on a trip with her other guy. That weekend her guy said he wanted to stop seeing her because he didn't see it going anywhere since she was married. I'm not sure if she was upset about that, but all of a sudden she was upset I was spending time with him and didn't want me to be alone with him anymore and said that she didn't want to be open anymore. She said they needed space to mend their relationship. A couple weeks later I get a text from her saying they were splitting up and she couldn't forgive me for the part I played in it. When I asked what she meant she said that he was so sad that I had pulled away from them that he became depressed and neglecting her. I didn't see it as pulling away since she asked me to stop coming around and they needed to work on things together. I am not entirely sure what happened but later I found out he wanted to move into a house with her when their lease was ending, which was soon, but get roommates. He knew my living situation was rocky so he suggested I move in with them and I think that was the last straw for her. She ended up leaving. When she moved out he kept lamenting that he had never been alone before and made some weird attempts to try and be with me but I wasn't interested in being a rebound or a place filler so he wouldn't have to be alone. I was happy to be a shoulder to cry on but that was it.

This all happened in the span of about 6 months. A couple months after that he was moving into a house and looking for roommates and at that same time my living situation sort of imploded and my lease was up. I didn't have any roommates, I couldn't get accepted into an apartment on my income alone and I wasn't sure what to do. He offered me a room in the house he was renting and when we talked he assured me all feelings for me were be gone and it would be ok, there would't be any weirdness. At first I said yes but then I wasn't confident that that was the truth and tried to find someone else to live with. I found out later it hurt his feelings that I didn't want to move in. I couldn't find a new roommate and I was desperate and asked him if I could have the room he offered and he said he already found someone else to live there. I got lucky and my sis moved out of my parents so they let me stay with them. 

The guy had a house party a few weeks later and honestly a few of us took a lot of drugs, including him. I ended up talking in the corner with a childhood friend of his who was now living with him since they reconnected. We stuck together the whole night because we were both nervous, too high, and didn't know a lot of people there. His friend told me his best friend had died the week before and I think we were both just sad about stuff and ended up making out and cuddling in a tent. The next morning I was nervous the guy would be mad, but since we were never really together and he had assured me he didn't have any feelings anymore I didn't think it would be an issue. The three of us were outside smoking and then he left for work. The guy and I discussed how we would tell his friend we had hooked up but weren't sure how to word it. I was still there when he came back and he sat with us outside again. After we made small talk for a bit he ended up storming out. He came back a couple hours later and said it was obvious something had happened between us and when were we going to tell him? I felt like we didn't really have a lot of time to tell him since it had happened like 24 hours before. Was i supposed to text him about it the second I woke up or text him at work? Shit hit the fan after that. He wanted the guy to move out, said I wasn't welcome over anymore and that I had ""destroyed the magic"" of their house. He said he told his friend that he had feelings for me and that his friend shouldn't have fooled around with me and it wasn't ok for me to go after his friends. His friend said the guy had only told him that he and i had a history.  He hadn't seen this friend in years until they reconnected and moved in together, so I thought that was an odd comment, since they werent particularly close. 

I was honestly angry about it since I didn't think he had a right to be that angry about it, but I said I wouldn't come over anymore. The next day he ended up telling everyone we knew that I slept with his friend, even my ex boyfriend and my old roommates. I found out because a few people I hadn't talked to me in a while asked me why he told them that. After that I would come over at night when everyone was asleep and leave early to hang out with his friend. I justified it because he was being an asshole. I am not sure if that was super fucked up? Eventually things smoothed over. He said his actions were justified and essentially we were ""even"" now. I let it go. His friend and I dated for a few months but I broke up with him because we had taken acid together one time and I kept throwing up and I remember telling him I needed to lay down and woke up 5 hours later naked and he told me we had had sex and I couldn't remember anything and he didn't understand why that scared me. About a year after that my friend and I were talking about people sleeping with you when your blacked out and who responsibility it was and such and I told her about what happened with that dude when I took acid. The guy was there and he left the room. He kept being really snarky to me in the following weeks and said it was only because his feelings about me had changed and this was how he treated everyone. Eventually he admitted it is because I told the story about me having sex with his friend and I shouldn't ever speak about those things around him. I was upset that he missed the point of the story which was OBVIOUSLY not me bragging about having sex with someone, it was me pondering about sexual assault. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been three years since he moved into that house. They have all since moved out and things have seemed fine. He invited me and our mutual friends to a kickback at his coworkers house a couple weeks ago. He also invited the girl he has been dating. He has known this coworker for two months and they seem to have hit it off. His coworker and I ended up staying up all night talking and exchanging numbers. He expressed he was happy to have a new friend. The next few times I saw this new friend he was very touchy and flirty so I thought he may be interested in me. I asked him to hang out a couple times and he said he was busy. His demeanor towards me changed after that, not even friendly anymore, a bit cold. I apologized for misreading the situation because I thought we were vibing with each other and was trying to make an effort to get to know him more to feel out the situation. He showed the text to my friend when they were at work together. The situation got grossly misconstrued and weird. The guy texted me saying that he was confused why I was even texting his friend, when I was going to tell him, and why hadn't I already? He said he had only known the guy a couple months and he had the courtesy to let him know. (The new friend later told me he did it for advice, not for a heads up, as he wasn't aware of the past situation) 

I don't think that I should have to tell him before I text someone he knows. I feel that it is none of his business. It also threw me off because he is dating someone on and off, and i have met other girls hes gone out with too, and he has met the few guys I have dated since then. He refused to give me a reason and kept saying that it was something I should just do for him because he wants me to it and I am his friend so I should respect his wishes. He compared it to someone touching me if I didn't want to be touched and saying they wouldn't stop until I told them exactly why I don't like it. As someone who has been in situations like that before I didn't think that was a fair comparison, I think being physically violated is different. After a looong argument, over text (texting about it was totally stupid and 100% my fault, but I haven't had time to talk in person, and I wanted to hash it out) he ended up telling me that me rejecting him years ago and then being with his friend back when they lived together caused him to be suicidal as he had never been rejected before and it was the most pain he had ever felt in his life. I couldn't really connect the dots of how that led to me needing to tell him BEFORE I text anyone he knows. I am not sure how that helps? I wasn't sure what to say to that either and I got upset. He never considered that I may not want to hurt his ex wife by being with him, or that he asked me out after saying he had never been alone before and didn't like being alone. I mentioned that so he wouldn't feel like it was just blatant rejection and he said I was a shitty friend and I had made it all about me. I just wanted him to know why I didn't think it was a good idea to be together. He then kept telling me I should show people my texts with him so I can see how I am being unreasonable and I can ""pull my head out of my ass"". 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Maybe I was a cunt, but I am here to ask, 3 years later, after him and I not REALLY being together, is it fair for him to expect me to tell him before I text anyone he knows? I don't see the point.  I would understand if i wanted to go on a date or something with someone he dated but me just texting someone he knows? I think he is holding on to the past and now that I know his reasoning for him wanting me to do this, it feels like a way for him to control a situation almost to get back at me for rejecting him. I think giving in is enabling this behavior and he needs to let it go. Rejection and feeling hurt is a part of life and you have to accept it and move on. Am I being unreasonable? I know I did a few fucked up things but I've apologized and didn't do them on purpose. I talked to my roommate and she just kept saying I was stupid for texting him about it and that were both stubborn, so I need some real advice. He and I have decided to stay at arms length, and to be perfectly honest I am not sure how or why we stayed friends all these years after some things have come to light, but I do want to apologize if I was unreasonable.",18Jul2019,2

585,"Some context, I knew him for a few years, I told him I'm bisexual, he swore not to tell anyone, and he is quite trustworthy but today was different. I drive him everyday as we live close and I've already stopped talking to him as often, but it wasn't serious, I just wanted to not start following him and always being around him.

Today, he was trying to open Word and I kept on pressing esc. It wasn't important what he needed to do and it was a joke, until he started mentioning the fact that he will tell people that I am bisexual. This really put me off, joke or not. I went silent for a while, and he played it off like it was nothing.

Well, a few minutes ago on Snapchat, I said I was pissed off, joke or not. He tells me it was not a joke but rather a threat. I tell him to not talk to me tomorrow, and not to come to my car tomorrow. He then responds demanding that he comes in my car, the talking part wasn't a bother to him. I told him I can't trust him and the one thing he swore not to tell is the thing that is threatening me.

I refuse, saying that I've driven him multiple times these past two months and I left him off some money he needed to give me back, but instead he still insists he goes in my car. This wouldn't be a problem if he didn't say that if I wouldn't, he would tell people I'm bisexual. That also wouldn't be a problem if I told anyone, but I haven't for a specific reason.

Now I'm stuck either being his slave or being humiliated. I could drive him tomorrow but that'd basically show that he is dominant and can control me, but now I really fucking hate him for that. The fact he is enough of a bigot to basically let me, his 'friend' to be humiliated because of me pressing esc on his keyboard and not driving him the day after despite all of all the favours I made for him shows.

I can't trust anyone with any of my secrets. I told him I was bisexual because we actually have been best-friends for long now and he is usually more serious, but today I feel like I lost him and I don't mind that, I mind the fact he can tell others and he is too self-centred.

I figured it would be fine because the dress hit my knees so there wouldnt have been any accidents as long as I was careful. so after i changed i went back to the living room to finish watching the movie and while I was standing by my mon she lifted my dress to check if I was wearing shorts. she must have expected me to be wearing them because i usually do but instead she just flashed my underwear and my ass to a lot of my extended family. then she started yelling at me for not wearing shorts and got mad at me! so I ran into the room I was staying in and stayed there for a couple hours and she keeps getting mad at me for not listening to her
everyone is telling me it wasnt a big deal and that I'm overreacting but I feel so embarrased and exposed 
what do I do? I tried explaining to her why it upset me but she  just got defensive and upset with me.",18Jul2019,1
598,"I am in my late teens and overweight. Most of my weight accumulates in my lower half of the body so I have to resort to dieting. I have just started to lose weight and I have couple diets in mind.

The problem is with my dad. Every time I deny to eat a meal politely when the family gets together, he gets angry and starts yelling at me. And at this point I just have to abide to what he says or else. I  understand that he cares for me and wants the best for me, but even when my mother tries to convince him that it is fine, he still gets mad. He only does this to me. When my younger brother says no, he doesn't care as much. This problem presents itself in other topics as well but I will not get to that. 

I am at a loss. I sat down with him and explained that I need to lose weight, but everytime he says "" You will lose weight eventually. "" or ""You will be thin when you grow taller."" I just can't get through to him.

How can I convince him?

600,"Throwaway time.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half now. I am in love with her for many MANY reasons. We both have the same sense of humour, she has such a perfect laugh and smile, and she generally makes me feel so warm inside. Generally, she is a quiet girl who keeps to herself, but is wild with friends. I met a girl about a week or two ago and we became quick friends. She is the opposite of my girlfriend. She watches anime, listens to kpop and very extroverted. From here on out I’ll be calling my girlfriend “GF” and the girl “F”. 

I don’t know why I like F. She likes things that I really don’t care about (kpop, anime, etc). I haven’t thought of F in a sexual way, but more of a simple “what if I held her hand right now?” and cheesy things like that. I haven’t felt like my relationship with GF is bad or going downhill at all. Even if I do have a crush on F, I’m still in love with GF. 

So my questions are; is this crush normal? Has anyone else experienced this while in a long relationship? Will I get over it? What happens if the crush doesn’t go away?

TL;DR: I like a girl I met two weeks ago, but I’m in a relationship.",18Jul2019,1

603,"Hey guys,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I was living with three other roommates (I'll call them A, B, and C), but left because the house was always a mess (mostly due to Roommate B's dog), kitchen was unusable, I was stressed, and Roommates A and B wouldn't pay me back for routine house things even close to on time. I pay the utility bill, internet bill, bug-man bill, and have to get reimbursed by them due to how late they are.

Well, last month, due to 1. a burst water pipe in the yard and 2. a leaky toilet in Roommate A's personal bathroom (the rest of us share one), our utility bill for a 3-person home (I don't live there anymore) was $920, over $600 being water. I told Roommate A after the city sent me an email that there was a leak somewhere, and followed up by going to the house and determining it to be his toilet, though I didn't want to invade his personal space at first. I turned off the water, informed him, and told him to address it since it was his. Well, he didn't. He said he would, turned it back on, and never dealt with it, and it went on for a month before the burst pipe (which I never noticed) was discovered a few weeks later by neighbors and our renters finally sent a plumber out.

Now we've found out that we can't do anything to affect this utility bill, and I've only told Roommate A so far. He is talking like we should all just split it. I don't feel good about it, because I feel like he is partially to blame, but I don't know how much the pipe affected it versus the toilet so I am at a loss here. I texted/called/emailed him about the water being too high close to 5 or 6 times.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: due to unfortunate circumstances I now owe nearly $1K to the city for utilities for a house I no longer even reside in because of ignorance and lack of responsibility because I was gone. What should I do?",18Jul2019,1
604,"So, i got into a relationship with this guy a few days ago and everything was alright until yesterday. He had a mental breakdown and made me feel really bad for having my limits as a human being.

We talked it out, and I figured he just snapped because he held in the pain for way too long so I forgave him.

Today I was in a call with him and on my phone, and all of a sudden he hung up and Texted me he felt bad again but wanted to talk to someone else because I wasn't giving him ""the time of day"" and all my attention.

I got hit by that because 1.He was also on his phone; 2.I didn't even know that he was feeling bad.

I texted him, being super careful of what to say, but somehow he still managed to turn my words around and use them against me.

I am not mentally stable myself at all, I am in therapy and everything. He knows that.

607,"As I grow older, I start to make realizations. It may sound narcissistic for me to say, but I am the only one in my entire family that doesn’t display any mental disorders. I am the only one to graduate on time, and the only one who can articulate well in my immediate family. Trust me I’m no where near perfect, but I was called a genius growing up simply because I never failed a grade of got in fights (B- student at best). Little brother is autistic (high functioning albeit), older brother graduated at 20 and still struggles with reading and comprehension, mother is a drop out (BPD, Anxiety, Alcoholic, Bat shit insane), and my father doesn’t comprehend anything beyond one sentence (if I explain something it just goes over his head). I have a close relationship with my older brother but I’m practically walking on eggshells when we talk simply because he often will take stuff out of context and get mad. I look around at aunts, uncles, cousins, and there is literally no role models in my bloodline, just poverty, dysfunction and substance abuse. All of the family members that I like aren’t even blood related. The only person blood related that I can connect with is my grandmother and even she has severe anxiety and depression (on meds). 


Long story short, I bring this up today because I always pictured myself having kids, but knowing what I know I don’t think this would be wise. My older brother has a son with autism as well, the thought of passing something on to a child terrifies me and seems like an overall selfish thing to do. How do these things work? Am I practically doomed and forced to adopt? Yes I’ve done a lot of self reflection and I know that I’m not perfect at all so please don’t bash me for saying this, I just want to know if there are any other people out there that feel this same way? What would you do? Family is so mentally unstable that I’ve always thought that there might be something wrong with me, but I’ve grown to realize that this is not the case.

She recently got a promotion to manager of my current team, leaving me to have to move to a new team. I was so happy for her and only had great things to say to and about her and her promotion. However, my friend on that team has recently told me “your sister told me not to trust you” in a sort of joking manner. I laughed it off then later asked my sister what that was about. She told me she was just joking around and try to get comfortable with everyone and mentioned something I did the day before that “wasn’t up to her standards”. It still makes me uncomfortable and upset because I work so hard and what she was joking about made me look like a slacker. We have a very great relationship, but this really bothers me.

610,"Alright. A little bit of backstory before I begin. I was dating this girl for a while before she left to a foreign country for some number of years. (Undisclosed for private reasons) We had both discussed in the beginning of our “relationship” that we couldn’t continue anything outside of being just friends once she left. I agreed. We got along amazingly and both agreed we were a really good match for each other. The time we spent together was great and honestly it was worth the pain when she left. We both like each other very much, and at least on my end, I’m sure I fell in love with her. We are still friends though, and still talk occasionally, as she’s very busy with work. 

Okay so I’ll split this into two categories. The letter, and the videos. 

The letter - I printed a Polaroid picture of her family and want to send it to her. I showed her the picture and she said no because it was sad. She then changed her mind and sent me the address I could send it to. I was also planning on surprising her with a bunch of stories I wrote to send in the same letter as well. She loved it when I told her stories and would ask me sometimes to tell her one. So I’m basically asking if I should send these because I don’t know how the picture and stories combo would make her feel. I don’t want to bug her and I especially don’t want to make her sad. 

The videos - During our “relationship” she asked me to record a video of myself playing/singing a song. It’s a very touching/romantic song. I did it, and sent it to her before she left. She loved it and cried when I showed her the video. She also asked me to record another song she liked, but I haven’t had time to learn it. After she left, I asked her if she still wanted me to send her videos of me playing songs. She said yes. The problem is that I’m not too sure if I should. It’s the same issue with the letter pretty much. These songs are romantic and one of them even made me cry multiple times. I don’t want to bug her with my feelings (even though I know she still has them for me), and again, I especially don’t want to make her sad. 

I might have left out some details, so please feel free to ask me any questions. Really need help on this lady’s and gentlemen. Anything is appreciated 👍🏼",18Jul2019,1

I was online looking for online jobs to earn some money. I don't have any work experience and I have just finished High School but after a lot of practice I understand English pretty well.
I was interested in getting into the translating field and I only have a B2 certification taken years ago.

There were two jobs to translate from English to Italian, one for 10 dollars and one with preselections (they give you 217 words to translate then select the better translations out of many, the real job is translating 23000 words).

I realized only later on they asked for experience/expert level translators etc and Idk what to do.

I doubt they will consider it tbh, should I just wait?

615,"For reference: I am a graphic designer/social media manager for a medium sized company and the person in question is a marketing manager who sits at the desk right next to mine. 
We are both women, and the same age (which sometimes I have a hard time believing since she can act so young), and she’s usually at an 11 and idealistic whereas I’m usually at a 7-8-9 and realistic. I should also mention that in the ‘.org chart’ of our organization, we are on the same level so she is not my superior. 

We work together on a lot of projects, she gives me the project request to do something wether it’s a poster, direct mail campaign, brochure, graphic, signage etc and I will design it, most of the time I also write the copy because the copy she provides is written like a 16 year old girl who still dots her I’s with little hearts. 

My biggest issue is whenever we are in meetings with other people in the company, the ideas and the projects are always ‘hers.’ She always refers to them as ‘my signs’ or ‘my posters.’ When in fact, we both worked on them together and the majority of the ideas were usually mine. 

Most of her statements usually begin with ‘I’ or ‘me.’ Like “didn’t I look AMAZING at the gala last year” or when one of our direct mail campaigns that I designed and wrote did really well she said “it was all me.”

I just found out that she took the credit for a huge project that we worked on together last year and sat through a meeting where she claimed ownership on a lot of stuff that I had been working on.

616,"Yesterday I was driving up my quiet dead end street (going around 12 mph, there's a water main being installed in my street so I was being cautious near the construction). I see my neighbor backing out of his driveway to my left, and when it looked like he wasn't stopping, I stopped and hit the horn. It was too late though and he ended up backing into me and putting a decent dent into my fender.

We both got out of our cars and he was apologizing ""my bad, my bad."" Then he looked quickly at my fender and said ""you're good, just tapped your fender"" (I'm good? Don't I get to decide if I'm good?). At this point I had barely even gotten a chance to look at the damage, and he just walked back to his car and drove to work. I can't recall saying a word to him during this entire exchange.

I sent photos to a dent repair place and got a quote of $425, which seems pretty fair to me, the dent is pretty large and in a tricky spot. 

My car is a standard commuter, not pristine, but it's not a beater either, and I want to get the dent fixed. Honestly if he had stuck around and given me a chance to talk to him I might have let it go, but the way he dealt with it really offended me. He didn't give me a chance to look at the damage or talk to him and just drove away without consulting me.

Here's my dilemma. The guy who hit me is like 19 or 20, lives with his mom, and works a retail job. I can't imagine he has a ton of disposable income. I'm a college student and I'm also not exactly rolling in it. If he looked like he had the means I'd have no issue just demanding the money straight up, but with him $425 might be squeezing blood from a turnip. He also lives two houses down from me so I have some interest in solving this amicably. I want to avoid going through insurance, but the option to make a claim is still there. His deductible is probably higher than the repair cost so it's very much in his interest to negotiate with me outside insurance.

I admit a large part of the reason I want to get him to pay for the damage is the way he initially handled it. I really feel like he was trying to pull a fast one on me and he just assumes that I'll let it go. Am I being unreasonable? What do you think I should do?",18Jul2019,5

618,"We have been together for 5 years. I found out a few months ago that he had his ex gf on all of his social media, and was sexting people on kik and other messenger apps. When I questioned him he denied everything even though I showed him proof on his phone. He has always been weird about his phone, making sure it always on him, being anxious and uncomfortable when I’m using it for YouTube or something dumb. When I would ask him about it he would just say that he was weird about his phone and didn’t like when other people touched his stuff. I believed him because I knew before we started dating that he had a traumatic past with his exes cheating on him and told me he never would and never had cheated on anyone. He went through a bout of depression 3 years ago and during this time we fought a lot. We were barely having sex or being intimate and I found myself working long hours to distract myself from home life. I did try several times to talk to him and see if we could figure out what was happening in our relationship but he would always say he was just depressed and avoid the situation completely. When I found out he was talking to his ex he was showing me a video on social media and the post underneath the video was his ex. I asked him about it and he denied they were even connected on social media...even though we were both looking at the same screen. At this point I went crazy I will admit. I went through his phone and found out he had been adding and deleting her on fb throughout  the 5 years we dated. No messages were saved anywhere. He denied talking to her and said that he just wanted to make sure she was doing well... After several arguments he told me that nothing happened with her and I finally believed him. Two months later I found everything wiped and she popped up on his fb again I found this out in almost the same way that I did the first time ( this time he was showing me pictures of a party we went to on his friends timeline) after more arguments and searching I didn’t find anything. But he did tell me that they occasionally talked and he drove past her house on the way to work several times. Apparently once he messaged her to let her know that he was nearby and she asked him to come over which he didn’t do. When I asked why he did that he said it was because his self esteem was low and knowing that someone wanted him validated he was good enough and it felt good to turn her down. I don’t even know what to say to that. Today he swears nothing is going on and I’ve caught him in several lies that I call him out on. He thinks that because he “didn’t do anything “ he didn’t cheated and the only reason he feels like he did anything wrong was because I was so upset. Am I crazy? This is cheating right? He lied to me about the nature of their relationship, and hid all of this throughout our entire relationship. Now he wants things to go back to normal and I don’t even know how to cope with the situation or let him know how badly I’m hurt.

626,"Hi guys,
 
Not sure if I came to the right place but hoping someone can help me out. I recently enrolled in a debt consolidation program for my credit cards and personal loans. I guess one of the cards had my dad added as an authorized user about 10 years ago(he hasn’t used it in like 5 or 6 years or longer) and I just never had him removed. It was just a card made in his name on my account so he could use it for gas and groceries.
 
It is now 70 days after I enrolled in the program and the lates are now reporting on my dad’s credit report and effecting it pretty negatively. This sucks because he wanted to purchase a condo next year to retire in but might not be able to because of this. I called the debt consolidation company and they stated they can’t really negotiate with the credit card company because of him being on as an authorized user and that he needs to be removed so they can negotiate. I cannot call them myself because if they get in touch with me that will be less of a reason to get in touch with the debt consolidators attorneys. So I gave my dad a number and he’s going to try to call and have himself removed. What I need on advice on is: is there any way to get this resolved and fix his credit back to what it used to be? Maybe even removing the lates from his credit report? I am not here for upvotes and downvotes and please try to be nice. I really just want to get this resolved.

627,"This is one of my first posts so I apologize if it’s all over the place or if it’s just bad in general.

So about 4 years ago I met this girl, we’ll call her Amy, We hit it off straight away and we genuinely liked each other. We tried dating but after about 4 or 5 months we broke up. We both thought it was a good idea and remained friends. Fast forward a few months later I’d just gotten out of a relationship and I was hurt really bad. (I struggle with really bad depression and anxiety so that doesn’t make any better) Amy then came to me and was just there for me she would always listen to me when I talked, tell me what I needed to here, and was just there for me. I ended up falling for her again. So we decided to give it one more shot and started dating, the relationship ended because of both of our parents, we made some bad decisions and it was brought to their attention... But although this happened we still remained friends. Over the next year and a half we were on and off, and I really loved this girl. She made me super happy... when she was talking to me... as I said before I have major anxiety, and when she didn’t respond for a while (which happened often) I got really worried about our relationship, that then led to me not eating and cutting. My whole mental stability revolves around this girl, at the time I didn’t notice how bad it was, but it was BAD. About exactly a year ago she moved. We where still dating at the time so I was happy. We texted every day so I didn’t struggle with cutting and that went on for a few months. Around two months after Valentine’s Day she just randomly texted me “I think we should break up.” I immediately responded “why?” And she told me the the long distance relationship was too hard for her, she doesn’t want the temptation to cheat. Although I was hurt... I said “ok, at least we can still be friends” but apparently I was wrong cause then she blocked me. I was so hurt. I ended up crying myself to sleep, I thought I couldn’t be hurt more... I was wrong. The very next day I got a text from a random dude saying “Are you still going after Amy” I responded with “no we broke up last night” I came to figure out that that have been dating since Valentine’s Day, for two months. The worst part was that he didn’t believe that she was dating me, we talked on Snapchat so I had no proof at all. He then blocked me. I couldn’t function for the next two days so I stayed at home. My mom was worried but didn’t press into what was wrong. I never got over it, I was still badly hurt, but for about 4 months I went on with my life and I was happy. I had a good home life, I was doing good in school, I had a lot of fun with friends, and so much more. I was happy, I didn’t struggle that much with anxiety. But about 3 weeks ago I got a text from Amy, she was apologizing and saying how she wanted to make it up to me. I loved this girl since pretty much day one, I’d do anything for her. So I forgave her. She wanted to hang out, so we did. I was so happy to have her back in my life, we went to the roller skating ring and skated for a little but ended up sitting down and talking for 2 hours. When we left I immediately got a Snapchat saying “I had a fun time”
I told her that I did too and that we should do it again.
She said we should but also apologized for her face being so close to mine, she wanted to kiss me. I took this as a “I like you.” So we texted pretty much the whole night. The next two days she was quiet, barely texted at all. So I thought she was busy. I talked to my friends about it and cause they know the whole past they told me I should block her and forget about her... I couldn’t though, I really liked this girl, and from what she’s said she likes me. I fell into that really bad anxiety while she was quiet. But what hurt the most was when she said “sorry I’m talking to this guy and I lose track of time when I’m with him” 

I know I’m clingy but I’m getting hurt by this girl over and over and I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried to confront her about it but all she says is “oof” 
I can’t tell the story that well but I think she’s just manipulating me and I can’t do anything about it because I don’t want to lose her. I know what I need to do is block her and just move on but I can’t bring myself to do it. This girl has always been bad for me but I just can’t bring myself to leave. I need help guys.",18Jul2019,1

She was mostly raised in America, so she has the ""American dream"" of falling in love, marrying the person she wants, having a house, dog, and 2.5 kids etc. The problem: her parents are very religious and conservative Pakistani parents. They want her married by the end of the year. To a man they pick, who will be one of her distant cousins. She hates this. Shes pretty liberal and doesn't agree with a lot ( but not all) of her parent's cultural ideals. She keeps sending me pictures of the men shes supposed to choose from and wants to hear my opinions on the matter. But my opinions are not rooted in her and her families' culture. I wasn't raised with these beliefs. Westerners don't tend to agree with arranged marriage at all, especially against the will of the people getting married. I don't know what to do. Telling her that I'm not educated on the subject, but that I feel for her is a load of shit. No one wants to hear that. But I dont want to tell her to say ""screw you, I'll marry who I want"" because her family will LITERALLY disown her. Marrying a man she doesn't even know will most likely ruin her goals in life.

The medication she takes inhibits Plan B (I forgot the name of her med, but it’s a prescription for anxiety). But since it was a few days since she took the anxiety medication, I wasn’t worried.

The problem is about 12 or less hours after she took Plan B, she got back on her medication and still is.

633,"Here's the story..

She was staying with me for a week, sleeping on my couch. She lives in a different city and visits me every summer. It's always super fun to have her here!

I had a small gathering, at the end of the night she and my friend went to ""buy smokes"". They were both a bit drunk, not very drunk but they each had had a few drinks. She texted me 15 minutes later saying she was going to smoke a joint with him, that she'd probably get sleepy and stay over at his place (he lives 4 blocks from me).

So they hooked up.

She's had many partners, even at 19. I support her exploring her sexuality. I just tell her to be safe, and she insists she always is. But, she's also had some mental health issues..depression, adhd. She's on anti-depressant meds. Obviously my friend knows nothing about that since it's her business.

He's a very sexual person as well. Not a predator or anything, but he does hook up with a lot of women. 

So, they are both very sexual people and insist it was enjoyable and loving and safe. I believe them. But, something feels..icky. He's so much older and I feel like if the positions were reversed, I would have sent her home. I consider myself to be a very liberal, progressive person and I have no religious or mental hangups about sex.

It's driving me crazy. I can't stand to hang out with the guy now, but, he's such a dear friend so it's tearing me apart. I want to be okay with this but I'm not sure I should be. I brought it up with him and he said he's very sorry it's making me anxious, but insists he did nothing wrong, that it's not about me at all - it was just two people I love enjoying each other physically.

Why does this feel so strange to me? My gut says it's some long, lost parental instinct kicking in but it feels..bigger than that. Any advice is appreciated.",18Jul2019,1029

She eventually came to the conclusion it was mine and nothing else was ever said about it. We now have another child for a total of four. I love her but given all the history and this go around not being exactly the smoothest (most of which is my fault because i didnt face some things i should've before i tried another relationship) things are a little rocky between us. Ive never cheated on her during this whole go around and she hasnt either yet there are still lingering trust issues. Ive tried everything possible to show her she can trust me and i get no where. Im tired of walking on eggshells wondering if todays gonna be the day she says she doesnt want to do this anymore. One minute were good then the next shes accusing me of stuff that never even happened, or just bringing up stuff from our past. Its honestly been draining me. Mind you she did this back and forth, i want you now i dont shit before we split initially. So idk if its mind games or what. And now I've met someone that i really like talking to. She's sweet, extremely pretty, loves to help others and overall has just a heart of gold. We laugh together and its really easy to be open and talk with each other. She doesnt have kids but is ok with the fact i do. It's obvious she likes me and wants to pursue an actual relationship. Now im torn because i want to stay for my kids but i also really want to see where this would lead. And honestly I'm just confused as all hell right now. 

TL;DR:Should i stay for my kids and try to fix something that may not be fixable or should i just start over with someone new. I plan on being in my kids lives either way.",18Jul2019,1
636,"3rd try. 

What are men thinking when approaching a random girl on the street? 
And wtf was this guy thinking?

I (F17) recently met this stranger guy who is only a few years older than me. I was walking home from an appointment, and he starts approaching me by making a funny comment. I had my headphones on and just gave a one-word reply, not thinking much about it any more. (As a girl, I always find it lowkey creepy when a stranger man approaches me on the street, which kinda sucks-being creeped out by a simple thing like that- but it is how it is)
However, about a min later he tries again talking to me, and as he actually looked nice (which sounds superficial but it’s just human I guess) I just „gave in“ and participated in a conversation. We end up heading into the same direction and getting along really well, laughing, many synchronicities and having a lot in common. So we walk about 20-30min talking about anything, and I actually like him (at least the 30min-version of him I got to know) 

Anyway, just when we’re about to separate and head into different directions, I expect him to ask for my number but he just quickly says „ok bye then“ without anything else and leaves, and I just stand there thinking what’s wrong with him/me/idek. 
I know this sounds like a cliché, expecting the guy to ask for the girls number, and it is, but I honestly would have asked myself if he gave me a chance to. Shit I don’t even know his name, it never came up in this half an hour. 

Now normally from what I’ve experienced, when guys approach girls on the street they simply ask for name and number, without getting to know each other AT ALL. Which kinda sucks but honestly, I still appreciate it, as not that many guys have the courage to ask a girl out face-to-face and not eg. on the internet.

But this guy really tried to get me talking to him, we actually have a really nice conversation, and then he just leaves like that.

So Guys: Why. What is your logic I don’t get it I need answers. 

Thanks for your attention.",18Jul2019,3

If I’m tired or not occupying my mind, they can seem quite audible. Sometimes they are whispering, and sound like they are in the next room and sometimes they talk directly at me.

I know they are not real, and this is like telling people about your dreams (which is just the worst), but they say things like you’re a f*ing f-word and you should kill yourself. Over and over.

Between bereavement and sick days out, I missed a lot. Luckily my work knows how hard I’ve been working and have been lenient. My manager had a talk with me, and with counseling I’ve been really focusing on being at work come hell or high water. 

Since the beginning of this year, I’ve taken 4 days off. All 4 were legitimate, whether I felt like dying or had to take our dog to the vet. There was never a day that I just didn’t feel like going to work. 

My manager said that in a rolling 12 month period, my numbers have gotten worse - because most of my absences were in the latter half of last year with bereavement and all that. 

I’m heartbroken. I’ve been really trying even though my mental health has been really rough in the last few months and I thought I was doing better.

645,"Okay, so this is kind of a delicate situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I begin I need to clarify some things:

a) I'm from Lebanon so our economy isn't that great.

b) Many people are forced to work 8-12 hours every day for less than 50 cents an hour to make ends meet.

c) Our neighbor is a teenage single mother of 3, without a degree, divorced and does not get monetary support from her ex-husband (apparently she refused it) so she's forced to work the entire day and leave her three kids alone without any supervision (oldest is about 5 and youngest about 1 year old).

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem: The youngest of the kids is a little girl and terribly misses her mother every day.

She screeches for hours *non-stop* (and I don't mean scream like a baby throwing a tantrum, I mean ***screech*** **like someone getting beaten with a stick**) and only ever stops when her mother is home, when she's sleeping or eating.

I want to get her to stop, I sympathize with their situation and sometimes even help them out by giving them meals and the kids some candy but it's been days and the constant screams have started to grate on my nerves.

Not only that but I **know** for a fact that constantly screaming like that **cannot** be healthy.

I live across the country so it would just be easier for me to stay with him since it’s close to school and i obviously didn’t wanna leave my boyfriend for 4 months. They agreed. 

I stayed there from the end of April to the middle of June and decided I wanted to go back home for the rest of the summer because I missed my family. I told his parents that I will probably come back a little earlier before school starts. 

My dad had booked my flight for 10 days before move in day. I decided to go back a little bit earlier to start working and get a head start before school starts back up.  I told my boyfriend and a couple hours later he said that his parents said I couldn’t stay with them. He assured me that it wasn’t because they had any problems with me, they just didn’t want any more guests. 

Now, of course it’s wrong to just expect them to let me live there... however they already agreed to letting me stay the entire summer and it was my decision to go back home.  So my dad bought the ticket with both of us thinking I had somewhere to stay. So now I am totally screwed and have to ask around to find somewhere to live ONLY FOR TEN DAYS. I just feel hurt and awkward at the fact his parents completely switched up on me and screwed me over as now I am basically homeless as of August 9th when I was told otherwise at the beginning of the summer. 

Is it wrong for me to feel this way? Everyone I ask says it’s ridiculous that they could do that to me- someone they always said was part of the family. Now they’re leaving an 18 year old girl out on the streets basically.

She's been uneasy about the relationship for the past year, but I always reassured her that things would be ok. this time last week, we had our usual small argument over nothing and it began to escalate (you know the drill). After we'd finished bickering with each other, I told her we should break up! I didn't feel it was healthy to continue doing this...

For the past few months, I have been chatting with a girl that I was extremely attracted too via instagram. I never thought id get to meet her, but I did! And it went really well! Nothing happened while I was dating my ex, I just hung out with her at her place a few times, getting to know each other. Fast forward to the day after I broke it off with my ex and I met up with this girl. We went out for drinks. We had sex. And again. It was amazing! She's a freak with a body like a goddess. And I kept going to her place for the week after... even when she's on her period just to talk and sleep next to her..

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like things are going well with this new girl, but in the back of my mind, I know she's just a rebound to help me get through a shitty situation. I'd love to date this girl, but not sure she's on the same wave length, I feel I should stop messaging her for a bit!

Apparently I'm never at the shop (which I am) and I'm too much of a liability while I'm going through this crap period of my life! Such a cool guy....

I can be a bit jealous, and recently they have been making friends with many other people and I feel left out. Additionally, as much as I hate to say it, I am frustrated because I feel like I am unable to help them. They recently said something that upset me, and I feel distanced from them. They have told me whenever I want to end the friendship I may do so, but I feel horrible leaving them in such a bad time of their life. Plus I do enjoy talking to them. Please help.",18Jul2019,1
667,"When I was 15 years old, I had a 14 year old girlfriend from the next town over. We were only together for a few months, and I can’t remember exactly how the relationship ended or who dumped who, but I know that things ended on a negative note. 

Not long after we broke up, I was chatting online with another girl that went to my ex’s school. We were talking about my ex and for some reason I brought up that I still had a nude photo that she had sent me. The girl I was talking to thought this was hilarious and asked me to send it to her, and, without a lot of thought, I did. 

Long story short, the picture spread like wildfire. I don’t know the exact details, but it was rumored that someone even sent it to her father’s work email, who was the principal of the town’s middle school and opened the email while at work. The police were called, I went to court, and for some reason that I still don’t understand today I was basically let off with no punishment. I was given something like 20 hours of community service that had to be done within a year and my record would be expunged. 

I’m 28 now and I haven’t talked to my ex since before I graduated high school. I know that my actions caused her and her family a lot of pain during that time. The community they lived in was small and deeply religious (Mormon) and I’m sure that she wasn’t treated with a lot of compassion. I deeply regret what I did and hate that I never really apologized to her. Is it too late now? Would it be selfish of me to even bring it up to her?",18Jul2019,42

669,"Hi, guys and girls! Long story short - I've been dreaming of studying in Germany (am from Bulgaria) for about a year now. So I graduated from high school last month and applied for the University I had chosen. 
However, I decided not to try my luck there because of several reasons: 1. I have no money to support myself. 2. I have absolutely zero contacts in Germany and finally, 3. The major I was going to apply for is highly impractical. I wanted to study law and get a degree in European law, but the total study time is about 6½ years, and I would be able to practice only this type of law, since I don't wish to get a German law degree. This is a big deal because my intention has always been to return to Bulgaria. But, as it turns out, this wouldn't be enough to find a job here. So, I'm taking an exam to get into a Bulgarian university. 
Still, even though I've made a pros and cons list of both and studying in Bulgaria is a more preferable option, I'm still feeling pretty down lately. My question for you is: Should I feel down? Because where I'm going (Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria) I will still be at my home country, there will be plenty of my high school friends, there would be no language barrier, and I believe it would be easier to work and study at the same time.",18Jul2019,1

671,"First of all, I’m sorry if I make a lot of mistakes since I’m a non-native English speaker.

So I (23F) have been with my boyfriend for 4 years now, and I love spending time with him and his family. All of his family members are really nice to me except for his sister (17F). It’s not that she only doesn’t like me, she hates me with a passion. She doesn’t want to be with me in the room. Whenever I come to a room she’s in she’ll leave. She doesn’t talk to me but when I’m not around she’ll have huge tantrums (including screaming and throwing things) about me coming to their family home. My boyfriend’s parents have asked her why she hates me but she gives no real reason. She just says she hates my ‘bitchy attitude’. When this all started 4 years ago I thought I’d be a phase but sadly it’s only gotten worse..

I’m extremely shy and I’m not the person to talk a lot. I’m 1000% sure I haven’t done anything to make her hate me. I even tried to get a conversation going in the beginning, but she’ll give very short answers and walk away. She also shows no respect towards me (throwing my stuff on the floor when it’s in her way or asking my boyfriend multiple times a day when I’ll be leaving). Whenever I confront her by calmly saying ‘you can ask me when I’ll be leaving because I’m sitting right here.’ she laughs and walks away. My boyfriend and his parents tried talking to her and punishing her for being rude to me but her behaviour hasn’t changed. She only acts this way with me, to others she’s always very kind and polite which frustrates me.

I’ve been pretending like I don’t care for 4 years. Because my boyfriend’s family is important to me I put up with everything she does and kept being nice to her, but as of lately I can’t do it anymore. I couldn’t find my favourite pair of jeans and a bra for a month and asked her if she’d seen them and she said no. Yesterday my boyfriend found them both in her room.. (it’s not even her size it’s just to f with me) I’m sick of her trying to ruin my life and it’s time I stand up for myself.  My boyfriend and his parents clearly gave up on talking/punishing her.

What should I do??

I spent an hour trying to make a perfect wing for the tattooist to trace over, but when the tattooing was done, it looked like she completely ignored it! My eyeliner was sharp and matched my eyeshape but the tattoo has blobs for a wing and makes my eyes look really small. I spent an hour crying and trying to find someone who could remove it only to find out that her only appointment is 4 months away. 

I just got this tattooed about 2 hours ago and i was wondering if there were any techniques to fade this during the healing process. I read somewhere that saltine worked but im a bit scared to do that. The technician said to apply aquaphor 4 times a day, if i dont do that, will it fade faster? She also told me to avoid washing it today and gently rinse it tomorrow, i will try not to wash it today but should i wash it several times tomorrow?

She has heard a rumour (under suspicions by her boyfriend) that I like her and she contacted me (a week later) to talk about it. I told her to hangout later the both of us alone.

Should I play dumb and make his boyfriend look like a jealous clown? Or should I tell her everything?

678,"So I live with two other girls who have hoarding issues. TRASH EVERYWHERE in their rooms and can barely see any surface of anything. They’ve learned to respect the common areas and at least keep their stuff mainly within their space (bedrooms, their kitchen cabinet, and shelf in the fridge) but it’s still nasty to be around!!   I’ve lived with these girls for 3 years now (they moved in with me) while I’ve provided all other furniture for the apartment, so I definitely don’t want to leave. But since I have opposite schedules than both of them, I barely get to see them, yet they’re fun girls and consider them friends.   I’ve confronted this issue a year ago with the one roommate that I’ve viewed as a big sister, and that went bad, even though I was gentle about it being that hoarding is a disorder. Bottom line, I said I was uncomfortable with her needing to bug boom the apartment due to medically treated bug bites and that it’s important to me that her space gets cleaned. Her point is that those bites “for sure happened in a park” and that she wanted to make sure nothing came back with her. Furthermore, she kept making excuses for herself and lying about it being spotless before...ya’ll it HASN’T since the day she moved in. Obviously, I had no idea what conditions were walking in when I agreed.   Anyhow, I involved the other roommate during that time to assure that I wasn’t attacking her, but that I do really care for her health and safety, but the roommate was really weird about it all, and now I know why...she’s got a similar secret.  So I’m looking for advice...people keeping telling me to confront this again myself, but I don’t think I’m certified to know how to handle a situation that has gotten REALLY bad. I feel like I should just contact my property manager (whom I’m super cool with and used to work for) for advise on this to maybe schedule an inspection for all smoke detectors or something to where someone would HAVE to go into their rooms and witness this first hand.

679,"So to try and make a long story short, I am still really close friends with my ex boyfriend, we went through a lot together and he didn’t treat me very well when we dated but there’s something between us that I can’t seem to deny. 

It sounds so cheesy but I feel like no one else understands me the way he does and we get on like we’ve always known each other. Even though so much has happened between us and I still see traits in him that make me unsure that he’s good as a partner I can’t help but feel that in some way we should be together. 

I’m worried I’ll never find someone who understands me like him, we are  best friends and even though sometimes we still fall out over things I genuinely think it’s because we care so much about each other. He knows more about me than anyone and another thing that makes him so valuable to me is that we both share the same long term illness, which is something that I can’t share properly with anyone else I know. 

We do clash quite a lot but we will always be there for each other when it matters and we’ve managed to stay so close through so much, but we get into arguments about whether we can still be friends or not when there’s so much history. 

Should I give him another chance at a relationship or am I clinging onto something that shouldn’t happen?",18Jul2019,1
680,"I am 17 years old, and going into grade 12, my last year of high school. I really dislike high school and am glad that it will be over soon, but on the other hand, I can’t escape the feeling that my life after high school will be much, much worse.

So many people around me seem excited about the opportunities the future might hold, but I feel nothing but pessimism toward it. It is impossible for me to see myself being happy in my adult life.

I’m not really good at anything besides writing essays, and you can’t exactly get a job writing essays. I have no career interests, and no idea what I am supposed to do with my life after I graduate. I feel like I should go to university, but I don’t even know what I would be going for.

My future is completely uncertain - I have no idea if I’ll be successful, no idea if things will work out, no idea if I’ll find my way in life, no idea if I’ll be a happy person in the near future.

I have no motivation to get up and do anything about it, and even if I did, I wouldn’t know what to do. I really have to force myself to study now in high school, and that will only get worse in university when I’ll have to do it so much more. I don’t want to work, but I know that I will have to anyway to support myself later on.

I can’t see myself being independent. I see myself crumbling under stress, unable to handle the weight of adult responsibilities. I fear life after high school so much that I often feel like I don’t even want to live to see it. I often think about committing suicide after my graduation ceremony next year, because it would be so much easier to die after high school is over than it would be to move forward into my adult life. I am not a particularly sad or depressed person - I just think about killing myself because I don’t want to face my uncertain future where it is very likely that I will fail.

What do I do? How did all of you find your way in life after high school? How do I find motivation to work and thrive? How do I start feeling as if life may be good to me in the future? Right now, I am an incredibly pessimistic person, and I just can’t see myself being a successful, happy adult. The future terrifies me, and I want advice about what to do about it from people who

681,"So I used to be best friends with this girl for basically my whole life. 

Then at the end of high school, I hit a lot of rough patches and never really explained what I was dealing with to her and then soon we just started drifting apart. I really snapped one day when my Grandma had recently passed away and I called her to let her know. She said something like, ""well, at least you knew it was coming"" to which I got offended by and hung up. She didn't realize it I had hung up on her so she just called back and I pretended like nothing had happened. 

Next thing I know we're in college and I tried reaching out to her about some struggles but she was pretty distracted by things and I didn't have the strength to tell her it was important. So eventually we just stopped talking.

Its been a few years and I still think about her a lot because she was like family to me. We briefly would talk once in a while, but it was like playing phone tag where we could never get a hold of each other.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it has gotten a bit much and today I decided to speak to him. When I got home today at 930pm (It's gotten to the point try to arrive home after 10pm not to get worked up) I knocked on his door and asked him if he could either play at a more decent hour or buy a mute. I explained that he lives in a community of people with thin walls and that, personally speaking, I use many weekday evenings to continue writing my Phd. His reply was ""yeah, sorry I come home from work at this time and I have to practice everyday and have no other time"". When I suggested buying a mute he said it was not the same. After I spoke to him, he just continued playing. (and thus, today ended up being the first time I smoked in a few months)

684,"Hello all I apologize for this being lengthy;

I will start by saying I have never posted to this subreddit. I am in a place of questioning. I hope my advice ask(s) are not too specific in nature. 

I am a 25 year old with no real feel for direction in life. I struggled identifying passion and ambition. I am finishing a Master's degree this August, because it just felt like the ""thing to do"" but it does not advance my career. I make less than 40K and have student loan debt and work a boring desk job I cannot stand. This is all complaints, I know. The tone changes. 

I came up with what I believe to be a brilliant business. I have no business experience and every step of this has me becoming overly happy then super depressed. I am struggling to manage the ups and downs. Slight backstory, I lost 100 lbs in an 11 month span playing videogames. It inspired me to look at how I could bring that to other people. This topic is my passion. Video games and working with Virtual Reality. I have been doing tons of market research and even somehow gained enough confidence in myself to even create website: [www.activearcades.com](https://www.activearcades.com) is my site if anyone wants to see what I am hoping to offer (yes, it is rough around the edges and needs some things addressed). 

I work at a small university and the university was talking about getting an e-sports team. I saw this as my perfect opportunity to step up. I could bring my business as a part of e-sports. So I could offer a social space on-campus for nerds and people that don't want to go to the bars. VR developer students could test their ideas with VR equipment and VR /Exercise is shown to reduce stress and anxiety/depression. Along with this offering something more robust for the e-sports team as a sense of community. 

Where my question(s) begin: I spoke with a director at my university today and basically they said they don't know if they have the money to even start an e-sports team (it is under $100K) which for a university would be minimal I had believed. They liked me and said to check back in a couple weeks when they could give me more information on where the e-sports proposal was heading, but I feel empty. Now I am trying to figure out how I deal with the feeling of dejection. I was not rejected, but it was nothing positive either. If I go back to the business model I had before I do not have the investments and do not know how to proceed. I can't stand that I have passion and drive for once but keep feeling like the mountain is insurmountable. Should I approach colleges and offer to bundle my idea as a way for them to get into e-sports, or will they just push me away and reject me the same? How much robustness do I need to present to the right people? Everyone looks for ways to shoot holes into an idea, and yet my idea has withstood so far and people like it... but the right people? People say to test the concept, well cool... but I cannot afford the equipment on my own. So I have tested the VR concept and it is well received, but is that enough? How do I keep my passion and make it something I can live off of without being poor? Is there even anything to my idea or are friends and people being supportive just because I know them? Self-doubt is a real bitch.... I KNOW if in 5 years I am not doing this I will hate myself if I see someone else doing this. I have passion for once but I am about to lose it to the depressive feelings of the business side of life. On top of this I cannot just leave my job immediately with no income source. I have nothing built up as savings. It is not possible with student loan debt and low paying job to get ahead for me right now. Help?

The many of us can relate to each other on the ways we drew things when we were younger, such as stick figures, m style birds, flowers, trees, clouds, etc. Even without outside influence that could possibly provide inspiration to draw this certain way. Why and how did all of us have similar pieces of art? We’re all from different parts of the country and the world, why does this phenomenon exist?

So far it’s been stressful and difficult to get the hang of, the people there aren’t really training me but really just telling me what to do and I try to keep up as much as I can. Part of all this I feel like it has to do with my hearing loss, when I was 11 months old, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer (I survived; clearly lol) but with all the healing process came side effects such as hearing loss and other small disabilities. The hearing loss is weird because I simply can’t hear words properly because my brain doesn’t processes them, words like “L” or “S” I can’t hear them and when I am told to spell something I have an extremely hard time understanding what the person is telling me. I have worn hearing aids in the past and they didn’t seem to help much or at least not that I could ever tell. My hearing loss condition wasn’t discovered until I was in 5th or 6th grade of middle school. I honestly don’t know what to do with my life if my hearing loss is becoming an issue.

711,"To start off I should say that I work at a relatively small industrial type plant. My Uncle hired me years ago and I've worked my way up to a computer-oriented office job. I would say that it's semi professional and there's no dress code. I sit in an office for 8 hours a day with 8 other guys and the owner and rarely meet directly with any sort of customers or outside contacts. All of the people I work with are mid to late 30's, very conservative, family men with the exception of the owner/my boss who is an older, still quite conservative, gentleman. Here's where the problem comes in. None of them have tattoos, piercings, long hair, anything out of the ordinary. They all dress basically business casual with few exceptions on rare occasions. 

This is where my problem comes in. I am a 25 year old ""snowflake"" (or at least that's how they classify me) with recent ear piercings, some tattoos and have been growing out my hair. As far as how I dress, I always wear long sleeves to cover my tattoos, I haven't had my piercings in ever at work, and I've tucked my hair into a hat every day for the better part of a year now. I wear our branded company shirts with jeans and a baseball cap basically every day. I conduct myself professionally through my actions, but I feel that when I do meet with customers or the like, I don't give off an heir of professionalism as compared to my co-workers. There have been times when I've met a contractor after months of email and phone calls to co ordinate an order and they are very obviously displeased with my appearance. 

The way I see it, I have a few options in the ways of solutions. One, I could cut my hair, buy more professional clothes and blend in. I don't really see this as a viable option as I already feel like I'm compromising my identity when I have to hide my hair and piercings. I'm sure this seems like a very paltry and childish thing to be so conflicted about but doesn't everyone like to feel comfortable in their own skin and have their own style? My second option is to buy more professional clothing and try to work my hair into my professional look but I'm unsure of how to do that. 

I guess those are really the only two options I see. Can anyone help with this?",18Jul2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

I like the place where I work but I have a strange feeling about the hours im working and how many I have written on my contract. I did some math and now i need help, its a seasonal job and I do work here for 3 months and a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem: 

&amp;#x200B;

My contract states that I have to work every week for 43,5 hours, furthermore I have 1 month with 5 days of work  and  the rest  with 6 days of work a week. Thre is nothing stated which month ne 5 days or 6 days are applied.  

&amp;#x200B;

I work from 5 june to 10 september

&amp;#x200B;

This are 98 days or 14 weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

every week would be: 

&amp;#x200B;

05.06 - 30.06  = 26 days or 3 Weeks 5 Days = 3,7141 Weeks

01.07 - 31.07  = 31 days or 4 Weeks 3 Days = 4,4285 Weeks

01.08 - 31.08  = 31 days or 4 Weeks 3 Days = 4,4285 Weeks

01.09 - 10.09  = 10 days or 1 Weeks 3 Days = 1,4285 Weeks

&amp;#x200B;

At the End of every month we get a paper with our hours and there it states that I have to work for 191,40 hours a month but there is nothing written about 191 hours a month in my contract. This got me thinking because 43,5 hours \* 4 weeks is 174 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

after some calculations i figured out how they probably calculated the 191,40 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

First 12 weeks: 

&amp;#x200B;

8,5 Hours \* 5 Days \* 4 Weeks = 170 Hours

8,5 Hours \* 6 Days \* 8 Weeks = 408 Hours 

&amp;#x200B;

170+408 = 578 / 3 Months = 192,666

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The calculation for 14 Weeks would be:

&amp;#x200B;

8,5 Hours \* 5 Days \* 4 Weeks = 170 Hours

8,5 Hours \* 6 Days \* 10 Weeks = 510 Hours 

&amp;#x200B;

170 + 510 = 680 Hours for 14 Weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

680/8,5 = 80 days 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But this seemed off because there is nothing written about 8,5 hours a day, only 43,5 hours. So i tried to calculate it only with the numbers I have given in my contract

&amp;#x200B;

2 Days off \* 4 Weeks = 8 days 

1 Day off \* 10 Weeks = 18 days  

&amp;#x200B;

that means i have \~ 18 days off 

&amp;#x200B;

98 days / 18 free days = 5,444 days \* 4 weeks = 21,7777 days per month 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

43,5 hours a week / 5,444 days = 7,990 hours a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

So is there a mistake or am I calculating this wrong?",18Jul2019,1

Since I was a kid I've always been the same, I feel things deep. I cry at seeing a dead mouse, I cry seeing a homeless person and 10x more so if they have a dog. I cry at the TV, I worry about people, even ones I dont know. When I was young my dad worked away and I used to worry about how lonely he must get, it made me really sad.

I know it's good to have compassion, to be kind and to care but I literally feel a physical pain thinking of someone being lonely or sad or having a bad time. The world is not all sunshine and shit happens, people die, animals suffer, kids get abused etc. When I think about it, I could cry. I really want to toughen up, because realistically these things happen and it's a part of life, but I find pain/injustice/sadness hard to deal with. 

One of the things I really cannot stand is animals being mistreated, I love animals so much that hearing about them suffering makes me so angry. I've watched all the documentaries, blackfish the cove etc and afterwards I cant stop thinking about it.

- isolate myself and feel lonely, yet I want close, meaningful relationships
- have no hobbies and interests
- ask others (friends, family) for advice yet ignore everything they tell me.

738,"I think by putting this out there maybe I’ll be able to get some perspective. I’m having a problem feeling attracted towards my boyfriend. I’ve been going through a bit a depression lately with moving to a new city, getting a new job and just dealing with my life being completely all around different then what it used to be. Anyways a few months ago it was getting to my boyfriend, he felt helpless about it and so he broke up with me. I felt like this was the worst possible thing he could do with the situation (I moved with him so he’s the only one I really have in this whole city.) I felt 100% alone and was trying my best to stay away from self harm.  During this break up period we still lived together which made things even more complicated emotionally. But he knew I didn’t have anywhere else I could go. To make it short, a few weeks go by of us both dealing with this and we agree to get back together and try to make things work. As time continues to pass I really struggle with myself to be able to forgive him for his actions. I feel like once someone hurts me once then that’s it. I’m done. Same thing happened with my ex, once the fighting starts and the hurtful things are said I just don’t see them as the same person anymore. I can tell he is putting in an effort to make things up to me but I can’t seem to change how I feel. I’m scared he could just change his mind again too if I don’t start to cheer up soon. Another part of it is that I now resent his family because they didn’t care enough to ask or see how I was doing. Even though I know he spoke with them about it. I guess I just don’t know how to forgive but I want to be able to make things work...any advice would help.",18Jul2019,2

I am 22 year male and I have had a relationship of 1 year with my current Girlfriend.  
I am a huge extrovert and she is an extreme introvert whenever I want to be out doing something she would rather sit at home looking at her phone and sometimes when we do go out to do something I try to talk to her but she shuts me down quick. Its like I cant have any fun whatsoever. Its mentally draining me.  


Why have I been sticking around for a year? Well. Because she loves me. I can admit I'm not the best of partners I do have my flaws and no matter what she has been there for me. She brings food to my place and she does as much as she can to help me out whenever I need it. But, at the same time I wish she was more upbeat and I wish she would interact with my family a little better. This weekend I was over in Colorado and she came with, there was a day where we didn't even talk to each other just sat around in the couch with our phones out.

752,"Need advice on getting better sleep quality.

Currently work 2 jobs; 1st one is 12.5 hour rotating shifts 2nd job is from 09:30 to 16:00. My work schedule is based on a 5 week cycle and I will occasionally work overtime at the 1st job.

Below is an example of how the next 5 week cycle is looking.

|Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Night Shift|Night Shift|Off|2nd Job|Off / Day Shift OT|Day Shift|Day Shift|

|Off|2nd Job|Off|Day Shift|Day Shift|Off|Off / Day Shift OT|
|12 Hr Day|12 Hr Day|12 Hr Day|8 Hr Day|12 Hr Day|Off|Off|

The overtime days change depending when/if OT is available. Week 5 varies from cycle to cycle. Some cycles it will look like above, other cycles I will have the entire week off, or it might be filled with overtime shifts/working at 2nd job.

I usually get up at 04:30/16:30 to eat, get to work for 06:30/18:30 , finish work at 07:00/19:00 and am in bed by 08:00/20:00, 09:00/21:00 at the latest. In preparation for night shifts I usually stay up until midnight to 02:00 and then sleep the whole day until 04:30.

For my 2nd job I will get up at 08:30 and get to work for 09:15.

For the most part I am hitting the 7-8 hours but I find the sleep quality is lacking due to the constantly changing sleep schedule. I find I wake up tired and there are some days where I am just completely exhausted.

754,"I'm in my second year of college, and few weeks ago I was chatting with two friends of mine and we were joking about cults (namely Scientology) and joining a cult and the idea one of us was trying to recruit the others, etc.

And yesterday I had what I thought was a somewhat witty joke. I knew that one of them was going to have an exam this Saturday, so I spoofed (I'll get to that) the teacher's email and sent her an email like ""Hello. Due to several reservations and doubts among your colleagues I have decided to send you the questions for the exam this Saturday. Regards (teacher)"". And I sent her the email along with a picture recruiting for Scientology. And I was thinking ""This can't really go wrong"". It was contained within 3 people. It was clearly not a serious email. She was going to meet us in 2 hours so it wasn't like the joke could go on any longer. And she was in constant contact with the 3rd friend, who was right next to me, also playing along, so I figured she wouldn't do anything that could spiral this out of control.

Our friend, without saying anything, thought she was really being converted into Scientology. So she replied with ""I think you sent the wrong file"". As soon as I knew she was in contact with the teacher I contacted both by call to come clean, but it was kind of late. Teacher mad as heck, and the Uni's IT lab threatened with criminal action if the teacher gave them the order to forward the email to the authorities.

As soon as I came home, I contacted 2 lawyers friends of mine and a former law teacher. And in my country THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL. All crimes here require proof that the action was undertaken maliciously, to cause damage or personal gain. This was clearly a joke sent to 1 person only. Whether it was a good joke not is up for a debate. 

This messed up my relationship with everyone involved. The teacher is just... I don't even know. The first time I called him to come clean he said ""Do you think I deserve this?"". DESERVE WHAT? You were not hurt, your career was not hurt, nothing happened, move on. I ended up calling him again after meeting with the IT lab to apologize and he just went ""Ok, cya"" and hang up on me. Seriously man go take a hike. I was absolutely fully willing to apologize and admit I was in the wrong up to that point. I'm just angry af now.

The person who received the email and was fully convinced she was being converted into Scientology can't be blamed. She's the one making this whole thing hilarious and I still can't help but laugh whenever I think of her. The other person can go take a hike as well. She spent the whole day yesterday worried that I was going to snitch her. And I obviously wasn't going to switch any blame to her, but she didn't even want me to tell the truth: that she was messaging the other girl and playing along. So she called the teacher behind my back to tell whatever story, when were supposed to go together.",18Jul2019,1

761,"Backstory- So I have this situation with this guy, and for this story I’ll call him J. I’ve known him for around 3 years. Now in the most recent of those years, I dated this guy for a long time and he broke up with me after 7 months, (this was my first relationship), so I rebounded for a bit after and this caused a bit of a problem when my school went to D.C. where a dance we had was just hell for me. This was around the time my current situation started.
       Now moving onto the problem, J has apparently liked me all three years I’ve known him. At first I had no idea he liked me, but after that fabled D.C. trip, I picked up on the not so subtle signs. He would tell me how when I was upset at the dance that he almost cried because he felt so bad, that he couldn’t tell me why he was awkward around me, and that only two of our mutual friends knew a secret that he wanted to tell me but couldn’t.
       I didn’t want him to live in the unknown of how I felt back, so I tried to get him to say it so I could let him down easy. I was dating someone at the time (a real jerk mind you, but a different guy than previously mentioned. This was more of a rebound.) so this was hard to get him to admit.
     Eventually through tons of light nagging asking who he liked and what the secret was, he had one of our friends tell me. After that, I let him down easy, and everything was good. (Or so I thought)
    My boyfriend and I broke up, for the better trust me, and J was acting weird.
He would say stuff like “Love is like drugs. You think it’s okay at first and then it ruins your life.” I never knew what to say, because I don’t think it’s my fault I don’t like him. 
After a good month, I started dating my childhood crush, and I still am now. We are super happy, which makes this harder for J. If I mention my current boyfriend, I’ll call him S, J gets really upset. I jokingly made a meme about S and me, and apparently hurt J just from seeing it. J also likes to subtlety say S isn’t good for me. He’ll hint at it by if I mention that S hasn’t replied in a few hours, he’ll say “That’s really mean of him,” in a tone that implies that he wouldn’t do that to me. I don’t even care if S doesn’t respond right away, he’s really busy.

So basically, I’m requesting help on how I can help this guy move on so neither of us deal with the guilt and annoyance of the situation. I don’t want to lose his friendship, I just want him to move on and be happy. Thank you if you read through the whole thing, I’ll appreciate any advice!

762,"Couldn’t really think of a better title as it’s a messy situation. 

I had an oops and got pregnant to a guy I’ve been friends with since we were kids. Floated in and out of each other’s lives but we were both single and looking to scratch an itch. Everything was all good and we made the decision we’d do this together. However during the pregnancy he started a relationship with someone new and much younger and he changed dramatically and decided he no longer wanted to do this. You may think this sounds like something someone young and dumb does, but we’re in our 30s. 

Our baby is now 10 months and I have done everything on my own. In her first 6 or so months he had only seen her about 5 times. Now from the talks I hear from mutual friends his relationship isn’t going so well and he’s been visiting a lot more to spend time with our child. She’s a really good baby and barely has meltdowns, however every single time he visits, the moment she sees him she screams and cries and is completely inconsolable for the entire visit. It’s absolutely heartbreaking for me to see her like this and I do sort of lie and tell him she hasn’t had a nap or she’s been in a mood. But it’s not the truth. The truth is she only does this with him. I make an effort and take her to see his family and she’s fine with them. She’s fine with people she’s never met before or barely even sees. It’s honestly just him. 

I don’t know what to do that I can help. I have a lot of anger towards him and would like for him to just leave and not be a part of her life. He doesn’t contribute any love or care towards her. Everything else to him is a priority and not her. But I also don’t want to be the reason my daughter doesn’t have a father. I would love for her to know him and be comfortable with him and actually have a father/daughter relationship. 

We don’t have any therapists around here or anything like that. I dont have anyone in my life that’s dealt with this situation. I assume people will just say “just keep trying” but I can’t even remember the last time she didn’t have a meltdown with him like this. Probably when she was a newborn and was asleep when he’d visit. 

I honestly have no idea what to do to get them to bond, for her to be comfortable with him and for them to spend some proper time together. Does anyone have any advice? Been in a similar situation? Is there any hope?",18Jul2019,2

There wasn't a big blow up, but years of small injuries that piled up and now they just don't talk. It breaks my heart and I know at least my dad is being stubborn and my aunt is afraid to reach back out.

Background:
I grew up very close with my cousins. Although we were not geographically close, we spent major holidays together, visited for birthdays, did week vacations together and wasn't uncommon for the parents to take all the kids for a week and then swap later on in the summer. SEVEN of us all close in age. It was great. My mom and aunt were actually best friends in middle school and my aunt set her up with my dad in highschool. 

Time went by our family went through the loss of their older sister to breast cancer, my aunt's divorce, money squabbles, ect. My aunt now takes care of their mother and their oldest brother, which I know is a huge, I don't want to say burden, but it's a burden in a sense taking care of both of them on her own. 

My siblings and I are still very close with our cousins And I've spent a lot of time talking with my cousin, the only other female, my big sister I've never had, about everything.

766,"My dad died a few months ago. He had terminal cancer, so my brother took two months off work (unpaid for some, welfare for some). I took paid time off (death in the family leave), but couldn't take time off paid because my wife is on maternity leave and we have a mortgage to pay. He was able to make it work as he has a high paying job and no kids, but I wasn't. He has also taken unpaid time off during the week (but not weekends) in preparation for the estate sale. I've taken time off paid (again, death in the family leave), and worked most weekends helping.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are both executors, and splitting the inheritance in half. Because he chose to take time off unpaid, he wants to be paid for his time, which comes out of the estate (and my inheritance). There is not much money in the inheritance, so any money he pays himself with is less that I acquire. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of history. I spent days and days helping my dad over the last few years to clean up his property as it was a mess. I have never asked for money. And now, I've been out there every weekend for months, and have not thought I should be getting paid for it. My brother is very upset that I haven't spent more time out there, but I have worked my bag off there in the past which helped us get ready for the sale, can't commit any more time than I'm already doing.

768,"I'm 21 and my ""father"" is 61 years old. Growing up my father was very cruel and hurtful towards me and my intermediate family(mom, brothers and sister). I am the youngest of the bunch and my older siblings have seen worse. My father used to physically abuse and fight my mom, even when she was pregnant. He's cheated on her during their relationship and has had different kids and abused their moms as well rather it was verbal or physical. He used to be a pro amateur boxer/wrestler back in his hey day. My mom never gave him a reason to be so hostile towards her. He has said a ton of hurtful and just plain crazy things to all of us and he acts like he's intimidating. Can't talk to him about how you feel or correct him without him trying to threaten to shoot, harm, or lash out at you and he will say ANYTHING to get under your skin to try and confront him. But in recent times I've learned that he often picked on who he thinks he can get over on and scare them, which is why he's probably abused so many women and talked bad about or challenged anybody he thinks he has an advantage over.


   A few weeks ago, he popped up at my home and my mom stays with me and she was looking outside and noticed him just sitting in his truck. I hadn't seen him voluntarily in over a year as I've cut him out of my life due to his harsh and sick personality.  It seemed suspicious so I made a stop at his house to confront him and he said that I must've gotten the message he sent(I have him blocked on my phone so idk what he was saying). I tell him that whatever message was sent wasn't received because I have him blocked and he gets into his feelings and tries to force me to leave without telling me what this message was about. Still sounding suspicious, I politely tell him, if anything happens, I know where he lives. From there he got riled up and we exchanged words. I decide to walk away and leave it at that. He then proceeds to attempt to follow me back home in his truck, but I flagged him down from afar to make it know that I'm right here down the street at a gas station(where my ride was parked at). He drives into the parking lot and proceeds to get out of his car and challenge me to a fight. My intention was only to figure out what this message was about and go on about my day, no harm on my end was intended and he he goes boasting his way into his own fight that he started. We exchanged words yet again and he starts trying to push me around, and AGAIN...I try to walk away because I'm young with a clean record and I'm not trying to catch a case. He then attempts to push me from behind and throws a swing at me and misses. From then, we fight for around 20-30 seconds. He gets two hits on me out of the whole array of jabs and hooks he's attempted in which I dodge. I try to seize the situation as quick as possible and just give him a few jabs to the face, I catch him one good time right in between his eyes and decided to walk away again because I didn't want to seriously hurt him and get arrested due to people starting to catch on. Turns out he broke his hand, had both lips busted and a black eye while I came off with minor swelling on my cheek and chin. 



   Since then he has been lying to everyone saying he knocked me out for 15 seconds, told me to get up TWICE and I headbutted him lol. Turns out he's been able leave voice messages on my phone and has been delusional about the fight between me and him. He has moved in one of his boxers to train and evidently has made it known that he is going to send his boxer out to get me lol. He has also made threats to me and my girlfriend(who witnessed the fight) that he or his boxer will ""do something"" to me and get someone to fight my girlfriend lol. I am being the bigger person and walking away from this as it will only lead to either me or him getting seriously hurt or a criminal record for me. I have my head elsewhere planning to go back to college for acting.

770,"As the title says.. I just broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months (last night). I’m pretty sad and upset as most people would be after a breakup. This has been the first girlfriend I’ve had that I’ve really felt in love with and actually felt like I’ve had a true connection with; she felt the same way. 

We broke up not due to any specific argument or thing that one of us did to make things have to end; but recently there was some personal stuff I had been struggling with and that was causing a bit of a problem in our relationship. Basic stuff that everyone struggles with but a bit extra for me (negativity, low self confidence and insecurity, jealousy, super small things upset me, I would obsess over my thoughts and feelings and have a very difficult time letting them go) so some emotional problems that were getting in the way. These things were affecting her happiness and my mental health and so we figured it had to end at least for now. Both of us still have feelings and still love each other but these problems were getting in the way of her happiness in the relationship and my mental and emotional health and stability.

 Our relationship ended (although it was extremely sad for both of us) on the best possible terms that I could have hoped for. We are staying as close friends and we both have some things we need to figure out on our own.. I especially need to learn to love myself and sort out some insecurities, feelings, and other stuff.. 

She broke up with me because she felt like some of my personal problems were getting in the way of her happiness in the relationship. It was mutual to an extent. We both didn’t want to break up with each other (and we both still have feelings and are having a hard time with the breakup) but we both felt like it was needed for each other to grow personally and by ourselves. I feel like I need to learn to accept and love myself more. I think the break is needed but my emotions tell me I want her back. I think if there is a break and I got the help I needed, then we could get back together and things might be OK.

I am going to get help with this stuff from a professional but I can’t help but wanting to still be with her, or hope that things can continue later in our lives. Anything could happen right? But I’m not sure if it’s realistic or any good for either of us. We both felt like we fit pretty well, but that the timing was just off and maybe we weren’t ready yet. Of course nothing would happen between us before we sorted out our personal lives by ourselves but if that happens and we both get better and grow as individuals is that maybe a possibility? Do you guys think it would be OK for that to happen? How should I cope with these feelings and the breakup? Any advice for really anything would be appreciated but those are some of the questions I find myself asking. 



Thanks in advance :)

771,"I currently have no real career path in mind. I got my bachelors in Marketing a couple years ago and have been working in sales ever since. I don’t love it. I’m still very young and don’t want to blink and see the next 30 years of my life fly by in a dead end job. 

I currently have the chance to further my education for free. I’m in the USA so that’s a big deal. My only question is what should I study? 

Marketing is a broad degree (like an MBA) and I feel like that doesn’t really help my situation any. I have no idea what I want to do with my life! I don’t have any real skills or talents either, but I’m a quick learner, good student, and hard worker. I’m hoping to find some sort of degree that’s pretty specific and will guide me to a career. 

I’d like to stay in some sort of business field as that’s the broad spectrum of experience I have. I love creative problem solving and team collaboration. I thrive when I have projects to work on and things to manage. 

So help me out guys. What degree should I go for?",18Jul2019,1

 so my plan is after I'm done school and have all the licenses I'll go to the ""big city"" auctions and buys cars for cheap, bring them back to my city and sell them using the internet after they're in good working condition and all polished up. My end goal is to have a small used car dealership going in a few years when I know more about how the whole process works.

775,"I 18M just graduated high school and became good friends with a girl 17F, i've known her since middle school but we got really close just about 2 months ago. There is no romance in our relationship, we're just good friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Her and her roommate 19F, a mutual friend, are attending a 4 year university 2 hours away from my hometown and they invited me to move in with them and attend a community college and then transfer to their university in 2 years. I'm certain I will get accepted in if I do decide to transfer in.

&amp;#x200B;

My original plan was to attend a community college in my hometown and transfer out in 2 years, living with my parents rent-free while working a job to make money.

&amp;#x200B;

My original college is offering me 7.5k in financial aid and the distant college is offering me 1.5k, however it isn't an issue as classes are only around a couple hundred. I was going to pocket the money and add it to my savings (currently at 3.5k)

&amp;#x200B;

If i move in with them, rent would be $450 a month which isn't that much with a part time job, however my main issue is walking away from my stable plan to move in with them and attend a community college.

My life in my hometown is getting a little stale and annoying as I hate my current job, I don't like living with my family as it's noisy and all-around bad vibes, and all my friends are moving out for college as well.

I have 2 best friends 1 of which is a girl that I like.
All 3 of us have a very close relationship and we are inseparable.

So this girl from my school, we have been best friends for about 1 or 2 along with our other best friend who plays a important role in this story. So I have had a major crush on her since we met but I didn't tell her this because I didn't want to ruin a good thing (if it ain't broke don't fix it) so I kept those feeling to myself and moved on with life but they never left me to this day, I recently found out that she has feelings for me too but does not want to tell me until she was ready (of course my other best friend let it slip) so I let her do her thing and waited until she decided the time was right but she never did tell me. I assumed she needed more time so I asked my best friend who then told me that he told her that I knew she liked me (of course he let it slip) so conversations were a little weird since then but we are back to our normal playful conversations. But today I found out by no other than my best friend that she does not want a relationship now because she wants to focas on her personal goals (which I understand) but she still flirting with me and I really like her. My best friend told me that he spoke to her again and she said that if I asked her out she would say yes, but I don't want her to feel forced. She has goals and I don't want to put those on hold.

Please tell me what to do.
She wants to wait for a relationship to achieve her goals but also said she would say yes if I asked her out right now.",18Jul2019,0

779,"Note: I am typing this on my phone so please bear with me.

Last Sunday I (F, 15) came out to my family, which consisted of my mum, dad, sister, aunt and cousin, as gay. I did not plan to come out that day but my family were having a really positive talk about LGBTQ+ rights, so I felt safe and like it was the right moment for me to come out. I told everyone that I had something to tell them, waited until everyone was silent and came out of the closet. I cried a bit and was met with lots of hugs and love from my family, so I was happy and glad at the time that I finally told them.

However, a few days later my mum was driving me to the station and she told me, completely out of the blue, that I should have given her and my dad the respect and honour to come out to them first. She also said that by coming out to my family altogether and not to them separately I had really hurt them and that as I had previously come out to them as bi a few years before via text, why it was such a big deal to come out this time around as gay.

I thought it would all blow over, like I thought that was her trying to wrap her head about the big news I told her, but I had another lecture by both of my parents today. Apparently my dad was having a conversation with my aunt while I was coming out, I didn’t realise this and I thought that everyone was listening to me when I came out, so now my dad believes that I don’t care about him. They said that me coming out was a very personal thing to them, which I agree, it is, and that it wasn’t fair that the rest of my family had to see their response and reaction. But it was ME coming out, not them. And again, they said that they didn’t understand why I cried and they seem to think that I value my aunt and cousin over them.

I’m now very unhappy and I wish I had never come out. They now won’t let me have girls around for the night unless there is another person sleeping over.

I don’t understand why if my parents think that coming out is such a small thing, then why do they care so much about they way I tell them about it? Why should I have to personalise coming out in the way that they want it? How was I supposed to know that I had to come out the way they wanted it?

I don’t know what to do. I need my parents to understand why coming out was such a massive thing for me, and why the way I come out is for me to decide and not for them. I don’t know how to convey this to my parents? A letter or should I just straight up tell them?

However, the fact that when he got back he didn't seem THAT distressed, didn't want to report it to the police, didn't seem to ring banks to cancel cards and then had the same exact wallet a week later because ""amazon sent 2 by accident when \[he\] ordered it"" doesn't add up.

783,"So Im a recent college grad living back home for the summer. I have a group of old high school friends that I feel like I have grown out of and am considering moving on.

This group and I have been pretty tight throughout high school and college, but its been rocky between us for a while. They have beliefs that I disagree with and say very ignorant things that I think are mean-hearted and just flat out wrong. (Im talking racism, misogyny, saying horrible things behind peoples back, etc.) 

They’ve treated me shitty in the past and I’ve considered them to be bullies for a while now. I’ve also come to notice they turn me into a bully sometimes because of the mob mentality and its not good for me.

I’m definitely the odd one out on a lot of things because I mostly try to call them out on their bs, but they always find a way to turn it back around on me. Whenever I call them out for saying something creepy or wrong they’ll just call me sensitive and say I can’t take a joke, call me defensive, etc.

However, me and this group have been through a lot, and they have remained my core group of friends for the last 5-6ish years. Even though we have our differences, I still in all honesty have fun with them when we hang out most of the time. However the bad stuff weighs on me a lot, and Im starting to think its outweighing the positives. 

As a recent college grad who is trying to work on himself and improve his opportunities for success, I think its time to move on. The only thing is that I’m afraid to take the leap, since they are my only real group of friends currently and I would have virtually no social life if I were to abandon them.

785,"So right now I’m on a break from studies (I’m changing my career, long story) and my mom has been asking me sometimes to pick up my niece and nephew from school. So as I’m super free from any other stuff (not working neither) I go very often and take care of them until their parents come from work to pick them up at my place. (It’s literally a few blocks from their school, my brother’s family also lives a block away from my place). 

Anyhow, so one day crossing the street to pick up my niece there was this old guy very friendly that say hi and I said it back. Then he was making some small talk as we were walking to the same place apparently and then he told me he was picking up his grandson. 

I’m usually a very shy person so this kind of conversations end up being an interview if the other person continues.... 
then we get to the school, my niece comes to me and as we leave I say goodbye and nice to meet you, and he’s very excited and calls me friend and asks me for my number. I pretend I didn’t hear as my niece is talking to me and he comes up again and insists for my number. 
I panicked so I gave it to him and then he gives me his. And he said what time he could call me or text me and I said that I was free during the afternoons. We left, all good. I tried not to think about it.
I thought maybe this sir wanted a friend, maybe he’s very lonely? And that’s okay, I can be his friend and chat with him.

But everyday, since that day he’s been texting non stop. From the morning with a “good morning friend, hope your having a great day, hugs” to the afternoon asking me if he can call me. 
Sometimes I reply when it’s merely chat conversation like “how are you” and such but I don’t know, he’s making me nervous. 

I have to add that I’m not very comfortable with talking on the phone unless it’s specific people (like my parents and a few close friends).
And lately he’s been calling and I have to keep my phone in Do Not Disturb or however it’s called.

So I’m lost. I wouldn’t mind being his friend if that’s what he wants but I’m not comfortable with talking anything personal with him, or talking on the phone. And now I’ve been rejecting picking up my niece because I don’t want to see him now. 

I don’t even know how to ask this, but what should I do?",18Jul2019,3
786,"I’m an upcoming freshman and I recently made the JV cheer team at my high school. Practice started this week and I feel like I’m doing great and having fun. I also take privates (one on one time between an athlete and a coach) at two separate cheer gyms. Lately at one I am working on a very hard skill for the past few months. Just recently my coach told me I need to put in the work at home like doing standing flips in the grass and backhand springs to build up my stamina and improve my technique. At the other one cheer gym where I take privates at they don’t have a team, they specialize in group classes and one on one practicing. Just recently they decided to make a team and wanted me to be on it. I joined and so now I’m on two different teams. My mom scheduled for my privates at the two separate gyms to be on the same day as my JV cheer practice. Obviously, I was pissed at her scheduling ability because the private and practice are hours apart and my whole day is wasted. So this past week I have had to work on cheer for up to 4 hours every day and my body feels terrible. I just had a practice today and then went to a private feeling horrible. I then perform terribly and I feel like crying my eyes out and just dying. I feel like everything in my life should be coming together and opening new doors to opportunities I’ve never had before but it’s like everything is falling apart. As mentioned before my coach told me to work on my flips and backhand springs at home and I haven’t because I’ve had to much going on every day this week. And since I performed so bad today at my private my mom was very disappointed in me. I was then crying in the car saying I just want to improve on this skill that I’ve been working on for MONTHS yet I still don’t have it and I feel like a failure. She then tells me that it’s my fault I don’t have it yet because I’m not working on things at home (even though I’m working at privates and practices 4 hours per day) and that she’s going to discontinue my privates at the gym. I really like my coach and I would be devastated if she actually did. My mom usually caves when it comes to most things but she sounded dead serious. My knees hurt so bad whenever I tumble or walk and I just feel like my skills that I have rock solid are falling apart and that I’m only going downhill from here. I know this sounds like basic white girl cheerleader problems but I’ve never had something like this before that’s hurting my body and emotions this much. I only have a few friends that I’m very close with but I’m that one person in the group that’s always joking and is always there for my friends no matter what yet I feel like I can’t even talk to them about anything.

789,"I have been studying in France for about a year, but I have been struggling and I am thinking about moving back home to the US. My school is my dream school and I have enjoyed my school experience so far, but my life outside of school is not great and causes me a lot of anxiety and depression. At first I was hoping that it was just culture shock and I would adjust, but I have been here almost a year and it has been the same, if not worse in some ways. At home, I would normally just go see a counselor, but here that is not covered by my insurance and I don't have the money to pay out of pocket. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worst, I have NO IDEA how I'm going to pay for my studies going forward. My tuition is MUCH cheaper than fashion design schools in the United States, but I have to pay all 14000 euros completely out of pocket (I can't get financial aid/student loans and scholarships are VERY limited) so it is quite difficult.  I applied for a scholarship through my school, but my application was rejected as scholarships are reserved for students from the European Union only. Finding a job is nearly impossible, as my school day goes from 9 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday and it's hard to find a job that will hire someone who is not 100% fluent in French AND can only work weekends/late nights. Right now my dad has taken out loans to help me and my grandparents have paid quite a bit of my tuition as well, but I still have two more years to pay for and no guaranteed way to pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do come back home, my plan is to work and save some money, then to apply to schools and go from there. It will be more expensive in the end, but I can at least get scholarships, student loans, do a work study program, get a job, etc. However, I don't want to disappoint my family who have worked so hard to make it so I could come to France in the first place. I also don't want to feel like I have lost because I couldn't just tough it out and get my degree and I fear I will regret coming back home. At the same time, I miss my family and friends so much and I feel I would more easily be able to go to counseling and get my shit together back home. I am very conflicted and would love some objective advice about whether I should just tough it out and get my degree or come back home.

I wouldn't think much of this if this hadn't been a consistent pattern with this person, who seems to sow the seeds of chaos and drama within my group of friends. 

Most of the drama surrounds her initially say she ""probably wouldn't stay"" at an Airbnb the eve of my birthday, but would be joining us for for dinner and drinks before hand. When the planner didn't include her in the thread of plans and prices per person for the Airbnb she acted as though she was purposefully being excluded, and decided she may no longer be joining us at all bc she conveniently has other plans now. When I ask her directly if she's coming because I need an exact head count, I get another vague wishy washy answer, and it seems she enjoys making people guess as to whether or not she wants to celebrate with me.

Finally, she's determined to bring a cake with only our friend's name to the SHARED birthday bash for me and another friend, which seems pretty rude and bizarre?  

I'm just looking for advice about how to deal with this difficult  person face to face, because before she was involved I was excited, but now I feel I have to cater to her feelings on MY birthday and that somehow I will be the asshole for wanting an evening to focus on just my birthday.

793,"Hi Reddit. I've always had these intrusive thoughts, but figured they were normal to have. I read quite a bit about OCD and got freaked out, because of how many of the symptoms I could relate to.
I'm a 16 year old guy and would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me more insigt, cause I am quite confused. I feel like these thoughts could also just be hormones messing with me, which puts me in even more doubt. Also, I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to ask for this kind of advice. 

These intrusive thougts happen to me through out my daily life, and most of them include:
- Violent stuff happening to my friends/family
- Doing sexual stuff to family members
- Doing harmful stuff to myself, like stabbing myself with the knife in my hand, or jumping off the balcony I'm standing on
Let me clarify that all of these thoughts really disgust me and that I would never follow through with any of them. I don't even wanna have these thoughts..
These kind of thoughts happen almost daily, and its kind of getting in the way of my life. Say I'm hiking with my family, I'll worry that something dangerous and violent will happen to them, then force myself to choose which family member it should happen to and then play it all out in my head, in detail.

Another thing that happens is, whenever I'm playing out a scenario in my head, weird and potentially violent stuff starts happening.. Its hard to describe, so I'll give you an example:
Let's say I'm playing out the fantasy of me kissing my crush. All is going well, when my brain suddenly decides that she should start doing weird shit like biting me or hitting me, even though all I want is to imagine what it's like kissing her.

I read about different kind of OCD's, and I could relate to multiple of them, some more than others. These are:
Harm OCD: I feel like I'm going to harm myself, with sharp objects
Sexual orientation OCD: I feel this one the most. For some reason I can't get it out of my head that I'm gay, even though I'm definiatly 100% straight. I keep picturing my male friends in sexual scenarios, watching gay porn and whenever I see an attractive guy, I suddenly think I'm gay for recognising his attractiveness, which makes me force myself to look at attractive women to confirm my heterosexuality.
Suicidal OCD: Again, I imagine stabbing myself with a knife, jumping off my balcony or taking too many painkillers, often.
I can also relate to Relationship OCD and Existential OCD, though I feel like these are less extreme (for me) and more common for ""normal people"".

Again, I'm pretty lost right now if this is all just normal humane stuff, or if it's a mental disablity. Any help is greatly appreciated.

And just to clarify:
- I'm not homosexual
- I'm not suicidal
- I'm not a violent person

Edit: Adding more OCD symptoms I have
- Whenever I go to bed I have to pee. If I don't pee, I'll just lie in bed thinking about having to pee, until I actually do have to pee
- I worry a lot. If my parents are going out at night, I'll worry about them getting murdered randomly on the way home

OCD symptoms I lack:
- I've never had that ""I have to switch the light swtich 5 times when entering the room
- I'm not overly clean. Yeah, I do wash my hands more often than most, but not even close what the memes on this subreddit suggest",18Jul2019,1

I'll be honest, there's a blatantly selfish side of me here bothered about this because I'm fairly certain his weight causes issues with erectile dysfunction, also he's very good with his hands so arthritis is an issue with that too. He's not great at taking care of himself looks-wise either, his hygiene is fine but he doesn't dress well and sometimes I feel a bit silly as even in my day to day clothes I often feel overdressed with him - I like him for him, but sometimes you want the person you're with to make a little bit of effort. 

I like him, I don't want to change him...but, well, he needs to change or he's going to end up having a heart attack or developing diabetes. 

I can't help but think that something is making him kind of give up, I'm trying not to fall into the trap of wanting to fix him but I want to try to encourage him to take better care of himself. I'll care for him no matter, but am I being selfish?",18Jul2019,1
798,"Hi everyone, I (M26) created a throwaway account (even though I really like the name Reddit suggested) and need life advice. Some of the provided information is kept vague intentionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

* Career keeps stagnating by denying me a promotion, but is the only place in the state for my specialized employment.
   * Supervisor (M65) is about to retire, and likely does not care about my progression.
   * Resume is stalling by being at my current company.
* My ex (F25, dated 2.5 years) is engaged after we've been separated 6 months. 
   * I don't want this to be a motivator to move away.
* I really like being near friends and family. Also, I've found this one lady I want to start dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Details:

&amp;#x200B;

**Career Stagnation**

Most importantly, my career is based upon on-the-job-experience. My department supervisor does not task me with projects, so I have to find my own work. This has been awful for my resume. Additionally, my company is the only location in the state that I can work.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 3 annual reviews I have been told that, even though I have the appropriate amount of time with the company &amp; exam certification/credentialing, I won't get a promotion (due to a lack of relevant projects) and to work towards it next time.  This last time, I had the potential to apply for a different spot in the company but declined to do so because I felt that I was going to get the promotion. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this last review my supervisor, who is about to retire and does not seem to care about my career progression, really just sidestepped most of my questions about the future of my career &amp; department while denying me the promotion. Since he is about to retire I feel like he does not care about his own career, *so why should he care about mine?*

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I am worried that I am limited in my current career and that the longer I stay with this company, the tougher it becomes to find new employment due to my neglected resume. 

&amp;#x200B;

**General Relationships**

My ex (F25, had dated about 2.5 years) and I broke up about 6 months ago. I was doing the whole ""ExNoContact"" thing, until a buddy told me that she is already engaged to a guy I had worried about during our relationship. I'm guessing that she was likely cheating, but I bring this up because I was given advice not to move because of an ex or based on relationship status. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have lots of friends and family that live in my state, and I really enjoy hanging out with them. I don't want to have to move and start over by building up new connections, but am afraid that I need to in order to keep progressing in my field and to keep employment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I have found this new lady who I am about to start dating that seems to click very will with me. For some reason I feel like it is difficult to find women who are career focused (like myself) and who are single, near my age. Should I stop dating her and focus on a move?

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Info:**

* Money is not a significant issue, I have been saving up with the goal of owning a house without a mortgage.
* Recently failed one of my certifications, worried if that is impacting my decision making.
* Most all of my friends &amp; family live in my current state. 
* My career has lots of opportunities in bigger cities, so another move likely would not happen due to larger availability. 
   * This career is also in high demand, just not for my state.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice needed: 

* Should I move away? 
* Should I stop dating &amp; hanging out with friends if I do need to move away for my career?
* Can anybody outside my life give me any perspective that I may be biased on not seeing?

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate anybody who will provide advice, 

Thank you",18Jul2019,1
799,"I’m 18(f) dating a 22(m). We started dating and soon as we met , and ended up breaking up a few months later due to him not being over his ex. Well. We continued to hand out and ect and are now going pretty steady again. It’s been 7 months since our breakup. He recently started a new Instagram for body building, and is following the ex that he wasn’t over back in January. The more I think about it. The more it deeply bothers me. I don’t want to act immature , and if I’m being possessive or childish by feeling jealous by this I don’t want to say anything to him about it &amp; get over it. I feel like since she’s the reason we broke up last time, it’s understandable I’m uncomfortable with her. (Side note, during the 3 moths we where dating , she texted him daily even though he didn’t respond , saying crazy shit like she was hoping she would have his babies and is so that that’s not going to happen) 

Got off topic but. If your S/O was following an ex on social media they still had feelings for when you two first got together , would you say anything ? If so, what? Thank you so much for any comments",18Jul2019,1
800,"I (28F) have struggled with social anxiety my entire life. 

It probably started when I moved to the US and struggled to learn English (my parents speak a different language at home, so learning English was slower for me). I remember when I was in 1st grade, we each had to read a book of our choice to the class out loud during story-time. I remember being terrified while stumbling in English when it was my turn. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been terrified of public speaking, talking out loud when called on in class, or really having any kind of attention on me by a group of people at once. I’m better in social situations; talking to a random person on the bus isn’t a problem, and talking to people I know at church, friends over dinner, or my peers in class is fine. 

It’s only really in an academic or work setting where having the attention of many is nerve-wracking. I feel a lot of pressure to be perfect or say the right answer when called upon. Even anticipating speaking up in class causes me to get heart palpitations, feel nauseated and hot. When it’s finally my turn to speak, I start shaking, causing those around me to avert their eyes (presumably because they can sense my anxiety and terror).

I’m now in training to be a doctor, and in training we get called on a lot, such as during conferences and lectures. We are also expected to speak up when a question is asked. The people who do speak up more also stand out more, and I feel that they are seen more favorably. My evaluations from my professors/attending doctors/supervisors thus far have been lackluster, with most people commenting on my lack of confidence. I think my quiet demeanor and inability to speak up and communicate in a more self-assured manner make me appear meek, less competent and weaker than my peers. I’m worried about how this will affect my career. At the end of the day, I beat myself up a lot for not being more vocal and confident.

I’m not sure what kind of things to try - I know working on self confidence is key, but my low self esteem has been an ongoing battle for years (up to the point where I was severely depressed for several years and required medications to help pull through). But the ability to speak up and at least SEEM confident is really important for my career at the moment.

Any advice would be appreciated.",18Jul2019,1
801,"I'm a high schooler as of writing this, about to enter my senior year as a matter of fact. M grades are not the greatest, my GPA being a 2.5 unweighted and a 3. something weighted. I live with my father and his current girlfriend at her home. I don't have a good relationship with my father at all, we only exchange hellos and goodnights. Our relationship is at a point where I don't believe it could be salvaged, this equal parts both our faults. Mine being for my lack of results in school and his as he never seemed to pursue an actual sort of friendship with me. I know that's not the way to accurately describe it but it's all that comes to mind. Not only that but he let it be known that the only thing important to him is my school, leading to a situation where after I got a part time job I didn't tell him anything about it which pissed him off as I let everyone else know. I have a brother who lives in New York due to him  being conceived  with a woman my father had no intention of marrying. He spends alot of his time raising my brother over the phone rather than speaking to me. I don't know if that makes me a brat but I feel like its BS that he ignores me and pays attention to him. There is also the issue of how I'm currently living as a basic maid of the house. My father's current partner has me do chores for her daily while I live here. I am aware of how that sounds, I do not mean she is asking me occasionally take the trash and do the dishes, I mean it in the sense that if I am tired and do not wash a dish in the sink it will remain until I clean it. If I am not up at 7 to clean the kitchen, hallway, living room, bathroom, and most times my guardians room weekly as well I am insulted and harassed being called lazy, useless, a bastard, an animal,and just outright ignored. I thought it was a normal amount of cleaning to do as a chore, but my uncle and aunt have told me it is in fact not at all. I clean anyway as the name calling hurts way more. 

I did not do amazing in my 3 years of highschool and I hate how I am living now. I just want any sort of advice as to what the hell I should be doing right now. I am taking online classes to make up for my fuck ups but anything at all would help",18Jul2019,1
802,"TL;DR: I am a 25-year-old female. I am really struggling in every sphere of my life and cannot see the point in continuing to live. I have no one to talk to about my issues and wanted some advice, any advice. 


I have been struggling with depression and crippling anxiety since being diagnosed with a condition at 18. I have made several suicide attempts. I would 100% kill myself if I could do it without hurting my parents. I have been desperately trying to get therapy on the NHS for a long time but red tape, waiting lists and stupid rules have made me unsuccessful. After making a formal complaint, they are now assessing me but the waiting list will still most likely be another six months at least. I cannot afford private therapy.


As mentioned in the title, I have no close friends - just acquaintances who I exchange texts with once a month. I struggle with extreme social anxiety. I disassociate a lot and find it really hard to think of anything to say in conversations. Most people find me too awkward and shy. I am starting to make an effort to meet new people using Bumble and meetups geared at people like me.


I have never dated anyone. I am not sure that a relationship will ever be possible. First of all, I cannot even find someone who likes me as a friend. There are also a bunch of physical barriers. I was born without a vagina and would have to use dilators to create one to have sex. I have excessive body hair all over my body which is mostly too thin to use laser hair removal on but also too dense for electrolysis to be viable - I was actually refused treatment because the practitioner thought it would cost me too much money, pain and time. My head hair has also been shedding like crazy since I was 15. Thankfully I started with abnormally thick hair but now it is so thin that I think about it every 30sec. (Yes, I have been to the doctor and dermatologist about it numerous times and they either have no explanation or say it is telogen effluvium) I also cannot look in the mirror. People tell me I have body dysmorphia. I actually don't think I'm totally ugly - I think I can be pretty in certain angles with the right lighting but I hate certain things about my face and looking in the mirror has intensified my suicidal urges in the past.


I also feel a lot of cultural pressure to get married. Almost all of my older cousins are married/engaged. It is the only thing my grandmother asks me when I see her. My parents are actually cool. They’ve stopped having expectations because of what I’ve put them through and they realise that setting me up with someone would be difficult with the condition I have. The thing is deep down I really want to get married and have kids. I know you’re not supposed to admit this but I was that girl who grew up dreaming of romance and a fairytale ending. I still fantasize about having a significant other and my own family but I don’t know how it’s ever going to happen. I  have way too much work to do first and I can feel my life rushing past me.


Career-wise, I started my first job as a data analyst last September – took me a while to get here. I am a nervous wreck at work 24/7. I constantly feel completely incompetent while finding the work I am doing basic/irrelevant. I cannot see how my career is going to progress from this job as I am not learning enough – I was only at my last place for 7 months, so I cannot afford to leave for a while. I cannot see myself thriving in this profession but then again I cannot feel myself thriving in any profession.",18Jul2019,1

805,"I'm a generally anxious person. Hell, I *have* Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so I think that pretty much defines ""generally anxious""! Anyway, I can go all day with foggy thoughts, no spontaneous creativity or ideas, and a general inability to focus on anything. Then, 11pm strikes. All of a sudden a wave of calm envelopes me. The rest of the world - figuratively - is sleeping, and I feel less restrained and more able to focus on what I *want* to do, and less on what I feel I *should* be doing. The thing is, I'm conditioned to ""settle down"" at night, around 11pm, to sleep, just like most of the other people in the world - obviously there is the exception of night shift workers and those who are otherwise frequently awake throughout the night. 

My question is: should I embrace my inner night owl, and take advantage of the peaceful and creative mindset that strikes me in the late hours, or keep trying to train myself into a routine where I have this level of productivity at a more reasonable time? 

Imagine work is out of the equation, and I can freely decide what time I sleep and when I wake up. (Oh, I wish life was that simple!)",18Jul2019,1
806,"So a girl I used to see back in late 2016 popped up on my ""may know"" feed the other day and I've been feeling compelled to send her a message, but I don't know if I should.

We were seeing each other for a couple of months and she really really seemed to like me. We had a good amount of stuff in common and shared a fairly unique personality. However, it didn't really end off on a good note back then...

What had happened was that I was in a different place at that time and was focused on moving to another province. I broke things off with her and declined staying friends. Shortly before that there was a bit of an accident where I was passed out at a party and inadvertently struck her when she reached to get something out of my pocket. Although it was completely an accident I know she really didn't like that.

A while after I broke things off she sent me a message on text, this was in 2017. At the time I didn't know it was her. Around mid-year 2017 we liked each other on Tinder and I then sent her a message over Facebook but she still seemed really bitter despite her actual desires.

Idk if I'm just being desperate, especially after all this time, but I just haven't met anyone else like her that I shared so much in common with. Also, I don't know if it's selfish of me to try and get a second shot at friendship, but it's been on my mind and honestly I have felt bad about this from time to time over the last couple of years, wanting to patch it up but instead I just let her be...

807,"Hey guys, I'm in a situation that isn't the first time, and it's bothering me and keeping me awake. I live with my mom, and for the last 3 or so days she's been acting unlike herself in some ways. She mumbles, forgets things, get's angry at things she usually wouldn't, she keeps changing where objects are placed, forget's throwing out things the day before, and at night she's extremely tired to the point of falling asleep sitting up on the sofa or on the toilet.  


Tonight she's fallen asleep sitting up 3 times. I tell her to go to sleep, since she obviously can't stay awake, but she keeps saying she'll go to sleep soon, after she's gotten something to drink and watched some more TV. Then I go downstairs like 30 minutes later, and she's asleep again- and it repeats. She won't listen to me, says she wants to stay up long for once (it's almost 1am! She considers 11 being up late and is happy when she manages to stay up for that long, since she usually get's tired long before then) Yesterday she wouldn't go to bed either, she didn't fall asleep while sitting as far as I'm aware, but she was really tired. She stayed up untill 4 am.  


I care for her and want her to go to sleep instead of trying to force herself, and at the same time I'm frustrated at how and why she's acting weirdly, it's almost like a drunken state right now.  


I thought she might have taken some new meds, as that's happened before (and made her act weirdly for some days) but  when I asked her earlier in the day in a roundabout way as to not upset her, she told me she hadn't.   


Can it be tiredness causing these changed the last few days?

814,"I’ll firstly start off by saying that this is a throwaway account.

This happened awhile back when I went to the movie theater with a few of my friends.
I was going up to get a ticket to see a movie, while I told my friends to go wait for me inside cause they had already bought their tickets.

When I was in line I noticed an older man, I’m guessing he was in his mid to late 50’s,  behind me. I didn’t take much notice of him at first but then he started getting uncomfortably close behind me. I brushed it off because there was a big group of kids behind him which I was thinking maybe were pushing him a little bit forward.

Eventually when I was closer to the front of the cue, he got way too close for my comfort. He had his body pushing against mine and I could practically feel him breathing onto my neck. I decided to turn so I would be facing him at a 90 degree angle. This is when I noticed that  the kids behind him in the line were nowhere near him.

I started to get a gut feeling that something bad was going to happen. Eventually he reached his hand out to grab my ass. I just froze. I didn’t know what to do, so I didn’t do anything.
I started having a panic attack but also trying to think on what to do, until he moved his hand to reach to my penis. I was shaking at this point. After what felt like 10 minutes of this I just thought to turn forward with him behind me again which I somehow managed to do. He then pushed back up really close to me and groped my ass again. I just sat there not knowing what to do.

When i finally reached the cashier, I bought my ticket, she asked if I was okay, I’m assuming it was because I was a very pale and shaking. I just said yes and continued in. And when I met back up with my friends inside the noticed how white I was and looked a bit worried, but i just brushed it off as nothing.

A few weeks after this happened i just couldn’t stop thinking about it whatsoever. I kept on having panic attacks every time I think about it (I still do even as I type this out). I worked up the courage to tell one of who was one of my most trusted friends, but when I told her the story she laughed at me and said I’m overreacting to the entire situation. And starting saying I probably liked it ( this is because I’ve told her that im bisexual ). I tried to say that I did’t like it and that because I’m bi, it doesn’t mean that I’m attracted to every man in the world. Even when I asked her how she would feel if it happened to her, she would say that she wouldn’t like it, and so on. And she says its different for me.

I hate talking about my negative emotions, especially my sadness (so I replace it with anger). Any place to open up to others without feeling judged?

Someone said I put up emotional walls and that is why I use anger as a coping mechanism. I get abnormally angry (like meltdowns) over math, sob stories (annoyed by the story, not feeling bad for the person), and when people call me serious/rigid. I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I use logic rather than emotion and only emotion over flaws I spot logically if that makes sense. I frustrate others. I get angry at someone who I don’t even know (personal) just every night.

During 2018/19 I studied Economics at City, Uni of London. I found the first semester okay but I really fell behind during the second semester. I did not attend the tutorials and lectures as much as I should have and I fucked myself over. I did significantly better in my coursework than I did in my exams which I think says a lot.

I know what I did wrong and what mistakes I made, I know what to do to prevent that from happening again. As a result, I was offered the chance to redo the necessary components of the modules which I failed for next year. This essentially means I am taking first year again and it makes me feel like shit.

824,"This might be long but it’s very important so please read.

Someone I know regularly “exposes” people online for  comments they make on Facebook regarding racial or political beliefs that she disagrees with.

While the comments she usually “exposes” are a bit offensive/wrong, they are in no shape or form a threat to someone’s safety. 

For example, on her most recent post she posted screenshots of a woman who made a comment about how a man (who was black) should wear a belt to keep his pants up. She instantly began to bait this woman ( by calling her racist and threw other insults) to get the woman to say or appear to say something racist. 
She then took screenshots of parts of the conversation, posted them on her Facebook and Twitter, along with the woman’s personal information such as city and state of where she lives, where she works, first and last name, and a picture of the woman’s face. She made a detailed post about this woman and in her conversation about this woman she is encouraging others to send harassing messages. She also contacted this woman’s place of work to try and get the woman fired(not sure if she succeeded).

She is a published author and runs a Facebook page with a bit of a fan base so she is capable of getting someone in serious danger or trouble.

She has made posts about students in the past who challenged her views or disagreed with them. Keep in mind that she teaches a composition 1 class to freshmen college students but she regularly uses that platform to discuss black issues and discusses them but doesn’t allow students to make challenging arguments. She has reported two students for racism because of their disagreement with some of her viewpoints.

Anyways, she has never included names but I feel as though she is getting away with some very criminal and unprofessional behavior by playing the race card and only sharing her “fantasy” side of the story. 

The college only has complaint forms available to students.
I have emailed the dean about wanting to file a complaint but I never got a response back.

I have even messaged the college’s Facebook page with no luck.

826,"Ok so it's actually my boss, not my coworker. His office is next to mine and he is constantly sneezing and blowing his nose in the most disgusting manner I have ever heard in my life. EVERY 5 MINUTES! LITERALLY! I'm at my wits end. It's the most vile sound in the world to me. Loud, and you can hear every ounce of mucous coming out of his nose. I realise he can't help it. But holy frig, who blows their nose that much?! And that often!? He's so disgusting and loud. If i can hear it being beside him, then no doubt the rest of the hall can hear. And no I'm not the only one bothered by it. Two of my coworkers are grossed out by it too. Yes I probably sound like a psycho right now. But it truly bothers me. I can't help it just like he can't. It's anxiety provoking for me, and I truly can't concentrate on my work. No I can't shut my door. Apparently it's not an option. (although with the door closed I can still hear it). Noise cancelling headphones are in my future I guess.  Any suggestions on how to handle this?",18Jul2019,1

828,"I recently graduated undergrad and am taking a couple of gap years before going back to school (specifically, PA school). I wanted to find jobs in the meantime. This way, I can build experience, make some money, and add more to my resume. I managed to get hired as an MA at a small clinic, and I accepted immediately since I was worried I wouldn’t find any other place that would want to hire me. Unfortunately, the pay is low, especially considering the amount of work we have to do. I’m basically an MA AND scribe for $11/hour. (Overtime pay is only $16/hour, and we don’t get much overtime anyways.) I’ve been working there for about 2.5 months now, and when I started, they had me sign a paper that said I agreed to work for at least a full year. 

My friend was looking for an MA job too soon after I got hired, and she got hired at a bigger medical institute that pays much more ($14.50/hour normally; $23/hour for overtime). The job description sounds way easier from what I do now, according to my friend, and the environment seems friendlier. They are still hiring. I really want to switch over to this job, but I’m scared to quit (or ask to be part-time) since I haven’t even worked 3 months at my current job, and I had signed that one sheet with my agreement to stay 1 year. Should I still take the risk and ask my boss?",18Jul2019,1
829,"Hi friends!

I’m in administrative work and basically cover an area.  I’ve been in the field about ten years and I am well versed in what I do. I got an email today asking me if I would like to cover an additional area. This area is about a four hour round trip from my office, and was explained that it needs some “assistance”. I understand it to be unorganized and in need of some “hands on”. My company has brands and I am running one brand in two separate areas. This suggestion would give me an additional brand and an additional area.  There was a person hired to do this, however they turned out to be a bad hire. I am willing to do the work, and expect it to be a little consuming, especially at first. The question is do I ask for more money? If so how, why and is there a perception of an amount. The conversation I had about  taking it over was very quick and nothing was mentioned. Just looking for a little advice, anything helps....",18Jul2019,1

832,"Well, not really “broken up with”. We’re on one of those “work on ourselves” kind of breaks. 

We still love each other deeply and it was apparent in our last encounter with each other. 

Alright. Let’s do this one last time. I have been with this woman for three years. It’s my longest relationship and I’m 23. We’ve had ups and downs of course but we always managed to get through it. Recently when we broke up she cited losing the metaphorical spark and that maybe it’s her interest in women that’s causing our love to fade. 

Now, every time a break up or a difference between us occurs I’m the one to fight and get us back on track. This last time I didn’t. I took the loss of the spark as the end. Like there’s no way to recover from that but people told me that it can come back. I love her and am dedicated to finding solutions because relationships are work

I was convinced there was no way to get back the spark and with her curiosity regarding her sexuality I just thought maybe our time had come. I accepted her leaving and it sucked of course. I didn’t properly handle my feelings about it. I buried them and gave everyone a straight face as I told them it was “mutual, amicable, for the best” all of that while ignoring my true feelings about it. She expressed hers and told me she missed me and of course I did too but I was still so stubborn about the thought that maybe this is it. God I was so dumb. 

She got her answer from me straight facing her telling her that it was for the best. Why would I want her to be miserable with me? 

We’ve always had bad communication. We just are two people who don’t want our desire to be overbearing on each other or to inconvenience each other so things don’t get discussed out of fear of being overbearing. It’s not a good way to run a relationship but goddamn it there’s still love there. 

Well anyway, fast forward to a couple days ago I had a shitstorm of emotions just hit me. Plus I was drinking. My mom may have breast cancer or not, the doctors are not sure and then this whole thing. My emotions finally got out with a little heart to heart with my best friend. 

Only thing is that they came out way too hard and I lost control. I’m smothering her. I’m overwhelming her. She just learned that I still want her back and I haven’t really left her alone since. Now she wants space from me to figure things out because she’s grown a little in our time apart. 

Of course I’m happy for her but I just want to be with her during her growth. 

I understand why she doesn’t want that. We just fall into a repetitive groove when we’re together. We watch Always Sunny in Philadelphia on shuffle, eat, drink and just enjoy each other’s company. She doesn’t have many friends and neither do I. We just work and work. 

She wants time apart to grow. It’ll be good for me too I suppose. I just freak out with the uncertainty of it all. I’ve never been more certain about anything than I have been about her (excluding when I foolishly let her go)

But it’s not all bad. She said she wants to see Lion King soon with me. She’s taking me to dinner in a month for my birthday at Disneyland since we have passes. She told me she’d be there waiting for me at the end of this but just needs space. 

This is where the advice part comes in. 

How can I distract myself while we’re on this break? How can I work on myself and this anxiety/fear of uncertainty? 

It’s why I came at her aggressively after I realized she’s what I wanted. 

Also thanks for reading, friend.",18Jul2019,1
833,"Fall 2018 I started a 4 year BSN program in Boston. A very competitive one. I was so thankful to have been accepted nonetheless given a great merit scholarship.   I thought I would do great, but boy was I wrong. Life got in the way of my studies multiple times last year and I struggled in my courses. 3 people near and dear to me had major health complications and I became extremely depressed and anxious.

This particular nursing school has very strict rules, 2 strikes and you’re out. If you get one grade lower than a B-, you’re placed on academic probation. If you get a second grade lower than a B-, you are dismissed from the nursing program entirely. Well, I got 3 cs last year, one first semester and two second semester.

I cried for days after receiving my grades. Around mid-May came an email from my college alerting me of my dismissal.

I haven’t told a soul about my dismissal, I’m so embarrassed about it. I lied to my parents telling them that nursing is just not for me and that I wanted to transfer schools. I’ve been accepted to another school and will be attending in the fall, but obviously not for nursing as nursing is so competitive in MA, and I’ll never get in another program.

Two months later I’m still so damn depressed, I’ve wasted my whole summer thinking about this. Thinking about how I could have studied longer,  how I could have made more of an effort. I’m sad that I have to leave all my friends and start over. That I’ll never be the nurse that I wanted to be. 

How can I move on and be successful at my next school?",18Jul2019,2
834,"The situation is exactly like the title states. I’m 16, and I’ve saved up enough money through various side jobs to buy my own car. It won’t be a fancy new car, just a $3000-5000 used one that should last me a while.

My parents refuse to let me get a car and don’t explain why. They just say I’m 16 and shouldn’t be driving, period, no questions asked. This would be fine and all but they’re not able to drive me anywhere due to their work schedules. I have to literally beg them days ahead of time to go anywhere, and even then it devolves into them screaming at me that they have jobs and things to do and can’t make time. I do need to drive too, I have stuff to do, friends to meet, etc. I understand but then how do I convince them to let me get a drivers permit?

835,"So I just got home from being at the cinema with my ex? So me and her have had contact for 2 years on and off and only started to get romantic a couple of days ago.

837,"i’m going into my 4th year of college so i’m kinda freaking out (i already know i have to stay for a 5th). i wasn’t able to pass a class that i took 3 times as a requirement for my current major (sociology) so i have to find a new one. 

i’m going back and forth between anthropology and ethnic studies, since my minor is chicano studies. i love learning about chicano studies and all my ethnic studies classes have been so interesting to me. unfortunately, there aren’t really any jobs in ethnic studies unless you go to grad school and at this rate, it doesn’t look like i’d be able to get in. anthropology seems like the safer option, career wise, but it just seems so boring. idk what to do, i don’t want to ruin my life by choosing to major in ethnic studies and then i can’t get a job 
should i just pursue an anthropology degree just to be safe? all my friends say to choose ethnic studies since i love it but it doesn’t seem like a smart idea",18Jul2019,1
838,"I am a fairly naive individual. At least, I think so.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of it might be that I'm young but I am also an autistic with psychosis that has trouble finding friends and getting to talk to people.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't go through life the way most people go through it.

&amp;#x200B;

People have bullied me a lot as a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

I was taken advantage of many times, mostly by other men, and maybe one time by a girl who was also mentally ill (I think she's at another University and is a conservative student but don't care very much because she took advantage of me as a teenager).

&amp;#x200B;

I have been taken advantage of financially multiple times by other students in high school, middle school, and elementary school. I was taken advantage of sexually by one girl, went through her dumping me for a clear bullshit reason, then moved onto the next girl. I was taken advantage of multiple times emotionally by neurotypicals who clearly want to fuck with me.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I become less naive more quickly?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking about social naiveness mainly in terms of getting taken advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

But how does that realistically work?

&amp;#x200B;

My university's psychology department said they have a one on one social skills program called SSAIL that could help me with that but first I would have to work on other social skills. They evaluated me and said it was realistic for me to learn this though but should I be suspicious of that?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a state school and I know the school is a good school. This is a program for kids on the spectrum to learn social skills tailored to their own needs and personal goals but I think they said over the course of a year or nine months or maybe a little longer, once I work on a few minor social skills flaws they said I can graduate into more advanced social skills and then work on calling out people who are trying to take my money. They said they have the skills to help me do that. Apparently this is a new form of social skills training for college students on the spectrum that has been tested (according to SSAIL clinic).

&amp;#x200B;

If this training will not work, what do I do to learn not to be taken advantage of?

&amp;#x200B;

I really think naivety is an issue and its very hard for me to work on it if I am hallucinating all the time but I am on medication to control that.

839,"So I was talking to this guy on an app for sometime, say a month or so. And we were going to meet up, but never did. At some point we were having great conversations and then it kinda went downhill. What I mean by that is, I started taking the initiative to text him first and it kinda felt like he wasn’t as interested anymore. Additionally, I’m not sure if this is a contributing factor but he’s never seen a picture of me cause I wanted to show face when we met up (if we ever met up). I wanted to test out the waters and see if the no face thing would be fun. I thought about him again cause I recently went back on the app and saw his profile. So the question is should I shoot him at text cause I don’t have anything to lose, or should I just let it be and move on?",18Jul2019,1
840,"My mother owns SO much clothing. She shares a closet with my father, and (without exaggeration) the closet is 90% her clothes and 10% his. MY closet is 70% hers and 30% mine and my brother's is 50/50. She had laundry baskets of her clothes on her floor, a stand-alone rack full of her stuff and our laundry room is covered in clothes. 

Anytime we bring up the fact that she owns so much, she gets PISSED. She thinks it's a personal attack or something. She tells me my room is messy (which it very much is ngl) bc I have so much stuff, but my belongings are confined in my own room and nobody else's space. I have a toy chest of the family's board games and a dresser full of books and stuff that isn't mine in my room, and I still keep my stuff contained. She calls me a hoarder sometimes, which I find ridiculous and I'm sure you know why. My Grandma was an actual hoarder and mom hated it.

Our house is an absolute disaster and no matter how much she cleans, there is always clutter in sight since it has nowhere else to go. Our storage room is full of board games, party things and nonsense. I frequently suggest that purging the house of what we don't need will keep it clean for much longer, but she once again gets mad. I feel trapped in my house, but heaven forbid we speak about it she gets so angry. She said she donated a lot of clothes, but it hasn't put a dent in the general mess. Thankfully she's quitting her job that requires her buy clothing for her uniform every month.
