0,"Ok so first a little background, sorry about formatting I’m on mobile. 
I’m about to finish my associates and I want to transfer to get my bachelors in archaeology so it’s time for me to start applying to to universities. I’m really interested in world history particularly ancient European history and the classics, and my dream is to be able to visit places where the history I’m studying actually happened. I currently live in America but I’ve always envisioned myself moving internationally eventually. 
My current dilemma is I’m terrified of leaving my friends and family and ending up isolated in my new home. I struggle a lot socially; I only have a handful of friends in my hometown that I’ve had for years and I almost never make new ones. In the past few years I’ve also struggled a lot with my mental health which gets worse when I feel lonely or disconnected from the people around me. It would take 3-4 years to get my degree so I could possibly be alone for that long with the exception of the occasional holiday. 
So I guess what I’m asking is do you think I should take the risk and move, or maybe wait until I go for my masters? If you’ve done something similar, was it worth it? Do you have any tips for making connections when you’re alone in a new city?",25Jan2019,1
1,"I've always been a late night sleeper, but things got worse more than a months ago. Winter break started which also meant last few weeks to study before my final exams in January. Since I'm not a morning person, I would wake up at 1 pm and sleep at like 3 am. I got This habit for a solid month. 

When the week of my exams came up, I was really stressed so obviously sleeping early was even more difficult. I would go to university with only 2-3 hours of sleep in me. This was last week.

Regular classes began this week, and it's the same. No matter if my classes begin at 8 am or in the afternoon, I can't sleep before 2 am. Tomorrow, I have a class at 8 am. So I went to bed at 11pm, which didn't seem so bad. During vacations I sleep 10 hours per night, but when I have to wake up 8 or 9 hours will do. Now it's 1 am and I've been turning over and over in my bed cause I can't sleep at all.

I've browsed all kind of social media which is a bad idea but I know that if I don't spend 30 minutes on Reddit to try to think of something else, I'll over think stuff of my everyday life since I'm a stressed person and I won't be able to sleep anyway. Sometimes, when I really need to I take a sleeping pill but I try not to do it a lot so that I won't grow a dependence. 

I only have 6 hours left to sleep, and that being if I succeed falling asleep in the next few minutes. It's so infuriating that I went to bed 2 hours ago and I'm still not able to sleep. I could have used that time for other stuff, but I know I wouldn't be able to fall asleep 5 minutes after going to bed anyway. 

I don't know what to do anymore, any piece of advice is welcomed",25Jan2019,1
2,"First off, I apologize for my lack of structure in this post, I am just so lost at the moment and had to get something down. 

A little background on me - I am 21 year old female with history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder, AKA I’m just a whole bunch of fun. I have been working with toddlers and teens with ASD for about 2 years now. It is a very high stress job revolving around playing with kids and dealing with their bad behavior (i.e. hitting, tantrums, biting) while simultaneously working with parents and running a very specific program with them. I didn’t go to school for this, but due to my history in volunteering in high school - I was able to get this pretty incredible job with no degree. I had attempted college for about a year and half, but I continuously kept dropping out and I just needed to find something to do. So, that’s how I ended up where I am now. 

About 5 months ago, I started to get really burnt out with my job. I work split shifts, so I will be going from place to place from 8 or 9 until 6 but only get paid for 6 of the hours. This alone can drive anyone crazy, but I have come to accept as best as I can. What really attributed to me getting burnt out was the fact that kids, let alone kids with ASD take a lot out of you. I find myself getting home every night exhausted and on edge. My fiancé will greet me a little too fast and I will strike him with all the frustration of the day, ultimately taking a toll on our relationship. I work every Saturday anywhere from 3 to 6 hours smack dab in the middle of the day, so social life is almost non-existent or even  time for myself. My supervisors will change my schedule without speaking with me about it. My direct supervisors always say they are available to help (and they were when I first started), but it is expected for me to just know everything now. So, with all of this, I honestly have come to resent my company. Not just the supervisors, but the kids and the families. I am constantly full of stress and anxiety thinking about my next work day, it is honestly never-ending. 

I feel I should mention that in Nov. 2017, I stopped taking my medication for my diagnosis. I know when I say this, some will say that this may be a big part in why I am feeling the way I am, but I don’t feel all that different. I hadn’t been seeing a psychiatrist for about a year and I could feel they were losing their efficacy. One I had been on for 8 years, the other I had been on for 6. My fiancé does say I am more quick to anger, but I feel that comes from staying in a job that makes me feel awful. But, I am open to hearing if others think this is something I should address.

I am now at a point that I am just ready to quit, I have my resignation letter all ready, but I cannot bring myself to do it. The biggest reason is because of the money. As I quickly mentioned, I am engaged and we are trying to save for our wedding. Alongside this, there are obviously bills and credit cards to pay off. So, if I were to quit, we would be losing about half of our income. We could stay afloat, without saving or have any extra money but overall it would be a huge hit. Don’t get me wrong, I have been applying to jobs rigorously the last few months with a few interviews, but most of my work experience is with kids and I cannot even think about working with kids again at the moment. My fiancé has seen me just start to give up altogether and says he supports me with the decision to quit, but is that the right thing to do?

To make matters worse, in the past two weeks, my physical health is starting to be effected (affected?) too. I have had persistent dizziness, loss of balance, complete loss of memory in the middle of whatever I am doing, and overall weakness. I had to miss 3 days of work and now my doctor says I am unable to drive until I get an MRI and an EEG. I have been relying on my father to get me to my kid’s houses, and there is no room for him to be late between my sessions. I had informed my supervisors about what is happening and provided the correct documentation, and all the ask is how I am going to make up the sessions I missed on those 3 days. With all this happening and all the money I am having to pay for these doctor visits and tests, I am wondering if it is due to the stress or I have something seriously wrong. 

So, I guess my main thing with all of this is: should I pursue what I think is best for my own mental and physical health and quit or should I suck it up?

3,"I am talking to this new guy, i met him in a nightclub, and we instantly hit it off, a few weeks later I went into see him and it was amazing, the bus didn’t arrive to pick me up, so I was stranded in his town for hours until my parents had to pick me up (and they hate driving). So after that my parents wouldn’t let me get the bus to see him, and I really wanted to, so I went to my sisters house and seen him 3 more times when I was there and once again, we hit it off like wildfire, each time I seen him, I went to his flat and we watched movies, which took away from any awkward silences that came along. 

My mother said that I could go into my local town to see him, if he would come on the bus to see me. I asked him, but he said he didn’t want to because my town is very small and we would end up walking around town doing nothing and if things got awkward, we couldn’t even kiss the awkwardness away, because we would be in public. 

I’m moving out of my parents home soon and I’ll be able to go see him then in my free will, but my friends keep bad mouthing him because they think, if he really wanted me, that he would come see me. But I suffer from anxiety and I can see how he could be anxious but if I really wanted to see him, I would. I get panicked a lot over this stuff and he keeps thinking it’s annoying because he’s explained to me that he likes me a lot. He’s never really online that much anymore and I’m afraid I’m pushing him away by asking so much because I don’t know what to think. 

He’s told me how much he likes me, and he would love for us to grow our bond and get closer before we’re able to be together in public without things getting awkward. I’m not too sure if he’s lieing to me because he isn’t bothered seeing me, or is he actually just shy. I’m seriously so afraid of getting hurt because I let my ex abuse me for months because I always thought that he loved me and he would change because he had me mindwashed, and I’m afraid of getting into that state again. I’m so unsure what to do, whether to carry this on or should I cut it off? I don’t know if he’s dodgy or not.


I beg for advice pleaseeee  ",25Jan2019,1
4,"Hello all. I currently work for two companies. My main job is for a nonprofit, my second job is being the administrative assistant, so to speak, for the man who gives us our free office space for the nonprofit. The boss for my second job (we will call him boss #2) is a family member of my nonprofit’s boss (we will call him boss #1)  so the free space was really just a favor to him. Hope this is all making sense so far.

Anyway, when we moved into this new office space, it also required me to relocate my apartment. I did not ask for this, but boss #2 assisted in my moving costs which included security deposit. Due to this, since I began working for him in November I have felt the need to bust my ass to make up for that debt. Although it was more of a gift, I don’t like to take handouts like that so just felt guilty and felt the need to work for it. 

Now it is to the point where I am basically attempting to do the workload of two full time jobs in a 40 hour work week. Boss #2 has brought up pay before but then never follows through with talking to me about it. Now he is hiring a part time worker to help with another aspect of his business and will be paying this person. I feel I do deserve a pay for all that I help with, but feel extremely awkward asking due to the free rent for the nonprofit and also his assistance with my move although that was two months ago. I thought of cutting back on his work, but could really use extra income right now.

So two part question I guess: One, is it appropriate to request some kind of pay even though he helped me before and also is helping the nonprofit? And two, if it is appropriate, how do I even bring that up? Money talk is always a struggle for me. 

Not looking for full time pay btw just supplemental if that makes a difference. Thanks!!",25Jan2019,1

6,"Going to try my best to keep it short. We(I'm 23M And
she's 22h) met online about 3 years ago and have been
really good friends ever since. She broke up with her ex
last November(2017) but I didn't know about it until
around may(2018). We became really close over the past
6 months or so and we knew we wanted to be more. We
started talking every single day, texting and calling
because she lives in another state at the moment and
quite far. We call for hours often, she's literally perfect to
me and she says she feels the same about me. I told her
I'm in love with her and she said the same. At this pointI
was thinking we're in a long distance relationship(I'm
ommitting a lot of details to keep it short).I was planning
on visiting her this coming summer but not for certain
because of school/job. She's been wanting me to visit for
a while now but I kept making excuses(but I really
couldn't). I feel like I've finally lost her interest. She
visited her ex a few times as friends over the past few
months, nothing unusual, knowing her. But the past 2
weeks have been different. Worth mentioning that they
only live 2hrs from one another. She visited him 2 weeks
ago and she was kind of different but I didn't pay it
much attention. Over the past week. We stopped talking
almost completely. Just maybe a casual hey here and
there, that's about it. Today I learned from our mutual
friend that she's visiting him again. My only guess is that
she's getting back together with him. It does hurt.
Maybe more than I want to admit, but I'm not stopping
her, that's her choice. What really hurts me here is the
fact that she didn't tell me about it. Why would she just
cut me off instead of explaining what's going on? We've
told each other everything over the years. It doesn't have
to be awkward. We've dealt with a lot of stuff together,
this is nothing compared. Not sure how to feel. What do
you guys suggest I do?

8,"Long story short - we broke up almost a year ago because he thought I was cheating on him. I never did, nor did I give him any reason to think that way, but he acted crazy and that was the end. After the break up, he contacted me a few times to reconcile, but only if I ""admit"" to cheating (wtf dude!?). After blocking him on messenger, he tried to get my attention by facebook activities with our mutuals, attending events he knew I will too, and trying to ""takeover"" my social life by hanging with my friends.  


Of course, as time went by, I got over him and found new love. I am happy with him and madly in love.  
But, the ex started to attend same sport group I'm in, suddenly. While together, he said that he doesn't want to train with me, because he thinks it's a mild sport, ""for pussies"". Now, he magically enrolled to it, to my group, of course. I am not so bothered by it, because as I said, I got over him. It was just irritating having to avoid someone while group workout.  
Lately, he's been seeing this girl from the group, and I see them going home together, etc. Even caught him looking over his shoulder while walking with her, to see if I am looking at him. I'm getting frustrated because some of the people there know he is my ex, even that girl should be knowing by now, I guess. I am popular there, people love me and I love them. I don't want them to ruin that. Their romance is frustrating me because, while I'm avoiding him (and got used to it), right now everything feels like a competition between her and me. I'm not a competitive person, I could be friendly with her, and I'm trying my best not to be bothered by that. But I'm feeling embarrassed all the time, because I feel like they ""won"" and are making fun of me that way (at least him, not sure about her, she doesn't have a reason to do it, except if she believes I'm scum, as he probably tried to convince her). I feel like shit inside every time, not because I want him, but because I feel like he's doing it on purpose. Changing groups isn't an option. Could somebody give me advice on how to mentally handle this?",25Jan2019,1

12,"I'm in a pretty bad situation with my graduate school at the moment. I was apparently emailed by the Registrar's office in early January about a very important meeting regarding my academic standing due to poor grades last semester. In the email, sent Jan. 5, it explained a meeting I had to attend with faculty including when + where etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I never received this email so I was notified the day of my meeting that  I missed it and I now have to apologize to the faculty for wasting their time and explain myself. I had a separate meeting today with the dean to discuss what's going on and a print out of this supposed email was shown to me on paper and this is how I became aware of this situation in the first place. I didn't even know how to reply to the dean because I thought, well if they have the print out with my name etc then I really must of been that oblivious somehow even though I had no recollection of ever seeing it.

Then I went home after class and started digging. I have a Google edu account. I've been looking for over an hour to find this email to prove I'm not going insane. I've checked trash, spam, inbox, sent, snooze etc NOTHING. I've checked the senders address, the date, and searched for several different keywords. I was reading online about how to retrieve all emails from trash but apparently since it's still within 30 days it should be on the server. If not, how can I check the server?

Not sure if this is the place to go here it goes.

I originally got into to uni to become a teacher but as the years have gone by and i've matured am just not sure if i would enjoy it, for one i don't really like kids or teens and getting college level jobs straight out of uni is really difficult i've heard. Also i had a terrible time in high school so working in one just seems a little bit off to me if am making sense? really i would prefer to be a freelancer or working for a media company doing audio and foley, working on stuff i want on the side but the job hunt for that has been fruitless so far. I more trying to decide if i go for the safe option or take a risk. i just kind of want to hear other people's opinions. the the only real problems is that i have an overdraft which is more than i could possibly pay off with a part time job.

19,"This is a long one I'm sorry!

A little back story about me first: My mom drank a lot for most of my life, and made me feel badly about normal kid/teenaged stuff. She would ignore me when I spoke, laugh at me when drunk, and got mad at me and blamed me for problems with her boyfriend (I didn't approve because he would come over and they would argue until 2am on school nights when my little brother was a toddler and I would have to get him to leave so both me and my brother could sleep, which pissed her off) she is sober now, and I'm proud of her, but I believe these things led me (or at least contributed to, as I was already a shy child)  have social anxiety, as I'm constantly walking on egg shells and worried about people getting mad at me and too afraid to talk to people due to my negative social experiences with my mother. 

My best friend and I have been friends for 14 years, since I was 9 years old and she was 10. I am honestly just not feeling the friendship anymore, mainly because she makes me feel like crap. I have social anxiety, and she acts like it doesn't exist. Two years ago, I moved 3 hours away. I thought that the distance would help because I wouldn't see her all the time. For a while, it did help. However, I've noticed that I don't even look forward to seeing her when we do make plans to see each other/when she comes to visit for a weekend or anything. 

In the past, even when we saw each other every week, if we went out to a place that was super crowded or something, I would get really nervous and pick up my phone.. not to ignore her or actually be on it, but because the crowds made me super uncomfortable and I would feel a panic attack coming on and I just needed to distract myself for a moment (which I've explained to her so it's not like she didn't know) and she would snap at me to get off my phone. Not even in a nice way or anything, just bluntly ""get off your phone"" with absolutely no sympathy for my situation or how I felt. She often has this attitude with anything we do. She always snaps at me to do something, rather than asking me. 

We worked together for a while, so we would carpool. One time I finished a bit late (An order for a product came in about 10 minutes before the end of our shift, so I had to prep it and get it ready for the following day to be sent out before I could go anywhere) and she got all pissy with me because she had to wait less than 10 minutes for me to be done. I told her I couldn't just leave the order and she said I didn't do anything all day so I should have had it done sooner (which makes no sense because I had no orders all day and nothing to actually do, we worked in an office and I had all my stuff done, I also can't control when orders come in so it would have been impossible for me to finish it sooner than when I did). Another time she snapped at me to sit down when she was explaining something to me when I was still new there. It made me feel like a dog being told to sit rather than a human being having something explained to them. 

There was another time we went to the movies together, and I have this fear of death that sneaks up on me sometimes, but normally I keep it to myself because I hate bothering people with my issues. Except this time it hit me hard so I mention to her that I think I am about to have a panic attack and she didn't care at all. She made it seem like there was no reason for me to be having one in the middle of the movie so why was I having it at all. (I want to clarify that because of my anxiety, I do everything in my power to never make a scene, so it's not like I was in the middle of the theatre freaking out and crying.. I was sitting there silently, heart beating a thousand miles a minute feeling trapped and helpless)  and she just didn't care. She never checked on me again, didn't ask if I needed to leave, didn't ask if I was okay, not even after the movie was over. 

Finally, the most recent thing was when she was visiting over New Years. We had spent the entire day out socializing with a friend and her boyfriend who live about half an hour away from me. We then went to do groceries and a couple of other errands. This is a lot for me in one day, but I never complained or said I didn't want to do any of it because I was feeling fine. Anyways, I forgot to get something we needed for our new years plans while in a store, as the store was crazy due to everyone doing last minute shopping and overall, just packed with people. I mention I forgot something to her as we were walking back to the car. She says I should go back in and get it, I tell her I'm feeling overwhelmed at the moment because of how busy the store was and didn't want to go back in. She says ""I'm making you go back in for it, we need it for new years"" I snap a little and say ""no, I'm not going back in. I'll grab it tomorrow before the stores close"" and she gets all pissy with me. We get in the car and I ask her why she's so mad, and she proceeds to tell me that I used my anxiety as an excuse to not go back in. I tell her I can't help that I feel overwhelmed by the amount of people in the store and that I'm not going to put myself in a situation I'm not comfortable in if I don't have to and how I can easily go back tomorrow to pick up what we forgot to get. Shes still acting angry and telling me I use my anxiety as an excuse to not do things (which is not true, I do a lot in a day, but just because it's not up to her standard of things to do in a day, I'm automatically not doing enough) so I bring up how I wouldn't force her into a tiny confined space or make her wear a scarf when I know she has claustrophobia (she does have this phobia) and she actually has the nerve to say that it's different. One is a fear of small spaces and one is a fear of social interaction. Both have the same results. 

I've had therapy, I push myself daily to go to work, go to my boyfriend's family events, make conversation with customers, do groceries and run errands despite feeling anxious about these things. She acts like I just sit at home crying all day, which I don't. In fact, I barely talk to her about my anxiety except for a handful of times, so it's not like I am constantly bugging her about it and having panic attacks in front of her every time we hang out. She makes me feel like my anxiety is not valid, and literally makes me feel like crap by getting angry the few times I have let my anixety get the best of me when I am with her. I thought for a while that maybe she was trying to push me to help me get over the anxiety but she's never offered any solutions, she has only gotten mad when I'm not acting the way she wants me to or doing what she wants. She never asks me about it, or tries to learn more about it. I'm just tired of feeling bad anytime I see her.

Am I wrong to want out of the friendship? I know we have been friends for a while but I don't think that's a good reason to stay friends with someone. 

How do I end this friendship? Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!",25Jan2019,1
20,"I used to be extremely depressed. It developed over about 5 years. It got so bad that I became anorexic. By the end, I decided to exercise a ton and eat healthy in order to lose more weight, but that actually increased my mood and helped me *recover* from depression.

For about 5 months, I was actually happy for the first time in a very very long time. I looked forward to my life, and I improved so much. I met the girl of my dreams, and I am now dating her.  In the past month or so, I started getting depressive episodes, but I definitely was not depressed 24/7 like I used to be. I started doing some of my old habits such as fasting, listening to really depressing music, staying up all night doing homework, sitting and thinking a lot, and watching really depressing YouTube videos. 

Right now, I feel in a neutral state. I'm definitely sad, but there are so many things in life that I'm thinking about. I wouldn't say I'm depressed yet, but I'm getting back to there and I'm so scared. I'm scared my girlfriend will leave me. When I become depressed, I get into a state where I try to make myself *worse.* I'm saying this now as a last-ditch effort to save myself. If I get depressed again, there's no saving me. I had 3 therapists at once at one point, and none of them ever helped. Anti-depressants don't affect me. I don't want to be a zombie doing schoolwork again. I'm starting to make friends for the first time ever, and it'll all be gone again. Honestly, I don't know if anything can help me now, but it's worth a try I guess- before I get taken over and completely change.",25Jan2019,1
21,"I am currently in an awful headspace, and I've been like this for a while. I am currently 17 years old and soon to be 18, and I feel like I wasted the past 6 years of my life ever since I started high school. I wasn't a nerdy kid per say, but I spent pretty much all my time on my computer since I moved to a new school and met up with my longtime childhood friend, who introduced me into computers and gaming. I wasn't addicted but I never wanted to do anything else, and I hate myself for it. In retrospect, I guess I kinda was addicted.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm past that, I'm in college and I feel as if I may possibly have mild depression. I never go out even though I really want to, mostly because of my friends not really being the outdoorsy type and prefer to play games. I don't mind this or dislike them in any way because of this, in fact, I'm happy with my friends and admire a lot of them for their intelligence, but I want to make more and move on to people who spend more time hanging out than staying at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Every evening I look around me and notice that I'm still in the same corner of my room, and I must have spent literal years in this single spot, and I hate that. All I think about when I'm alone is how I wish I was out with friends which I don't have or going to parties - things which when I look back at myself I wish I was doing already.

&amp;#x200B;

This post seems to be really scrambled and nonsensical so I'll try to sum up my problems. I am 17 and hate how I spend my time every day. I am in a group of friends who spend most of their time on their computers, and because I don't have any other friends, I spend the majority of my time doing the same. I would rather be out messing about with my friends however, and wish to make more outdoorsy friends but I just don't know. I feel like I'm trapped in a massive hole that I can't get out of, and constantly wish I could change the majority of my history. Sometimes I even wish I could change the world so that I was born before technology kicked off so that I wouldn't be where I am right now (before 2000). Sorry this was such a long rant, I just need some advice - that's all.",25Jan2019,1
22,"I’ll start from the beginning of when the problems started occurring. It started with my old job where I was an Account Manager for a 3rd party marketing firm that sells AT&amp;T products. It’s really just a fancy way of saying I sold direct tv and and At&amp;t internet/phones door to door. This isn’t a normal job and I’m not going to go into a crazy long explanation of how this company worked right here but basically I did it because it was my first job out of college, it payed decently, and had promise of upward mobility to me owning my own office if I put in the work.

Now I want to establish back then even before I joined this company I always wanted to own my own business, but I never knew where to start, so to have it be an option if I put in the work at this job was awesome to me at the time. I worked at this job for 1 year and 7 months and quit last August. Part of the reason being I was working easily 55+ hours a week, 5 1/2 days (includes part of Saturday) doing the following: training constantly new candidates due to high turnover at the office from 11-1pm, 1-8pm I had to be in a random neighborhood walking/ driving regardless of weather, I had to hit sales quotas every week while splitting 50% of the sale with new recruits that went to the neighborhoods with me that day regardless if they did anything, and run meetings. 

This alone wasn’t enough to stop me, but it was the fact that this job is 100% commission with no base pay. That means all the time I spent in the office or field I get nothing if I don’t sell something. I didn’t have benefits and was using my car with no gas money reimbursed. This post is already long so I’ll keep this short ultimately I wasn’t making sales enough to support myself and quit.

After I quit I was trying to find a job desperately even applying to Lowe’s at some point, had an interview and was rejected despite having more experience than any high school kid which was a blow on my confidence. This made me stop applying to any jobs for 2 months as of now. Some time later my ex girlfriend admitted for the past 6 months she was losing feelings and we wanted to make it work. Ultimately last Tuesday she said she wanted to break up. Unfriended me on me on Facebook and even blocked me on all social media.

I know for a fact she was already losing feelings for me cus when I was working I was tired every Saturday and Sunday. I didn’t want to do as much but I would force myself to take her out to eat or something cus I know she likes that despite me being tired. I personally think it’s also because I gave up on finding a job and got depressed which probably made me look undesirable in her eyes cus this went on for months. 

Before anyone says I’m lazy and get over it look at it from my point of view. I was on top of the world thinking I’m going to be this owner of a company if I worked hard, but due my shortcomings I couldn’t make sales. Despite me staying out even till 8:30pm on weekdays to try to make sales! I then quit thinking I can find a better job. “I got a bachelors in marketing and all this experience great!” Then I can’t find one decent paying job, I’m out of money now, I live at my parents house, I then get depressed cus I’m convinced I’m incompetent with no real skills and can’t do anything right. Then the one person I considered to be not only my lover but best friend who stuck with me despite me going through such a hard time for months even her patience ran out and stopped wanting to be with me. 

I feel like losing her was the last straw and I want her back so bad I can’t even describe this feeling. I can’t imagine not being with her and moving on when she was such a huge part of my life for more than 4 years. I even said in my head whenever I get a decent job I’d save up and marry her. Now I’m just here in my room as a fucking shut in whose too embarrassed to work at a crappy below $15 an hour job like working at target. Not like they’d hire me. Especially when everyone and I had such high aspirations of what I’d do now I have no idea what to do anymore. It doesn’t help all my colleagues and friends are getting better jobs, moving to new states, getting married etc. What should I do?

23,"I am in a rental with an absent landlord (when we need something, which is almost never). There is little water pressure in the kitchen so it takes ~3 min to fill up a brita jug. Having had enough, we called in a plumber to take a look. He gave us a quote online and when he saw the faucet said it would be a bit more since he has to replace something. Fine. After opening up the faucet and replacing the part, the problem is due to corroded pipes, which will be a big deal and something our landlord would never agree to (I hate landlords but that’s another story). Fine. So I pay the plumber and after he leaves realize that the low water pressure is now a trickle!

25,"Jerk in question was charming, met on a dating app and although not my type I gave him a chance, first date started with my wanting to climb out the window but somehow ended with kissing. I slept with him after the second date, soon after it felt more like a booty call - no dates, him coming to mine when he was free but I felt like I was just meant to wait around for when he wanted to see me.

He kept who he was from me at first, slowly it came out he didn't want a relationship - I did, but by this point I was so into him I tried to convince myself I could do casual. But as things went on it turned out he not only wanted to sleep with other girls but wanted me to join him in sleeping with other girls...I still stuck around, thinking I could still enjoy my time with him and if he pushed on this I'd go.

He was generally manipulative, I couldn't express my dislike for how the situation was playing out without him twisting things around - I'd go into a conversation knowing I wasn't okay with this, by the end I'd somehow have agreed with him or I'd be defending myself from him accusing me of being unfair to him in some way. My anxiety was sky-high but I blamed it on my inexperience with dating.

He went a few days with no contact and then ignored me on Valentine's Day so I ended it...two weeks later went back to him, then ended it again within two days when he went back to his old tricks messing me around.

This all happened over a year ago. He was messaging me and I was ignoring him, until six months ago he wrote a long message that sounded genuine and I stupidly replied, within five minutes he was back at it again so I chased him out and blocked him. About a month ago I matched him on a dating app, letting him in yet again, I was going to meet him but the fact he left me without messaging for a few days made me see sense so I unmatched him.

Still now I'm checking his social media, I unblocked him, I'm secretly hoping he gets in touch again, and he's currently in a city the other end of the country so part of me is worried that he may have moved there thus I'll never see him again. It's ridiculous but I've never wanted a man so much.

I'm normally so sensible, I guess it's a combination of this having been my first experience dating (after ten years off the market) and his being so charming, plus the sex was good and he was dominant...I'd gone some time without sex, and had never had a dominant partner.

I've dated two guys since him, one was a big deal, but still my kind comes back to this jerk. I hate him and I hate myself for still wanting him so much, I just don't know why I can't forget him.",25Jan2019,1

28,"So I've been living with my fiance and his family since May while we finish off paying off some debt before we get our own place. I've noticed some really off things about his parents, primarily that it's completely obvious that his dad really doesn't enjoy being around his mom and his mom is desperately trying to get the affection and attention of her husband and her son. In the 9 months I've lived here I haven't heard his dad say one nice thing to his mom. He is CONSTANTLY criticizing her, for every little thing. He tells her to shut up, he tells her she doesn't know what she's talking about when she tries to voice her opinion, he just completely tears her down and I can see how hurt she is when it happens. My fiance never says anything, he says its been like this his entire life and he just ignores it because it's not his problem. On the other hand, I'm the kind of person who feels this annoying need to fix everyone else's problems. I couldn't even stop myself tonight, it was the first time I shot back at his dad after he snipped at his mom. We just got a new oven and it was the first time she had used it, it's a double oven which no one had ever used before, and she had said that she removed a rack in order to use the whole oven instead of just a portion of it to make dinner. His dad started laying in. ""Why did you do that? Why didn't you just use the top oven? It's not too small for the pan you just did it wrong. You made it too hard for yourself to take the divider out, that's why we got a double oven so there's two parts. Next time pay attention."" Shit like that. And I just snapped. I looked a him and said, ""Well, it's a new oven and it's a force of habit to use it the same way as the old one. I'm making cookies later and I'll probably do the same thing."" And it was DEAD SILENT. His dad just got up and left the table. My fiance didn't look happy that I interjected, his mom looked like she wanted to cry. I just went upstairs. I just don't feel comfortable staying silent when I see someone being bullied right in front of me. On the same hand I don't want to jeopardize the living situation we're in right now.",25Jan2019,1

Yesterday, our auditor attended a meeting with our board to review the audit. He gave me lots of praise and said he loves doing our audit because everything is accurate, clean and there are no adjustments to be made. He said I provide high quality financial information. 

Today, I had a meeting with my boss and another manager (who is at the same level I am). I mentioned that I was pleased by the review our auditor gave me. 

My boss said, “don’t take this the wrong way....you are doing a good job and everything and yes the audit went well....but given that our auditor is a man and you’re an attractive young woman, he likely praised you more because of that. Men make more of an effort to be nicer when they’re dealing with a good looking woman sigh as yourself.”

I feel it was derogatory for him to marginalized my work and attribute part of the praise I received to my physical appearance. It also makes a lot of assumptions and notions about our auditor and his professionalism. 

What would you do? In the moment I just sort of laughed it off because it surprised me, but after I got back to my office I was floored.

Home life has been slowly improving with some family therapy that has recently come to an end, but it is far from normal. My parents have also babied me growing up, and to some extent still do. I've only realised this speaking to therapists and thinking about my life, seeing it is different than others.

I was never taught basic things. My parents would do everything for me and I usually wasn't allowed to do myself. They did very basic and inappropriate everyday tasks for me much longer than they should have. They still don't allow me to do a lot of things myself and don't want me to learn how.

I've looked at my options including moving to a youth shelter. I visted different places and such, and I don't think its worth leaving where I am now for that, I don't know what's worse to be honest. Living here is bad, living there is also bad. No matter what I do it's bad.

I think my best option is to work towards moving out as early as possible. How do I go about moving out on my own as an incompetent person who doesn't know basic life skills?

40,"     So I was talking to this girl on tinder for about two weeks and when I mentioned that I was still on the app her friend said “if I still have it downloaded then I should scram right now”. 

     (A month later) Then when things started to fall off a bit and we were talking less, her friend said “I’m not gonna let you hurt her. Tell her if you just want to be friends.” She then mentions that I shouldn’t post with 5+ girls on my social media and say nothing about it. At this point it’s still somewhat understandable. They ARE best friends after all. That being said, I have many female friends. I was closer with girls than guys in high school so hanging with them wasn’t weird for me nor did it have any dating connotations involved. It would make sense for her to care a lot though. This is when it get tricky. She then asks me to call her and she told me that said tinder girl wasn’t going to talk to me until I called her. I feel like she was implying that she told her not to talk to me until she called me.

To be clear, I think that if things fall off with someone and they don’t mention anything about it then either a conversation should be had or if it goes unsaid you let it go. 

     If I’m an asshole I’d like to know so I can change in some way or make the right decision and apologize rightfully but if I’m wrong I’m not gonna let this girls friend dictate wether or not I’m gonna have a relationship and frankly if that’s how it’s gonna be the whole time I’m hypothetically with her then I’d rather not deal with it.

41,"Hello everyone!

This is my first post on Reddit, but I think this is going to be a better forum for my conundrum that FB.

I'm a 38 yr. old divorced female. I am on disability and my children are pretty much grown. This makes it more difficult to obtain Section 8 housing bc of high demand. Yet, it's also about impossible to cover rent, utilities, etc. on my income... So I rent a room and a bathroom from a older man who is my friend, let's call him Hank for reference purposes, at a good price, as well as I do some light housework here and there as my condition allows.

I moved here in mid-Sept. Everything goes fairly well between Hank and I. His gf is just the sweetest person ever. No problems. Meals basically included. I'm on one end of the house w my own bathroom and they're on the other w theirs. 

Anyway, I meet Hank's son, (let's call him Chad), a few times when he comes through to see Hank and/or get any mail of his that may have come here. Chad is a year younger than me, which breaks my own personal Rules of Dating, bc I tend to go for older men any way. However, we have some similar tastes in music and had been able to hold a conversation with ease. He's not my type really at all, but he asked me to go eat, just to give his dad and gf some space here a little while.

Well, I went, first making it clear verbally and non-verbally, that it is NOT a date and I'll take him to lunch the next week when I get paid, (which I did and then some)... I'm taking a break from dating anyway. No problem. He says it'll be nice to have someone the same age group to hang out with, etc. 

I should mention at this point that Chad is an alcoholic... He had only been drinking one of the three or four times we had met, having just completed a rehabilitation program; he was still trying to not drink all the time then.

When he is sober he is a delightful person, but that just doesn't happen w Chad. He will pass out drunk, wake up at 2am and have a beer, &amp; go back to bed. He is arrogant and cocky. Just basically your all-around creepy, pervy, jerk. Throws temper tantrums arguing w his dad. Think a he God's Gift.

My parents were both alcoholics and died from Sepsis due to Cirrhosis. Needless to say, I'm not a big drinker... And I certainly am not looking to babysit him and watch him drink himself into the grave. I told him I'm not making him choose, bc I've seen how that goes. Alcohol is going to win every time unless a person quits for themselves, not bc they are being made to.

The other thing is he just doesn't seem to want to work, has no drive, lives w his grandmother... I mean this list is extensive. However, it is difficult to make friends in your 30's and why not?

So, I was nice at first. You know, it's not you it's me. We can be friends bc I like hanging out w you, but I'm not interested in sex or a relationship. Now he is taking advantage of my living at his father's house, by using that to be here when I say no. 

One day I wanted Chaf to go, but Hank said it was his house and he could come anytime. Fine, but I will be in my room bc he isn't here visiting me. After about a week and a half to two weeks of him ALWAYS here, (he slept here on couch for four nights until I finally lost my Sh*t and Hank said may be he better give me some space); I've tried EVERYTHING. Nice. Mean. Subtle. Direct. 

I don't have a car and he had a bs job that he only gets worked 6-12 hrs a week. So, I put gas in his car, buy oil, bought a $15 headlight, to take me places. It works well, except that the days I need to go anywhere, that's another excuse to be here butt crack of the morning and stay all day/night. 

I'm very direct that we are only friends, but he keeps asking me to be his gf. Says how we are together reminds him of how he thinks old married couples are. This man has never been in a long-term relationship, past a year or so, and they didn't live together. My second marriage was 7 yrs. long. 

No, we aren't having sex. We did once, about a week into things, before I got fed up w the constant drunken whining and belligerent arrogance. 

I get that he is partly hanging on bc I have an income, (a lot of women in my demographic in my area don't), and also because we did get intimate that once. 

I can't ghost; he pops up. Hell, he asks things and doesn't pay attention to the answer. Like not coming over. Or just being friends. It's as though he talks bc he enjoys his own voice. Even his laugh is haughty and fake af.

I don't think I am going to be able to be his friend, because I am as certain to wind up damaging his ego, (at the least), as he is to keep acting like I'm speaking a foreign language or someone hit him with a stupid stick... In other words, pretty freaking certain.

I can't really afford to move right now either.

Its very central so didnt think too much about it at the time as I was desperate to get a place, but I see now it is a bit much. I would also have to clarify with the owner that I could rent out my room even though it says I can in my contract, but I am short on time and have to make a descion quickly to get this apartment. 

I could also maybe move in where I used to live, but I wont know for a few days. The problem with that place is that even though it would cost less, the people in the building are drug users and the police have been there a few times. They are also selling the building so I dont know how long I could stay. 

Basically it is a mess of things and I just dont know what to do. Any advice would be great.

48,"TL;DR: My parents have been having yelling matches over how I should spend my summer, and they've been really manipulative. I need ways to calm them down a bit but worry I might say something wrong and make things worse.

For background: I'm turning 16 in April. I'm a pretty good student, A to B+ range with a couple APs with a particular focus on science. I'm in my school's science research program and this summer is when summer research opportunities really open up for me. 

My parents have always pushed me to do well in school and take hard classes, but don't really check in on my grades or anything like that which leaves me pretty unmotivated. I love science but I'm not really a fan of research. I know my parents would be upset if I dropped the class now since I've already done it for two years and have invested a lot of time. 

For the past month or so my parents have been pressuring me to leverage a family connection with a local lab into a pretty tough to get into summer program. Problem is, its for juniors becoming seniors, I will be a sophomore becoming a junior. I've explained this to them but they don't seem to get it. Today they gave me another option but the deadline for that one was yesterday. 

Now they're arguing over whose fault me not getting into either of these programs is. They've always flip-flopped between being really close &amp; outwardly affectionate and having nightly yelling matches, but this one has been especially bad. My mom stormed out of the house pissed off which she never does. My dad has been sending me pictures of their texts and they're pretty clearly aggravated with each other beyond anything I've seen before. I kinda have a history of foot-in-mouth when it comes to sensitive stuff like this and I'd rather not fuck it all up further than I have already. How can I diffuse the situation a little without making things worse?

49,"I hope this fits into this sub.

So, I've never been the best in school, at least imo. When I was younger I was often praised for being such a smart and intelligent kid but I often just felt like a failure. Especially socially I always failed and pushed myself to at least be good in school if nothing else but there were always people better than me. Now that I'm in university I feel more inadequate than ever before. I dont have that many people I can compare my grades with, unlike before and most of them are way better than I am. It's not like I'm failing, my grades are just meh. From time to time I notice that people I'm not friends with but that study the same subjects as I am, are indeed failing or have worse grades than me. Still, I feel ... kind of empty? Stupid? Unfit? I dont even know. I'm just always trying to tell myself that its okay to be average as long as I'll find some job that I like some day and that pays my bills.",25Jan2019,1

52,"Hey, so background. Kind of since I got out of the womb both of my parents specifically my dad (go figure) had pushed me to always be “number one” he used those exact words. As a kid all the way through high school I’ve been an honor student and people since I was young including classmates and teachers have always called me “smart”, to the point were I have come to hate the word. Because in reality I never learned anything at all, all I did was memorize &gt; get the A &gt; and throw whatever information for the test away. All I did was get good grades to have my parents off my back (and not to get depressing here but maybe have my dad feel proud of me too) because in reality what I really loved doing was drawing and to maybe one day have a job in animation. 

Now that Im an adult and have my own sense of self, with 2 begrudging parents that are accepting the fact  their kid isn’t going to be a doctor or a US senator- Im making my own slow strides to start doing what I actually wanted to do. But because I’m not a dummy I obviously have a plan B incase my art career doesn’t pan out, im thinking of double majoring in business once I transfer to uni (im in community college rn) since it’s pretty broad major. 

My problem is, ever since I’ve entered community college my grades have gone to a slow downward spiral- I no longer have a dooming father figure breathing down my neck nor this weight of expectations.  Everything is just up to me now and I think my psyche realizes that, I cant even do that whole memorize and throw away trick to save my hide. I’ve reached a point were just reading a single page on a textbook has become the hardest thing. After a lot of self reflection I realize I never actually learned how to learn and I realize that this whole time I’ve hated school. 

But I want to actually be studious, and to like learning and to like school- I have a person I care about and I have a future that I want to actually do, I want to become a responsible person and to give the person I love a great life- and never become an economic burden to them.

57,"I guess I will start with a little background. I went to college out of state and moved back to my home state almost 3 years ago. Throughout high school and college I was always decent with the girls. I feel like I've always been fairly good and getting people to like me....at least at first lol! So I do not believe that my social ability has anything to do with this. I have always been in decent shape, maybe slightly above average looking and clean cut. I have a college education and am fairly successful for my age.(Felt like somewhat of a desc was necessary here)

When I first moved back I went out with a few women that I knew from high school or through mutual friends but nothing too serious. One girl lasted for a few months and then we drifted apart and then dated again after 5 months or so. The second time only lasted maybe two months. No fighting or anything. We both just stopped putting in effort to be there for eachother. We were both starting new jobs at the time too so that probably aided it.

After things had faded with her I went on dates with people I had met on tinder and fb. I didn't really connect with any of them. Except for one occasion, I didnt want to go out again. I know this will sound terrible but I feel like I haven't met a woman who is up to my standards yet. I have certain standards for success, intelligence, personality, etc. I work in finance and I also would be happier with someone that's not a financial loss to me. 

For the past few months I decided that I am not going to put in effort to date anymore. I feel like it is just a waste of time and money. I decided to focus on my interests and hobbies more (mostly career related) and have been very happy doing that. I've noticed myself expand my knowledge and skill in these areas and from that I feel happy.

Another part of me: I feel like everyday there is more of me that wants to be with someone. I just dont know what to do. I feel like there is no one in my area who meets my standards. I know it sounds bad but I think setting standards to what I know I'll be happy with is saving time and money. I'm in a fairly small town (under 20k), theres no young people scene, and average income is really low. I work 40 miles away and have an amazing job. For reasons I wont get into, I will not live in the county my work is in and there arent any better options on this side of the state.

Sorry for rambling on for so long. I guess what I'm asking is how can I meet someone that I'll actually enjoy? In school, it's easy. At work, I think its inappropriate. Internets a waste. Plus, I'm busy working most of the time.",25Jan2019,1

62,"I share a suite with my 5 close friends on campus. We only have one semester left before we transfer to another campus that’s bigger(we’re at a satellite campus rn) One of the close friends, let’s call her X, always has some kind of bullshit going on. I’ve never had a peaceful friendship with her, the pot is always being stirred and it really frustrates me. I’m a very reserved person, and somehow she manages to tell the entire school my business anytime there’s anything to talk about. Our campus is very very small. Like 100 people. 

X is confused about her sexuality. Recently, I showed romantic interest in a friend of ours and X told me she didn’t want me to pursue the girl because she didn’t want to deal with any drama if it didn’t work out. I said that my romantic life isn’t really X’s business, and I slept with that girl multiple times after that. X was very understanding and was even happy for me. 

One month later. (Now) we just got back from winter break and X, as soon as X got back to the apartment from the airport, she urgently needed to hang out with me. We talked for like an hour before she randomly mentions the girl I slept with and says that she has interest in her as well. 

She basically asked my permission to start fucking the same girl I’d been sleeping with. 

Note: I stopped sleeping with that girl because she said her friends didn’t like me and she couldn’t be seen with me anymore. So the girl I slept with is an asshole too. 

I’m in a tough situation because I’m kinda being a hypocrite. I told X to fuck off when it comes to telling me what to do with my love life because it doesn’t involve her. How can I tell her it upsets me that she’s trying to sleep with the same girl if that’s not really my business either? 

I’m conflicted between just saying fuck you to X and ignoring her for the next semester (since we’re all moving very soon and I’ll never see her again) or if I should actually explain my feelings. There’s literally no non-dramatic outcome since we’re dealing with the biggest shit talker I know so I feel like both of my options kind of suck.

65,"So I recently started interning at a small CPA startup firm. I have two friends that intern with me (we'll call them AL and Y). AL is a great gal who's been working with me and we get along great, both in class and at work. Y is another student who is a year ahead of us and has been having issues at work. 

So right now is busy season for accountants (after all, someone has to help prepare and file those tax returns!). Because of busy season, this is when most interns get internships. Everyone needs help. We're all lucky we get to work together, and we thought it was going to be great. Except Y has made it into a somewhat toxic workplace. 

So Y has many issues with work. 

1) He hates doing taxes, which is fair because it's not for everyone and it can be boring. Except, as I pointed out to him, he knew what type of internship this was and he signed up for it. 

2) He talks crap about our boss whenever possible. For example, he'll say IN THE OFFICE things like ""Oh, \_\_\_\_\_ won't last in this industry"", ""He doesn't even know what he's doing"", ""The guy is all messed up"", ""This guy can't do shit right"", etc. And while I believe anyone is entitled to their opinion, no one should ever talk crap about their boss in the work place. It's not professional and it honestly feels like it's putting me and AL into a bad zone. Like we are both worried that our boss will walk in and hear Y say something bad and we'll get lumped in with him when we have nothing but respect for our boss. 

3) He's not productive and does the least amount of work. Me and AL are taking our first tax course this semester, but we've caught on fast and do 95% of the work and get things done ASAP. We're trying to be efficient because we both want to make the most of this internship. Y has taken both individual and corporate tax courses, so he should be doing better than us. Instead, he does the work slowly and does not try to do better at all. This last point isn't really relevant, but in the sense that if he were to be fired or he quit, it wouldn't change much because me and AL already do most of the work and have no problem taking on more. 

4) Getting paid. First paycheck, Y complains that he's not being paid right. Me and AL already know we were paid correctly for the amount of hours we worked and don't see the issue. Y says that he's being paid minimum wage, which is impossible because we're all paid the same amount, which is quite a bit more than minimum wage. Also, he claims that he worked 24 hours during the pay period. I know for a fact that he did not because the paid period was 12/31-1/13. During that time, Y only worked 3 days, in which he worked 18 hours (the hours he was paid for). We're paid bi-weekly, so it sucks, but you do get paid for the work you do. No one is getting cheated. I tried to explain to him that he must have gotten it wrong, but he insists and was quick to say our boss can't do anything right, etc. Basically, he was quick to talk crap about our boss AGAIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why Y is being like this. I really don't. But I do know that AL and I don't appreciate him being unprofessional in the work place and potentially getting us in trouble. We have no idea what to do. I did try to tell him maybe he should quit since he obviously doesn't like working there, doesn't like our boss, and isn't productive here at all. Other than that, we can't really think of ways to get rid of him or do anything besides hope he'll learn to shut up and keep his opinion to himself. ",25Jan2019,1

I’ve tried to tell the teachers that if I was just being lazy and didn’t wanna do it, I would tell them bc I don’t wanna cry wolf and have them not believe me later, and they just say “no excuses/no back talk”.  

The teachers also expect us to have absolutely no home life or free time. Like I’ve had several mental breakdowns over the fact that I don’t have any time to pursue my own interests and just relax. And not even my phone or Netflix either, I knit, crochet, needlepoint, calligraphy, and a bunch of other crafts to help me decompose.

Also, I have absolutely no motivation whatsoever to get good grades (all A’s). It’s not the lack of smarts though, all my life I’ve been told “your a genius” or “you are like the smartest __ grader I’ve ever met!” And stuff like that. My classmates, at least in my eyes, are all-respectfully- idiots. They are so superficial; all they care about is social media and memes and trends. And people have told me, “I wish I had your mind” and I always tell them that no, no they don’t. Because it’s a blessing and a curse.

He feels I owe him something, and I feel guilty that I dont have an interest in what he does. He wants me to take over his ""business"" and take 50% of all earnings while I do something I passionately hate. I've made this clear to him.

74,"  

My fiance and I have been together for almost 5 years and engaged a little over a year. I recently found out I was pregnant and I was stressed out over the bad timing and I thought my fiance would want to keep it. I wasn’t 100% set on what I wanted to do when I told him about the pregnancy, but his first emotion was happiness. He hugged me and you could see the happiness he felt. After a little while I think it set in and he brought up other options. We decided on an abortion. I wasn’t set on it, but he wasn’t really open to talking much after telling me his thoughts. His preference had changed pretty drastically from happiness to pretty much ignoring the pregnancy. So I ultimately made the decision by myself. 

I was still early enough to have options and I chose the medical abortion. In our state you have to have a consult appointment at least 24 hours before the procedure appointment. I had this about a week before I could get in for the second appointment. I went to the first appointment alone but texted my fiance with updates throughout the day. He went with me to the second appointment because it was his regularly scheduled day off. I took the first set of medication in the doctor’s office, but the second medication has to be taken 24 hours after and the second set is what causes the abortion.

I was technically supposed to have someone home with me or someone I could call if I was bleeding too heavily or something went wrong and I had assumed he was taking off to be home with me but that’s my fault for not clarifying with him before.  I was home alone during this time and I texted my fiance a few times while he was working. I didn’t blow up his phone at all, just sent a few texts early in the day. For example, I asked him where the heating pad was and I let him know I was taking the medication in case I needed him. He told me not to need him because he was at work. He has a very casual workplace and he texts me regularly when working. He’s never complained about it so I didn’t think three texts would be a big deal. He got upset at me for texting him while he was at work and came home in a bad mood. He said his coworkers and customers annoyed him mostly and I just added to it. He didn’t say hardly anything to me all night and started playing Xbox with his friends almost immediately after getting home. 

I went to sleep fairly early so I didn’t say anything to my fiance last night. I woke up this morning and before my fiance started getting ready for work I told him he had hurt my feelings by showing me no compassion or talking to me at all the night before. He really didn’t say anything back but later on he told me he was irritated that I hadn’t cleaned our room the day before like I said I would. Which I had said I was going to do before taking the medication, but I had to bath our dog unexpectedly and I was not feeling up to it. I told him I was a little busy and hadn’t expected to be in so much pain. He just said it irritates him when I say I’m going to do something and don’t follow through. This isn’t something I do regularly but I can see how it can be irritating so I apologized. 

I sent him a text later in the day about our dog obviously joking around and trying to lighten the mood. He responded back and said he is at work and we can discuss it later. I was straight up rude back and haven’t talked to him since. I know I am overly emotional and hormonal right now, but this isn’t like him at all. Normally when I’m hurt or sick he takes care of me and wants to spend time with me. He’s always been very loving towards me. But now he doesn’t seem to want to talk to me at all and I just don’t know what to do. I could really use some advice on starting a conversation with him tonight or just advice on anything.

75,"I (14F) think I like someone (15M) but I don't know what to do...

He's amazing and I've known him since we were in kindergarten. I hadn't seen him for a while but I got the chance to see him again last year at a youth group meeting. After another meeting, he decided to join despite living half an hour away from the town he used to go to school at. 

It had been so long since we last talked (a few years) but we became good friends once again and now we text almost every day. He has this wonderful personality and he makes me feel wonderful every time I'm around him. We have a lot in common, it's almost insane. We both play the same instrument and have a love for anime. Both of us enjoy video games and we even watch the same YouTube channels. He has this way that he goes about life that I find fascinating and he always makes me feel like I could trust him and tell him anything, even if he doesn't say anything. 

This is where things get a bit complicated. I did tell him some stuff that I've only told my closest friend. The biggest thing I've told him is how I'm struggling mentally. I have a few problems that my family doesn't have enough money for. I haven't even been able to get this stuff checked out by a doctor but I suspect bipolar disorder as well as anxiety. I confided this information in him before I told almost anyone else. I asked that he not treat me any differently knowing the truth and he hasn't which I'm happy about but I don't know how he feels about me. He could be thinking so much about me that I don't know and I don't know how to handle this. He treats me like the others but I know he must think differently about me, knowing this stuff. 

This isn't my only problem. Like I said before, I think I like him. All of a sudden he went from seeing him as a big brother to more then that. I kept telling myself that we're only friends and that won't change. I don't want to ruin the friendship that we have.

 Way before this happened, I told myself that I wasn't old enough to be in love. That I didn't understand love and that anything I did then would only hurt my chances with someone later in life, when I am old enough. That I was young and dumb and that if I waited long enough that the right person would come at the right time. I still think I'm a little too young but I do understand more about love now then I did when I told myself that. I want to wait to tell him when we're in our junior year and can actually drive and pay for things but I can't help but wonder. What if by then, it's too late?

This is where you, the older and more experienced people, come in. I'm very much clueless about what I should do so any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, if my crush is reading this and they know it's them that I'm talking about, please let the earth swallow me up and never let me go. ",25Jan2019,1

79,"Hi everyone,  I’m still in high school, and I know that having a girlfriend doesn’t need to be a top priority for me, especially considering I have a lot of other things going for me.  I have good grades, and even better friends, but I met a girl a few months ago who I am interested in.

This girl is very beautiful, but she is also smart and has a similar sense of humor to me.  We hang out from time to time, but almost always with a group of friends.  I seem to be her favorite out of the entire group as she always yells my name whenever she sees me at school and she usually specifically makes sure she gets to sit next to me when our friend group hangs out.  She recently trusted me with a very big secret that I won’t share here, even though I don’t know any of you, and I think I am the only one that she has told other than her parents.  I do know that these things don’t necessarily mean that she likes e back, but I also think it means she could like me back.  

I want to ask this girl out, but I’ve never had a girlfriend before and I don’t know what to do.  I first of all need to build up the courage to ask her out because I don’t have much self confidence when it comes to things like this.  I also have no idea how to ask her out once I get the courage.  

My last problem is I’m not sure if she is single or not, she moved to my school from far away and she still has friends where she used to live.  She also had a boyfriend there but I’m not sure if they broke up or not.  She has mentioned him in conversations, but I can’t remember if she said he was her ex or not.  I just don’t want to ask her straight-up if she is single, because if she isn’t I’d rather not make things awkward between us for no reason.

I know I said that was my last problem, but if anybody has any suggestions as to what I could do in order to keep it from being awkward between us if she says no, I could use them.  She is a really good friend and if I can’t have her as a girlfriend, I would at least like for her to stay my friend.

81,"Alright so back in September of 2018 I bought aftermarket headlights for my 2016 Toyota Corolla le from carid.com. I then got them retrofitted by changing the drl's to switchback drl's and put RGB lights in the projector and etched the lens. I got them installed on my car but didn't connect the drl's as I wanted to buy pigtails so I didn't have to splice into my wiring harness. So I've been driving on the projectors for like 3 months no problem. I just got the pigtails a few days ago and was planning on wiring and installing them sometime next week. 

Now last night as I was going home the projector led on the driver side decided to check out early on life. I took it to the dealer today to see if maybe they can do something, and they couldnt and didn't want to touch them due to the fact that they are aftermarket. No problem I went back to pick up my car after work and went started my car and now the passenger projector decided to join his brother in projector heaven, so now I have no headlights other than high beam. 

I did a quick search on Kijiji and found that I can buy both sides for $250 cad total and my retrofitter said he can swap out the projector units for slightly reduced labor costs but didn't give me an exact quote.

My question is this: should I take my loss and just reinstall my oem headlight assembly and call it a day? or am I already in too deep and might as well go all in?

I can probably return the pigtails and get my money back on that. I also got a $70 usd partial refund from carid for the assembly. 

Thank you in advance and any input is appreciated.

It literally just pops in my head, with no supporting physical evidence. The closest thing to physical evidence is having a dream that related to an event. For the most part, it has been pregnancies. However, I have also had a dream involving spending time with 3 specific individuals, about 2 months later, I end up attending an event that focused on the three individuals. Sometimes I will check up on somebody because something is telling me that they need it. It is weird and I do not consider it a typical 'lucky guess'.

88,"My husband is pulling his hair out and we are in desperate need of advice.


Early last year we noticed a leak in our master bathroom. We submitted an insurance claim, and due to how substantial the damage was we had to do a complete reno of the bathroom (new sub floor, tile, hardwood in the bedroom, dry wall). The insurance was going to cover almost all of it, aside from the few changes we wanted, things we wanted to upgrade, etc. They connected us to a restoration company they work with regularly and things seemed pretty peachy.



They quoted us 8-10 weeks. We realised that this was something that was going to take a lot of work and that was fine with us. Thankfully we have a second full bathroom.




The work started in June of 2018. It is now the end of January 2019 and we are still not done. My husband is afraid of being too aggressive with our project manager for fear of getting sub par work. We've had trouble getting in contact with the project manager sometimes (up to two weeks to hear a reply), and we are constantly finding craftsmanship issues that need to be remedied. At one point we called the finance office just to confirm a bill we had gotten and the woman mentioned that our final walkthrough was scheduled for the next day and she had no idea that work still needed to be done on our bathroom.



Do we have any sort of case to possibly get the money we paid out of pocket back? Or should we just take this as a lesson learned?",25Jan2019,1
89,"I made a short film last year that has recently been accepted into a film festival in America (I'm from a country outside the US), and as a broke student, I've spent the last few weeks working out how to get enough money to go to said festival in April. I was planning on going with one of my closest friends, who worked on the film, and everything I've planned so far has been based on him coming. 

I set up a GoFundMe page to jumpstart the trip, and we've already got most of the money we need through that, the festival has offered to put us up in a hotel for most of the trip, and everything was working out. But he's just told me that (due to uni issues) he won't be able to come. I've never been to the US before, and I'd really prefer not to go it alone, not to mention that we've got two VIP passes to this festival and there'll be other costs associated with the trip that it'll be difficult to pay by myself. I've also let the festival know that there'll be two of us going, and I mentioned it in the GoFundMe page.

There's not really anyone else who worked on the film who I'd consider going with – not to mention that a lot of them would have other commitments anyway.

90,"So I am currently a first year accounting student and looking to get some extra curriculars to help me in the big 4 recruiting later. 

I currently have two options for something to do next year.

The first option would be to join our school's case competition team. It's Canada's one of the largest case competition where each school sends 30 students every year to compete in different business areas. The name is instantly recognizable and would give me credibility. However, it's a huge commitment (7+ hours a week to practice) for the entire year.

The second option would be to work as a ""Student Life Ambassador"" at my school. They are hiring a few students to represent our school's student services. I would be receiving training,holding events and hosting booths to promote different student services our school offers. It pays $15/hr, which will be about $5000 for the entire year. That's 80% of my tuition!

Which one should I go for? The case competition is the traditional business student's ""top-tier"" extra curricular activity in our school. However, I feel like the student ambassador position won't be bad because it shows that I am able to talk to people, represent a business, be enthusiastic, which is ultimately what the accounting recruiters are looking for through ECs.

93,"About 3 months ago I left a relationship of 3 years. We moved out of state for the last 6 months we were together. There was never much substance between us, and when we moved in together it became much more apparent that we weren't right for each other. I believe that she was a narcissist, and drained me of any drive I had during our time together. 

Once I left though, it was like night and day. I'm motivated and excited about the future. Since being out of the relationship and back to the city, I've been reconnecting with my family, friends, and hobbies. I gave most of myself to my relationship, so I'm finding that I have to work hard at developing my own independent identity that doesn't require someone else's approval. Have been applying for jobs and have been to several interviews, but nothing yet. I've noticed that I'm stressing about time passing, like I need to make some ground-breaking progress every day or else I'm not trying hard enough. In reality I've been doing a lot, dabbling in learning some piano, some computer programming, and quite a bit of exercise. I think this stems partly from my low self-esteem after having it widdled away by my ex, but I'm working on bringing that back up slowly but surely.

She is the biggest gossiper and she would hate everyone gossiping about her and her fag son, 2. My parents have some holes in their marriage and wants me to grow up quick to help out and she’s expecting big things, and 3. She has many gay friends she doesn’t want her son to turn out like them.

So yesterday something hit my foot and I shouted ‘ouch’ . My mum didn’t care and she asked me why I screamed which I was not doing. I was holding some condiments and she asked my I was holding it like a girl. I knew something was coming so that night she said she needed to talk. Essentially she said why am I doing these things and she added that I got it from girls and only having girl friends which was not true I have many male friends but it shouldn’t even matter. She said that I needed to be a ‘real man’ and to ‘act accordingly’ and in my head I have so much I want to say and fight back but in the moment I just say yes or okay.

99,"Warning, very long. 

TL;DR My boss fired me because I figured out he was avoiding the labor laws by not paying his employees time and a half for overtime. I’ve already reported him to the DOL, not sure what to do from here. 

So to preface, I’ve already reported the place of business to the Department of Labor. 
What happened was that I was hired about a week ago to train as an assistant at a chiropractors office. $13/h full time, potential for bonuses and raises, outings and free lunches on occasion, etc. it all seemed too good to be true. Because it was.

So I trained for one day last Monday (1/14/2019), and the boss (also the main chiro) paid me with a check from the business for the hours I worked. He informed me that I would not be getting paid for overtime. I had a weird feeling about this but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he meant I wouldn’t be scheduled any overtime. I was told to come in this Monday (1/21) to officially start. I got my papers in order, handed in my direct deposit, etc yesterday. My hours were as follow:

Monday-Friday 8:45-1, lunch, 2-7

And then we worked out that every week thereon would be the same, except on Tuesday’s where I would come in at 12-7 with no lunch hour, and another girl hired with similar hours to be would do the same but on thursdays. 

See where I’m going with this?

So I looked a bit closer at my schedule yesterday after working three 10 hour days in a row, and saw that I was scheduled for much overtime. I decided that I’d ask my boss about it, again giving him the benefit of the doubt.  This morning, I asked a coworker (O) who worked there for 2 years already if the doctor paid for time and a half when they worked overtime. She said no, and when I informed her that was illegal she shrugged and said that she just worked 100 hours in two weeks and didn’t get any overtime pay for it, just straight pay. 

Later when the doctor came back from his lunch, I went to discuss my own schedule with him, again still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. The conversation went something like this (I wrote it down immediately after it happened as I didn’t have my phone on me to record):

Me: Hey (D)oc, I just wanted to know if my hours were right because it looks like (new coworker hired along with me) and I are both scheduled for overtime. I just wanted to make sure this was right since you said you don’t pay time and a half for overtime. 

D: What? You won’t want overtime? You must be a millennial.

Me: haha, I mean, I just wanted to make sure it was right cause I wasn’t sure if you wanted us scheduled for more than 40 hours.

D: give me a second, I just got back from my break I’ll talk to you in a bit. 

About 5 mins go by and he calls me into one of the exam rooms to discuss my schedule. 

D: So what’s the problem, you don’t want a full time job is that it? You don’t want 43 hours?

Me: Well no, it’s just that you said you don’t pay for overtime hours, and if that’s the case I only want to be scheduled for a full time of 40 hours without overtime. It looks like you have me here for 47 hours on this schedule. 

D: Well since you’re already complaining on your 4th day working here about your schedule I don’t think you’re a good fit. I think it’s time for you to go now, this isn’t really gonna work out.”

Me: Wait, no, I just meant if you’re not paying time and a half

D: You can leave then. 

Me: do you want me to finish my shift or?

D: No, you can get your stuff and go. 

Immediately following this he rushed to his office and I told the other new girl that I just got fired, and she should leave immediately as well (we were discussing his shady payment earlier after my discussion with O about her not being paid for her excessive overtime).  I’m not sure what she did after that but I grabbed my things, clocked out, wished the other girls at the check in desk luck and said I would report him to the board of labor. 

This job was supposed to help my boyfriend and I pay some big bills this month (increased rent, high heat bill, phone bill, couch, etc).  Now I’m jobless with only a few hundred bucks coming in from the past few days. I’m not sure where to go from here other than continuing to apply to any job I see. Any advice would be helpful.

100,"I need some help. One of my previous teachers, and the teacher of many of the top students in my class (he was the gifted and talented teacher) has been put on administrative leave. 

Background, to begin: Mr. Bob (pseudonym) is one of the most favored and well-known teachers from our middle school. He has been known to undertake some of the most beneficial and painstaking work to ensure that his students become culturally literate in as many ways as possible, from building gardens to traveling across the world to teach us about different nations and cultures to tasking us with building working automata as a project. He is a solid mentor to his students and a personal friend to many of his former students. We continue to look towards him for guidance long after we leave his class.


So, Mr. Bob told the other teachers and the principal at the school his entire side of the story before he got put on leave to show he wasn’t hiding anything, and they (I’m not allowed to say who specifically) passed it on to my parents.

So this “Adam” is a 12th grader that was having some issues with school and at home so he would go to Mr. Bob’s classroom occasionally for guidance, and mr Bob was trying to help him finish school and graduate. Eventually the student let out that he had a really bad abusive home situation with his father. As a result, Mr. Bob tried to set up a meeting with him, the student, and the dad, to try and work everything out because he believed that if the student ended the year like this it would ruin his relationship with his father forever. When the dad was contacted to meet and talk things out and realized what Mr. Bob was doing he contacted Mr. Bob and said something along the lines of “stop mentoring/contacting my son or I will ruin you”. Then the dad and the son got into a fight that eventually became physical and the son left that night and went to Mr. Bob’s house because he didn’t have anywhere else to go. Mr. Bob let him stay the night. The next day Mr. Bob told the principal, the staff, and his students at SBMS exactly what had happened so he could be as transparent as possible. Later that day the dad filed official accusations of Mr. Bob committing misconduct towards his son. Mr Bob was put on administrative leave and told “you can either resign or wait for the outcome of the investigation”. Mr John, the principal, went to the class and told the GT students that they had a sub for the rest of the year and that depending on the investigation it “may be permanent.”

I was told by another teacher at the school that even if Mr. Bob is found completely innocent of all counts legally, he is still likely to be fired for violating the district policy for interacting with students (by letting the abused kid in need stay the night) so it looks like either way he loses. If he resigns now it won’t go on his record.

I am personally pissed off, and I as well as other students are prepared to resist the administration’s decision as significantly and as vocally as possible. But we need advice from more level-headed individuals. If it helps, we are from Texas, so those are the education laws in play. Please help us out. What can we do? Mr. Bob deserves to continue teaching, and the students are better for having him.",25Jan2019,1
101,"My friend got kicked out of his parents house a little over a week ago; the reason was valid but petty. He stole his mom's car for the night and got it stuck, then didn't have it back home before she woke up and he got caught. Anyways he asked if he could stay at my parents with me   for a couple days until he could go home. He's a close friend and of course I'm not gonna say no.

Fast forward to now, he's lived here 9 days well over the ""couple days"" he said he would be. My family is not financially well off to the point where just feeding my brother parents and I is a struggle and now with another person that just makes it that much worse.

The final problem is my entire family is going out of town for a week or so soon and he has not even attempted to reconsile with his parents. I've asked him multiple times to talk to them and every time he says ok then doesn't. I even confronted him about it and he says he just doesn't know what to say so he's been avoiding it. I even saw a text he got from his dad in his notifications from 2 days ago he is yet to open. How can I get him to talk to his parents so he will go home? I don't think he gets the fact he can't stay here forever.

TL;DR:friend got kicked out of his parents house, asked to stay with me for a ""couple days"", hasn't left after 9. Won't talk to his parents about going home because his ego is too big to ask his mom to come home.

102,"Hey everyone, I'm really down on my luck with car issues lately.  I'm hoping someone can really offer some solid advice.

Sorry, if this is a long post, but I want to give as much detail as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 2010 Toyota Tundra 5.7L V8. It has about 113,000 miles on it.

About a month ago, I went to pass a vehicle on a country road and the engine immediately started misfiring and the check engine light started blinking.

I pulled over, shut it off and started it back up. No engine light. At this point, I'm just trying to get home (about 5 miles).

After about a mile it does the same thing. It doesn't knock or ping but runs rough. I limp it home and hook it up to a cheap code reader I have. It tells me P0302, cylinder 2 misfire.

My thought are that it needs new spark plugs and/or coils being over 100k miles, so I buy and replace all the spark plugs and even the coil pack on cylinder 2. It does absolutely nothing.

So I finally break down and have it towed to the local Toyota shop. Their findings were that there was some chewed wiring related to the computer (ECU if I am not mistaken?) and 1 injector (supposedly cylinder 2 which makes sense).

I file an insurance claim for the rodent damage, and after a week, Toyota calls me to tell me that the truck has a new computer and 4 new injectors all on the same bank of the engine to play it safe. Despite these repairs, there is still a bad misfire in cylinder 2. They come to the assumption that it is an internal engine problem, possibly from the engine running without a computer since it was short circuited out form the wires being chewed. They speculate that it is some sort of seal on the cylinder and they recommend tearing the top end apart for a whopping $2,900. Now I am not about to have them take apart my engine for almost $3,000 due to some speculation trial and error.

So they reach back out to my insurance company to report their findings and request to revisit the claim.

Someone else who is a 3rd party inspector hired by my insurance company comes out for a reevaluation. His words are as follows

"" THE SHOP WHEN FIRST CHECKED FOUND THE CODE: P0302 AND #2 CYLINDER MISFIRING. THEY ALSO FOUND THE INJECTOR WIRES HAD RODENT DAMAGE. THEY REPAIRED THE WIRES AND CLEARED THE CODE AND THEN FOUND THE ENGINE STILL RUNS ROUGH AND MISFIRES WHEN ACCELERATING. THEY DID THE BASICS AND CHECKED THE COMPRESSION AND LEAK DOWN, BOTH SEEMED TO BE OK. THEY ALSO DID A VACUUM GAUGE TEST AND FOUND THE GAUGE WAS NOT STEADY AND THEY ARE NOW RECOMMENDING TO REMOVE THE HEAD AND CHECK FOR VALVE SEALING ISSUES. THIS IS NOT RELATED TO ANY RODENT DAMAGE SEEN. THIS WOULD BE RELATED TO TIME AND MILES AS THE ENGINE HAS OVER 100K MILES..""

&amp;#x200B;

This verbiage alone has completely disinterested my insurance company into paying any more into this claim. 

Also, upon asking for trade-in value, Toyota has told told me that they have no interest in offering me anything based on the unknown repairs. I am up shit creak without a paddle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone with experience tell me what I might be up against?  I owe about $8,300 on the truck and according to Toyota, I can't get anything for it. Do I bite the bullet and dish out the thousands in repairs? If I have a valid argument for the rodent damage, how do I make a rebuttal? If I am at a complete loss here? What other options do I have to at least break even on what I owe on my vehicle?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is greatly appreciated!

104,"So long story short I’ve been living with my boyfriends family for about a year and some change. His mother has been overwhelming for me to handle each day. I’m stuck home alone with her everyday while my bf is at work, and his mother likes to obsess over everything I do, and create arguments constantly. Without going super into it, it’s been hard for me mentally since I suffer from ptsd. So somehow I came up with the conclusion that I’ll move in with my mom and brother when they move closer in the next few months. Everything is set up, we’re supposed to sign the lease next week. I’m currently visiting my family and realized what a huge mistake this was. I somehow had forgotten how difficult being with my family was on me.. worse than anything I deal with living with my bf. I’m panicking because I just want to stay where I am but fear confronting my mother with bpd about not coming to live with her. Any advice would be helpful.. I just need to find a mentally healthy place..

Also it’s worth noting that I am a disabled person with several physical conditions mixed with mental illnesses. I do go to therapy but don’t see my therapist again until a few weeks from now.",25Jan2019,1
105,"**TL;DR: My boss is a sociopath who manages by gaslighting and has herself setup in a well protected position, friendly with her superior's superiors, and makes sure her boss can't live without her. I feel like she's conspiring to get rid of me and I don't know what to do about it.**

Hey so it's a long, long story, but I don't really want to skip details I feel might well be important.

**The Setup**

I work for an IT company, originally in quality assurance testing software, and about 7 months ago our senior manager mentioned there was a new team being built who would manage the releases of our software - this responsibility had recently been delegated to the game studios. Naturally only the QA's had any time to handle it so I'd become quite familiar with the process and wanted to break away from testing, so I enquired about the team.

The senior had never given me reason to trust him in the past, so I was naturally sketchy about the sales pitch - far too good to be true. He suggested I'd be exclusively doing the work I was already doing with releases, bridging the existing release team with the studios and gradually taking that work stream from all the studios. All the QA's hated it, so I knew I'd be doing them and the company a favour - albeit with a lot of responsibility on my shoulders. 

Now the position was completely new, and totally undefined. Role and responsibilities were non-existent, and to be defined as we go. It was clearly a huge risk so I met in private with my co-QA who had been there longer and hashed over the idea with him. We agreed it would be really risky, I was fairly comfortable where I was and if things went wrong I could end up with nothing, but he suggested I ask for a period in which I could switch back and it was clearly worth a pay increase. I then met with a girl I knew on the release team, who told me the work load there was enormous, and the boss was a bit of strict workhorse, expecting a lot of everyone and that there would rarely be time to relax.

I figured it would ultimately look good on me if I could pull it off, do the QA's a big favour, make a name for myself, and the pay boost would be worth it right? - but I had to ensure a safety net. So I cautiously agreed provided I would have 3 months in which I could return to my original role, and there would at least be a guaranteed pay increase. The terms were agreed and I moved desks.

**First 3 Months**

Those 3 months went smoothly, the team mostly ignored me and let me do what I wanted to do. I carried on as I had, just working on my studio and eventually once I worked out a system, I'd get more studios release work. I made over 200 releases getting all of our games up to date, working out the system - albeit constantly overruled by my Boss who kept making sure I was doing things more or less her way. It was all little things, like my spreadsheets weren't legible they were made how she liked them, using colours she approved of. The control freak vibe was real but didn't seem out of control.

I decided to stick with it since I was making good progress and didn't mind how things were - I figured the small annoyances would be totally tolerable for a pay rise and the position seemed like it would be worth a decent increase. So things were finalised, and I was officially on the team. No announcements or fanfare, but that's okay, not like they do it for anyone else.

**Suddenly...**

At this point things started to change. During that time I was pretty secluded despite working in an open office. I hadn't spoken to my old team, and I was always under the eye of The Boss, or The Big Boss. Boss was the woman who I reported to mostly, and coordinated with, she's in charge of the team while Big Boss is in charge of her. Now I'm not a very social person, prefer not to be, but I at least expect some basic pleasantries. People saying hi to you, or asking you how its going, but here I was completely disregarded and I had started to notice. There was no bad blood with my old team, we just didn't have the opportunity to chat. I'd update Boss or Big Boss on what I was doing each day but otherwise no contact. It was super cliquey. I think the only time one person acknowledged me early on was to remark on how disgusting my food smelled. Even the girl I was kinda friendly with before didn't talk to me at all suddenly.

I'm also a smoker, and as time went on I got moved next to Boss, and shortly after Big Boss called me into a 1-to-1 to tell me there was an issue with the smell of smoke on me - first I've ever heard of it in my professional career - but fine, it's not impossible. I suggested I move desks, but that apparently wasn't an option, because Boss needed me next to her, and she was clearly the one annoyed by the smell. So she began turning on her little desk fan and pointing it at me. I felt a little insulted, but then every single time I sat down from a smoke, on went the fan. A week of this, I started having to sit with my jacket on, and eventually it was drying my eyes. It was driving me nuts. I kept asking to move desks, and she refused, I asked her to move the fan and it would always be temporary. I wasn't hiding my annoyance, but it went disregarded.

**I Learned More About Boss**

So lonely, cold, and irritated. Not a good start. I was friends with other people in the office though, and my friend L started saying hi to me now and then, it was a bright moment in the day, just speaking to one another for a minute or so. Very quickly I got pulled into a meeting with Big Boss, he explained that there was a complaint that I was being too chatty when there's work to be done, maybe to work on my timing. It caught me pretty off guard, because it was the only person I'd spoken to in ages and it was very short when we did. The only person present was Boss at the time so I figured I knew where the complaint came from.

I mentioned to L that there was a complaint that he was talking to me, and he apologised explaining there was history with him, Boss, and my friend on the team - lets call her R. Apparently he and her were friends too, they got to socialising with some others in the company and Boss didn't like that R wasn't spending time being her friend. She apparently started a campaign of gas lighting R, making her life difficult when she tried to socialise with the others. It was only by exclusively being Boss's friend that she let up on her. R just wanted the crazy to stop and never brought up anything against Boss.

Things start making sense, the controlling behaviour, the manipulation, the gaslighting were all explaining a lot of things - because Boss is very good friends with everyone on the team except me. She also notably ensures Big Boss is kept ignorant of how anything works. She controls the team, the work, and how she does it, Big Boss just cares that things are going smoothly - but he couldn't live without her. The work she does, only she knows how to do, so no one is able to replace her. She's very friendly with the higher ups that sit behind us so everyone tends to have a good impression of her. I realised my friend wasn't being friendly with me, because that could incur the wrath of Boss on both of us. She wanted a new friend to add to her collection, and I was the smokey guy who ate smelly food, and everything she was doing felt like she was trying to make me staying as unpleasant as possible.

**I Almost Quit**

By this point I was getting very stressed, and when Big Boss called our regular 1-to-1 update, I explained how I hated it. I wasn't in charge of anything, the little I was in charge of was always at the whim of Boss. I was lonely, the one time I talked to someone I was complained at, the fan was driving me crazy, I was refused any ability to resolve the issue, and I explained I seriously was considering just leaving the company - dismayed because this is not the impression I was given in those first 3 months where I had the option to go back. I felt like I'd been tricked. Not to mention I was told I'd have a pay adjustment and no one had mentioned anything. Big Boss consoled me, and said he didn't want me to be unhappy, if I wanted to move somewhere else in the company he'd support me. He'd talk to Boss in the meantime and investigate the pay situation.

I did investigate moving, and even interviewed but the team I wanted to go to had no openings. During that time Boss let up on me somewhat. The team were a little friendlier, and even though it was all small changes I felt a dramatic improvement in morale. Things kind of plateaued there, but I knew Boss was never to be trusted. I just did my best to reciprocate the politeness I was shown and keep things moving forward as we started taking on new teams, and I got to give some feedback on the big internal tools - that felt really good, like I was actually having an impact on the company for the better. Things were better, so I waited to see how long it would last.

Around this point, my Grandmother died of cancer, a bit of a trigger for me since I lost my mother to cancer only 4 years ago and ended up taking some time off to cope with the depression. Big Boss was understanding about it at the time, and after a week or so I came back.

**The New Girl**

Nearer to the end of last year I was told I'd be getting a new co-worker for my side of the team to help take on the last remaining studios. I'd get to move a desk away from Boss and I'd get help with the increasing workload. It turned out the new girl was a friend of Boss in the company, and my first instinct was that Boss would try to replace me with someone she wanted on the team, a true addition to her collection. It also annoyed me that she got a big announcement about her new role at the company quarterly. A big round of applause for M, and no mention of me or recognition of the huge amount of work I'd been doing.

She joined, and I begin training her. She naturally starts immediately complaining about the way I do everything. I try to be constructive, and agree that the system can be improved, after all we made it in a bit of a rush since we needed to start somewhere. We work together on improvements and overhauls, and eventually its Christmas break.

My yearly review came up, and we have x/5 ratings which determine how much bonus you get. Most everyone gets 3, while 2 is bad, 1 you're fired, 4 is hard to get, and 5 is nearly impossible. Big Boss asked me to list any achievements I was proud of having done, so I rattled off a good 15 things I'd kicked ass at since I joined the team, new processes, taking work from the QAs, getting things done, helping with the internal tools, salvaging a lost file pretty much everything relied on and getting it setup in the new system, coordinating with all the studios etc.

He came back to me and explained that I'd gotten a 2 due to my 'absences', namely when my grandma died, and told me if I wanted that pay increase I'd have to work harder for it. Everything in me was screaming that this was bullshit, but there was nothing I could do about it. He just told me I was being given a low rating for grieving. Of course he told me to let him know if I had an issue with the rating, but I felt so utterly dejected I didn't see the point. My prospect of actually getting paid to deal with the bullshit was dead, I'd given up the comfortable position with a friendly team for this mind-f\*ck.

**Since Then**

It's now the end of January and me and M have been getting on okay. Boss remains tolerable, likely somewhat placated that she has a new friend on the team, and I'm still training her. I've now been given the task of writing up everything I know into word documents, for future new starters on the team. I can't help but feel like it's because I won't be there for some reason. M is a slow learner, and Boss knows my knowledge is the only reason I'm there. I could be paranoid, but I'm sure the goal is to extract that from me and make me entirely replaceable. At the same time I have no justifiable reason not to do it.

This whole thing has my brain a bit fried, and I have no idea what to do, or what I even can do. I've known for a while now that even if I complained about Boss it'd be to people she's basically friends with. She's difficult to replace and Big Boss would be putting himself in the fire by standing against her. Although I am learning I'm not completely alone in seeing through her. I feel like going against her would be starting a war, and I don't have the strength for a conflict like that.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

I usually try to be very proactive with my fears and it does work, but not with that one.

Whenever I'm in a high place, let it be a 5th floor or a 200 meter mountain, I feel terrible. Cant move, can barely breathe, getting very lightheaded and sick.

I tried working on it, making myself getting to high building and places but I just end up feeling TERRIBLE without any improvement.

My friends want to travel to a ski vacation, and at first I was hyped about it, but thinking about it more deeply I tend not to go, simply because I feel I will encounter too much fear at a point where it wont be enjoyable any more. let it be the ski gondola, ski lifts, being on a high mountain itself, and even flying (I've never went on an airplane before)

On the one hand I feel like I should not let it decide whether or not I'm doing things, on the other hand I feel like it's too much to deal with at once, at a point where I'll suffer more than enjoy (I do after all feel.. TERRIBLE) , and maybe I should try to overcome it one step at a time.

107,"We're in high school. My best friend (I'll call her Jane) gets her first boyfriend (John) and over a couple of months things escalate and the two are making out a lot. Only problem is, Jane doesn't want any of that. John pushes it all onto her. She only went along with it because she thought that she *had* to, because as a woman she *should* enjoy making out with a guy. In reality she was repulsed by him. She made efforts to make it clear to him that she did not enjoy it, but he persisted, and she relented. He was also uncaring towards her feelings and only seemed to like her for her body. 

Eventually he wanted to go much farther than making out and was just sexually abusing her. Always trying to grab her breasts, shove his hand down her pants, and he even grabbed her hand and put in on his dick in the middle of math class. 

They broke up, but Jane is still reeling from the events almost a year later now. She even tried to kill herself. 

John still goes to our school (of 100 students and he's in all our classes; we cannot avoid him) and has faced no consequences for his actions. He has no idea the pain he has caused. 

So my question to all of you is: how do I bully him? I can't do it in a way that is obvious, otherwise I'll be facing the repercussions from the faculty, who do not know what happened between Jane and John. I want John to feel the emotional pain that he lacks from guilt; I want him to feel terrible like Jane did. ",25Jan2019,1

Obviously the concern was someone was looking through our windows(while eating?)

We havent installed our front curtains yet, but this relevation is a concern.....should we start asking our neighbors? Speak to the police?

113,"Hello! So, very recently my sister had her second baby. We're a pretty problematic family, but my sister has always been the worse one about it. We always have been, honestly. My sister and I never really got along, she pushed me out of her life when we were really young. She hung out with the wrong crowd... She got into drugs and cigarettes, developing addiction habits. I ended up also pushing her away because of it. The only time we ""got along"" was when she vented to me. Otherwise, we didn't like each other. We ended up better off when we only saw each other occasionally.

Note: We are both adults living with our parents, in our early 20's. (I want to move on in life but I'm still struggling on what I want to do career-wise/have anxiety about the next step)

&amp;#x200B;

 About last year she had a bf who was really great. It was a great period of my family's life - no more fighting.... we all got along during then. But then suddenly she shows up with a new bf. He was only supposed to stay for a couple of days only and it ended up... so much longer than that. Almost a year now. The kid being here also stressed everyone out too (who is now 3), especially because my sister and her bf were always saying things like ""could you watch her for a second?/I'll be right back"" only to be gone for hours at a time. We are constantly fighting - the whole family AND struggling with money. 

 A lot of the time the kid gets put onto me. Long before she ended up pregnant for the first time, I had made my position with kids very clear: I don't want any. I don't like kids. I do not have the capacity to handle a kid. I've always known this very well, and never expressed any want to have or take care of a child, because ultimately they would suffer.

 Being an aunt is okay, my mother says I ""fell in love"" with my niece, and already my new nephew. I wouldn't mind watching them **occasionally**, but overexposure to children causes me to feel resentment, so I disagree. I hope I'm not the only one like this...

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward though, my sister has her second baby. There were complications. She was honest with the doctors - we knew she did drugs before she knew she was pregnant but turns out she did them WHILE she knew she was pregnant too. This raised a flag and CPS got involved and my mother had to come up to talk to them. She didn't want them to get sent off to foster care. Well, now my sister AND her bf can no longer have contact with any of her kids, my mother is taking custody, we're hoping my sister completes rehab. It's been extremely stressful for everyone. I know I'm going to be called on a lot to take care of the kids, if the past is anything to go by. My mother keeps calling me selfish for feeling the way I do. I know I'm going to end up hating both of them because I cannot mentally handle this every day. I feel sick just thinking about the future. There was a reason why I never wanted any kids - I don't have a single mommy bone in my body. These two are going to suffer in my care, and that's wrong. Kids frustrate and anger me. I get the whole ""it takes a village"" saying, but a lot of the time it feels like I'm the only villager. 

It's not like I'm going to harm them of course, it's just I can't provide the love and attention they need. I get overwhelmed easily and snap. Kids... drain me so fast.

So far my only options seem to be moving out/getting a job but there are a lot of complications regarding that. I feel like that'd just mean me coming home to having to watch them anyways though and I don't really have any IRL friends I could live with either. I want to start taking proper $$$ commissions too but I need to have time to even get a sheet started for that...

&amp;#x200B;

But - what do you guys think? Maybe I really am being selfish... I'll take any sort of advice or opinions related to this.

114,"First off, sorry, mobile user.

So, I'm bunking with a freshman in college. I'm a sophmore in my schools graphic media couse and with such, I have super early classes. I'm trying to sleep, but he tends to play videogames till about midnight, with a mechanical keyboard, and yesterday screamed for five consecutive minutes playing CS:GO with his online friends. I've been losing sleep and haven't had the guts to address it directly without sounding like an asshole about it. Any idea's on how to deal with this in a respectable manner?",25Jan2019,1
115,"I cut out all the bull shit in my life and now there's nothing left.   

  

\*\*Tl;Dr: After cutting out everything toxic or wrong with my life, I find I have nothing left and I don't know what to do with my time or myself. I feel lonely, and its really starting to bring me down.\*\*

I am not trying to be dramatic, nor was I when I was doing it, but recently I got fed up with the way people were treating me and the way my life was going and I cut out everything that wasn't working. It felt great, and had a lot of immediate effects that were very positive, the problem is it was very short lived.   

  

This lead me to quit a side job I was doing for a little extra cash, as the boss just could not find it in herself to treat me with respect.  

  

Another thing I did was I said goodbye to a long standing friendship. My good friend was simply not treating me right. He's been taking me for granted for years, he can never find the time to hang out with me, and often times he will cancel plans last minute if he finds something better to do. In the past 5-6 years he has refused to inconvenience himself even the slightest bit for me, I always have to be the one to drive farther or move things around if we are to hang out.   

  

I quit watching TV all day. I used to watch a lot of TV and play a lot of video games. I did not do it so much because I enjoyed it, but because I really had nothing else to do. Now I only do it as an absolute last resort, like if I can't sleep or something.   

  

My biggest problem is that while I was doing all this my friend got a job and moved away. I knew it was a possibility, but now that it has happened I really don't have anyone left to hang out with.   

\*\*I don't regret anything I did in this process\*\*  

  

I did what I had to do to protect my deteriorating self esteem and mental health, and I feel much better for it. I am happy and proud of myself, which is something I have not felt in years. 

  

However, I am having trouble dealing with the loneliness that has come as a byproduct. I cut away a lot. I have more free time than I have in probably 10 years, but now I have less friends to spend it with. I am growing more and more restless by the day. I have taken to taking long walks and sometimes drives to clear my mind and wast time.   

  

It's kind of scary having nothing left like this, I really don't know what to do with my life.   ",25Jan2019,1
116,"I'm currently going to school for my Associate degree in HVAC; I'm still not done quite yet but I find myself wondering of where I want to go for work after I'm done. 
 I've thought of going to a bigger city once I'm done. Because all I've ever wanted since I was 18 was to leave my hometown. And considering it could be a better career opportunity for me I find it as a promising future. 
 Although, the only reason I've been going to college was to help my parents out of the financial struggle they're in. My mom is supportive and so is my father, but as my father has aged he's become more grouchy and less enthusiastic. Sometimes it just feels that im unappreciated and a joke even after all the effort of going to school and working to pay off their bills. 
I know it be a dick move to leave them and to just move on with my life, but it feels like a better personal decision. Don't get me wrong i love my family and I know how much we've had to struggle to get the point where we are now, but they longer i go through this the more i feel the cold shoulder from my father.

119,"My wife and I built a custom home with a local homebuilder who served as the general contractor.

When the home was finished we paid the home builder the final payment. That same day the home builder met with his subcontractor tradesmen and said he was having trouble paying for work they already did and he was going out of business. The subs obviously were pissed and demanded they get paid. The builder refused to pay them for work already completed on our and others homes. Work that we paid the builder for per our contract.

The subs who were not paid sent out lien letters to us requesting we pay them the amount due that was already paid to the homebuilder or they will put a lien on our home. One decided to sue us (and the other families building with this home builder each) for $20+k. 

We luckily were moved into our home at the time of this but others have a half built home getting rained on.

Many subcontractors went out of business since they lost tens of thousands of dollars from fronting the materials and labor for their portion of the home build. 

We are out a few thousand in legal fees (and stress) but have gotten the lawsuit dismissed.

We got word today that the owner of the home builder is fleeing the state without resolving any of the mess he left behind. To make matters worse he is having a going away party with family and friends at a local bar in the town where he scammed all of us. One of his sub contractors tipped us off of the location and time tomorrow (Friday) evening. Many customers and subs are planning on attending and calling him out.

Promoting from middle school I was honestly excited to start high school and start my path to pursue botany, the study of plants, because I really felt like I wanted to do this as a future career (I quite literally planned where I wanted to go to college already). But slowly through freshman year I started to feel less and less of that spark to keep up with school. Eventually I lost interest in pursuing botany and anything in general. Of course I still did my work and I'm doing fine academically but my mental health was degrading from a couple things going on through my life.

I was dealing with depression and anxiety for a while and my anxiety is better to deal with, still no medication to help me and my depression... I feel like I got that chapter over with or maybe I've become numb still not sure.

Both of us were drug users and we escalated each other's addictions. We lived, breathed, ate, slept together. She ended up getting fired from the camp for letting a class of campers see a pack of cigarettes she had dropped. Quickly and almost instantly she was fired and ripped away from my life. She was sent home. A home that happens to be 4 hours away in another state. Days later she made an attempt to end her life which she survived. I quit my job at the camp, and we didnt have a way to contact each other for 9 months. This was almost 2 years ago and I'm yet to have any closure with it. Both of us are currently sobering up.

126,"I (14F) think I like someone (15M) but I don't know what to do...

He's amazing and I've known him since we were in kindergarten. I hadn't seen him for a while but I got the chance to see him again last year at a youth group meeting. After another meeting, he decided to join despite living half an hour away from the town he used to go to school at. 

It had been so long since we last talked (a few years) but we became good friends once again and now we text almost every day. He has this wonderful personality and he makes me feel wonderful every time I'm around him. We have a lot in common, it's almost insane. We both play the same instrument and have a love for anime. Both of us enjoy video games and we even watch the same YouTube channels. He has this way that he goes about life that I find fascinating and he always makes me feel like I could trust him and tell him anything, even if he doesn't say anything. 

This is where things get a bit complicated. I did tell him some stuff that I've only told my closest friend. The biggest thing I've told him is how I'm struggling mentally. I have a few problems that my family doesn't have enough money for. I haven't even been able to get this stuff checked out by a doctor but I suspect bipolar disorder as well as anxiety. I confided this information in him before I told almost anyone else. I asked that he not treat me any differently knowing the truth and he hasn't which I'm happy about but I don't know how he feels about me. He could be thinking so much about me that I don't know and I don't know how to handle this. He treats me like the others but I know he must think differently about me, knowing this stuff. 

This isn't my only problem. Like I said before, I think I like him. All of a sudden he went from seeing him as a big brother to more then that. I kept telling myself that we're only friends and that won't change. I don't want to ruin the friendship that we have.

 Way before this happened, I told myself that I wasn't old enough to be in love. That I didn't understand love and that anything I did then would only hurt my chances with someone later in life, when I am old enough. That I was young and dumb and that if I waited long enough that the right person would come at the right time. I still think I'm a little too young but I do understand more about love now then I did when I told myself that. I want to wait to ask him out when we're in our junior year and can actually drive and pay for things but I can't help but wonder. What if by then, it's too late?

This is where you, the older and more experienced people, come in. I'm very much clueless about what I should do so ANY suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!

In that class, she had also claimed that anxiety and depression and such disorders were basically ""all in your head"" or caused by that darn social media which had made many roll eyes and which I believe isn't even factual. Around a day later when we were sharing important values of ourselves she commented on the fact that not one student she has had said that God was among their important values once again bemoaning said statement.

I tried to show interest by making eye contact, but I think I've messed this up and just made him think I'm a weirdo - as we always go to the coffee shop at the same time and we're both regulars he sees me there often, it also means we're often in town at the same time so see each other after the coffee shop while walking around, but my anxiety has me worried he thinks I'm a creepy stalker.

I was at a coffee shop writing and a stranger (male, 30's) struck up conversation with me. He was normal and also happened to be a writer. He saw I was using an outdated writing software and offered to give me the newest version. He pulled out a [USB STICK](https://imgur.com/a/2RN30dM) (drawn for you because I obviously can't find it nor do I have a picture of it) and said he could give me the new software from the USB stick. I was hesitant, but he was very eager to help, maybe a little too eager, which seemed off. Before I could process what happened, he put the USB into my computer before I even had the chance to agree. He kept trying to get me to type my password into an encrypted coding system thing (I'm not a tech person at all) but I had seen this coding before at my work via the IT department. I started typing but messed up a few times and never fully finished before he sensed that I was kind of weirded out. He exited out of the encrypter thing and ended up dragging the software onto my desktop. Then he said something like ""make sure to save this to iCloud"" or something. I left shortly after and I deleted the file almost immediately after leaving. So here's my question: what does this symbol mean (looks kind of like a less detailed ""Punisher"" skull but I can't find it anywhere online) and what could have been done to my computer? I'm not trying to be watched via webcam or the darkweb so should I hard reset my computer or is there anything I can do to see if I'm actively being hacked? Thank you!

At that time, I asked if I could meet or reach out to his other family members. Especially of note: his mother and my siblings.  He said no. No one knows of my existance and it's been too long now to uncover the lie. My mom sent a letter to his parents when I was young asking for support. He denied that I was his.

We grew up in a sexist, ageist, racist culture. People regularly hurt her physically and emotionally, verbally tell her how little she's worth, they basically make her the root of every single problem in the house and surrounding houses, and she takes it, she thinks they're right. 

I only know half of it, the other half she says she doesn't know how to put into words. It only comes up during specific scenarios that she shuts down, certain topics, like getting closer to people. She's terrified of doctors, but she's been to several therapists when she was really young, and said even as a kid they sounded full of shit and that none of them seemed to know what to do when it came to gender - also that she wouldn't be able to admit anything outloud since she can't even admit or know what she thinks herself. 

She was molested, and is sexually harrassed regularly by people her parents will instantly defend. The worst part is she's too afraid to do anything, she can't even try to try. She's so young, but she can't live longer because of how painful it all is, she has been physically paralyzed before which she says is from her anxiety, but again no contact with doctors. She's been infected for years, and is deaf in one ear. Even the thought of waiting long enough to move into a place is impossible to her, because she doesn't think she's capable of anything.

143,"I’ve been working at this company for three years and they’re ghosted me two times already, each time for periods of several months with no work.

They offered me my former’s boss’s job last week. He quit late summer and they hadn’t responded to queries of what happened to my job after he left until December, when they suddenly asked me to come in without telling me that it was an interview.

I was trying to negotiate pay with them because what they offered me was kind of low and lower than what I know my former boss was making. He and I are still on good terms so I was able to ask him.

I haven’t heard back from them for a while and think they might have ghosted me again, after the interviewing, after working for them for three years, and after they already offered me another job and we were in the middle of negotiating.

I’m super frustrated with them because the work we’re doing is creating community programs. How can we create public programming and expect people to trust us if our presence is on and off because employees keep getting ghosted?

It sucks that they expect me to stay available for them but can just ghost. 

I’m wondering, what is the best thing to say in this situation? I don’t want to cross the director I’m speaking to but I want to hold him accountable. I do still care about the job they offered me, even though I’m skeptical of having a good working relationship with him at this point because I know the program and care about the clients we service.

Is there a tactful way I can get him to realize how unprofessional his behavior is without him rescinding the job offer? Should I just ask him whether I should consider it rescinded because he refuses to get back to me? Should I call on Monday or is that super pushy?

I’m not sure how to act because being ghosted means I have no idea what’s going on at their end. 

I’m a good employee and wasn’t asking for an unreasonable rate. I have heard through the grapevine that the director tends to treat female employees different than men, so he may have gotten angry I was negotiating at all. I felt I had to, however, because I make more as a self employed person than what he offered me.

Thanks all in advance for any advice on how to handle this.",25Jan2019,1

149,"I’m from a mixed race background, but I was raised my entire life by my mother who is Mexican, and we aren’t traditionally Mexican, although, we seem to have the universal background as most Mexicans. What I mean is, we express ourselves differently and I’ve found that most (more so my older family members and their friends and acquaintances) do not acknowledge or believe in clinical diagnoses (there are some exceptions though but I don’t want to get into that) so it’s hard for me to explain how I feel, think and why I do the things that I do. 
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a preteen, but I wasn’t put on any real medication or was able to get therapy because my mother didn’t and kind of still doesn’t believe any of this is real, as if it’s made up to get free money from the government. Anyway, at 20 I was told I either have manic depression or a major mood disorder; this was after a serious medical incident where a psychologist was brought in to speak to me privately (he asked about my thoughts and concerns and activities and explained I was more than clinically depressed) and I needed help with aftercare from family, so still without money or any idea what to do, I never managed to get help. 

Just recently my primary care doctor told me he believes I have a panic disorder, along with what he truly believes to be manic depression, and that I should get help. I don’t know how to explain any of this to my family, especially my mom since I still live with her due to my illnesses, job and money issues (which I am so deeply ashamed and stressed out about). She thinks I’m either doing street drugs and/or not doing enough to get myself physically better so I can get back to work, but it’s hard and so damn embarrassing to tell her why I do what I do and why I’m losing weight, why I sometimes sleep all day and stay up all night, why eating anything makes me sick, and why I hate leaving the house. 

I thought about showing her YouTube videos about what I may have, but I know she wouldn’t watch or she’d blow it off and say ‘so why are you sending me this?’ I feel dumb asking a bunch of strangers for help, I really hate asking anyone for help because it seems to be that all I’ve done is take from everyone in the last few years, but I’m desperate and I don’t know what to do.",25Jan2019,1
151,"Me (22m) and my ex(21f) dated for about 5 years. The first three we both made a lot of mistakes which caused trust issues. The biggest of these being that we both had cheated on each other with the main difference being me sleeping with another woman but she did not have sex with another. The last two years we were completely committed to each other and I asked her to live with me at my university. She does and we spent 6 beautiful months together full of love. We spent about two weeks apart because I had a volunteer camp that I go to and then she went to visit her parents. During that time she called me and dumped me. It was like she had flipped a switch and had nothing for me. She couldn’t even talk to me about what was wrong and she moved out and in with her friend (female) from work in less than a week. I was completely destroyed and fell into depression. A month or two went by and she hit me up and asked if we could hang out. I thought that this was my chance to rekindle our love. We went on two dates, but she still had her switch flipped. She refused to talk to me about what happened, our relationship, or anything like that. She made plans for a third date but stood me up, claiming she was too tired but then went out with her friends. I was devastated again. No contact ensued until the last thanksgiving, she called me the night before turkey day and said she missed me a lot and we talked on the phone for a few hours. Her birthday was that weekend and she said to call her on Monday when she got her work schedule and we would schedule a day to hang out and talk. I texted her on her birthday and got no reply. On Monday I called and asked about the drink. She told me there was another guy in the picture and that he had asked her on a date on her birthday and that she’d like to see where it went. I was devastated once again and it hurt like never before. She blocked me on everything and we didn’t talk at all. That was until three days ago. It was the night before my birthday and her number rang across my phone at about 10:00pm. I answered. She said that she missed me. We talked for about thirty minutes and it seemed like she was talking to me like she used to for the first time since we broke up. She said she was ready to talk about what happened to our relationship and asked if I wanted to get a drink and talk. I agreed and we met up at about 11:00. We talked about why our relationship failed, she said that even though we were loyal in the later years the mistakes in our early years together brought a lot of trust issues and she felt like she wasn’t really loved. She said when she tried to talk to me about it she didn’t feel like I really listened or tried to comfort her. She said that time having had sex with another girl had ruined her self esteem. She also told me that she had had sex with the guy who was in the picture. This hurt a lot. But for some reason not as much as I thought it was going too. She said it was awkward and that she regretted it and that he was no longer in the picture. We hung out until about 2:30 in the morning and it was really nice to see her and talk to her again. It felt amazing but really sad at the same time. She said she still loved me and wanted me back but wasn’t ready right now. She said she felt like she should let me finish college and live my life. After we parted ways she sent me a text that said “I’m miss you so deeply. Have a wonderful birthday tomorrow, You deserve it ! goodnight love. We’ll be in touch.” I had some mail for her from her bank and the next day I sent her a message telling her that and saying I didn’t want her to get in financial trouble. She kept the conversation going and ended up saying that she wanted me. She came over and spent the night. We eased into it very slowly made love passionately and she laid in my arms and talked to me all night. In the morning we did the deed twice more and she stayed two hours later than what she had planned too. I sent her a message that said “Last night was amazing. Thank you. I’m always here for you. Have a great day and I hope I hear from you soon!” And all she replied with is a heart emoji. I don’t know how I feel. I love her so much I just want her back even though she slept with someone else, I know that sounds like some bitch shit to say but it’s the truth. I don’t know if I should text or call or just play it cool like I don’t care and wait for her. Idk what her intentions are or if she wants to be with me. I’m so confused. Sorry for such a long message but it’s a really complicated situation and i don’t have anyone to talk to about it. Thanks guys ",25Jan2019,1

161,"I am a 14 year old freshman who is currently at high school and I can't play video games on the weekdays. My mom has a very strict policy in where I'm not able to play on the weekdays and its really grinding my gears. I would go on my discord during the weekend and with a burning look of jealously of all my other friends playing together and having fun while I'm force to read books for 2 hours straight. The next day I would see all my friends gathering together and talking about their game play and fun they had last night. While I'm just standing there with no words but only thinking I wish I could play with them. Every time I ask my mom if could play even on a Friday, she would freak and say no. The thing is that I am able to play on weekends. But if i play more than 2 hours, she starts ranting that I do nothing but play video games all the time. Here's the weird part. Everyday she's always playing mobile games like ""cooking dash"" or ""candy crush"". She's literally grinding it so hard that the game doesn't have any more content left for her to play. Every time I make a remark that she plays games all day, she just yells back that she's not a student and that I have to study all day and why I can't be like the ""smart kids"" in my class. I mean don't get me wrong, I love my mom and she""s pretty cool sometimes. But if this goes on, I'm literally going to break down.

166,"Im kinda in love, not rlly love but i have a crush on this girl for awhile now.

long short story, shes a v friendly girl with a cute personality. I absolutely adore her ngl, we started talking on insta, started sharing memes everyday and so on. We'd have good convo. I knew her bestie, she is a very good friend of mine. Anyway we decided to make group plans but we got busy and never got around to it. At this point we were chatting for 5 months yet never met irl

i told her i liked her but we decided being friends would be best. She was still attached to her ex at that time and would sometimes tell me how much she miss her. She once asked me if she finds it awkward when she talks about her ex, honestly i don't. I told her not to worry as we're friends. Things were going good. We'd talk on daily basis, joke around and roast each other. I genuinely enjoyed talking to her. It'd cheer me up on the days i wasn't feeling good. I'm quite a reserved person and doesn't talk to girls much either. But i felt like i could share everything with her. While she was at work, i decided to go and see her. She told me to wait till she finished work. I did, she came from one part of town to another just to meet me. We were both excited to meet i suppose. 

Note: English isn't my first Language and i have speech impediment, which make things worse for me when im nervous and she was aware of that. However, that didn't hold me back this time and i still went to meet her by myself. 

After all this time, i finally had chance to meet her. We met and i went in for a hug, i usually dont hug as im quite shy. Anyway she was such a genuinely nice and friendly person. I was nervous at first but after awhile i feltcomfortable. We walked for abit and chatted and then took the bus together to home. I talked to her for abit that night and she told me i wasn't nervous at all and it was good to finally meet. I was happy lol

Next day, this is where it all went downhill, she started being cold, started ignoring my messages and stopped sending me memes. She started avoiding me after our meeting which sucks so much as we talked for 5 months. I felt like she has high expectations of me which i failed to meet those expectations. 

I asked her bestie what she said about the meeting, she said that she was saying how nice person i am and stuff etc. I was like okay cool, maybe shes busy, right? Happens. Couple days passed, she is still cold. I was kinda devastated and confronted her. She said she has been busy lately, thats all. I thought to myself, maybe she is busy for real, after all she have exams in couple of months.

Weeks passed by, it is still same. There was rarely any spark left in our convo and at this point, she aired my snap for about 10 days. One day i was at gym and put it on my snapchat story, that is when she popped up to me opened my snap which she never checked for 10 days. She said she is in the gym with my pin. And said she is almost finished.

Anyway, i still tried to start convo with her sometimes but she'd give dead replies or ignore my snaps. I felt heart broken as i thought we might stay good friends atleast, but no. 

Fast forward, last week, i felt like buying decent headphones, and figure i could use her staff discount card. She agreed to help me out, kinda surprised but nonetheless i was happy that she agreed to it. On Sunday, i was talking to her bestie, and told her that i might end up blocking her completely as i get upset when she ignore me my snaps etc and we barely talk nowdays.

On monday, i recieved call from her, she told me she in the shop and have brought my headphone. She'll wait for me at coffee shop. I was actually nervous seeing her, after all that has happened. But once i came there and saw her, i felt comfortable. She looked tense as she's revising for her exams. We chatted for an hour and it was nice, honestly i kinda felt good. I thought maybe things will be back to normal now. 

Unfortunately, it remained same. Our convo felt very forcedfull and i thought shes only replying cuz shes a nice person. I felt like i wasted my time on that person when i could just be in peace rn and all those efforts and good times for nothing like she could atleast try and stay good friends. 
But She'd give v ded replies and late replies. She left me on seen again. I kind of decided it'd be best that I'll just completely block her off from everywhere and move on. I finally mustured up the courage and blocked her from everywhere.

I'm not too sure if that was the right decision, as she could genuinely be busy. I felt bad blocking her and feel like a selfish asshole for blocking her, but at the same time i feel like it was the right decision than forcing convo and being sad about it.

She have my number, so i figured if she's bothered by it, she can always contact me. But i highly doubt she'll even notice that i have blocked her. Maybe she'll eventually. 

I'm still questioning my decision, was it the right move?",25Jan2019,1

Someone sent me the following message asking for advice and I felt it'd be better if it was offered to the newsfeed. He didn't feel comfortable posting it himself so I'm doing it on his behalf. Feel free to show him support and give any advice you may have. If anything, I hope this shows him, and others, that anyone who has these kind of feelings is not alone.

""I'm just kind of in a funk. I feel like I desperately need a man in my life to feel happiness. I've struggled with depression in the past, and part of it has to do with loneliness, wanting someone to be there for me. I think it's an addiction, and it causes me to exhibit really clingy and otherwise pathetic behavior. The closest thing I have to a boyfriend right now is my best straight friend, since we're so close, and even I feel like I'm pushing him away. Combined with the fact he might flunk out of school soon, he could be out of my life forever, and that scares me so much. 

Everybody says 'Oh, you just need to learn to love yourself!' But I really don't think I can. I've tried so hard to, but I think it's just like a chronic disease, where I can't repair my relationship with myself, so I cling to other people, even people that don't actually care about me. I crave attention from men, and constantly try to attract more male attention, either in crying for attention online with my own problems or just whoring myself to anyone moderately attractive or interesting.

I don't know what it is about me that can change this. 

Anyway, I really let myself down last Christmas time, only a month ago. I kept getting nagged at for a good 2 weeks by a couple of girl coworkers, telling me it'd be good for me to go and that a lot of people that are going are going to want to see me there. I tell them no, that I have to work the next day, but they continue badgering me about it. I finally say yes for them to stop, but at the last minute, when everyone was ready to leave and asking if I'm going, I told them ""no."" The disappointment I caused for them absolutely devastated me. To make matters even worse for my psyche, one of the girls that asked me is really cute, bubbly and cheerful. The expression I gave her haunts me. She even broke up with her boyfriend a few weeks ago. To think that if I had gone, I might have been able to date her. But I've already gone and screwed everything up because of this problem I've got.

I really just want to know if anyone has this type of problem and what might be a great way to solve it. My friend at work told me to just 100% commit to something and not think about not going. He even offered to drive me to the place next time, so I cannot drive anywhere else and am locked into the gathering.",25Jan2019,1
174,"Okay. So let me begin this by saying I am recently married and in love with my husband, so this is no cheating post, sorry to disappoint. 

5 years ago I was dating a guy in another town (I lived out of state) and things ended poorly. Him smashing my face in the counter poorly. What caused this? He was abusive, obviously, but he was also talking about killing himself and I called 911 for help because I didn’t know what else to do. 

My dad killed himself when I was younger, so looking back I believe that this was another shot at mental abuse, but at the time I was blinded and scared. I thought this guy was the greatest. 

He beat the shit out of me while we waited for people to get there, his roommate came home and thankfully got him away from me, or who knows what would have happened. I still thank him to this day, honestly. 

He went and got help, and when he got out, I was packing to move back to my hometown. In the midst of all this I found out my grandfather was dying. So timing sucks. He flipped out at me, calling me all kinds of names and things.

I eventually separated myself and blocked him on all social media. When I started dating my husband, I unblocked him (and everyone else I had blocked as a cleansing thing). He messaged me and we started talking. Everything was fine and normal. 

Now he’s telling me how he wishes he had been a better boyfriend to me, I should have married him, he’s really hurting, wants to kill himself again, etc. &amp; before anyone says anything, my husband has seen all of these messages, no I’m not hiding them. 

Part of me wants to help him, and the other part of me (and my husband) thinks he’s just trying to manipulate me again. I’m not  sure what to do? Block and forget him? Call the law? Let him talk it out? Or something else? ",25Jan2019,1

176,"This is not a joke. 

CONTEXT: I took over the lease for another girl who lived in the apartment. We have two bathrooms and I have to share mine with another girl. The old girl who lived there apparently had a lot of issues, specifically with my bathroom mate but ended up blocking all of them so I assume it was an issue with everyone. This girl EVACUATED the place like immediately. I moved in two days after her and she left all of her food, glassware, and some stuff in the bathroom. When I moved in I saw a paper I wasn't supposed to that had a list of all the openings in the apartment complex. The old girls name was on the list marked in red as an immediate removal due to ""unsafe situation concerning roommates boyfriend."" I was kind of concerned but really desperate for quick housing before the semester started and initially didn't realize that was the exact room I was moving into. I don't have the entire story and all of the girls have been super nice to me so I give them the benefit of the doubt.

PLOT: My bathroom mate is very respectful and nice. I met her boyfriend briefly. He's here nearly every night which is a little annoying because as far as I know, he's not paying rent. However, I never hear anything from them and I never run into him in the bathroom or anything which is super important to me. 

When I moved in, the toilet paper that was already in the bathroom was awful. I'm unsure if it was the previous roommates toilet paper or the current one, but it was that single ply, super thin, see through, make-your-ass-bleed, sandpaper shit that they put in public school bathrooms. I put a roll of my own toilet paper in the bathroom next to make sure it got used next. It's Charmin Ultra two-ply and I think it's pretty good quality. I know it's not really that big of a deal but I like to shit in comfort. 

Anyway, the roll was getting close to the end this morning but still had a good amount of toilet paper left so I didn't see a reason to change it yet. This was at 9AM before I left for class.

At 3PM I return to find that the toilet paper roll I set out was missing. I was really confused because I didn't understand why someone would move it. I then realized that the new toilet paper was already on the roll...with half of the roll missing...6 hours later. I'm irked.

I try thinking of reasonable explanations for why the roll is missing so much. I noticed that we were going through toilet paper pretty quickly with the roll before this. I specifically started cutting back because I thought maybe I was using too much. I started thinking maybe the boyfriend is the reason we're going through so much toilet paper or maybe there's more people coming through the house. 

Later on I begin to believe maybe I've exaggerated how much toilet paper they used in my head but when I come back again, the roll is even smaller. I even take a picture to show others to make sure I'm not crazy. This was at 7PM.

At 11PM I use the bathroom and see that THE ENTIRE ROLL OF TOILET PAPER HAS BEEN USED. It has only one to two sheets left and I'm really annoyed.

I don't know what the fuck they're doing with the toilet paper. I know it could be a medical issue but I'm thinking that she's using the toilet paper as like a substitute for paper towels to clean or something. 

I know it's really petty but I'm really bothered by this. She knew that was the toilet paper I bought. When we had the last toilet paper roll it lasted nearly two weeks and had clearly been in use before I got there. I'm bothered that she's inconsiderate towards the money I spend. I was really looking forward to that toilet paper too. 

I don't know how to bring this up to her. I feel ridiculous for even saying something. My friend said I should start taking my own toilet paper to and from the bathroom but that's so petty and more work on my part. Honestly, I also really want to understand what they're using this toilet paper for??? What should I do? I have to live here for the next seven months. ",25Jan2019,1
177,"I’ve always wanted a ragdoll cat- I’m just in love with the breed.  I kind of spontaneously searched for a breeder near me one day and found one. I called her, inquired her about the available kittens she had. We made a plan for me to buy the kitten and after the 2.5 hour drive I had my own ragdoll! Yay me, right?

This next part is why I feel scammed. I really don’t want to come off as nitpicking or ungrateful or that I wouldn’t love him either way. It’s simply principle.

Ok, anyways, a few days later I was looking at her Facebook and saw one of her queens named JJ, which is my kitten’s mother... And the description said ,”this is JJ, one of my maincoon females “ or some shit like that.

I paid a lot of money for what I was told was a pure bred ragdoll, not a mixed breed. I can’t help feeling a little disappointed.

I also think, due to her giving me a fraudulent contract, that I should get my money back. Not all of it, he’s still worth something (I don’t know how else to say that without sounding like an asshole) and I wouldn’t trade him for the world.

Okay, so as the title says my SO and I got rear-ended on the highway this past Thanksgiving. I was in my SO's car as the passenger. Nobody needed to go on the ambulance or anything; we got some of the usual whiplash but I also ended up slamming both of my feet from the impact and it ended up aggravating an old surgery site on my knee. My SO told me very emphatically to not involve his insurance policy and I agreed. Since he was not at fault at all I thought this wouldn't be an issue anyway.  I went to the chiropractor for treatment and they introduced me to a firm to handle my case. The lawyers sent me to an orthopedic doctor who put me on medication for the pain and swelling. This morning I get a call from the lawyer who said they would like my SO's insurance information so they can see if he has a medical coverage that can possibly help cover the cost of treatment for my leg. I asked them if it was going to negatively impact his coverage in any way and they told me that in the state of Georgia it will not. I then let them know that I would like to discuss this with him first. I tell my SO what they said and he flips out, telling me that this will have to be settled in court. I tried explaining to him that I'm asking him because I don't know and told them not to do anything yet. He then tells me that he can no longer have me in his car for legal reasons. At this point I start getting upset because because it now seems like a question of character when I have clearly told him I'm not going to do anything that'll impact him negatively and it seems to be falling on deaf ears at this point. It devolved into a pretty bad argument and now he's not responding to any of my contacts. It feels like he's cut me off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do and I'm pretty miserable and depressed right now. I don't know if the lawyers are lying or if he's freaking out over-the-top for nothing. It hurt so much that he wouldn't believe me. The funny thing is that they don't have his insurance information so I don't think they can do anything without his consenting to give it to me in the first place.

179,"Let’s call them C. C and I have been friends for a long time. C’s great. They’re funny, and deeply cares for me. Likewise, C is precious to me and I treasure our friendship, which is extremely close.

I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinions about things. I am not here to change anyone’s mind and tell them they’re wrong because their POV is different from mine. Usually if someone asks for my opinion I might share a thought or two, but I largely avoid it because I don’t want to start arguments.

There’s been some local news lately. C has fairly controversial opinions on them. Sure. Whatever. But C keeps sharing screenshots of the news with me, sometimes of the social media posts of the victims or people involved. C’s opinions were largely victim-shaming, and I briefly disagreed with them. My personal opinion is, I don’t condone it.

So C knows I disagree. But instead of letting the matter slide as we used to do, they press it further. Why do I believe the rape victim? Why do I have nothing to say about people who post RIP posts on social media, isn’t that attention seeking?

When their theories are right (the rape “victim” had lied), they feel proud that they’re correct. “See, I was right. You cannot trust or believe people like these.”

Also, C  pushes her opinions onto me, egging me on for MY opinion (which, frankly, I often don’t have any because I think I don’t know enough of the situation to comment). It’s becoming tiring.

What’s very weird and kind of uncomfortable for me is checking my IG and SC.

I do miss my friend, but it makes me feel pathetic, like I’m almost stalking her somehow. It’s especially awkward because I know that she can tell that I’ve seen her stories, and what’s more is that I can also check when she’s seen mine. I actually have been posting more often than I usually would to see if she’s keeping tabs on me, and I feel kind of gross about it.

My girlfriend is getting a good opportunity to work for her dad's company and possibly make a lot of money doing so. To put this in perspective, she could make 3 or 4 times what she makes now.

Then, i would need to make the decision between 3 choices; quitting my job and hoping there is a job opportunity for me when i move down there to live with her, trying to see how long a long distance relationship works until something gets sorted out, or break up and end a 3 year commitment. 

There is a lot of good potential with moving to this new city, but it requires a lot of sacrifice on my part and swallowing a lot of pride to give up what I've been working on so she gets this career opportunity.

187,"Posted in r/confession originally...

Some background:

I never wanted to do this but as of late I have been having guilt trips and nightmares. This is just a glimpse of some of the inappropriate comments he has made to me in the past. I was having severe anxiety everyday at this job but could not quit immediately due to signing a new lease on my first apartment. I also gained 50lbs in 3 years due to the stress and over eating. 

I worked at his clinic for 3.5 years. He owns a podiatry clinic in Ontario, Canada. In the beginning everything was great, I thought he was super charming and really enjoyed working there, learning new healthcare related info and meeting incredible patients. My boss would leave for Cuba every 6 weeks for a week or two for ""vacation"", at the time I had no idea he was meeting his wife. One day we connected over lunch and he confessed that he met his wife when she was 15 (he was 27). They met at the resort he was staying in, she performed on stage as a theatrical dancer for the resort entertainment. I was shocked to say the least, at the time He told me this when she was 17 and he was 29. He also told my other co worker who had been employed before me. At the time i was battling depression and was under immense pressure to make ends meet and I sort of pushed it to the side.

Fast forward: He has made uncomfortable remarks about our younger female patients to me a few times at this point. I started noticing how he would interact with female patients that were younger (as young as 5) he would be very flirtatious and would make unnecessary remarks. Some of the things he has said to me when the patients would leave:

""That girl flirted with me like she was 18"" (shakes his head laughing, said girl is 11 years old).
""Wow that girl is going to be very beautiful when shes older"" (this patient is 8 years old).
""She was so cute! Her and her sister...wow very athletic bodies"" (while referring to a 15 &amp; 6 year old)

One day i was working on typing clinical notes and had my hair tied up, he comes and stands next to me and says: ""I like your hair like this, it shows what you looked like as a kid"". Immediately i freeze, he senses i am uncomfortable and says to look at him (he used to do this a lot) i told him ""I dont want to lose my train of thought, sorry!"".

Before I had an arising suspicion, i showed him photos of my niece who is a year old, he exclaimed ""Shes going to be a hoe like her auntie!"" I was shocked and told him that she just a baby, and is he implying that i am a ""hoe"", to which his face changed and he solemnly said ""you're right, I'm sorry"".
One day he showed me an Instagram photo of a random girl that did not look a day over 13. He said ""can you believe shes 15, I think 15 is a good age"". 
WTF. Side note: Many parents have left our office in a hurry with their young daughters, we would order orthotics for them (he gets the orthotics for $75 and sells them for $500 btw) and I have had angry mothers tell me that the father of their daughter will come by to collect the product and proceed to shut the phone. 

He started posting videos on YouTube, him displaying his surgical toe nail procedures and wart surgeries. This caught traction and today I saw one of his videos in my recommended. I clicked on it, and saw that he uploaded a video describing how his show will air on A&amp;E in March. Something came over me and I truly believe that writing is a style of therapy so I came here to basically vent. I started having crazy anxiety at work and my demeanor changed completely around him. I started giving him one word answers and would cry every day on my lunch. I finally quit last year and have not looked back. I still remember the many times he has made uncomfortable remarks like ""My best friend is a virgin he is nearing 30 years old! So I told him to go to Thailand to lose his virginity"" (says this with a smug smile) I almost yacked right then and there. There has been many many other times he has made inappropriate sexually suggestive remarks about our younger female patients after they would leave. 

Ill never forget how one day he told me that I shouldn't think he is a soft sweetheart to everyone, how he has a dark side to himself that is very serious. Many times he would appear caring to his patients that are older and dealing with traumatic instances like not being able to trim their own toe nails; once they would leave he would say things like ""Those feet were disgusting, I couldn't breathe"".
I am bothered that he has a split personality, he tries to come across as humble and charismatic, yet I know the real him is narcissistic and pervasive. 

Btw, he tried sponsoring his wife when she turned 18 but The Government of Canada rejected stating that is too young, lol go figure. He tried again a year  later and succeeded. I met his wife, she is visibly younger and would stay at our clinic the entire day while he attended to patients. Some patients, who he has told about his wife, he has lied about her age and makes her 5 years younger and not 10.

Reddit, should I report him? All I have is hear say evidence...i almost forgot about him until i saw that YouTube video. I realize now i should have confronted him before quitting. He also tried to withhold my vacation pay as well. All in all a very troubling situation on my conscience. I hope the nightmares stop.",25Jan2019,1

194,"Throwaway... this is my first time talking about this. It’s not an easy subject. 

I am a married woman (8 years) who has had a very rough last two years. My husband went through addiction, rehab, the whole lot, got better, but our marriage was never the same. That’s another story for another day. 

A year ago almost exactly I was secretly seeing a man I worked with. Who was also married longer then I was, also to an addict who went to rehab and improved but he still wasn’t happy. Within two months I had some serious feelings for this man and had decided I could finally leave my spouse and be happy. This man from work and I had so much chemistry. Like fire. We didn’t care what it was going to take, we would figure it out. We always said “you jump I jump.” 

We both have children, so the decision was not taken lightly. Lots of long talks, lots of planning. We decided to tell our spouses we are leaving, I kick my spouse out, he asks for his divorce, and he brings over the first bag of his stuff while we plan on how to get the rest. That night we spent our first night totally out in the open together. No hiding, no fears, just happy. It was awesome. 

We ride into work together the next day and half way through the day I realize he is gone. Turns out his kid got into a fight at school because someone was making fun of them for their parents divorcing. Wife called him, he panicked and left for home. I noticed he had left so I leave too, only to be told that basically, he had changed his mind. He told me he was messing his kids up, and had changed his mind. He left me that day. 

The following days were filled with not so nice messages from his wife. We had a brief fb conversation where neither of us were nice, however she used many many bad words and I stayed pretty calm and collected in my opinion. The six months following him going back to his wife her Facebook was filled with posts set to public blatantly obvious about me. Even mentioned specific details about me like using a hashtag “youjumpijump.” I never responded, I blocked them both. 

So here we are a year later and I am dreaming about him every night almost. After being okay for the last year. My husband and I went through a lot of counseling and we are doing well! He is aware of all of it, and was actually there to support me when I was a crying heartbroken mess. Twisted, I know. I have guilt. She absolutely hates my guts, but I want to try to make it right. I don’t even know if I can, but I’m considering an email or something. A letter. Too soon? Too raw? Leave it be? How does one say sorry for damn near ripping two families apart due to my own selfish unhappiness? 

TLDR: should I apologize to the wife of the man that almost left her for me but changed his mind last minute.

201,"I am 18 years old and am just generally having a bad time. My first semester of college, severe panic attacks were an everyday thing and thoughts of suicide lingered in my brain. I've had a history of mental health issues but have never been treated for it. During my first semester, I took on too much and my grades showed it. I was working 40 hours a week hostessing, despite requesting to work 20-25 hours. I was struggling with settling into college work and dealing with my mental issues, which worsened during this time. Might I add, there was also the I-just-graduated-high-school-and-I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing-with-my-life panic.

I just started my second semester of college and I'm taking more easy-going classes, but they still require the same amount of time and energy. I started just starting serving and despite telling my boss that I needed less hours during school, he has been scheduling me for 60 hour work weeks. Mind you, I only have classes from 9-5 on Tuesday and Thursday. I haven't been struggling yet, but it's only the second week of this semester. The money is good, but I feel like it's not worth it anymore. I literally only work, work, work. I have no time to relax, rest, or spend time with my friends and family. I rarely get days off, as my boss works me like a slave. I requested Christmas Eve off and agreed to work Christmas, but he made me work all day both days. It's partly my fault, for not quitting or sticking up for myself. I'm going to, it's just a matter of when. I absolutely hate working. What's the point of doing all of this if I cannot enjoy my time? I want to enjoy the rest of my youth. I feel like I'm not living my life. 

My problem is, I don't know if I can do this anymore. What is the point of working full time and going to school full time? My mother is particularly adamant that I must have a job. She has always been harder on me than my other siblings, as they are superstars in travel volleyball- which is held highly in my household. My father, however, doesn't mind me working part-time or even not at all during the school semesters. We are very affluent. The only things that I need to pay for is gas, my phone bill, and car insurance- which isn't that much. 

My question is: is it bad to not work for a couple months? I really want to straighten out my mental problems and focus on my schoolwork but I feel guilty. On one hand, I feel like I need to take time to straighten myself out. But on the other hand, my mom will be on my neck about not having a job. I feel like it's a damned if I don't damned if I do type situation. What are your thoughts??",25Jan2019,1
202,So basically I have a friend (I'm 14) and she is non stop copying literally everything I do. I've been off school for a while for some reasons and my therapist told me to draw to relax me. Since then I've been in love with drawing and I posted my drawings on Instagram. I did draw the same style that I made up a long time ago too and she was copying my exact drawings and i was so mad. So I stopped drawing and she stopped too. She keeps asking me if she can go back to doing the same drawings as me but I told her it anoys me when she keeps copying my drawings. I told her to just think of her own art style. But she is getting all mad at me and jelous. She also messaged someone on Instagram and she told them that I told her I couldn't draw (wich isn't true) and that I got my style from the internet (also isn't true) she's making it into such a big deal but I just can't relax when someone is copying like everything. And it's gotten to the point where people think it's her art style and not mine. What should I do? I know this sounds pathetic but it bugs me because art is my favourite thing in the world. Could someone please message me privetly and I'll send screenshots?? Thanks,25Jan2019,1
203,"Luck Inversion Theory...

At what point does the odds of you having a series of unlucky events, during a specific time period, and atypical to what normal people experience, reach a level of what the luckiest people (aka lottery winners) experience. 

Context:

I’ve had a shitty year. ALL-TIME shitty year. I could get into it, but that’s not what this post is about. (Btw.. job loss, near death, infidelity, no more savings, living with Mom... etc...)

Got bad news today, and shared it with a friend. Having been friends with me for over 30years, understanding the arch in my life and how every other year has been, he mention that I was so unlucky this year, that I should buy a lottery ticket. 

It got us thinking... is it possible that the odds of my bad luck are so great, that in a twisted way... luck was in my side. 

So the 2 questions I pose to Reddit..

1. Is this complete bullshit, or can a stats/math guy develop a graph for this?

2. Should I buy a lottery ticket?

205,"Figured it couldn't hurt to try and get as much help as I can, so here I am.

I hope this won't be hard to understand, but I don't know how to put it all together.

TL;DR : Life sucks, I don't like school, nothing makes me happy or satisfies me, I don't have anything that drives me, and I have no idea what I'd rather be doing with my time.

I'm pretty unhappy (that's putting it lightly) with my overall situation. I can't recall ever being satisfied or super happy with my life (even when I was a kid I would often feel down and I would get bored all the time). I live an easy life; I have everything I need, I go to a good college, I've had good education, my parents are divorced but they're good friends, I've been in a relationship for over a year now, but I can't ever seem to find satisfaction in anything I do. 

I've always had an easy time at school, and college is no difference really. I half listen to everything, I never do my readings, and I still get out of most of my classes with decent grades (70s to 85s, 90s when it's something I have an easy time doing), but I don't have fun doing it. I can't get out of bed most of the time because I don't have the motivation anymore. Classes have started a week ago, and the amount of classes I have skipped is probably equal to or higher than the amount of classes I have attended. When I do go to class, I don't feel any better. I hate sitting there, waiting for time to pass. The cherry on top: when I'm out of class, I just walk around in the hallways because the few friends (not super close) I have left don't have the same breaks as I do.  I just don't see the point of going to school if I don't like it at all. I know it's so I can get a better salary when I'm older, but I don't seem to be able to care.

I have a hard time making good friends and finding people I can truly be myself with. I feel like there'll always be something that makes me want to step back and think twice about friendships. Idk if this is making sense...

I've been in a relationship for over a year now, and I'm not sure how I feel anymore. I love the person I'm with, but at the same time, a lot of stuff happens that makes me feel bad. We can get in useless arguments from time to time, she speaks about other people in a way that makes me feel like she's into them, she tells me about her celebrity crushes (which frustrates me so much. Why do you look at other people if you're in a relationship? I know she knows it can never happen, but it always makes me feel like shit). Anyway. I try to tell her about as much stuff as I can, but it's hard opening up to her because she has such a strong personality while I'm really not. Idk. I don't think I can really progress of I stay in there, but at the same time I have feelings for her and I don't want to hurt her.

I recently started asking myself a lot of questions on what I like in life, and sadly I can't ever find anything. There's nothing in my life that I find fun in doing, and I have no idea what I love. I enjoy playing music, but I get discouraged everytime I start playing again (it's like I don't have enough satisfaction out of it to want to put efforts in learning). I enjoy video games, but I'm never gonna become a pro and make money out of them, so what's the point. I like rock climbing too, but just like video games, I'm never gonna be great at it, so I get frustrated. I probably have more interests, but I can't think of them rn. (After writing this, I'm realizing that I'm kind of an all or nothing person).

I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months, and though I have grown a lot and I now have access to many tools I didn't know about in the past, I feel like I haven't gotten better whatsoever. I'm gonna start taking meds soon because of my lack of motivation, happiness, satisfaction, proneness to being depressed, all that fun stuff. I feel like I'm a broken person. 

I'm lost. I have no passions, I have no highlights in my days, and nothing to look forward to in the future. I try to live life one day at a time so it makes it easier for me to not get lost in my head, but it's not enough. I'm still young, so maybe it's normal to go through what I'm going through, but it's not really fun to feel like I'm just walking around aimlessly. 

There's probably some stuff I'm missing, so I guess I'll come back later. 

Thank you for any form of feedback. I may not be super convincing, but it is greatly appreciated 💕 

Sorry for writing a novel!

213,I have been ignoring calls from a friend because I was busy to meet him (and because he's very insisting). What should I say on the next call.,25Jan2019,1
214,"My father-in-law, Alan, who is in his mid-seventies, owns a ~7 year old corgi. His corgi, Juney, has always been overweight, but over the past year or so she has ballooned up at an alarming rate. She has a tray of food set out for her 24/7 (on top of being fed wet food twice per day), and is often fed treats and table scraps. My husband and I have talked to Alan about portion control, set feeding times, no table scraps, etc., but it doesn't seem to do any good.   


Alan acknowledges that Juney is severely overweight, and is seemingly aware of what he needs to do in order to help her lose weight, but he doesn't seem to be willing to put any of the plans into action.    


A few weeks ago, Alan called us in a panic, telling us that Juney was vomiting white foam. He wanted to take her to the vet, but was nervous about trying to pick her up, because he'd thrown his back out trying to lift her a few months ago.   


My husband and I drove over and helped Alan load Juney into our car. The vet kept her overnight, and diagnosed her with pancreatitis. She told Alan that Juney *needs* to lose weight, or the pancreatitis could reoccur, and possibly become more severe, along with a slew of other health problems that could start to happen because of her weight.    


When we've visited him in the weeks since Juney's trip to the vet, we've noticed that she is still on a free-feeding schedule, and my mother-in-law says that Alan is still frequently (multiple times a day) giving Juney snacks, treats, and ""goodies"" like table scraps and human snack foods. We talked to him about this and his response was that he feels guilty when he doesn't feed her snacks, and that ""a little bit won't hurt her.""        



I don't know what we can do to help Alan and Juney, and I'm worried that we won't have much time to do anything at all if things continue the way they are.   

Has anyone else ever dealt with a situation like this?

216,"So to begin, the Ex in question is THE Ex, The One Who Got Away, The Great White Buffalo, you know the deal. Her and I vibed in every way and our chemistry and shared interests were unmatched by many. Things in our relationship were a bit complicated, and I was making stupid decisions without any communication to her and she ended it. Since we met through a mutual friend (**J**) I naturally brought her to our friends group and she was an instant hit. After the breakup though things were pretty awkward at gatherings and for her sake I ducked out.   


Fast forward to about Thanksgiving time this year (two years later). I reconnect with another friend (**T**) in our group whom me and a third friend have known since middle school practically, so at this point we're family. He notices that I have been really killing it at having bettered myself in the last few years and was hyping me up to rejoin the group so they all could see. With that little push I messaged **GWB** to see if she wanted to try and be friends again and maybe catch up for coffee, to which she responded positively. Over the next month or so though, planning that out is a hassle, but I think nothing of it really. One day in December we have an impromptu movie night that day of **GWB** decides to come to. And since **T** gave her a ride there and back, I figure they are pretty good friends, giving me the idea to talk to him about her. Since I have a physical job and would like to be in way better shape AND it would give me opportunity to talk to him, I ask him to start working out with me, although he says we cant until after Christmas.   


Over Christmas when me and **T** are visiting our hometown, we meet up and drive around the area like old times. During this  I confide in him about all of my feelings about her and wanting to make up badly for my past mistakes and I just would not shut up about her at all. Everything seems positive and I feel like he might say something to her later on.   


A few weeks later we start our training and it goes pretty good, and I talk about her and how I want her back in my life blah blah, and later in the evening we sit down for drinks and he says ""Well that might be put on hold for a bit because uh... I'm dating her."" He begins to explain that our friend **J** had been trying to push them together for MONTHS and while he still wasn't sure about it it just kind of happened. But almost in the same conversation he told me straight there and then that he was going to end it (at this point it had been probably three days). Not only for my feelings for her, or because he had ruined another great friendship over a girl in the past, but because he really didn't like her that way at all. Allegedly he felt pressured into it for MONTHS by mutual friend **J** and **GWB** as well, and factor in that he is a fit as hell attractive dude who is awkward with women and dating and hadn't really had a date or sex in years, he just kind of went for it, hoping he would come to like it. He did however mention that he saw no chemistry with her or common interests, nor was he even attracted to her in the least (this came up a lot between then and now) and that he saw way more potential in her and I and really wanted to see that succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

To specify, I was very much okay with the relationship, out respect for her happiness, although definitely wary because I have known him for 15 years and know that she is in no way shape or form his ""type"" and can only see her getting seriously hurt, and so did he. He agreed to help me since he felt stupid for basically tripping over my plans to not only reconnect with her but befriend her and possibly win her back over.   


In the time leading to the breakup we talked about multiple plans to facilitate the break up without hurting her and dealing with the possible fallout, while also rebuilding *my* image in not only her eyes but in our friend **J's** eyes, due to their best friendship and her influence. There was an upcoming party for **J** that we were going to and he planned on being awkward as hell toward **GWB** leading up to, at, and after the party until breaking up two days later (relationship was probably only 6 days old when he finally did it). At the party she introduced him to ALL of her friends that were there, which spooked him a little due to how serious she seemed to have been taking it by then. I, knowing they were at that moment in a relationship but also knowing it was soon ending confidently strolled around the party as if I was cool with everything. Between the end of the party and the break up he put up with a lot of my paranoia (""What if you have no intentions of really ending it and just dont tell me??"" kind of shit) and put a lot of effort into reassuring me. He even brought our other hometown friend into the conspiracy (what else would you call it at this point) and did the break up call in front of me since he wanted a wingman to help him get it over with basically.   


He told her the facts: He didn't feel right about it at all, he just didnt feel any chemistry or common interests, he was afraid she was taking it too seriously, etc. etc. The fallout was not nearly as bad as we had prepared for, since we assumed **J** was going to start WWII, but she called him a little later to talk to him about it and she seemed very calm, although upset for her best friend. Turns out she was only trying to push them to fuck, not date, and kinda saw this coming anyway.   


So we breathed a sigh of relief, grabbed a few beers at the bar and walked around discussing the next courses of action. For the next two weeks we talked about opportunities to build me back up in the groups eyes and maybe catch **GWB**'s attention. A surprise party was planned a week before the date it was to be held for our mutual hometown friend, and we saw this as a perfect opportunity for me to stand out in her eyes. So we s=started a group chat, I took the lead and coordinated the fuck out of everything. During the week through the chat I was able to actually communicate with **GWB** (albeit in a public setting) and things thawed a little between us. **T** has to help **GWB** multiple times throught the week to gather materials as she was supplying us with a TON of decorations from one of her jobs. During this time **T** and I talk multiple times about trying to find him local girls, browsing Tinder, planning to go to bars to wingman for him, etc. And he mentions a LOT that **GWB** is absolutely not his type and he really isnt into her figure and isnt attracted to her at all. Maybe for my reassurance since he knew I was paranoid and might have needed it.   


Day of the party comes and we have a blast, although I kind of stress a lot about how perfect everything is going and a song I had to sing and all that good stuff. I got a ride there with T and the supplies he got from **GWB** however later in the night as everyone is splitting up and cleaning the house he mentions **GWB** is getting a ride from him. Now, I'm mostly stressed at this point because I'm waiting for the inevitable ""Oh I'm giving you a ride too?"" because of course I was never led to have assumed otherwise, because we DO have all her supplies and they DO need to get back to her house, but while a ride for her was discussed, one was not with me. So I load shit in his vehicle while they tear down decorations and jazz and he gives us rides home and things seem pretty cool as hell in the vehicle, chatwise.   


Now, the thing here is that after the break up we agreed that he should absolutely take a distance from her, to cement the finality of it, and to not give her anything to read into, etc. etc. Problem is, with this party, planning and gather junk,  they did have to interact a bit, but nothing too dramatic. However I did mention that he might be cooperating too much with her and she might see that as a sign or something. Basically she wanted his attention and he was (unknowingly?) giving it to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I have had a pit in my stomach since that night ended. The night after he came over to help me clean my house (we had trashed getting supplies stowed and basically making and painting decorations) and pick up some of his own stuff he had left, and I was braced for him to say something that night but it never came. Earlier that day I asked him if the following weekend he wanted to go bar crawling and try to get him some girl numbers and such, which I would have assumed would trigger an ""Oh shit I need to tell him ugh"" response. And that, for a few days reassured me. Until tonight when one of **GWB**'s friends posted a few photos of a get together that was that night with **J** and **T** and **GWB**  and a few others in it. They were not exactly next to each other in a ""hey we are dating"" closeness, but the fact that he had said he would keep his distance made him going to this gathering suspect. Earlier today he asked to hang out tomorrow after he gets paid, probably in the evening. 

  
I do not know how to proceed really. Around the breakup I gave him multiple chances to just admit if things werent actually going to end, and he told me to trust him each and every time. But the last time I asked I let him know that if I ever found out otherwise I would probably withdraw from our group for good, as well as boot him as a friend. At this point it's a trust thing and not a jealousy thing. He had been hyping me up to winning her back over and him finding another girl who he actually was attracted to and wanted to be with blah blah, and I had been trusting him hardcore to keep things ended.   


Since I know his stake in **GWB** would literally be because she's the only dog barking up his tree and he's desperate, I have the nuclear option of sending her chat snippets of him saying that he has no feelings towards her or that he isnt attracted to her, or just our general planning in general. I want her to be happy but if this is how things are going, I want her to know that she's only there because he can't find anything ""Better"".   


I'm not sure how to proceed tbh. I guess I'll find out tomorrow night what the case is, and I know I want to just end the friendship right there and go home and send her all the screencaps of chats. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this or if I'm actually right. If anything, talk to me, typing this out helped reassure things a little adn I think talking more might help idk.

I applied to some schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford, but she's been setting the bar really high. Ever since I got my first two acceptances (not to top tier schools), she's been putting a lot more pressure on me college-wise. Just because Princeton requested an interview with me, she thinks I'm going to get accepted. Just because I've got a relatively good GPA, she thinks I'm going to get accepted to everywhere. Just because I'd be third generation at USC, she thinks I'm going to get accepted there.
She's already wanting to plan college tours out east for when I'm on spring break. By then, I'll know what I've been accepted to and rejected from. I don't want to be touring schools I didn't get accepted to, but I don't know how to tell her that.
She's also trying to control what college I go to.

222,"I apologize beforehand, I was never good in expressing myself.

To begin with some background, I am big on family. My father and mother did not have the perfect marriage though always tried to make it work. I witness extremes of what it was to be a great husband, an amazing father, though moments of the opposite would occur. The same may be said about my mother, nonetheless, they loved each other immensely and made it work. My pops passed last year of cancer, he was and is my hero. Prior to knowing, we had bought a house together with our combined income. He went through great lengths to put my name on the title, (we had lost a house in 2007), to express *we* did this. The house, while materialistic, exemplifies the tireless work he had put in providing for us. He was also a miracle. He endured a near fatal car accident, having various surgeries including spinal-cord surgery later, and eventual removal of a tumor in his head. My pops never complained, he was a warrior. Regarding the house, it's the last thing he left my mom and sister. Currently, my mother and I are barely and struggling to make the mortgage payments of close to $2,900. To me, its sentimental, the last thing I told him was I'd make him proud. 

&amp;#x200B;

My then girlfriend, now wife, had journeyed with me for six years. She had witness the good and the bad. We also had highs and lows. After my pops passed I wanted to start anew. I had lost my grandma in 2017, and she lost two family members on her side soon after. So, in my thinking to offset the drama, I believed getting married would be symbolic of something good amongst all the heartache. I was also paranoid of someone leaving us and not being there to attend, we had a small gathering being money was and is tight. So we married seven months later after two years of discussion. She moved in with my mother and sister, that's when the drama occurred. My wife attempted to personalize some areas of the home, which may have been perceived as an invasion. I attempted to mediate though general bickering of who did or did not do what began in regards to chores and tasks. There was a lack of respect on both ends stemming across from my wife, mother, sister, and myself. Stress is still high and we did not properly grieve. I debate and question my decision to marry. The majority of issues regarding my wife stem from finances where the majority of my check goes to the mortgage.  All cumulated to a recent blow out where my wife and I moved in with my in-laws after I got into it with my mom. In wanting to help, my father-in-law stated we could reside for free; however, if we were to financially aid my mother, we would pay rent to them as well. We cant afford both. I want to help my mother yet my wife feels I been disrespected and goes against this. She is at home with her parents, says she is not, ""walking on egg shell,"" yet, we continue to argue. I was rash though believed things would change. She is traditional and tell me we are married and she should be priority. I feel we are going backwards. To spite me, she says I am not a man and attempts to compare my father and I for all he did while I am presumed to neglect her. I feel lost, I am caught in the middle. I cannot focus on my work and am restless. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what do I do? My mother stated she would move out yet I cannot allow that. I'd have too much regret. I question my relationship being she now wants nothing to do with my mother or sister and vehemently opposes helping them. It has got to the point she berates or attempts to instigate an argument. I am debating divorce, I felt she has changed since we married. This was also a reason why my mother felt some way with her, because we would argue in the home, we had no privacy.  I feel my wife did not try to mediate or resolve trivial issues after residing for three months. I could find a place of our own, though the the income my mother makes does not suffice a livelihood for her and my sister (early teens). Any and all advice is appreciate. Apologies if this was choppy, my heads everywhere.

224,"My best friend tried to kill herself a bunch of times in the past, but I stopped her those times.

My problem is we’re not classmates and I can keep watch if she’s cutting herself. 

She tried to overdose on pills back then, but then started resorting to cutting herself. My other friend in the same classes with her tries to stop her from cutting but she still cuts herself. 

Today she cut herself, there were a lot of cuts and it was deep. 

To give you a bit of view of my best friend,

-I met her back in 4th Grade and became good friends (we’re both freshmen in highschool) 

-Her parents fight a lot and her mom is sometimes abusive to her.

-Her Grandfather molested her when she was young.

-Her brother doesn’t really care about her

-she’s a shy introverted person

-has trust issues

She trusts me enough to listen to her problems and I try and help her as much as I can. I keep her away from sharp objects (I steal her cutters or anything sharp I can find in her stuff). 

She tells me that there are times she wants to cut herself because she feels numb and wants to feel something, but I tell her to avoid self harm but then she tells me it isn’t fair that she can’t do self harm but I can
(because she knows I used to be a masochist, but I don’t cut myself or anything. I buy those slurpees from 7/11 and try and get a brain freeze for fun and nostalgia, and if it’s not the slurpees she knows I listen to ear rape with head phones really loud. But I stopped with the ear rape thing, and they stopped selling slurpees in the country I’m in) 

Her parents don’t want her going to a therapist, because it’s too “expensive”. (I mean it is, but she’s trying to kill herself. Ffs just let her see a fucking therapist) 

How do I help her? And maybe finally stop her from trying to kill herself once and for all?

231,"Almost a year ago, I completely ejected from my former life. I had done the single-dad-dance for several years following my divorce and my ex-wife's subsequent descent into mental illness; throughout, I was also mired in a continued custody battle. The close of a bad relationship, a career that had dead-ended, my own mental health issues, and the worst Cluster Headache cycle I have ever experienced all combined in what seemed like a signal that my entire life was not working. Fortunately, my son's mother also found more steady footing in the lead-up (and we had made a lot of peace), so she was able to step in as primary parent, allowing me the opportunity to try to find a new way in a new place.

Unfortunately, this reset is not working as intended. A year later, my new chosen career path has not developed AT ALL as I had envisioned (I'm on my third role in this industry in the last year, awaiting the seasonal up-turn that will being back the promised hours for my second role), I've fallen right back into my old habits of laziness, procrastination, and porn in my off hours, there's been almost perpetual drama in the apartment I landed in (two former roomies have left for differing reasons and it now seems apparent that I should do the same), and I haven't made a single genuine friend since I moved.

All in all, I'm starting to think that I've made a huge and costly mistake, that I'm worse off than I was a year ago with absolutely no savings and a nearly maxed-out credit card (I tapped my reserves during my job searches), and I'm LONELY. Worst though, while some of the circumstances have been outside of my control, I can't help but consider the saying: ""wherever you go, there you are"". Despite the changes that I have made, I feel just as frustrated, failed, and hopeless as I did before I ejected and the only common factor between my old life and my new one is...me.

I'm not even sure what kind of advice I need, I just know that what I'm doing (or possibly who I am) is not working and doesn't seem like it's going to suddenly start.

238,"Hey there, I am a 21 years old man and I have suffered from shyness and low self esteem for my whole life.

I believe that the reasons for my low self confidence and shyness started from childhood because I was bullied, and from there it was just like an  avalanche with more problems getting along like being shorter then average, not having sex , not having enough social experience because my friends and family are shy as well etc.

So my current situation is that although I made some improvements by exercising, meditating and trying to get out of my comfort zone, I am still very shy and have issues with making friends and meeting women. In conversations I am usually the one to tell really funny comments and people like it and it appears that I am confident. However when it comes to meaningful, getting to know you, friendship building conversations, I can not find any word and don't know how to talk about myself or asking questions without being extremely boring. So as a result I talk to many people but still can't make connections, meet women and new friends in general.

I tried for the past year coaching and psychological treatment but found them useless. I am super aware of my problems and the reasons for them, and talking about it didn't help me at all. I understood that only by taking action I will have a chance to improve. So I signed up for a 16 week improv class that should start next week.

So my question is: Do you think that improv class might help me with my issues? In addition, for the people who were able to make the change I want to make, what other activities can I try to gain the social confidence and skills I need? I want to believe that by having enough good experience with girls and people I will be able to finally accept myself with my height and other flaws.",25Jan2019,1

240," I'm not sure what happened and what changed your mind. We decided on dinner and a movie. The last two times we saw eachother, you kissed me several times before leaving. There was a twinkle in your eye and a smile that could've reached to your ears. 

Then we laid in bed and you couldnt look at me. With your back turned, face in pillow you announced it was over. That you didn't feel it. I panic, is it something I did? You assure me it's not. Did we go too fast? Did I make you feel used like an old toy? Do you worry about my intentions? Because I never wanted to hurt you and I wouldn't intentionally try. From the first day, back in May I that you were cute. However you were hung up on a friend and I was getting back on my feet. I pushed it away because we worked together. Then the holidays came and we kept running into each other. We even worked one day and had a lot to say. A lot of the things you said connected with me and I'm pretty sure I said that outloud to you. I've dated men like you and yes, it was your mysterious mystique that I liked. You have better hair then me and just like me I noticed you hid beneath your hair. I get that eye contact maybe is uncomfortable for you and I feel that too. I didn't have any expectations  but that's how I am with all people. Not since reading great expectations when I was in fifth grade. So yes I liked you, I found you charming and handsome. You say no and run the away. I respect that and I am so sorry for any uncomfortableness I made you feel. 

We are still cordial and no one at works. Maybe you didn't like that and it was something I wanted. I just didn't see the sense in not saying anything if it isn't something yet. Yet being the operate word and not the definitive resolution in the future. Circumstances change and yes, I go at a much slower pace. Well whatever you're doing, i just want happiness for you and no, you weren't a stand in toy that was occupying my time until I found something else. I'm a very single track mind that juggling multiple men is not my forte nor do I ever want it to be.

Fast forward 15 years and I decided to look him up online for the first time ever.

I found a picture of him and the feelings came, unexpectedly, flooding back. 

He would be late 30s now and it is highly likely he is married with children.

There are no signs of a partner but he only has a business page online and no other social media. 

I decided to message him very casually saying hi and I know he saw the message and didn’t respond.

I cannot stop thinking about him despite this being out of character for me. 

Would it be creepy/weird to message once again and tell him how I feel or that I would love to reconnect if he is single? 

He also has his mobile listed online for his business, would it be totally crazy to call him even and just say hey, this is how I feel, would you like to catch up even though it’s been many many years of no contact?

247,"TL;DR at bottom

So the situation isn't as cut and dry as the title, so let me explain. I've known her since 8th grade, we used to go to the same school, and she's been my closest friend since, and my longest standing one too. (We're both military brats, so we moved around a lot, and I've lost touch with anyone I've known since 7th grade and before)

I've told her before that I had feelings for her during freshman year of high school. Can't exactly remember what was said, but it ended up with her getting mad at me, and we didn't talk for a couple weeks. After the couple weeks, she came up to me one morning in the gym before school started, nudged me, and then we hugged, and shit just went back to the usual after that. 

I moved away after sophomore year of high school, but she and I kept in touch, skyped a LOT, got to visit eachother a couple of times, sent memes to eachother, etc. 

I was supposed to come visit her again after senior year of high school, but I got arrested for drug charges on the last day of school. I got off relatively easy considering the charges, just 6 months of a self-correction program with some pretty strict rules (it's basically probation with extra steps). That aside though, it hurt not being able to see her.

Flash forward to summer after freshman year of college, I go to message her one day and I see that she's defriended me, not just on Facebook, but on any social media I have her added on. It's kind of complicated and involves some things that happened at our high school after I moved away, but the long and short of it is I thought that she didn't want to talk to me, and she thought I didn't want to talk to her.

That hurt a lot. I didn't know what to do, didn't know what I did to make this happen. So I did my best to ignore it and try to move on to some degree. I figured if someone just up and cuts all ties with you, they probably don't want you to be apart of their life. I didn't think about her any less, but my feelings for her faded.

Thankfully, a year and a half later (so like 2 months before this post) a mutual friend of ours was talking to her, and asked why she and I hadn't spoken in a while. Neither of them had spoken to me in quite some time, but the mutual friend just messages me out of the blue ""YOOOOOO"", and shortly after, she (the girl, not mutual friend) also messages me ""Yoooo"". She and skyped later that night, talked a lot, admitted we were both idiots, and things went back to normal(ish) between us.

We start skyping more and more, and then my feelings for her start to come back too. We visit eachother like a week and half later, and it was great. She's apart of my life again.

Flash forward to today, I'm about to study abroad, so I come down to visit her a final time before flying out, she's just recently started dating this one dude, they've gone on a couple dates, she really likes him. She tells me about him, gets all giddy at the mention of him. She says they're not committed, but I can tell she really likes him. Hearing about it and realizing it hurt.

So now I'm in a pickle. I can either confess that I do have feelings for her, potentially losing my closest friend in the process after finally getting her back into my life after going a year and a half without saying a word to eachother, or I don't and maybe these feelings go away at some point.

I don't care about having her as a significant other, she's already significant enough to me, and she does a lot for me by just being her and doing the things she does. I want to tell her, but at the same time, I don't want to lose my closest friend.

TL:DR is basically the last two paragraphs.

I emailed the company at the specific contact email a week ago, not being mean or anything just asking when I can expect my order to be shipped and I got no response.

252,"A little background.  I came from a large family.  But also a poor one.  Growing up, the stress of little money coupled with the many kids caused a lot tension between my parents, and between my parents and the oldest 2 kids(one was brash punk and the other they suspected of doing weed and possibly other drugs. A correct suspicion as it turned out, but that's resolved) . Unsurprisingly there were many shouting matches between my parents alone and my parents and siblings.  As little kid, you never forget all the fighting and you never forget how sad and scared it made you feel.

This is not to say we were an unhappy family. We had problems but we all loved each other.

So many years later(a couple weeks ago). I'm talking with my parents and my father asks what's the **very first** thing I think of when I think of my own childhood. I tell him the truth and say it was all the fighting.  Unsurprisingly they don't take this well. He puts on a miffed tone and say something to the effect of ""wow thanks,  that makes mom and I feel great"". I explain that it may be the first thing but it's not the only thing and it's not most important either. I explain that my siblings and I all know that he and mom did their best with cards they were dealt and we appreciate everything they did. That helps but I could tell they were still agitated by it all night.

256,"Im F(18) for context. But basically I started working at a local shop in October 2017 and a few people from my school work their and this one guy (let’s call him K) had been in a few of my classes since 2012 so we knew each other and each other’s friends pretty well (his mates would be the guys at our girls parties and things). 

My best friend (S) was put in a group for a school thing around dec 2017 and their group met for an hour a week for like 10 weeks. And she came to me saying he had this big fat crush and basically was obsessing as you do. I was super happy for her cause I thought I could get all his gossip and info from working with him and relay it to her .

By the time June 2018 rolls around I’ve spent so much time with him he’s like one of my best friends and I stopped telling S about everything cause some of it was super personal. We flirted quite a bit at work and he asked someone if I was keen for him but I initially said no because of my friend and cause we worked together. But as time has gone on we are so close and have a really flirty relationship and S suspected we had a thing going on but I denied everything. I’ve tried to get the courage to say something to him cause it’s obvious we like each other but he knows that S likes him and that’s my reasoning and also now I’m moving away for uni in like 3 weeks so there’s no chance of us being together and so confessing I have feelings would only jeopardise my friendship with S.

260,"Yesterday night a big family drama happened, in which some harsh words were said (including my father insulting me and my brothers, saying he'll kick us out, won't feed us and guilt tripping my mother for wanting 4 kids). I was dead silent during all of this, not knowing what to say or what not to say, because I didn't want to make matters worse. 

This didn't sit right with him though, because he decided that after I did one thing wrong, his whole list of things I did wrong unfolded. I don't know why he thought he had the right, but he decided to take it out on my SO who's 12000 kilometres away. He ranted about how he always talked so my dad just shut up. How he ate too much and drank too much. How he was impolite by just grabbing himself food and drinks. 

Since me and my brothers were small, whenever we wanted to do anything, we had to ask permission. Whether this meant wanting to get a drink, getting some food, going to the toilet or taking a shower. I'm unsure if this is normal, since it's what I grew up with, but I understand what my father says partially, these rules are the once he and we grew up with so he believes it's standard.

 However, when he told me he didn't want him back in our house again (later adding for more than a week because my mum seemed upset) I couldn't help but feel enraged. I see my SO twice a year, for 30 days. He wants to shorten this to 14 days a year. 

In some ways I feel like I have no say in this, that the only one to blame is me, I am not the best daughter, I disappoint my parents constantly and don't have a foot to stand on; they pay, their rules. 
But on the other hand I feel like I have to fight for what I love, my SO. He's the man I'm planning to marry and share my future with. we've been together for nearly 3 years and for him to think he has the right to not only insult him, but meddle in my relationship makes me enraged.

Yesterday night I had an hour long panic attack, cried myself to sleep and wanted to stop being me for a moment.

267,"  TLDR at bottom.

Introduction (its a lot)  

So I've been close friends with someone for around 7 years. We were kinda just acquaintances/""friends"" for the first couple years but quickly became way closer and have been for the past few years (would consider us pretty much best friends, at least way up there)  

I also have a female friend I've known for around 3 years. She's never been in a real relationship (she's really cute but her type is fuckboy I guess.)  

I thought her and my aforementioned friend would be a really good fit for eachother. They both liked hiking, exploring etc and neither had a ton of friends so this was basically the dream scenario for 2 of my close friends to start dating.  They were also both career centric and were just getting out of school (they're like 22 and 24)   

This is when I introduce them. I think the first time they met it was super brief and I don't really remember why they met, I imagine it was at the bar or something and we had a group there so I invited both. They meet, cool.  

Second time they meet is a day trip to a really sick hiking spot a couple hours away. They get along well, it goes great, cool. On the way back she talks about how cool he is when he's getting something from the store (he has some cool interests and interesting tattoos) and I'm like ***nice.***  

I start kinda talking them up to eachother because they both knew I was jokingly trying to matchmake them (it really was mostly a joke at first then became more serious when they showed interest)  

This...is truly **my greatest fuckup.**   

It's been nearly (please take note this word) a year since they got together. The beginning was actually REALLY rocky (a couple dumb arguments that shouldn't have really been arguments but went too far) so the first 3 months weren't too hot. At this point I was actively campaigning for their breakup but they decided to stay together which was fine with me. If they can resolve things, great. Like 4 or 5 months go by and things are well. To my knowledge there weren't really any fights and things were going really well and they were comfortable with eachother and from an outsiders perspective they seemed happy.   

Then around 2 months ago... it happens. He's been talking to an ex a lot because they had a good relationship and were comfortable speaking to eachother about things they wouldn't really disclose to anyone else. She noticed this and was really not the biggest fan. This is also around the time the guy started complaining there was never really anything to talk about. Admittedly she really doesn't have many interests and should try and expand into other things since she has pretty much literally no hobbies and not much to talk about. Then there's a night where he (ya know what, let's call the guy James) was with his ex watching a show together. In my mind it was totally innocent and still is because I really don't believe anything happened. Then my female friend (Jesse!) called me panicking. She said that James was with his ex watching something and assumed they were at his house (where the seating options are just a bed). She trusted him like 98% and just wanted reassurance due to the fact that it seemed sleazy that Jesse had told her basically nothing about his ex at any point. I reassure her, she calms down and goes home. Then later probably the biggest fight yet starts because of this. Turns out they were at the ex's house. James is going off about how she doesn't trust him etc and Jesse is just crying and basically regretting not trusting him 100% (another contributing factor is that they had talked around 5 hours earlier and it was a super lazy conversation. Jesse expected James to expand on the conversation and keep it going but he just didn't.)  

They almost break up this night but amazingly don't which is probably my fault for convincing him not to. To my knowledge their relationship was going really well at this point and I decided I didn't want it to end so stupidly. I guess this was another mistake.  

Throughout a lot of the relationship James was trying to convince Jesse to get an apartment with him. He didn't like his situation and hers was VERY bad plus rent isn't too cheap around here so to him it seemed like a great option even though they'd only been together around 6 months (I think) when these conversations initally started.  

She was extremely hesitant, rightfully so. She hadn't locked in a career position yet and neither did he and they were both kind of at inbetween jobs (still making decent money)   

Skip back to present time. I hadn't talked to either very frequently just because I was busy and they were busy plus its cold as fuck so its not like we're gonna go anywhere. About 2 weeks ago out of nowhere I started talking to James and he tells me that Jesse and him found a place together. They signed a 1 year lease and are splitting rent thats pretty decent individually but would be a little hefty for one person (1100)  

Now it seems like he really wants to back out. The relationship is extremely stagnant as she still doesn't really have any interests/hobbies outside of summer activities and seemingly his ex has had a large influence. I think she's kinda homewrecking but around a month ago she expressed having feelings of wanting to get back together with him and that's kinda what he wants. They had a good relationship before unfortunate circumstances really tore it apart.  

They move in in 6 days. The contract is signed. He seemingly wants out and Jesse has no idea.   

I told him that either he needs to:  

\- Break up, help her move AND pay his half of the rent despite not living there  

OR  

\-Move in together, make an honest effort (he apparently still loves her), try and learn things and find a hobby TOGETHER so they have something to talk about and see how things go from there. If he decides at that point he doesn't want to stay he should move out and continue to pay his half of the rent or at least a good portion for the remainder of the contract.  

I also added that he almost NEEDS to stop talking to his ex but he outright refuses. He says they;re too comfortable talking to eachother and can tell eachother things they can't tell anyone else (I'm offended tbh, jk) and he refuses to let that chemistry go.  

Personally I think Jesse is fucked over by literally any decision. She honestly loves him. I think since his thoughts right now are so blatantly selfish Jesse should be the absolute priority and he needs to make sure this turns out as good for her as it can.  

I don't really know what to suggest to him and Jesse has no idea. I did my best to end the relationship when I thought it was bad (there were several times before 4 months I suggested it and then I think there was another time.)    

Don't fucking ask me why they decided to get a place together literally a month after nearly breaking up (according to him there was even a fight AFTER that which was nearly another breakup)    

This is on top of the fact that they haven't even been together a year yet.    

They were so similar I honestly thought it was going to be great but now I'm pretty sure Jesse is just gonna be really hurt.  

**TLDR: I MATCHMADE 2 GOOD FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY HAD SIMILAR INTERESTS AND WERE IN SIMILAR SPOTS IN LIFE. THINGS WERE BAD EARLY AND I SUGGESTED IT END BUT IT DIDNT. THEY WERE ISSUES WITH BOREDOM AND TRUST IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND NOW THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL WHATSOEVER BUT THEY'VE DECIDED TO SIGN AN APARTMENT LEASE TOGETHER AND ARE NOW LOCKED INTO MOVING IN. NOW IT SEEMS TO ME, 6 DAYS FROM THEIR MOVE-IN, THAT HE MORE THAN LIKELY WANTS TO GET BACK WITH HIS EX.**  

The TLDR is kinda shit, I just suggest taking a few minutes to read if you have 5 minutes.  

Thanks.

268,"So I haven't told any of my family or friends about this because I've been so embarresed. But now this is a nightmare thats following me around

So 5 years ago, I was 20 years old and I met this girl(27) on a chat board. She lived a few hundred miles away, but we would chat on skype and whataspp. Long story short, we chatted everyday and things became a bit ""intimate"", for an online relationship at least. This happened over the span of probably 2.5 months. (just note, even though we talked everyday for 2.5 months, I never told her my real first name, I gave her my middle name which she thought was my last name).

Anyways, I honestly started feeling really disliking the idea of ""being with someone"" who was so much older than me, that ive never met, that lived far away, and was from online. So I pretty much ended things by more or less ghosting her. I know, not the best move, but honestly I was 20 and stupid, and she was much older. About a month after that, she somehow found all my friends and family on facebook, made an imposter profile with my pictures, and requested them. The profile had a long bio about how awful I was and that I was abusive to women, sexisty, bigoted, etc. She said that she was a victim of sexual abuse, and that I stopped talking to her because I was unsupporting and other very false and hurtful things. I was mortified, but kind of told everyone that it was probably someone playing a prank on me. (i knew it was her because she used photos that I sent her). I was also shocked she managed to find me since she didnt have my first or last name, she only had my middle name and a few other details to go off. I may be using the term stalker liberally here, but still. Anwyays, ever since then, I've had a lot of anxiety about social media, have deleted everything out of fear, and been out of touch.

Fast forward to 2 days ago. It's been a little over 5 years. I'm havent thought about that in ages. I finally developed the confidence to get back on social media 4 months ago. And 2 days ago.... 2 fucking days ago I see a friend request from her. I'm so shaken up right now. I mean, this could just be an innocent/no hard feelings, but still. What should I do? My biggest fear is she tries to defame me to my friends or family again. Should I reach out to anyone? A lawyer? lol

Also Should I deactivate my account now or just leave it?",25Jan2019,1
269,"Some back story, I'm currently a junior (11th grade/second to last year) in highschool that has to think about college apps and what I want to do in the future. I know I don't have to make everything set in stone now, but I just at least want some sort of plan. I'm going through a tough time right now, and in a result of that I've been skipping school. I was in IOP (In/Out Patient) for mental health in the beginning of the year, so I missed many of my classes. Following that, I've been leaving school early, or not going to school at all, due to stress-induced migraines that school and my medication give me.  So much so, that I'm marked chronically absent by my state. You'd think I would be able to get a doctor's note to be excused for all of this, but with the new year my family's insurance changed making me have to get a new therapist, psychiatrist, pediatrician etc. So, I don't have a doctor's note. There are a possible 181 days of school, and right now we've gone through 84. I have been absent for 25 days, and the education law in my state says I have to at least attend 150. Since the days of me being absent have been growing exponentially, I have only a few options most of which involve money that my family doesn't have. 
1.) Home instructor - I'll have an tutor come over to my house to catch me up on everything I missed 
2.) Summer school - self-explanatory 
3.) I graduate with the class below me
4.) I get kicked out of school/drop out 
- you might be thinking, why don't you just go to school? I don't have any good excuses here, but I have an anxiety disorder which causes a depressive disorder and insomnia.  I have great friends and teachers who support me, before I left school my grades used to be A average. I've been to multiple programs and they just send me from place to place, saying that it's just how my brain is and I'll find coping mechanisms if I go from place to place. But, lo' and behold it's the same in each place, don't get me wrong, they do work for most people, but I'm just one of ones that's out of the drift. Anyways, back to my problem, I want to drop out and get my GED, take a gap year, before I study animation or graphic design. My Asian parents are obviously against this, but since I'm the youngest child they've given up on trying to make me ""successful"". Just because I'm not at school doesn't mean I'm not doing anything though, I've been working hard on learning animation programs, learning about graphic design (me and my graphic design teacher are pretty close so we email frequently), and I've been keeping contact with my other Honors Art teacher for critics and things I can improve. I've also gotten a hold of the digital arts/animation teacher at my highschool and he said that would be willing to help me with works. But, I feel like my attempts to get on track aren't enough, a lot of the adults in my life are against it, but at the same time if I'm going to want to sort myself out, why can't I get myself on a track where I'm actually doing what I want to do versus the old me who didn't want to do anything in life? I know it's a bit unrealistic because a lot of people aren't doing what they like and are just getting paid, but I don't know anymore. Damn, adulthood! I don't want to think about it, but at the same time I can only think about it~ so what should I do? Do I drop out and do my own thing, or should I just finish highschool?

276,"Hi, thanks for reading.

Im currently 23f, living in London, in my final year of university. It has taken me 5 years to get to this point in my degree because of issues with mental health. It has been a huge goal of mine to finish my degree and I'm nearly there, but the anxiety caused by this situation is distracting me from focussing on the final hurdle.

I have been living in a1- bed flat with my boyfriend, him covering rent, and I bills. We have broken up and I cannot cover the rent for this place by myself so I am going to need to move before the end of March (2 months notice). My dilemma is where I'm going to go. 

My mum lives in London also, and has said I can stay with her. The problem is the home I come from is abusive, and my relationship with my mother is very strained.  Not only this, but she is a hoarder, not the most extreme, but to the point that it is very dirty and uncomfortable to be there, there is many animals (which I don't mind but that I am allergic to) and and a slug infestation. Growing up in this enviroment has given me a slug phobia and paranoia of contamination. She is very defensive and reluctant to help me maintain a clean environment, and it would need an expensive deep clean/clear to get it back to a state that I'd conder normal. I am very anxious to go back into this toxic environment and not sure I can handle it. I have overcome alot of my struggles, but I am not sure if returning would bring them back, it is giving me alot of anxiety just considering it. I am scared to test my mental health at this important time in my life, I just want to be able to finish my degree.

The other option is to get a place of my own. I have looked into sharing in London, but it seems a simialr price to get a small studio, and then I don't risk terrible roomates. I have £15,000 in savings. Living costs would be bout £1400 a month. If I do this, I might save my mental health, but eat my savings away quickly. I have no job lined up after university so it is a huge risk. I'm very aware that I would likely get trapped in the renting cycle, never being able to afford to buy. Maybe I should not be looking that far ahead in my position.

I have been working part time life-modelling recently, because it is very flexible and pays relatively well. It's not many hours though. I'm aware that as my exams get closer I will need to focus and won't be able to manage working aswell. I'm considering some kind of sex work because of the money, but it's not something I want to do, I am just so stressed.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated. I'm feeling really alone and stuck between a rock and a hard place. ",25Jan2019,1

287,"Hi! I really need your advice on this thing I've been struggling with for the last few weeks. I will explain the backstory:
There is a celebrity whose work I like very much. On top of being brilliant, he is very handsome, so I decided to tell him that. With a clearly unreal account (nonsense name, Jennifer Aniston picture, silly bio) I will occasionally compliment his appearance and make some ""flirty"" comments over things he says. I try my hardest to be respectful. It doesn't seem to bother him. Au contraire, he even started following me on Twitter. I am very happy, even if that's silly, but on the man's comment sections I ended up meeting a particularly nasty person.
One day, I saw another girl (let's call her Paula) saying some flirty things to him. I humorously made a comment about liking him too, and the chick blocked me. I got confused, so I blocked her too for some reason. Some days later, another account (let's call her Sarah) replied to a comment I made on the celebrity's account. There, she gave me some nasty advice on how to flirt, and I replied some polite bullshit about how my courtship intended to be different. My online persona is very formal, so what I replied was nearly humorous as it was so serious and stupid at the same time. I forgot about Sarah as she didn't reply.  A few weeks later, she replies to a comment of a comment on one of my posts. Surprised to see her back, I check out her profile. There, I find a profile filled with insults to me, where she dissects everything I post and observes every interaction other users have with me. After replying again (a mistake, I know, but a polite one) I block her. She retweets the posts of yet another fake account, a male, which I also block. By that time, I create another account to best observe the situation, but make a mistake and for some reason follow my first account. She says I am a suspicious account on Sarah's twitter, and ""warns""  Paula about it. I check up on Paula with my new account, and find out she has a bunch of insults directed to me and claims I stalked her (I barely found out about her account). I realize through the words she uses, her punctuation, and her likes and dislikes that she must be the same person as Sarah and the male account. I gather all Sarah-Paula interactions are probably to make me think they are different people. 

I had previously been worried about being followed, so I disabled locations and my phone number. The only thing still there is my real e-mail. 

When I realized the lady created a whole scheme to stalk me, I looked up all her names on the Internet, and most are completely fake. Paula isn't, she really exists. I have never gotten even close to the woman, let alone met her, so I find it unlikely she knows who I am. Apparently her problem is with my Jennifer Aniston account.

Anyway, I get worried. Who is this person, what does she want, what can she do? I've read it's possible to locate Twitter users, but don't you need a lot of skill for that? Will she be able to find me? Do I find myself in a Fatal Attraction-type plot?

As stupid as it may sound, closing my account makes me very sad. I am very awkward socially, and this was the first time I was successful in my interactions, as stupid as they may be. A goddamn celebrity was following me. I am finding it very hard to stop doing this, but I still worry about the lady. I reported her several times, but she never uses my account's full name, so Twitter ignores it. I blocked her, but she peruses the celebrity's comment section to read my tweets.

How can I make myself safe?

I am very sorry if this is confusing. I have been very worried about this for some reason.

TL;DR: woman made complex stalking scheme to insult my humorous, completely made up account. What can she find out about me? If she really is as creepy as she seems, what are her possibilities? What should I do to protect myself?

291,"**TL;DR** I always had ones with almost doing nothing, school then got harder and I failed to start actually doing something. Now I'm almost failing school and can't motivate myself to be productive

\---

**Disclaimer:** I'm Austrian and speak German as my native language, so **a)** my English won't always be 100% understandable, but more importantly **b)** our school system differs quite much from American, British and other school systems: Grades are numbers 1 to 5, one being the best and 5 the worst, you get a 5 if you have less than 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**: In elementary school I always had ones without doing much if anything at all. In high school (or our equivalent of highschool) I got some twos and even threes in the first year, still not doing very much, and then gradually worsened but still getting ones and twos in most subject (Math, Biology, Physiks, etc.). I already had some bad 4 in languages (German, English and Latin), manly because I haven't done (m)any homeworks, but I always got out of it with writing one text or so, so I still didn't worry at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current:** Fast forward to this semester, which is almost over now, I have a 4 in English, though this is my smallest problem since I almost got the 3, I'll get a solid 4 chemistry because I supposedly haven't handed in a single assignment, though I definitly did, but lets keep that away for now, and German and Latin

Latin has alway been more or less of a problem and will still be for about 2½ years. I haven't realised I have to take it in 3rd grade, and now I can't drop it since we are already the minimum number of students for it to come about. Last exam we had I failed with 19/60 points, and, as already mentioned, we need 50% to pass. A smaller test we had recently I also failed misserably, and I don't now why, but I completly fail to actually sit down and learn vocabulary for more than 10 minutes.

And finally, my currently biggest problem, German. I had a very close 4 on the exam, but I only did one out of about 5 to 10 homeworks this semester, am only participate passivly in class and failed an oral exam today, even though I probably would have made it with a single hour of learning.

I have a retest in German and probably Latin aswell in 3-4 weeks and definitely need to pass those, else I'll drop out of school, but since I have a really big problem with self motivation I first need some way to start learning and don't imidiately find something more enjoyable to do after only 10 minutes.

Any help or stories how you overcame such a problem would be greatly appreciated!",25Jan2019,1
292,"I have to get this off my chest. 

I’m F, Asian, and 20-30 years old. 

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a manipulative guy. He lied about almost everything. But I was still so attached to him. So I began hooking up with guys to try to forget about him. 

I went on Craigslist. 

Long story short, I went to this guy’s apartment. Let’s call him John. Unbeknownst to me, John had a friend there as well. John and his friend were both African American. John would be the 2nd guy I was meeting off Craigslist on an attempt to forget about my manipulative ex so I was still very nervous. I mean, to begin with, anyone would be nervous meeting ppl off Craigslist, second time or not, so I was just super nervous and just not really there. 

And unbeknownst to me, John’s friend was recording videos of John and me and taking pictures too. John and me engaged in PIV sex, oral sex. To be totally honest, I really wanted to leave as soon as John’s friend started recording. The whole situation, thinking back on it, gives me tremendous anxiety. 

I’m NOT ashamed about having sex. I’m ashamed John’s friend started recording without asking for my consent. I’m upset that even if he had asked, I would have been too scared to say no. I was in a stranger’s apartment and it was two men against me. 

I think John’s friend did delete the videos and pictures? I really can’t recall. But I don’t think he deleted them from the “recently deleted” folder.
This is where I’m stressing out. I don’t know if John’s friend distributed the videos and pictures amongst his friend group. I know it’s highly likely he did if he had a backup of the videos and pictures and that really makes me just want to scream. It also makes me highly anxious. I can deal with strangers coming across these videos of me. But if my Asian parents were to ever find out, I really think I may just as well be dead. 

I have a therapist but she is Asian and I don’t think I can ever ever talk to her about this. What if she tells my parents? 

I can’t talk to anyone really about this. They will judge me. They will say it’s my fault for going to John’s apartment in the first place. I really never in my wildest dream thought John’s friend would be recording me and John. John was pretty polite in the email and in person and he never once mentioned that his friend would be recording us. 

What can I do? What should I do? 

If this happened to you, how will you move on from this? How would you deal with the anxiety and shame of knowing that there might be videos of you having sex floating around on the Web? 

Once again, I am not ashamed of having sex. But I still do not want strangers watching these intimate videos of me in a vulnerable and intimate light. I don’t want these videos out there. I want them gone. 

I am angry because John’s friend probably does this for fun and never stops to think about the non consenting “participants” feelings. To him, it doesn’t affect him at all. He walks away unscathed. No one will call him a whore. His family will not freak out and go berserk on him.

297,"OK, I'm not sure if this is advice I'm after or just a rant, but any input would be read and taken on board.

So about 10 years ago, I met a Dave and we had sex. I ended up working in the same bar as him. He met Tracy who was a friend of a friend (Betty) of mine. He was always saying she was nuts and that they weren't going out. and Betty is always saying he really likes you. There were a couple of after work partys which I was dragged along to by a friend Betty and I stay the night at his after much alcohol (nothing happened) The next morning she is banging on his door shouting. 

OK clearly I'm being strung along. I left it at that but kept working at the bar.

At this point she now fucking hates me because apparently someone told her that I told them I had slept with Dave. (I suspect Betty) 

Over the years, She married him, she divorced him. She's had 2 serious relationships since and now a baby. She contributed to getting me fired, She's had it out with me saying ' I just want to know the truth which I have given. 

She either thinks I slept with him when they were together or lied about sleeping with him when they were together. I can't bloody win. 

We have been at various events together and got on well enough and she even invited me to get baby shower (I didn't go)

I found out that at the weekend (from Betty) someone mentioned my name and she went mental saying 'how dare you talk about that bitch who slept with my husband'

I think that Betty is probably causing drama and doing the whole she said you said between me and Tracy.

It's been a decade! It makes me really uneasy and unsafe that she is clearly still a bit fixated on me. I'm a happily married mother now. Even if I had been in the wrong it's 10 years later. 

Should I have a show down? Or just drop Betty as a friend and thus any connection with Tracy. We live in a small town but I can probably avoid her well enough. ",25Jan2019,1
298,"So a little background: I have always been interested in space, physics and math. So during High School I was pretty sure I would continue studying something along those lines in university. During high school though, I had a terrible math and physics teacher so it wasn't very motivating. I had a general interest in all sciences though, and had a great Biology teacher. At the very last year of high school I started thinking about medical school and while my grades weren't enough to enroll directly in my country, I had the opportunity to study in another country. A classmate wanted to do it too, so after a lot of thinking, I thought that I would apply. My thinking was that while I was interested in math and physics, I also love helping people and I like science in general, and helping people would be more satisying in the long run rather than studying math/physics without a clear picture of what to work with later.

&amp;#x200B;

 I passed the enrollment exam and got enrolled. I studied there for 2 years in total, and started questioning whether it was the right choice or not for most of the last 1.5 years of the education. I started feeling depressed and anxious and started doing worse the last semester in year 2, and although I only failed one course, it was a big course and with the strict rules of the university, it meant that I had to repeat the whole year. I decided to take some time off and figure out if I should continue or study something else. I took a break for a semester and studied math and physics on my free time, and decided that I really want to study it in university level. So I enrolled into an masters program in engineering physics and I am now in my second year. 

To be honest, I have found most of the courses very interesting, although tough. But recently I have once again started doubting. I feel the pressure of getting older (I am 24) and the economic pressure (I am only able to get student loan for 4 of the 5 years in my current education). So I really cannot afford to make more ""mistakes"" by dropping out and starting something else or continuing unless I am sure. Many of you will probably say that if I find the courses interesting and enjoy them, then I should continue. While it is true that I find a lot of it fascinating, I like it more on a theoretical level and find it difficult to get a clear picture of a job I would enjoy in relation to it. So right now I am once again starting to feel down and studying becomes difficult because of it. I feel stuck and don't quite know what to do. Any advice on things like what I should consider, how to proceed, etc. is very appreciated!

316,"I'm a very shy person. I have social anxiety and over the last year it's gotten a lot worse, and it's at the point where I'm constantly frustrated by it. It stops me from fully contributing in my college group projects (despite the fact that I love my course and I *really* want to be an active team member), and I'm struggling to make friends even though I have plenty acquaintances. I feel like it's controlling my entire life, so my resolution for 2019 is to learn how to get my life back from social anxiety. I started by signing up for counselling (I've had counselling in the past, but I definitely need to go back) and taking a more active part in my college's theatre club.

Next on my list is something I've been thinking about for a while. I'm past the legal drinking age in my country, but I've never had alcohol before. Having social anxiety means that I've always been afraid of getting drunk and letting out too much of my personality in case people judge me negatively (I am aware that that's a ridiculous fear), so I just never drink alcohol at all. I've never even had casual drinks with my friends, and I'm tired of turning down the opportunity to be with people whose company I enjoy just because some anxiety problem tells me I shouldn't.

But how do I go about having my first drink?",25Jan2019,1
317,"I work at a tech company. Our manager, who reported to the VP, left supposedly from burning out about 3 weeks ago. Since then there've been talks with the VP on how to restructure our very unstructured and constantly overwhelmed team, merging it with other teams from mergers, putting people in charge of various things, etc. I gave my opinion directly to the VP, and he was quite condescending to me when I spoke to him despite everyone I work with lauding me all the time. 

On Wednesday he scheduled a meeting for a subset of us on the team, about \~10/12 people, for Thursday morning, without telling us what it was about. Then Thursday morning he announced the new structure and our new roles in front of everyone. He would announce someone's role, then ask them how they feel about it. Of course, what could we say candidly in front of 10 people, including our new and old managers? We couldn't ask ""what's the title? pay? concrete responsibilities?"" When my tech lead who was on the phone said ""I'll be sad to lose \[me\]"" the VP said ""well the feeling is not mutual, she's grinning ear-to-ear."" This wasn't true and I tried to protest but he talked over me. 

We all left rather shocked and unsure about how we felt. 

In retrospect, in the meetings leading up to this where they were deciding these things, he included the more subservient or, dare I say, socially ""weaker"" members of the team to help him make decisions rather than those with the most knowledge (like my tech lead who has been around for many years and been a manager on and off).

I don't know what advice I'm looking for, I'm just feeling upset. I have nothing good to say about the VP in general, I don't like him and people around me don't seem to like him either. I've thought about emailing the VP's manager to let him know how the VP behaved. Is there some official complaint I could make about this meeting he had? ",25Jan2019,1

322,"I have to give Spotify some Credit, they allowed me to enter the world of Legit music listening (e.g. no more Limewire) I have been a subscriber since they launched, and have been pleased with the service ever since. There are a few times some of my songs changes, and I have to redo them on my playlist, but that's just a minor annoyance.   


iTunes has always been a strong platform, and I have always been an avid Apple Fanboy. I have both a Windows and Mac and use both an iPhone and an Android. Their music selection is pretty top notch, and their movie / tv show selection is unmatched. However I do not like the fact that if you want to watch a purchased movie or show, you have to do so in an Apple Ecosystem. OSX or Apple TV. Music is the exception, because iTunes has an App for every OS

&amp;#x200B;

I have a pretty sizable music playlist collection on Spotify, fairly large, however I am not the type to add new music regularly. I listen to the same music over and over. (I'm weird, I know) I add about 1-3 tracks every 5 months or so. So my logic is, if I switch to iTunes I can stop paying the $9.99 for Spotify. Free service for Spotify isnt much of an option because I do need the ability to Download music, being a truck driver I do go through a lot of areas with poor service, so It will be a major bummer to drive with no music playing due to the buffering. (I hate sprint. GO T-MOBILE MERGER)   


Long term: switching to iTunes will save me money, I won't have to spend money each month for a subscription.

Short Term: It will be a Financial Nightmare. I will have to dump Thousands of Dollars into iTunes to match my playlist that I have on Spotify. Even if I don't buy some of the lower priority songs, It's still going to be upwards of Thousands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue I have rolling around in my brain, I just heard a rumor that Apple is going to restructure iTunes a bit more to favor streaming, to compete more with Spotify and Amazon Music. I'm not sure how this will affect my desire to purchase songs and keep them in my library and avoid monthly subscriptions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like how this world is moving towards subscription models. Its good for convince, sure but its going to cost us more money in the long run with so many different services on a subscription model and our content being uniquely on its own service, so I am trying to cut down on my subscriptions as much as possible.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, Any advice, thoughts, questions, comments? It will all be appreciated.

Ok so here it goes. I own a house and rented one of my extra bedrooms out to someone off Roommates.com back in July. We will call him Nick. Up until October everything was fine and he was paying rent on time. In October, Nick’s car had back to back issues and he was without a car. I took him to work a few times and he also used Uber. He hasn’t paid me October or November rent to this day. I was patient and understanding with him considering his circumstances. We agreed that he would file his tax return ASAP so that he could get fully caught up(his idea). He is ten days late on January’s rent now as well. Legally I know I can evict for failure to pay rent. For reference sake I am located in PA. I have a boilerplate PA lease agreement signed with him on a one year lease. My thinking was to just ride it out and hope and pray he pays his back rent and stays current. Essentially the old expression, you get more flies with honey than vinegar. However, as of this morning the situation has become more complicated. I was taking out the trash to the curb this morning and right on top was pill bottles and boxes for Zubsolv and Suboxone. The dates on them were from before he moved in with me. I don’t know if he is currently still on either of those medications. My issue is that during my “vetting” of him, I asked about any smoking and/or drug use currently or in the past in which he said he never had an issue. I had 600$ disappear back in August and I suspected it was my summer roommate but now I feel as if it was probably Nick. The money disappeared right before he took a week long vacation. Nick has also made my girlfriend feel uncomfortable when she was at my house and I wasn’t.

330,"Title is a little confusing so I'll elaborate.

I'm a dude and I'm currently 16. When I was 13 I enrolled into a new school and had a classmate(We'll call him John, not his real name). Basically I've been close friends with John since I was 13. Halfway through my first year I realised I kind of felt a little weird towards him. After a while I realise that I was attracted to him. Doing a little bit of digging I find out I'm bicurious because he's the only guy I'm attracted to.

I've lost a lot of weight since I was 13, I used to be really overweight but now I'm about average. I've noticed that John had started becoming a little more 'attached' to me in a sense, like when we played games he would get sad when I was leaving, something which he didn't do to others to the extent that he did to me. 

When texting him, he would occasionally add a "";)"" or call me terms like ""hottie"" or ""babe"". I know this could very possibly be a joke since it's common amongst my friends to do things like that, but after I asked some of my friends I realise he's only doing this to me. He also started buying me things, something which he would barely do to others. He took a lot of convincing to contribute $10 to our friend's birthday present, even though he had around $50-$60 of spare money. I don't know if he needed it for something else but he said he didn't

I also noticed he started being a little more touchy. I responded to all his slightly flirty comments with some of my own just to test the waters and he was completely fine with it. When I was in a crowded bus with him I noticed he started slightly pressing his body against mine? I didn't say anything about it but I was trying to show that I was completely comfortable with it. 

This is my last year in the school, and I likely won't enroll in John's school so I might not be able to see him in person often. He also likely won't be able to go online often so I might not be able to talk frequently with him at all. What should I do? Should I confess now? Should I wait until after our final exams? I worry that if I confess to him and he ends up not feeling the same way as I do to him, he might start treating me differently, and I really value the time I spend with him.

333,"Six months ago I contemplated making an account to post my story here. I didn't do it because I still had determination and hope that I could change things and rebuild my life. 

I'm going to give you some brief details - just note, some parts will sound like I am self-aggrandizing, but I'm not, I just want to give you the facts so you can fully understand me and my story. 
I'm 28 years old and I live in a first world country.   
I'm male.  
I'm 6ft.  
I'm ENFP if you put any faith in that.  
People who are ""obviously"" intelligent (e.g. lawyers, psychs, docs) have said that I am intelligent. 
An unedited and recent picture of myself smiling on photofeel got an ""attractive"" rating of 8.7 which put me in the top 20%, you can see that here:  
https://i.imgur.com/FXaSaoP.jpg  
So I just wanted to share that brief information first off to hopefully mitigate potential questions about my looks or intelligence, not that it's not worth a discussion, just that I don't want to waste your time. But I do want to touch on a few aesthetic questions, a bit later though. 

Now to start at the beginning. 

I was born to loving parents. They remain together. One is a high-income earner, in a career that requires one of the highest levels of qualification to enter. The other is retired but has worked and was a valuable, capable employee in their field. 

Life between 0 and 12 was decent. I had a lot of friends. No gf/romantic relationships. I excelled in certain subjects at school, and I was poor in others, but overall, in the yearly National exams, I received average to high marks. 

Life between 13 to 17 was decent. However, I went off to an all male boarding school at age 13 quite a far way from home. I found it difficult to re-connect with my old friends due my school holidays being at a time when they were still busy in school. By the end of highschool I had no real friendships back at home anymore. 
Throughout highschool I had no gf/no romantic relationship and not a lot of contact with girls. I developed strong friendships towards the end of highschool. 

I graduated highschool at age 17 and I received a scholarship paying full tuition and board at a university. The university was a long, long way away, and it was a very religious university (strict orthodox) - but the subjects were of interest to me, and I hadn't any other plans, I felt some anxiety about ""continuous upward movement"" and so I accepted the scholarship and within a few months I was living not only a long way from my old home, but also a long, long way from the friends I had from boarding school. 

Life between 17 and 20 was decent. I had friends, but no truly close friends. My friendships with my close friends from highschool began to degrade, just like previously in my life with my friendships in my home town. I had no gf/romantic relationship. I was, and still am, non-religious, and due to all of the girls and other guys at the university being strictly religious, I simply wasn't compatible (confirmed by a few girls who I kissed once or twice after we both had a few drinks). I graduated with my bachelor's degree at age 20. 

Before my degree finished I enrolled in a masters degree at well known university. I was looking forward to beginning the ""end"" of my studies, I only needed to complete the masters before I could begin my dream career. At age 20, not long after I graduated from my undergrad, I received an offer to study my masters and I accepted it. Once again, feeling anxious about ""continuous upward movement"" I packed up and moved away to live near the university where I would study my masters. It was sadly too far in distance have a social life with my friends I had made during my undergrad studies. And it was still, a long, long way away from where I went to boarding school. Over the break between finishing my undergrad and beginning my masters, I spent most of my time alone. I felt my friendships degrade even further. And I was unable to make new friends socially. I felt my first real depressive moment during this time. I put my faith in the masters degree and meeting people in the classes to make new friends. 

It felt like ages but classes did eventually begin at the new university. They were predominately night-time classes which I found difficult to acclimatize to. Things got worse. Apart from two people every other person in my classes was much, much older. I was 20, and a young 20. Most everyone was 30 or up. They just ignored me. I tried to socialize after classes and it came to nothing. The two who were around my age simply weren't interested in making a new friend, it was clear that they already had a friendship group, and so I simply just didn't have any meaning or value to them. 

Two weeks in I had my first panic attack.  
For the next two months I would have multiple panic attacks everyday.  
The first was when I was showering getting ready for classes. I felt like I had to vomit and I'd dry wretch uncontrollably. The second was on the bus to classes. I felt like at any moment I was going to scream uncontrollably, or piss myself, or shit my pants. My knuckles were white and I had beads of sweat dripping down my forehead as I held onto the steel bar trying to hold control of myself just long enough to get to the university. I had to sit on the front seat of the bus. I wasn't able to walk further down into the bus without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack, with everyone looking at me, and I felt the further I went down the harder it would be to get out. I began drinking heavily at night to escape a problem I never thought I'd have, that I couldn't speak about to anyone, I drank heavily to escape myself just so I could sleep; I slept so I could get up the next day and hopefully wake up back to normal, and that the panic attacks were all just a bad dream, and that I had friends, and things were okay.  
I dropped out 2 months in after not making it the entire length of the bus trip - this day I just couldn't do it, I felt like I was going to burst, have a heart attack, scream, shit, take control of the wheel and drive the bus into a wall. I got off at a stop that wasn't mine. I walked around in a daze for a few hours until I eventually found myself not far from where I was living.  
I felt like someone had shattered me from the inside out.  
This was the beginning of the end of my life.
From this moment on my life would unravel - it would be a little over half a decade until I broke out of the cycle of severe depression and anxiety. 
I don't want to go into all the details of what these years were like, but just imagine someone crying, drunk but somehow still coherent, in a graveyard, wishing they were dead but also not wishing to make their parents sad or be a burden on anyone. Imagine a mother and a father wishing they could take all the pain and suffering away as their son punches holes in walls and screams that he can't do it anymore. Imagine someone driving drunk a little after midnight through empty city streets crying heavily as the speedometer hits 130km/h, with bloodshot eyes looking for a wall as they say sorry to those who find him and sorry to their parents for the pain.  
Those are a few moments I remember, and there's many I don't.

Not too long after my 26th birthday I moved back home to live with my parents, I'd hit rock bottom several times, but this particular time I couldn't get back up. So I realized I had to go back and live with my parents and I was planning to kill myself if things didn't get better, if I didn't get better.   
I did eventually end the cycle of severe depression and anxiety.  
I did get better. 
Around my 27th birthday I knew I wasn't suffering mental illness anymore. I'd been feeling a lot better for several months. My psych and I confirmed it. So that was that.  

But I was still suffering. Loneliness had been fucking me up on and off for a few years. But once I moved back home it became really intense. The chronic loneliness began to make my feel physical pain. This became really bad in early 2017 and hasn't eased up since. 
I'm now 28. For the past two and a bit years I've been studying to give me something to do and to get entry into work. I haven't had any work during this time. I've not been able to make any friends. Once again, everyone in my classes are all much, much older than me. All my friends from highschool and university have moved on. Far, far on. Nobody contacts me anymore and they haven't in a long time. I've tried reaching out but they just don't have time for me. If I don't reach out then it's honestly like I just don't exist. I haven't been able to make any new friends where I live. Everyone seems to either think I am a weirdo, they see me as an outsider, or they have enough friends already they don't need more. 
I've tried everything realistic and possible to make new friends. I've not told people about my past and how lonely I am and how much I just want to have one genuine friend - and when I don't, then they just ignore me, they don't interact, aren't interested etc, and if I tell them ""hey, I'm really lonely, I'd really like a new friend, what do you think? Can we be friends?"" they reply with something along the lines of ""oh you should have told me that! I'm really busy/I don't have friends and don't want any but just love yourself and you will find friends!"".  
If I am honest about my story and how lonely I have been straight up then what I've found is that people don't believe me, or they think I'm being dramatic, or that I don't love myself, or that I'm a negative person, or that I'm ungrateful, or that I'm fucked, basically that I am the issue and therefore they don't want to be friends or be around an issue, and so it's made me even more of an outsider.  

I haven't had a relationship in my life at all. I've been on two dates in the last year. One girl said she had a wonderful time but then ghosted me. Another said ""smoking isn't a plus. maybe we can catch up sometime as friends eventually"".  

One of the things that got me through half a decade of depression and anxiety was a grain of hope that I could get better, and that I'd be able to enjoy life. I never knew just how hard it would be, how chronic this loneliness would be and how much it literally physically hurts. I sometimes wonder if I should have bothered getting better at all. I know that's fucked up to say, but it's honestly something that I contemplate everyone once in a while.  

Over the last two years I've tried so many things that I thought would help, that would change things for the better.  
I've tried so many things that were (and are) given as stock standard advice.  
I've put in significant amounts of time, energy, and hope into all these things I've tried and I've gotten nothing but failure. 

I really don't know if I can win this battle. 
Everyday it gets a little bit more difficult. 
Every failure makes things ten times worse.  
I can't figure out any logical reason to continue (apart from not traumatising my parents)  
I am scared that no matter what I do I can't change things.  
I'm scared that I'm too far gone. This was my greatest fear and I feel like it's actually happening. 
I feel twisted up inside knowing that despite getting through depression and anxiety I could end up sick again, not for doing anything wrong, but for trying, and trying, and trying again, only to fail over and over, destroying myself in the battle to save myself, to live. 
I really honestly don't know what to do. 
There's more details i've left out but nothing that is super significant I don't think. That's the core of my story and the madness I'm facing.

(Not gonna lie, I did check her out once in a while)

Because, going to the gym is like some form of alone time to me. It might apply to many others too. She seems like she's a super nice person and friendly too. Would it be creepy if a guy suddenly walks up to a girl in a gym and try to talk to her unless they want to use the machine that she is currently occupying? 

I don't want to risk getting a complaint or get banned from entering the gym. Because, it is the cheapest compared to gyms around the area.

337,"My girlfriend and I recently moved to Texas and there’s been so much upside to it. The only thing is that driving is a necessity when it comes to work/life/school. I drove down from NJ because I didn’t have the money to ship my car down on top of plane tickets since I came down around the holiday season. I’ve been helping my girlfriend look for a used car that will get her from point A to point B safely. 

We found a 2013 Nissan Versa, fairly new for $4800. Clean title, passed inspection and 80k miles. The dealer told us he slapped on a warranty on to the transaction, and as soon as we purchased the car and hit the roads, the car stalled at a red light. We took it back immediately and they said it’s probably just  the battery, so they took it and told us to come back tomorrow so they can fix it. The next day we arrive and the cars there, and the ride home was ok. It wasn’t until later in the day where we go out in her car so she can experience driving the car and 10 minutes into driving and the car overheats.

I’m not sure what they did the first time they “fixed” the car but if by warranty on the car they meant simple fixes then what’s the point. I don’t want my girlfriend driving the car and I saw her get very flustered when the car wouldn’t move at a traffic light to the point where she didn’t know what to do. Am I allowed to return the car since we haven’t even had the car for 2 days. ",25Jan2019,1
338,"Okay so I’m a senior in high school, and so is this guy. I first “met” him when we were freshmen. His locker was right next to mine, so for all of freshmen year that’s the only time we would interact. Every time I would look up from getting my stuff out of my locker, he’d be staring at me but would never say anything. And I mean every single time. And he wouldn’t look away when I looked back at him either, I ended up looking away because it made me nervous. 
Anyway, we never really talked much, besides him throwing a few comments about either my hair or what I was wearing. For example, I had dyed my hair darker and the next day he was looking at me and said to his friend who was with him “hey look her hair is different”. I just looked at him and said yeah with a small laugh; I didn’t really know what to say and he made me nervous, for multiple reasons. The first being he was literally always looking at me, and the second because he was a pretty popular kid and I am not even close to popular. Another comment he made was he joked around about me wearing a different schools hoodie saying “I had really good school spirit”. 


Then in 10th grade, we had math together. Again, any time I looked up from my desk he would be looking at me, and wouldn’t look away. The only time he said anything to me that year was when our gym classes combined one day and I was going to change the scoreboard thing and apparently I wasn’t doing it fast enough so he comes up and goes “just let me do it since it’s too much work for you” then looks at me and smiles. 


Then 11th, we also had the same math class, and again the same thing with the staring. The only time we talked was we both started laughing at the same time because of something this one girl said and he looked at me and goes “did she really say that” and I laugh and go “yeah”. He would also wait and hold the door for me when we left or came in even if I wasn’t even close to the door, but he still wouldn’t say anything. 


Then this year. We have no classes but again our lockers our next to each other so I still always see him looking at me. And every time we pass each other in the hall hell be looking around then when he sees me he doesn’t look away. I look away then look back and he’s still just watching me. At our lockers he looks like he’s about to say something and then doesn’t. 


Sorry for the long explanation, I just don’t know if this means anything or if he just has a staring problem. I also want to say that my school is extremely divided into cliques, and if you’re popular you do not associate with people who aren’t popular. It’s terrible, but my school is awful with status and popularity issues. The thing I’m always wondering is if maybe he just won’t talk to me because I’m not popular at all and he doesn’t want his friends to make fun of him? Or maybe I’m just reading waaay too far into this and he just has a staring problem. 
 Please give me your comments and thoughts!!


tl;dr guy at school constantly stares at me, sometimes tries to talk to me, very confused. ",25Jan2019,1
339,"**Background: I'm not saying anything positive or negative about marijuana, I'm pretty ""Y'all do want you want,"", but this is my experience. I had an ex that chose weed over me. It stung, so I've been averse to dating anybody who smokes since. Now I'm with someone I am completely in love with, he knows this background, assured me it wouldn't happen, and this is what's up:**

My boyfriend is genuinely the best person in the world to me. I love him more than anybody I've ever been in a relationship with, and know if I marry someday, it would be to him.

That said, he's a heavy cannabis user. He hid it from me at first; the first time I was introduced to the idea of him using at all was when he got his medical marijuana card for CBD. I was all for it because he has nerve damage, and thought it would help.

Since moving in with him, I've noticed he doesn't use CBD like he portrayed to me, but the highest possible THC he can get. I hate it; he turns into a jerk when he's high, calls me ""stupid,"" ""idiot,"" ""boring,"" etc., things he would never think about saying sober. I brought it up, and he said it's just medicine to him, he doesn't need or necessarily like it, and he would quit any time if it means not losing me.

The behavior didn't change, and I brought it up again. He said he would cut back. he didn't. This has been a conversation three times within the last two months. 

He has mental issues like depression that he has told me the cannabis helps with. But lately, I've noticed it is only making it worse, and he's been getting addicted to it. His tolerance is getting crazy high, he's high all the time, moody, and he's turning to his vape to even function. He's been scaring me with things he's been saying. I brought it up two nights ago, focusing on how his mental health has been deteriorating and briefly brought up the cannabis because it's playing a factor. It was a two minute part of an hour long conversation, but that's what he clung to. Not my concern, not his mental health, that I had said something negative about cannabis.

He promised me that night he would stop. Last night he said he reversed that decision. He essentially gave me an ultimatum for me to accept that he uses as much as he does or leave. 

I don't want to lose him, but I also can't continue to bury my feelings with this back and forth. I'm worried for his mental health and that he's showing clear signs of addiction, and that he'll be resentful of me because I don't smoke.

341,"Was dating this guy and his ex faked a pregnancy to get his attention while she knew we were dating. She also told him she didn't want to keep it so she faked purchasing abortion pills too and asked him for money. Fucked both of us up and we had to stop seeing each other. A few months later, I hear they are dating again.

Clearly this was emotional abuse and manipulation. Both of us were traumatized. I seriously don't understand why he would go back to her. I had to go through some psychological trauma and anxiety myself, and it would help me understand why he would go back to her, from another guy or another girl's perspective.

You leave it in a open box with fresh air coming through the window for 2 weeks and did not wear it again.

344,"I'm 19 M, and I guess some people might say I'm at the age where I'm meant to feel pretty lost and confused. But I feel as if time is flying by with very little progress or growth in my life, especially when I turn 20 soon. This post might be a bit messy, so try to bear with me. 

Currently I am living with my parents with no real motive to move out except to get away from my family (more on that later). I have gone through about a year done in college online, and I worked for about 2 years during high school over the internet for side money but eventually quit. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't go to parties, and I tend to stay pretty isolated atm. I don't know if I'd say I'm severely depressed or self-hating, and I'm definitely not suicidal. 

The main problem right now is that I can't help but feel my lifestyle is very unnatural and perhaps incredibly unhealthy. Since I really didn't like high school or my younger years and always felt isolated and rejected, I've slowly created a habit of just avoiding talking to people or dealing with relationships altogether. Because nobody ever taught me how to make friends or socialize (my parents worked all the time and never really got me involved in sports or activities), I always just withdrew and either read books or played video games alone whenever I wasn't doing school work. Even the biggest nerds I knew had friend groups, I just didn't belong anywhere. Throughout high school I basically had to learn how NOT to socialize after getting rejected and mocked by anyone I tried to talk to. Girls would constantly say I'm too skinny and awkward or not manly enough, and the few semi-friends I had always seemed to avoid me. So I forced myself to avoid acting emotional or ""weird"" to try to fit in, but it never worked. Even joining various clubs fell flat, everyone basically ignored me and gave me dirty looks whenever I tried to get involved in activities. A few were nice to me out of pity, but that's about it.

After graduating and becoming unemployed about a year ago, I feel like I just can't plunge into society. I can't help but believe that every person I meet just sees me as a rodent, and the only person I can ever rely on is myself. I genuinely can't bring myself to try to like anyone anymore. But I also don't really hate anyone either, and I wouldn't go out of my way to hurt anyone. In a sense, I'm just empty now and live only to see another day. I barely eat, I try to exercise to no avail, and I can only spend my days reading and playing games online. I've just made a habit of accepting complete isolation. My mental walls are just too strong and I can't talk to anyone anymore except sometimes online.

As far as trying to get help, I've talked to a few therapists (my mom has a few friends in the industry luckily). None of them have helped me and the only one I kinda liked actually had to quit because he was sent to rehab for drug abuse. My dad works all the time and has struggled with alcoholism, and he's been verbally abusive in the past. He would call me useless and weird when I was in elementary and middle school, which lead me to just move in with my mom in high school when my parents split. My mom has really shown to not be much better though. She drinks and parties every week, often bringing friends over that will basically tell me to be a man and move out whenever I leave my room. And her friends bring their children over (that are around my age), and she'll sometimes call me in to compare them to me to try and show them how weak and unmanly I am. It probably sounds a bit worse than it actually is, but it certainly doesn't help my self esteem.

Its very bizarre overall, and I can't help but imagine that everyone sees me as a pathetic alien of some sort, even my own family who should try to encourage me. I probably won't trust anyone I meet for a while, or even try to meet new people. I would love to move out, but most jobs involve talking to employees my age and angry customers 24/7, which sounds like hell since I have zero confidence or willpower. After being hurt and disappointed so often, I've just become somewhat bitter toward the idea of running outside and having random ""friendly chats"" with strangers to make friends. My dream is to become a writer or video game designer, but how can I do that when I can't work with people? I'm necessarily looking for encouragement, just some reasoning and help since I can't get any IRL. Thank you.",25Jan2019,1

351,"We've (both 20) been friends since we were 12 and developed a lot of bad habits through our friendship together (smoking, drinking, hooking up with random guys and going to strangers' houses at the age of 14). We both had a rough childhood and had a lot of issues related to it, along with depression and addiction problems. I was always the one who was doing more, I think I was a negative influence on her.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I got better. I worked on my depression, dealt with my drug abuse and started to realise that a lot of my friends around me were the reason I had never realised how bad my behaviour was. I told her this and told her that I couldn't fix myself if I was on 4 hour phone calls with her everyday about how shit her life was and while she refused to accept responsibility for what was happening to her. So we took a break from speaking for about a year, until she called me and apologised for everything that she had been doing and I accepted her apology and we became friends again, this time with some reservations on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

It was ok for about a year, she was focused on her career and her studies and was happier and healthier and nicer to me. At the start of this school year though, she made some new friends and has started doing hard drugs and hooking up with wannabe gang members and texts me all about it, even though I've explicitly told her I don't want to hear about everything she does that's negative. Then every two weeks, she has a big breakdown and comes to me saying she wants to change and I don't know what else to do so I just listen and then less than 24 hours later she'll be back to her habits.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I even in the right to be this frustrated with someone when I was in the exact same position? I don't know what to do but I've got no respect for her anymore and my boyfriend and I have had multiple fights about the fact that she's a continuous toxic part of my life but I do nothing about it. I've already done the big friend ""breakup"" thing before, so I don't feel comfortable doing it again. I'm not sure what the right move is here.

354,"Hello Everyone! Sorry if this is on the wrong tag, I took it as a ""Relationship"" with a friend.

Alright so, My friend from schooled was wondering why i wasnt at school Yesterday/Last Thursday. I didn't really wanna tell him since it was kind of personal (Some Depression stuff). He kept asking over and over, til he told me that he would tell me a Secret if i told mine. I thought then : ""Hmmmm, Us 2 knowing more about eachother could make us better friends"".

So then finally, I told him my Secret. He didn't seem to be ""satisfied"" with the Secret though, stating ""..."" followed by a ""That's it?"". I told him that that was my secret, and asked him to tell his. And then, He told me. To ""Guess"". Even though i didn't ask him to guess mine. I played along and tried guessing but never got it.

After guessing and having to BRB to go eat, he told me he didn't wanna tell his since it was ""Really personal"". And stating that ""Alot of people have depression"" (Me being depressed wasnt the secret btw). He then decided to tell me 2 ""Small secrets"" as he put it. Instead of the big one that he Promised. He told me that he had a crush when he was much smaller in his home country, and that he was bullied when he was alot smaller. And after hearing that, and him REFUSING to tell me his secret. I was Fuming! 

I was so mad because my fact was REALLY personal to me, no one except my parents knew what happened, and i just told him. And for him to just discredit my secret was just so effing annoying! Not to mention, My fact was a current day thing. While his 2 ""Small Secrets"" were 2 things in the past. That No one would care about. I'm not trying to say that no one cared he got bullied or anything like that. It's just that, while i was guessing he told me those 2 ""small secrets"" when i guessed wrong just to be like ""No.. Well yeah but before"".  


I ended it with telling to fuck off because i was so mad. I then felt regret for getting mad at him, and i wanted to say Sorry but he had gone offline to go to bed i assume. I ended up sending a message to him telling him why in my opinion he's in the wrong, and that he had lied to me.

Fast Forward to a few minutes ago, I see I have some messages.

And this is what he told me : 

""Well you don't respect the fact I don't want to say something. It's not a matter of trust

In the beginning I wasn't even to say anything to you

And I didn't need to, cause it's my secret, and I choose if to tell it or not, and you should respect that. If you wouldn't want to say something, I wouldn't insult you for that.""

I hope you can see why i'm so mad. He promised me a Secret and refused to say it. I really regret telling him now since in the beginning I didn't want to tell anyone.

So I recently regained some contact with this girl Sarah (with which a talked a lot a few weeks prior but stopped for some reason), and I felt kinda optimistic about it.

But thing is, a pretty close friend of mine (he doesn't know that I like this girl) recently told me that some months ago, when this girl was new, he talked a lot with her, and she supposedly liked him (I don't know if they directly talked about it), but my friend doesn't like her back, so he doesn't want anything with her, even though he says he finds her very nice. So by the time they got pretty close, even outside of school, but nothing happened.

And now friend told me they just talk during the one class they share (which I share with them as well). But thing is I've seen that they also talk on the phone, and my friend showed me she texted him a heart last week, which he ignored.

So I have no clue what to do. I really like her, but I don't want to bother her if she wants something with this guy. But also, the guy doesn't want such thing, so idk. I was thinking on talking to my friend directly, he is very nice, but it could make things a bit wierd.

362,"A little background. I came from a large family. But also a poor one. Growing up, the stress of little money coupled with the many kids caused a lot tension between my parents, and between my parents and the oldest 2 kids(one was brash punk and the other they suspected of doing weed and possibly other drugs. A correct suspicion as it turned out, but that's resolved) . Unsurprisingly there were many shouting matches between my parents alone and my parents and siblings. As little kid, you never forget all the fighting and you never forget how sad and scared it made you feel.

This is not to say we were an unhappy family. We had problems but we all loved each other.

So many years later(a couple weeks ago). I'm talking with my parents and my father asks what's the **very first** thing I think of when I think of my own childhood. I tell him the truth and say it was all the fighting. Unsurprisingly they don't take this well. He puts on a miffed tone and say something to the effect of ""wow thanks, that makes mom and I feel great"". I explain that it may be the first thing but it's not the only thing and it's not most important either. I explain that my siblings and I all know that he and mom did their best with cards they were dealt and we appreciate everything they did. That helps but I could tell they were still agitated by it all night. 

Anyway, things were back to normal the next day.

My suspicion is that saying I remember fights first made them feel like they failed as parents. Which my siblings and I all agree is simply not true.

If it ever comes up again, should I say anything else?

Should I have just lied in the first place?

He then follows me out and into the elevator, stands very close to me even though there are no other people in there and says ""You're so cool want to hang out?"" and I respond ""Umm sure but I work a lot."" Which I do. I have a part-time job outside of class which barely gives me time to socialize with even my roommates. We are back in class and he keeps trying to pass me notes and staring at me. I try to focus on the lecture and not think about it hoping ignoring him would maybe que him to focus on the lesson. He asks for my instagram and I've already felt super creepy vibes at this point to I said sure and gave him my work instagram (I'm a makeup artist). After class was over he followed behind me even though I was on a call with my boss saying HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY over and and then when i told him its an important call he said, ""Fine whatever then."" and walks away. I think maybe he latched to me because I was nice to him and knew he probably didnt have many friends so I should keep being nice. He continues to message me on my work Instagram every hour. At first it was asking how my day was and then it turned into him telling me very personal things about him even though I wasn't responding at all. This has continued. Today in class he asked me for my number, and me being me, I said sure not wanting to start conflict. He continued to follow me again to the bathroom and sit next to me and try to talk to me during class. He tried following me back to the dorms but I pretended to be on the phone. I wouldn't mind this if it hasn't turned almost stalker like. I had two panic attacks over this. I told my boyfriend and my father and he said to contact security immediately. I told my best friend and she said I wouldn't react like this if he was normal. Which is false. If someone followed me to the bathroom I'd be creeped out regardless of condition. What should I do? Continue being nice or ignore or even report? Thank you!!",25Jan2019,1

He owns a small business that's doing fairly well, but obviously not rolling in dough. I wish I could just write it off as a gift, but I didn't have that money to give at the time. On the promise I would be paid back quickly, I let him use my high interest credit card for a few thousand dollars of business needs. At the time this pretty much kept his business afloat which did make me happy, I love him after all and want him to succeed. I carried it over on the card for a few months, but ended up getting a consolidation loan because the interest was killer. It's been a year and a half and I haven't seen a dime.

At the beginning I used to help out a lot with the business, but eventually had to get a job of my own. I make decent money, not great. He now has a business partner and a couple friends as employees. It's less stress on him and they can take more on more jobs which is awesome, but obviously more people to pay. One employee is paid under the table about how much I get paid at my job after taxes. He can barely take enough money for himself to pay his bills so outings and groceries are on me.

We live separately, him with his folks and me with my sister and brother-in-law. So living expenses are essentially nil, except I do pay a little rent. I don't like where I live, I haven't for a long time so",25Jan2019,1

I feel like my life is nothing compared to that. I can't even afford a car or take trips to music festivals even though I want to. 

At the very least I'm married. My wife tells me all the time that 'the world isn't fair', 'everybody's life is unique', 'stop acting like the world owes you something', etc. I know all of this stuff, but for some reason, I can't internalize it.

I think it's because that these are things said by people who perpetrate unfairness. Like a cheater in a game saying 'the world isn't fair' while they still continue to cheat.

Honestly it feels infuriating when she says that because not only do I feel like she doesn't understand (even though she should because life is most unfair to her), but I feel like I'm being 'mansplained' to.

So, when i was in Middle School i had my group of friends and everything was ok, until High School arrived. 
I'm the only one in my group of friends that studies in a private school, so i'm by my own alone. Only a few acquaintances are in this school, but they aren't my friends, i basically don't know anything about them.

The first semester was kinda difficult but i managed to make friends. However, the school has this system where they reorganize the classrooms after the first semester (idk why, it is stupid).

So my new classroom is different, few people from my other classroom are there, and the few ones that are in it are people i barely talked to. So i don't talk to no one, and i'm getting the reputation of the weird asocial freak of the class, and i don't want that reputation because i'm not like that.

Also the Mexican society doesn't help at all, because everyone is collectivist and extroverted, so the majority expects you to be that way as well.

This has made me search out for a part time day gig although I don't want anything too demanding (main focus is my night job).  So I applied to a food location in my neighborhood because I pass their now hiring sign on my commute. They offer me 10am-3pm after hearing my needs, and weekends off? Perfect! So they ask me to come in to do the computer work at 9am (9:00am Wednesday) and my first working day would be Thursday. 

   I come up at 9am Wednesday to of course be told ""have a seat"", where I waited until about 9:30. Finally I get called back and assigned a computer to complete the job details/tax information/all of those kinds of things. I noticed within the paperwork it stated I would be charged $35 of first pay check to pay for uniform. After I finish that, The nice lady asked me to tour the store with her. She took her time, showing me where everything is located in the store just kind of a brief rundown of the place. After she showed me it all, she asked me to have a seat again (10:50ish at this point) Apparently the lunch rush begins a little after 11. So now at 11am, I am asked to come over to the time clock where I was assigned an employee password so I could clock in and out; they told me to clock in. 

   So I clock in and to work I go. I get through the day true enough; I applied for the job so it is what it is. When 2:00pm gets around and Im done mopping and other hazing rituals I assume, I'm given a schedule.  I'm listed Mon-Fri 11am-2pm. I'm shocked. I asked what happened to the 10am-3pm agreement and was told ""we weren't busy enough for that yet.""So  I have been trying to figure this out in my head ever since. A huge piece of me feels like at 3hrs a day its not even worth my time (although gas isnt far, store is only like 8mins away). I could find somewhere else and work a few more hours and get a slightly better check to help me save. 

   A bigger piece of me feels like the fact that I was asked to come in at 9am for computer work but stayed there 9-11am UNPAID .. Im being charged for the one Hat and on Tshirt for $35 (meaning everyday I'm basically worth a shirt and hat to this company. 3hrs a day x $10hr = My whole first day was spent paying off my uniform) . The ""logical"" side of me feels I'm just being a tad bit emotional, and even though this situation is not as good for me as they made it seem, it is better than nothing. I dont go in until 11am meaning I have time to find another part time job in the morning and just work this one collecting the checks until I find my next move.

He is almost 20 now, but at the time we got together had just graduated high school. He hasn't gone to college, but I've tried to get him to go, since I'm in high school taking dual college courses towards my career.

I've reevaluated everything many times to see if I really am an issue, but theres just no reasoning behind his accusations... it hurts really bad and I just want things to work out.

375,"(TL;DR: this guy I like and asked about before on here was acting wierd then didn't show interest and now is acting wierd again.)

Hey again, so I took the advice on my last post and reached out to this guy over messenger. (Context, guy is in my classes but is in the year above me and interrogates me about my personal life. I have a bit of a crush on him but have no clue is he likes me or is just screwing with me. He has done stuff that I consider a bit strange for someone I barely know like standing very close to me so that he is touching me and he also teases me about music I like.)

Now I'd usually think maybe this guy does like me by the way he has been acting but then I messaged him and the conversation was a bit flat and he stopped responding. I assumed he didn't like me and so I distanced myself and forgot about him for a bit. 
I saw him walking about with girls from his year and nothing happened for a while so I guessed he wasn't interested and left it. 

I come back from the winter holidays and suddenly he's making loads of eye contact and started doing things that he was doing before like teasing me etc.

I'm still a bit reluctant to assume he likes me but the other day I was doing an investigation in one of my classes and he came up behind me and tried to scare me by grabbing my sides and yelling. 

Is it just me that finds that wierd? I'm practically a stranger and despite his playful type of personality I've never seen him do that to anyone else in my classes?

The day after that he pulled up a chair right next to me and sat so that he was touching me slightly when the teacher was explaining something- I'm so confused.

 Again, I really don't want to be big headed and embarrass myself by thinking he likes me when he doesn't. 

I'm scared that he's just playing with me or that I'm reading it wrong- I thought there would be other girls he would go after rather than me.

389,"Being bullied is it a serious issue… Most of us experience it! Here’s some qualified advice on eliminating bullying in your community.

There should be no negative connotation surrounding this issue, other than the fact that an individual has been abused. There needs no further negative recourse. In fact, any type of negativity will only Garner and fuel further negative results. 

In the recommendation of a professional, I highly recommend complementing the bully when you are in his/her presence, or staying away from him/her at all costs.

In this case (and the case of any bullying situation) fighting back or standing up for yourself is the absolute worst mode possible… Most likely, the bullies frame of mind is so negatively fueled; only wishing to seek negativity. Any type of negative reaction will only garner success through the bullies eyes.

Rather than diffusing the situation in negative form; through abuse in anyway, I recommend complementing the individual, or smiling when he/she throws a negative comment to you… Don’t react in anyway other than a smile, then walk away. Keep doing this and eventually you’ll see that the bully has extended the negativity to another individual... or, he/she will stop the pattern altogether.

Unfortunately, just like change in any form, an individual cannot instill any type of change until he/she is willing to make a committed change within themselves… This means that the bully you are speaking of will eventually need to want to be a better person themselves. This is something that could take years for an individual to even fathom let alone try to make positive change.

Ultimately, if you see these strategies not fulfilling the positivity you’re wishing, I recommend speaking up to a suitable adult whom will speak individually to this bully… Nobody knows what’s happening behind closed doors until you infiltrate and enforce discussion about the issue…",25Jan2019,1

A year ago he drank himself into a coma and had a really bad scare. That, along with meds and family, helped him stay sober for almost a year. 

A couple weeks ago he got his second DUI. He has not been sober for a minute since. He called the court on the day he was supposed to get sentenced and said he was just going to go to rehab instead. He never went. The last few days have been so scary. The amount he is drinking, and how drunk he is. 

I called the cops to see if they could help. They can't. My brothers 16 year old son drove him from one police station to the next, in every city my brother has warrants, and they won't take him bc he's drunk. But he's always drunk!

If I admit to wanting to harm myself, or if there is any sign that I am hurting myself, I get taken to the hospital against my will. 

I am in alanon. So I know that you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved. The cops can't cure my brother. But they can't cure my depression either. The cops took me to the hospital, they transferred me to a mental hospital. This mental hospital did nothing but hold me til I'm stable. They offered no therapy, no counseling. I just colored for 10 days til they released me. 

Why can't they do the same for my brother? He's killing himself. Alcohol is his razor blade. I'm not asking anyone to cure him, again. Just get him stablized so he can face his sentence, get into a rehab (he wants to go he just can't stay sober long enough). 

I don't understand what the difference between someone who has depression who wants to self harm, and someone with alcoholism who is self harming. 

Is it really bc alcoholics make the city money with all the trouble they get into? But not people with depression bc they don't tend to break the law more than other people, so the cops want them to get better, but not the aloholics bc the alcoholics help them reach their quotas?

414,"Fast forward 2 years ago and I was fat, lonely, and unhappy. So I decided to change myself by dieting, going to the gym, and losing 12kg in a weight (74 - &gt; 62kg) (32% Bodyfat - &gt; 14%). During this time I developed my personality, and got a job in a restaurant at the age of 15)

Now I achieve the highest grades in the school (without being a cocky or arrogant person). But the way other people reacted to this makes me feel like crap.

I was constantly insulted for having a job (washing dishes, which I know isn't great but that's all I can really do at this age), people insulting and mocking me for it. In addition, I get insulted on a daily basis for going to the gym as people constantly mock me (basically acting like they are intimmidated be me, in a mocking and mean manner).

I don't understand why, as these people are fine on their own but are absolutely horrible when in a group (which is most of the time). And when I consult these people about it they basically act like it is nothing - but it isn't as it is literally all the time. It's hard because it damages my motivation as I feel like all I do to better myself just makes the situation increasingly worse. 

It got so bad I ended up quitting social media and leaving all (except one) group chats. The worst thing is that it won't stop (people apologise and start it again the next day). I have 5 months until I can leave this place.

I've no idea what to do. I could get adults involved but that would make the situation worse as it shows I'm affected by it. I've tried ignoring it for a while but it's hard to when people talk about me behind my back, and I can hear them from the other side of the room.

416,"I've been trying to buy a franchise for the past several months.  One deal fell through, after Discovery Day they called me up and said they rejected me for owning a franchise because I don't have enough business or management experience.  I'm going to another Discovery Day for a different franchise soon and need to figure out how to better present myself.

I don't have much business or management experience to be honest.  I worked in retail and office jobs in my 20's.  Never made it up to management, but I always excelled at my positions.  I've never been fired, always left on good terms. Bosses always wanted to hire me back after I left.  I got bonuses in positions that never got bonuses before.  I won awards for job performance.  I'm a really competent and bright person.  All of my 30's was taken over being a stay at home parent to 4 kiddos though, and I lost a lot of potential job experience due to that.  I went back to school when my youngest went to kindergarten, and earned a Bachelors in a science field, I graduated Magna Cum Laude (with honors).  Now I'm newly divorced and finding the science degree isn't going to cut it in terms of supporting myself and my kids.  I've always wanted to work for myself, the daily grind working for others has never been appealing to me.  So now's my opportunity to make it on my own.  I am currently applying to business schools to get an online MBA, which I will get regardless of if I get this franchise or not.

Anyway, I know I'm competent enough to run a business well, and the business I'm looking to buy is simple to run.  I'm shy and socially awkward though. When it comes time to speak with the CEO I'm going to have a rough time again - it's so much pressure.  I'm not good at talking about myself and I don't know how to frame my prior achievements in a way that proves I can handle running a business.  The alternative is to lie and say ""Sure, I was manager at blah blah blah"". It's not like they are going to check out references.  I don't want to be a liar, but it feels like lying is the only way to get what I want in my life right now.  

I'm looking for any tips or advice.  How do I present myself?  Should I lie?  Has anyone else here done a Discovery Day like this before?  What do they really look for?",25Jan2019,1

Basically, I've known this guy in a few of my classes for a few months and they're nice enough, just never really contributed (like anything actually) much during group projects, or anything else really. So a major final for my English class was due today (I ended up finishing it at 2:30 am and thus got 3.5 hours of sleep), and so I presented it to the teacher and I was good to go just like that.

After mentioning it to the guy, he then asked me bluntly if he could look at my project, since he hadn't finished it. Since I worked hard on it and don't want to get in trouble for indirect plagiarism, I told him I couldn't. He was still insistent on looking at it though, even after I literally told him no respectfully a good 3 times.

I really don't like confrontation or hurting people's feelings, but I'm also afraid the guy might be salty about it and start a rumor or something just because I didn't share my work. I'm overall a sensitive person and shit talk can really get to me if I know the person. Our school in general takes plagarism, ect really seriously and the consequences can be bad.

In the meantime, I'm working at a job that's great for my grad school application but pays very little. 

My parents assist with some basics like my phone bill, assistance with college loans etc. But they also love having complete and total control over my life. I recently effed by by doing something they didn't want me to do, which was skiing with my bf. It would've been fine because they never found out, but alas being the unlucky person I am, I got hurt skiing and tore my ACL and need to get surgery to fix it. 

I'm fine with paying for the surgery and everything - I'm on my own insurance and kind friends for emotional support. My parents do have a tendency of random visits though (we live in different states), and they'll eventually find out. It's been almost a month since my injury and I don't know how to tell them about it myself. 

I'm scared of their backlash - they'll likely force me to download location app that lets them see where I am all the time, likely will guilt trip me, and also impede my rehabilitation process by verbally and emotionally abusing me for getting injured or limping, etc. I'm also scared that they'll force me to have the surgery back home where they live as opposed to the city I live in right now. That would be terrible because they always keep me spiraling into depression when I'm there and tend to abuse me. 

The last thing I want is to leave my support network and be around them because being around them for a prolonged period of time brings back thoughts of self harm.

But because I'm a little bit\*h I am nervous to talk irl. So I tried using social media, messenger/snapchat. Basically at the start I was messaging her and I realised that her replied took hella long. So I talked to one of her friends which was kinda a mutual friend. That friend told me that T doesn't use social media often which is why I may be getting no replies.   


So I continued trying but it was difficult cuz I couldn't really sustain a conversation over text if replies were so long. Anyways, at one point we were talking about a TV show then she asked a question and I answered. The reply was not opened for ages like really damn long. So after a week passed I realised that I wasn't getting no reply. Then my dumbass got did the worst thing possible by showing desperation. It wasn't a lot but I believe it was enough. I typed the word 'bump' in text to kinda like how people use this symbol \^   


I asked the mutual friend whether I was being ghosted. (note we were preparing for mocks this time) The mutual friend said she doesn't think I was ghosted and that T isn't like that, so and so.   


Cut to maybe 2 weeks? I don't even know anymore, I made myself move on. And then the snap and the messages were finally read.

On the last day of my experience she suddenly turned nice- told me to put her as a reference, advised me to start as an assistant to get the ball rolling, even offered to write me a letter of recommendation. So obviously, I put her down as one of my references for a job. 

Today, I got a job at a school as an instructional assistant. The lady who gave me the job came out and told me that my CT had given me a not-so-great recommendation and that she implied I shouldn’t have my own classroom and should only be an assistant. (Not sure why she told me, but I’m glad she did.) 

It honestly broke my heart. I love teaching and am so passionate about it, and I can’t believe she would encourage me to use her as a reference then say negative things about me when employers contacted her. The lady who gave me the job was very kind and told me not to worry about it, but I’m so scared that I will never have a future at this school now that they’ve heard this negative feedback. 

Has anyone ever had anything like this happen? Is it still possible for me to pursue teaching at this school or did she screw me over? Most teachers start as a sub or assistant to get a foot in the door but now I’m worried I will never advance and get my own classroom.

I don't know if the position will get better as time goes on, or if accepting it is just signing me up for unhappiness. I'm unsure if I turn it down, if the position I'm happy with will be there waiting for me. 

My question is, should I apply? Should I make the discussion to suck it up and be a big kid or should I take my mental health and wellness in to consideration? Would more pay be worth the added stress?

443,"We are both 22. Okay so I asked my boyfriend for a lift to work the other night for the next day and he agreed and he must of forgotten, instead of reminding him politely I got really annoyed and ranted at him telling him he is an idiot for forgetting (I was being a bitch I know). Anyway because I was rude to him he told me really sarcastically to 'take the bus and don't forget to be nice to the driver' and I screamed at him in a rage and told him to 'man up and do what you said you would do'. He freaked out, like so bad I have never seen him that angry and upset it was like a flip of a switch, he screamed at me back telling me shit like 'you are a woman why don't you start acting like it!', 'go put more make up on, go on an woman up before you go!' 'oh I know! Why don't you show me what an independent woman you are and fucking walk to work!' He was slamming the door repeatedly at this point and it scared me and made me cry I told him to calm down and he laughed at me and he went to the kitchen and threw a plate at the wall and screamed 'is that manly enough for you! fuck you!' and I was just frozen and crying, he is NEVER EVER like this and I didn't know what to do. He walked out and told me not to come back tonight (his flat, I live down the street). I just sit there on the floor for like a while and called in sick to work I was so hurt and upset and frightened by his anger he probably went to walk it off, I got my stuff and went back to my place and thought about it for a bit and realised that it was my man up comment that sent him off the rails. He is an amazing guy though and I did some googling and seen loads of articles like 'never tell a man to man up' and shit like that and my mind has been racing with thoughts that I have fucked up his trust in me or something . I called my brother and asked him about the situation and he laughed and said 'he should never of got that angry, but I get why it would upset him, you couldn't have picked the worst sentence to say to him but his anger was over the top' my brother also told me not to message him at all and just leave him be for a while and let the two of you calm down, I asked my brother why he was so angry at me and he told me that 'statements like that hurt, especially from woman we care about, and it feels like a stab in the back, but like I said before his anger was uncalled for, you are both in the wrong I think'. Still though would that really make a guy that angry? Could it be something else? I understand I was mean but like my brother said maybe his reaction was over the top?

I sent him an apology text anyway (it's been a while) and told him we can talk it out later if he wanted to and he replied saying 'sorry if I scared you, sorry I forgot about the lift'. He didn't reply to me asking about talking it out so I left it and an hour ago he text saying 'nah' and I think he has turned his phone off now. I dunno what to do, look I know I was being a bitch but is he not taking this too far that maybe something else could be goin on with him? Please help",25Jan2019,1
444,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck in a bit of a *shitty* situation and I need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the story is as follows; I've been working with this colleague of mine for a while now and over the years we've worked together we became good friends and we ended up always spending time with each other whenever we could. Sitting together to do projects, ask questions to each other constantly, work out together (we got a fitness area at work), eat and walk together, etc.. We ended up getting really close and touching feet and hands when could, we basically showed interest in each other and well I ask eventually asked her out.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I asked her out she said ""No, it wouldn't be smart."" and well things got a little bit awkward after that, though eventually the attraction gained traction once again and the same cycle occured and we even got a little more closer than we did before! I convinced myself to put it all on the line again and ask her out a second and final time to go and grab a drink somewhere and she said that she would like to do it! Oh boy I was so happy!

&amp;#x200B;

So after the first date came another and another, and so forth until after one of the dates she said she didn't really feel like we were on the same level and that she just didn't really feel too much anymore. Fuck! I still have feelings for her and boy did it hurt. She messaged me that she was really sorry and I replied to her that I would need some space, even though it would be hard because we work on the same office floor and our work corrolates. Well off to the next day, which happens to be a work day, ""*yay""*!

&amp;#x200B;

The next day. Well I felt like absolute shit. We basically avoided each other - per my request - and that might have just made it into the worst thing ever. Well whatever, I realised that it was all fresh and this was the risk I took in the first place, so I'd just have to bite through the bullet and go on. Well the next day I called in sick and stayed home for a few days but went back to work soon enough. We were still on the avoidance-path and I went working out alone, walking alone, eating alone and well I basically isolated myself a bit hoping to get over this feeling, or at least accept the situation. But it didn't really work. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a really bad week and getting some good drunk nights in the weekend I started reaching out to her again and requested to go sporting together, as a sign to show that I am wanting to  act normal towards each other again - or at least not avoid each other. Well a few weeks have gone by now and we are on much better terms. I feel like I have accepted the situation for the most part and I'm doing okay, but I still have days or nights where I just can't stop fucking thinking about her - *thanks brain* \- and those are moments that I start feeling really sad again. I am doing mindfulness/meditation on these days and it helps a bit but the thoughts always manage to overrule my mindfulness of the situation and this is what I need advice with. How can/should I cope with this? I like my job and it pays me well so I'm not really willing to search for another one but the sad feelings really hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind I realise that I should maybe not care so much or that I'm maybe overreacting a bit since we only dated each other for like a month but being aware of it doesn't really give me the ability to control these feelings. What would you do in this situation? Ask for more space again? I don't really feel like that would help because in the beginning it only made me feel even more sad..

447,"The basics of my problem:

I lack knowledge in math. 

If I don't have 30 hours in credit by the end of the summer, I lose my scholarship that is the only reason I can afford college.

I am currently taking 17 credit hours this semester. 

All but four of those hours are science/math/engineering. Specifically, those classes are: Chemistry 1, Calculus Based Physics 1, Calculus 2, Computing for Engineers, and a four hour literature class. 

My problem is that, despite taking dual-credit calculus in high school and passing, my knowledge of math and science is dismal. I made it through high school because I am a fairly intelligent person who could make educated guesses in most classes and pass. I can't solve a calculus problem (except for the easy stuff like limits), I can't remember trigonometry, I never learned anything in physics, and I recently tried to take the ""Course Challenge"" test on Khan Academy's Algebra 2 course and gave up halfway through because I was missing every other question. I honestly did not realize how little I know until I saw that I cannot even do algebra 2. 

To be honest, I've had a false sense of ability in math for the past year or two because of my test scores. I made a 780/800 on the math part of the SAT and I made a 33 on the ACT (don't remember specific sections, but they were all around 33). This gave me the mindset of ""Oh well, who cares if I'm making Cs and not studying, I can do math just fine."" I now realize that is not true at all. 

In the fall, I started out with 15 hours of classes and ended up dropping two classes, Calculus 1 and Chemistry. The calculus class I dropped was because the professor was an extremely hard grader (the average in the class was a C/B *after* he had given a curve), and about half of the class dropped. The chemistry class I dropped because I had missed a couple of lectures and homeworks and gotten to far behind. At this point, I still didn't realize how behind I was. I signed up for Calc 2 this semester (since I already had Calc 1 as a transfer credit), and am retaking the chem class. I figured I knew enough calculus to get by, and I planned to study it over the winter break, which I ended up not doing as a result of plans changing. 

Now I'm in these classes and have no clue what I am doing. I'm trying to catch up as best as I can. I have read advice given to people in similar circumstances, and a lot of the time it seems to be ""drop out for a year and get your shit together.""  I am currently receiving $7000 a year in scholarships that I will lose if I don't stay. If I lose that money, I will literally not be able to afford college. And I know in the long run it won't matter that much, but the thought of getting so far behind will send me into depression and I won't do anything to better myself (been in a similar situation before). 

I would just drop my Calculus and Physics class right now, but I will lose my scholarship for not having enough credit hours. Right now I can make up the 4 missing hours over the summer pretty easily, but I don't know if it's even possible to take 11 hours over the summer. 

I haven't talked to an advisor yet, but last semester when I did, they weren't helpful and didn't answer my questions. 

The only pro I have going for me at the moment is that I can learn things quickly, and I don't have any other obligations outside of class, work or social.

448,"I work as an IT support person for a living, and I'm currently a college student studying the same field. While I love working with technology, many people in the support world will tell you that it begins to wear you down when you're in helper mode 24/7. This is beginning to happen to myself, as a couple of my friends (and family!) now use me as their computer guru whenever they have a simple question. Friends are friends, yes, but I'm starting to get very annoyed when being asked basic questions that a Google search can answer.

Before I get labeled as the jerk here, I've offered free answers and support to them for years. I do enjoy sharing what I know, and it's good to feel needed. The problem is, I feel I've become the replacement for any self-help they could otherwise do. One repeat offender just texted me ""Help, I'm in a crisis!"" this morning. Come to find out, it's nothing serious, they just wanted to know which laptop I thought was better.

450,"Let's get this out of the way first. I love my parents and I have forgiven them for all the shit I went through while growing up. You see, my parents are heroin addicts. They are in their 60's, have been using since before I was born (I'm currently 26). 
All of my siblings (3) have left and started their own lives and I'm the only one that visits them on a regular basis to help them with food and water and just spend time with them. I'm still attending a university in Texas and have a low wage job that doesn't give me a lot of financial freedom. I live with the boyfriend and like many others live paycheck to paycheck.
It's been weighing on my heart lately. I want to help them but I have no idea where to start. Then there is the possibility that they don't want help at all and surely I can't force them to get clean can I? They have both tried to get clean about 10 years ago but it didn't stick. I know in my heart that my mom would be willing to get clean but my dad is the tough nut. If he doesn't get clean, he'll just drag my mom back down with him.  I can't just stand by while they are on the fast track towards death can I? Do I have a responsibility towards them? I figure I can first ask them if they want my help and go from there. However there is still the question of where do I take them to get clean and will it cost money that I don't have? ",25Jan2019,1
451,"I booked a week long trip to Dubai for my husband and our 2 sons, booked a 5 star hotel and upgraded the room to one of their highest categories. Ebookers have put us in a room with 1 king sized bed and are saying it’s totally normal for a family of 4 to share a bed for a week. I called customer service and spent an hour and a half arguing with them on the phone. The ‘customer service’ reps had pretty bad English and were unbelievably unprofessional. They looked at my previous bookings and said well you stayed in the Waldorf Astoria in Berlin and had 1 king bed you didn’t complain then about sharing a bed. I told the idiot that booking was just for my husband and I. They then insisted a king size bed is plenty of room for 4 people. 
I ended my call with them totally furious. I an gobsmacked that they are trying to act like I am in the wrong. 

They said if I want additional beds for my 2 sons they want me to pay another £600.  They wont change the room type, wont move me hotels and are refusing to cancel the trip saying it was non refundable- I wasn’t told it was non refundable until after I booked. 


Ive emailed their customer service and today received 6 emails from different people asking me for my booking details over and over despite the fact they have my booking reference which brings all those details up. Then this evening i get my holiday confirmation resent with a message saying ‘you booking confirmed we have resent you booking to you registered email’. 

Has anyone else experienced nonsense like this from ebookers?

I feel like I’m under pressure to be “entertaining” when I’m in a social situation and I can’t be that because I’m a rather unemotional person with personality problems.

How can I start to enjoy being friends with people and doing stuff with them without feeling stresses? Alcohol helps but I don’t care to drink that much. Which makes everything hard because all of my friends are social drinkers.

453,"Soooo, to make a super long story short, my 17 year old (girl) and I are tight, but have boundaries.  She knows the roles; I'm a mother first, friend second but I'm very open about life with her and she's come to me with SOOO many things over the years and I've always been there to listen.  From stupid little petty friend drama to her coming to me telling me she was bisexual.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday I had to get a tooth pulled and I was scared sh\*tless for three days leading up to the appointment.  So I go have it done yesterday and I take my pain pills and I promptly go to sleep on and off all day.  Husband made supper, we all ate, she went back to her room.  Whatever, no big deal.  She doesn't have school today because it's exam week and she's already done.  So I leave for work.  No pain pills just ibuprofen.  I should have stayed home but that's whatever.  I go home on lunch and I'm hurting.  I go back to work thinking in the car about how she never asked how it went, yesterday or today at lunch, never asked me how I was feeling, never got a hug, nothing.  

&amp;#x200B;

She's never ever been this thoughtless. I mean, I get it, teens are teens.  I was a jerk too but she's never been a ""jerk"" so to speak.  So then I start to spiral.  She has been up since I left for work apparently, and she hasn't done one thing since she's been awake..she knows her chores.  Dishes aren't even touched.  I asked if the dogs went out and she said yes, yet when I get home the little dog is crossing her legs begging to be let outside.  Like WTF.  Do you always lie to my face about stupid sh\*t like that?!  

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's probably nothing anyone can tell me for advice other that suck it up and one day when she's older she'll ""get it"" just like I did with my parents, but in the meantime, it really hurts my heart that she's seemingly ""checked out"" and I've asked her recently if there was something going on that she wanted to talk to me about and she yelled at me that she didn't have anything to talk about.  Okay, fine, I get it.  Again, she's 17 years old.  I mean, maybe I'm just being selfish??  We JUST went to a concert last Saturday together and had a blast and now, bam, it's like mom doesn't exist anymore all of a sudden.

458,"I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm also asexual. Yes, I've tried sex, and it was a horrible experience. Either it hurt like fuck or I felt nothing. But more than that, my reason for being asexual is the amount of disgust I feel at people oversexualizing women (just in case, I know men are sexualized too, but in the context of my situation the former is relevant. I don't mean any of this post in a sexist way, so I'm sorry if I offend anyone). I'm not all that attractive, but I've had my fair share of thirsty desperate dudes sending me graphic, revolting messages. It makes me feel physically sick to think that there are people out there who look at women as sex objects and nothing more, so much so that it's made me repulsed by the thought of sex itself because it just makes me feel horribly degraded and scared. The way some men act as if sex is the be all end all, like it's mostly what matters in a relationship and that it's a huge deal breaker makes me feel awful. I can't see sex as something  passionate and as a result of love, all I can see it as is a fucked up demonstration of power. This most likely stems from the fact that I was abused for a very long time by both my dad and my ex 'best friend'. I've been to many therapists but it's been ineffective all this time in that aspect and so I decided to become asexual.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be fine with this because it's not like I have the desire to be  sexually intimate with anyone since sex is disgusting to me. But I'm asexual, not aromantic. Even though I'm unfortunately quite wary of men after my experiences, I'm still attracted to them romantically and I'd like to have a relationship. I'm aware that not all men are like what I described. For example, my best friend is a dude and he's an amazing person, but either way my trauma still affects me. I'm going to try therapy again (for my BPD, but also this I suppose) in April, but otherwise I'm honestly clueless on what to do. I've never met an asexual guy, and I doubt any non-asexual would want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want sex. I don't want to be alone forever but I also can't see a way past my issues.

468,"I've lurked on reddit before, but now I've actually come to the point where I would like advice and not to keep this to myself anymore. So here I am.


I have family members with views that I find awful.  

Here are some examples:

-They are ""soft"" racists meaning that throughout my childhood until now, views have slipped out that are obviously racist.  They would never be mean to someone based on their race and never would say anything outside of the family, but I know the views are there.  They don't hate any groups, but it sucks to know that whenever particular races come up, they think less of them.  

If in the future I had a SO that was a POC, they would be nice if I introduced them, but they would not be thrilled and would have concerns.  

-They've had sexist views as well.  To them, there is obviously a man's place and a woman's place.  Men are supposed to act a certain way and women are supposed to act a certain way.  If a woman is speaking loud with confidence, she is annoying and brash. If a man is, he is confident and assured.  My grandma is in her 90s that holds these views more than other family members.


-They are homophobic.  They think it's ""gross"".  They've been vocal about this. Some of them I can see are trying to become more open-minded, but it's just burned in their minds how ""unnatural"" it is.  Which is absurd.

-There have been specific situations where I just have been disgusted by the things they said.  When it comes to the recent Me Too movement and sexual assault, they had the audacity to wonder why this one particular abuser would ever assault this woman because SHE IS NOT AS PRETTY AS HIS WIFE.  That made me sick to my stomach.  Let's not focus on the pig and criminal that assuaults women, but let's focus on the victim's looks.  Obviously they believed Kavanaugh as well. My grandma also has a hard time believing the children of the Catholic Church scandal and still has this idealized version of priests.  It fills me with rage to think that someone wouldn't believe these child victims.  

Again, these are not nasty, rude, awful people.  They are nice and kind to others (including all races).  They have helped a lot of people. They are interesting and I learn something every time I see them.  They are funny and generally optimistic and positive people to be around. 

So finally, my question is: to what standard should I hold my family to?  

I had a friend that I was close to since childhood into our 20s.  I was hanging out at his place one day and the news was in the background.  Something about consent culture came on and let's say he said some pretty messed up things about the subject.  We are both guys.  He would have never said that had we been with our whole friend group that includes girls.  I had no idea he had these views.  After I heard that, I just couldn't see him the same way.  It messed me up actually.  This was the kid I played on the monkey bars with and went over to eachother's houses after school all the time.  I straight up told him a few days after the comments that I couldn't do it. He tried to backtrack and make excuses, but I already was certain that was how he felt. Haven't talked to him since and this was more than 6 months ago. 

Is it justifiable to think my family should meet the same standard? My grandma is in her 90s like I said. Is she just a ""product of her time""?

I'm sure some of you have this situation as well. How do you handle it?  

TDRL: Family has some homophobic, racist, and sexist views.  Otherwise they are very nice people. Is it reasonable to cut contact with them over their views?

And she made me maid of honor which I said yes to..because shes only been talking about her dream wedding since we were kids and I am very excited to share this experience with her. But it means my dad and I are sort of forced in the same room together. So it's a weird dynamic lol. Thank god I've been a maid of honor once before so I at least know the general vibe of navigating that role traditionally. But this obviously is.....

470,"Over ear headphones would be way more appreciated than on ears, but I guess they are fine too 

I have been starting to watch a lot of movies/anime recently and I just can't bear when sometimes I can barely understand what the characters are saying. And no it's not a problem with volume (these cheapo headphones do get loud, even so that it isn't comfortable to listen with) or with my listening skills. I just think that I need headphones that excel in hearing clarity (not sure if clarity has anything to do with hearing voices loud and clear )

&amp;#x200B;

Budget - under 50 euros(max 100 euros I guess), I don't understand the technical terms but I think it's that my phone doesn't have a good dac/amp to power something great and it isn't worth spending the money ( there are probably low impedance headphones that still provide great clarity ). Yes I know there might be better, more expensive options that could run off my s7 just fine, but then again I don't even plan on bringing my them outside.

&amp;#x200B;

Source/Amp - Samsung s7

&amp;#x200B;

How the gear will be used - lying in bed

&amp;#x200B;

Preferred music genre(s) - Movies and weeb anime.

&amp;#x200B;

Past gear experience - in-ears that came standard with my s2, earphones that came standard with my s7(holy poop those were crap) sennheiser hd 201 (most durable stuff ever), cheapo market headphones ( they are duct taped, but I don't have a clue why it was done as it isn't broken, it leaks a fair bit and not that it sounds bad, I just think it lacks what I need)

What aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve? Hearing those damn voices mate.

However, recently we’ve had our differences and decided to end the toxic relationship I had with them (reason being that they were generally assholes and a bad influence). 

The problem is, now I kind of regret that I was so isolated from the rest of the class. It’s hard for me to just slide into other people’s social groups, because one thing I’ve noticed is that I’m blurred out. People are almost reluctant towards talking to me, and I honestly don’t have any clue as to what I’m supposed to do.

I haven't even thought about her in years, but a friend of mine who knows her recently found out she was single.  And knowing that I liked her, he let me know.  I searched her on social media, and the crush on her came rushing back for some reason.  It's silly, I know.  But I haven't been able to stop thinking about her.  Unfortunately, none of my friends talk to her anymore, and she probably doesn't even remember me.

But now he’s full time and doesn’t have time to do the things that make him feel like himself. He hasn’t had his time to escape into his pc to hang out with his friends and play the things they like to play.
He’s stressed out and today my normally quiet boyfriend, who normally doesn’t acknowledge his own feelings, told me he doesn’t feel content with anything anymore.

I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do.

484,"Hey, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if it's a right subreddit to put that question but anyway. 

So here's the thing, I'm 22 and am getting my BA degree in social anthropology (junior).  I've always been into humanities, languages and writing, so my dream job would be a journalist or a researcher who's making a positive impact on his community. But the harsh reality is that I live in Siberia, work as an English tutor for kids and do internship in local newspaper (the influential one but who cares), so I can only get a part-time job that's enough to pay the bills, buy food and that's pretty much it. I have a single mom who doesn't support me financially, we live in different parts of the country and I don't have to pay for my university because I've got a scholarship that covers all the tuition fees. So, the truth is that it takes years, profound erudition and wit, you name it, to become a good journalist or especially a researcher, and don't think I have those qualities. I'm very aware that anything worthwhile doesn't come easy, but I'm so afraid that the quality of life I'm having right now, which is always being worried about not having enough money to pay my rent, not being able to travel (except for academically related stuff), to buy more that two books a month, etc, that it will last for years. I'm moving to Saint-Petersburg to get a master degree in sociology (in a great school I've been dreaming about since I was 17) after graduating but it doesn't solve my problems. 

So, the smartest solution I came up with is to learn how to be a web-developer. It could take a year or two to learn and start working in a field, but it might worth it. I know almost nothing about it, but it's sort of interesting, and I'm not that super dense or old, so I think I could learn it from the very beginning. I wanna travel, I wanna see the world, meet new people, get more education. Why on Earth have I been learning French, Spanish and Polish, if I'm not even able to earn enough money to go to damn France or Poland? 

I'm very confused and I need the third opinion on it. I feel like I'm giving up my dreams because I'm not smart enough to get a well-paid job in my field (at least right now, optimistically), but I don't wanna live like that in my early 20's when I'm constantly sad and worried about the money. I feel like I've done something so far (e.g. I've got all A's for 3,5 years, I got a scholarship to go to the US for a semester to study anthropology there last semester, I've got that internship in newspaper, been to summer schools, publish some articles, etc), it's like tiny steps, but idk what should I do, and if I'm doing a right thing when considering web-development.... Should I put my ""journalist or whatever dream career"" on a back burner, get a real one, earn some money, travel the world, maybe leave my country and then do whatever I wanna do to fulfill my purpose? Or am I giving up easily? 

Tl;dr: I've been studying humanities all my life, currently getting a degree in anthropology, but I only can make enough money for paying the bills and buying food, that's why I wanna try learning web-development, but I feel like I'm giving up my dream of being a journalist or a researcher way too easy.

490,"This is a bit of a complicated situation so I will try to keep it succinct. 

&amp;#x200B;

In May 2018 my partner and I got a dog from a local shelter. We didn't live together at the time, but already planned on moving in together in July when our leases were up. We also moved in with another friend, so there's three of us in our current apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

We had the dog for 8-9 months, but in that time he had bitten 6 people, 7 times (1 person twice). I've never been bitten, but both my partner and other roommate have been, along with multiple of our friends, and my uncle. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been advocating to remove the dog and give it to a shelter because I do not feel safe and I do not want a dog that continues to hurt people, even with training. Other than the biting he's remarkably good-natured, and despite the biting my roommates both still love him greatly, whereas I am bordering on distain/dislike.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we finally found a rescue that would take him (most won't because of his bite history) and it wasn't what we expected - there were kennels and it wasn't terribly clean. However the woman running the rescue has been doing so for 20 years and she specializes in dogs with traumatic pasts, various issues, etc. and seems to have a good screening program for potential adopters. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, my partner and roommate told me neither of them were comfortable with leaving him there, and while my partner and I had already discussed and agreed that we're not responsible enough or capable of being his owners, our other roommate feels strongly about getting him back from the rescue, and adopting the dog to be their own. 

&amp;#x200B;

They say they would keep him in their room and on their side of the apartment so he wouldn't be a responsibility for either of us and I wouldn't have to interact with him. This doesn't seem like a good life to me, for the dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too overwhelmed and fried to even know whether i'm thinking rationally or not. We've had so many bad experiences with the dog, I just don't like him anymore and I don't want him around. However I understand that my partner and our other roommate both still very much love him and feel attached to him. I told our roommate if they're able to adopt the dog back, and keep him in their space, it wasn't my business. However I'm very frustrated - and hence i'm here - that I feel like my feelings and worries do not matter and I feel like the fact that he's bit so many people in such a short amount of time should bother them more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel unable at this point to set a hard line in the sand and say they cannot bring the dog back, because they've already made it clear that up until now it's been my wishes that lead to us rehoming him in the first place, and not what either of them wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

What even does anyone do in this situation? I'm so lost. How do any of you deal with your roommates pets? I'm hoping that if my roommate does get the dog back, that I can just ignore him and not have to deal with him at all. And maybe it really isn't my business. I don't want to, but I feel like I just need to suck it up and deal with it. If it was a different dog, not the one we gave up, I wouldn't really care or be upset about them getting a dog because that's their perogative. And maybe that's my answer right there, but i'd still like to hear any wisdom or words of advice that's out there.

491,"TLDR: My parents are progressive peeps and I don't want to lie to them about getting tattoos, but they can't stand to even entertain the idea. Looking for some input from parents who feel or felt similarly, and peeps who have been on my end of things.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are really wonderful and have supported me and my sisters financially and in all the ways they should've throughout our lives. The one sticking point I have with them is my wanting to get tattoos and them almost passing out every time I bring it up. I have made my interest in this clear to them throughout the years, but held off while in college (since they paid for that, and for most of my car).

I have a lot of respect for them, and they're currently dealing with being empty-nesters, but I'm living across the country from them, have a job that I love and excel in, and have been a successful, financially independent human since graduating from college last spring. I don't want to lie to them about getting tattooed (we live in a beach town so covering them up when I visit them isn't really on the table anyway) but it's really hard to have any kind of productive conversation about this. 

For some background, I work in environmental science and community development, often with youth. Most of my coworkers and classmates have tattoos, and this industry is pretty liberal when it comes to appearances and identity. I want to get tats as a way to collect artistic styles, and frankly they're cool and I want some. I think my parents' distress stems from old perceptions of people with tattoos and my ""hire-ability"", but everything that I understand about my career interests and generation (generally speaking) says that this isn't a big deal.

I would love input from parents, especially if your kid talked to you about getting tattoos when you were against it and especially if they went ahead and did it anyway. I'm tryna do scholarly research and stuff in the meantime to get some stats on this (stress makes me turn to academia) but it's just such a hard topic for them (they're very liberal themselves, my body my choice and all that good stuff, but god forbid I do something beyond getting birth control).

My boyfriend has become friends with a girl in his college class and they text outside of it, and it drives me crazy for some reason.

For out Halloween party we made tentative plans for sometime that weekend (despite my roomates and my best attempts to figure stuff out) and then about 10 minutes before the event, while I was with another friend she said ""oh we're going to the halloween party, they just decided its now"". How do I deal with this sort of thing politely and am I doing the right thing keeping my evenings first come first serve? 

tl;dr- part rant about my friends inability to plan things, how do I deal with tentative plans that are pretty much just ""sometime this weekend"" and also deal with their constant ""oh you're so busy we never get to see you"" and last minute ""in 20 minutes come to the car"" type stuff.

497,"Okay, there's a lot to this so hang with me here. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. 

So, I have two best friends, a girl I've known since 7th grade and a guy  I've known since 8th grade (I'm a senior in high school). I've had a week-long relationship with this guy when I was like 14, but he lives an hour away so I never got see him and broke it off. Apparently, he was a lot more hurt about it than I was. As we got older, we talked on and off because people we dated or our lives got busy and that was fine. We still found our way back to each other. I had dated 3 guys during the span of all of this. Unbeknownst to me in between each of these guys, he tried to date me again but I had no clue. So fast forward to about 2 months ago. My long term boyfriend and I had just broken up and I had realized I had feelings for this guy (we'll call him Greg). I had mentioned it to my girl best friend (we'll call Hannah) and she was all for it. Fast forward again to Christmas and Greg came over to my house and he wound up kissing me- a lot. I was hooked. He Ghosted me on New Years and didn't talk much after. My birthday, Jan 10th, happened and a group of friends came over to celebrate. About half of us decided to go to Stake and Shake so we got in two cars and went. Greg and Hannah took a separate car so they could ""talk about me."" They started doing that a lot and Hannah was really trying to push me on him, or so I thought. He told me he wasn't looking for anything and maybe that would change after he left for National Guard. Fast forward to yesterday and I found out that they had made out together and she has hickeys everywhere that she won't give me a solid answer on. Yes, I was upset about it, but I was more upset that she spent the next few hours lying about it and trying to make it my fault (I didn't do anything?) Eventually, today she owned up to it after all of my friends told her to cut the shit. Even Greg said it happened. She said I'm a whore, I'm overreacting, it is my fault he didn't want to be with me, and I need to take her emotions into account. As I said, she was well aware I was into him. I'm truly lost as things keep happening in our friendship I'm not sure I can deal with anymore.  Should I attempt to fix things or is this a toxic friendship? Is it even worth it at this point? Who knows, maybe I am in the wrong. I'm thinking about moving on from both of them if I'm being honest. Please, I'll take any advice I can take. ",25Jan2019,1

I also got hit 6 or so times with a large cast-iron frying pan but I didn't get knocked out, the hospital said it was about 6 times because of the angle and shape of the splits in my scalp, I got 25-30 stitches. After following head-injury protocols and much endless discussion with the doctors and psychologists, the hospital reluctantly let me leave without telling family or friends.

I can't get her to understand that the breakouts were my skins reaction to a drugstore foundation that my skin wasn't compatible with. I do get pimples occasionally but I treat them with a drying lotion I have and it works well for me.

509,"Hey, so I'm having an issue with my monitor for my computer.  First off, I'm not sure how much it could affect it, but I have a decent gaming computer and my monitor is a shitty TV that's at least 10 years old.  I want to get a new monitor anyway, as this one is absolute ass graphics wise.  I just don't have the funds currently.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have them connected with an HDMI cord, which normally works, but sometimes it just *doesn't.*  Sometimes if I'm loading into a game, my screen will blank out for a moment and hit me with the ""No signal"" but then work fine a second later.   Also, playing games like gmod, I can't have my game window in fullscreen mode, otherwise it seems to crash my monitor and it goes to no signal.  I don't think this is an issue with my computer because I can be in a voice call with my friends and I'll still hear them and be able to talk to them after my screen blanks out.  When this happens, the only way I can fix it is to restart everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that to save power, I try to turn my monitor off when I'm done using my computer for a while.  Like around 70% of the time I do this, I have to turn my monitor on and off multiple times and keep restarting my computer for it to connect and not say ""No signal"".  Sometimes I can't even get to the no signal display and my monitor indicates that it's on with a blue light at the bottom, but the screen is entirely black.  Again, I have to keep turning it on and off again to fix this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried multiple HDMI cords (and different ports) so I know that that isn't the issue here.  Any ideas?

515,"TL;DR 5 years ago, I was doxxed by someone I met online and had very negative things posted about me. And now, 5 years later, that person requested to follow me on social media.

So to be brief, five years ago, I was 20 years old, met a girl who was 27. We chat everyday and skype for 3 months. I was young, stupid, and started to realized i didnt like being ""intimate"" with someone online, who lived over a thousand miles away, who was much older than me. Being naive, I more or less just ghosted her. A month after ghosting, she somehow found my real name (i had given her only my middle name, and no last name), made a fake facebook with my pictures that I had sent her, wrote incredibly rude and untrue things as the profile description (saying i was abusive to women, a misogynist, sexist, etc), and then friend requested my friends and family. I was mortified and embarressed, and just told everyone that someone was trying to prank me. I never told my friends or family the truth. I deleted all social media, and this stopped.

Fast forward to now. I finally feel comfortable to get back on social media again, make an instagram probably 6 months ago. And I woke up 2 days ago to a follow request from this same person.

517,"Hello, r/Advice, This is my first post here. I was always very skeptical about seeking advice from internet users, since I believe that personal and cultural differences play big roles when interpreting people's situations. Still, I think that this ""problem"" of mine has an universal understanding. I apologise for any language mistakes, as I'm not a native English-speaker.


Since last April, I'm living with a really good friend of mine. He has many qualities that make him a great roommate. In November, he was starting to run through financial difficulties so we agreed to accept another roommate in our 2-bedroom apartment so we could split the expenses in 3. He suggested that we lived his cousin, who he'd always talk good about. We agreed on me paying for 40% and having one bedroom for myself and they splitting the other 60% for the other bedroom.


His cousin moved in and he seemed like a nice person with good roommate traits: hygienic, safe (never brought some stranger in without our consent), pays the bills at the right times etc. All those things considered, I can't put it in any other way: I think this guy is insane. Living with him makes me feel very uneasy. I'll list some things that bother me, starting with the lightest and ending with the extremes:


1) He's very loud. Not in the sense of putting on loud music, but he's always moaning like he's constantly having sex. For example, when he lays on the couch he makes a very sexual sound... The first times that he did it, I thought he was kidding but he does this every night various times. He moans when opening the fridge, when pissing etc.


2) He's constantly doing really weird things even when he thinks no one is watching. For example, he'll fill his glass with water and drink with a teaspoon. When I see him passing through the central corridor, which paint is old/crumbly (I can't choose the right words, sorry :/) he'll pick some of the paint and put it in his mouth. Also, he's constantly logging out of our shared Netflix account and later deny that he was the one who did it (I've seen it twice). He'll spill out some of the toothpaste through the sink for no reason... These are just some things from the top of my head.


3) When we gather to watch TV, just the 3 of us or with friends, he'll speak the subtitles out loud and disturb everyone around him. When we call him out, he becomes very angry and denies that he's doing it!


4) He has a knives collection inside his wardrobe and the way he treats it creeps me out. Seriously, he always examines them when he arrives at home. I've suggested that he kept the knives at the kitchen, but my friend told me that he collects knifes since he was a child. It no longer bothers me that much, I think.


5) I've caught him messing with my stuff. Haven't lost anything yet, but I've seen him reading my books, looking through my medicine box and some papers in my bedroom. I've noticed that some things are sometimes not where I leave them, like my wallet and some clothes.


6) He's extremely judgemental about my sexuality. I'm gay, no big deal for my friend. He makes a couple of rude jokes but honestly I don't  think he makes them to offend me. Well, once he accidentally used my shaving razor (he had broken his, and thought mine was his cousin's, but it's an odd mistake to make considering the appearences of our razors). Immediately after, he went to the local blood center to get tested for HIV. I was very offended by that as I'm not HIV+ and that's why I'm writing this.


Should I talk to him or my friend first? At first I thought he was just weird but I genuinely think that he is insane. My friend is always very defensive when I point out something about his cousin to him, and I don't think I can go through the process of moving right now (extremely busy and exhausted from work/university).",25Jan2019,1

521,"Hi just want a few opinions on my renting circumstance at the moment. The flat who live underneath us play really loud dance music/films from about 12-11pm to the extent it thuds through my floor and interrupts me listening to my music. I have been down multiple times to ask them to turn it down and even invites him into my flat so he could hear how loud it was but it always creeps back up over the next week. The guy who lives there is also really rude to me and laughed when I told him it caused me anxiety and that my cat runs from the room when they play it too loud. I complained to the landlord over email but she didn't reply. I emailed her again and phoned her (no answer) and she said she'd get her husband to talk to the guy. Next day there's still no reply. So I email her again asking for her or her husband to come over and sort it out but she just arranged for the noisy neighbour to come up again into my apartment without either of them here. I was really angry and told her she needs to come over to sort it, so she reluctantly agreed.  During the visit, I went down into the noisy neighbours  apartment to hear their sound level (i was expecting it to be just bad insulation) but it was extremely loud - to the extent they could hear it in every room in their apartment and that I don't even know how they talk to each other when it's that volume. The landlord basically didn't want to deal with the problem so was like oh this is a fine level even though we could clearly hear it in my apartment so it didn't solve the problem. Then the landlord basically told me to work it out with him and for me to give him my phone number so I can text him if he's too loud. After the visit, I looked at my tenancy agreement and it mentions how tenants shouldn't make unreasonable levels of noise and annoy other tenants. I phoned citizens advice and the agency who wrote the tenancy agreement and they were shocked that the landlord hadn't dealt with it herself as the tenancy agreement puts the responsibility on her. I then emailed her this and basically told her it's her responsibility and I'm not hassling the guy downstairs to turn down his music. It's been two days and she still hasn't replied... what do you think I should do?

- the flats have been acoustically tested so we shouldn't be able to hear them 
- I have told the landlord it has been affecting my mental health badly and prevents me from studying in the apartment

522,"Hey guys, I would love to post this in r/ADHD but I’ve tried about 6 times and my post fails every time. I’ve recently been diagnosed and it explains so much. I’m actually crying while I type this.

I’m not stupid. I’m not forgetful. I am worth it. I can do things. I’ve gone my entire life thinking I’m not enough and that I’m stupid and that I can’t complete any task, when in reality I have an extreme case of ADHD. I’m trying to get medicated right now.

Does anyone at all know any ways I can handle it? I have problems with many symptoms including:

-Repitition. When someone says something to me or I say something, I latch onto it and repeat it over and over and over in my head. I end up completely missing what the other person says or misunderstanding them completely. It makes serious talks about feelings with my boyfriend difficult and makes me dwell and become anxious and guilty when they are over.

-Misunderstanding. My brain works so fast that I often hear people wrong. For example, today my boyfriend was going to pack himself a bowl of weed before taking a nap. He said, “I’m gonna pack a toke.” but I heard, “I’m gonna go.” so I repeated his phrase back to him to make sure I had it right, and he corrected me. He then jokingly said ‘pathetic’ and laughed but I could obviously see he was frustrated by it.  This nearly made me cry.

-Forgetting things. I’m sick of making waffles and going over the kitchen 5 times to be sure I’ve cleaned up, only to notice the waffle box on the microwave an hour later. It makes me feel stupid for not even being able to complete the task of waffle cleanup.

-Overthinking. I can’t hear anything or be told anything without way overthinking all possibilities. I’ll hyper focus on the topic. For example—my boyfriend has a new female friend who I am as of recently insanely jealous over because I told myself, “If you keep thinking about her she will begin to bother you.” And doing that made me think about her for an entire day. I’m working on getting over these feelings now but it’s harder to undo.

-Weird planning? I’m not sure how to explain this one, my therapist told me this was a symptom. I have a habit of preparing myself when I go out. If I’m going to my local fish store, I spend about half an hour walking around the house talking to myself as if I’m talking to someone there who’s asking me intrusive questions about my tank. I do it to be prepared for all questions so I know what to say, and because I love talking about my fish.

-Procrastination due to distraction. As a top post on r/ADHD says, “Anyone else put in headphones to listen to music only to realize 30 minutes later you still haven’t turned your music on?”

-Loss of motivation. I can be SUPER into something when I go to bed, and in the morning, nothing. That to do list I wrote where I wanted to clean the entire couch? I could have done that last night, now it will never be done. I’ll half start things and get distracted and then when I revisit it, I have no interest in it. My boyfriend loves minecraft but I always want to make an entirely new world every time because the only ones are now ‘tainted’ and used and I don’t have interest in them.

I want to see if I can get medicated for it but I’m not sure yet. My focusing is only ever on bad things and it’s given me diagnosed generalized anxiety and clinical depression. I’m suffering.",25Jan2019,1
524,"I’ve been at my job for 6 months now, and around the 5 month mark I was pulled into the office and told I was doing great so they’re gonna give me a raise (woot woot!!). 

This is the first job I’ve stayed at for 6 months or over, and the first job I’ve gotten a raise.

We do not have pay stubs (at least that I can access) and our employee time works app does not say our hourly rate. 

It was the last day before Christmas and in my profession (working with kids) it’s just a really fun day/week to work, so like an I idiot I said “thanks so much! I appreciate it” and didn’t even ask how much it was for. I was really distracted because of how giddy I was (along with everyone else) about it being Christmas.

Let’s start at the beggining.The first odd thing happened when we were is the process of renovating the house.Our,and the neighbour’s downstairs and upstairs window look at each other(across the street if you know what I mean).My dad was painting the walls in my  bedroom upstaires so he opened the window(there wasn’t any blinds or curtains yet).He noticed a figure in the neighbour’s upstairs window,as if it was just standing there, then, a few minutes later, when he turned to face the window again,the neighbour’s window was open and someone was looking into my room with a telescope.My father closed my window and ignored it.A few weeks later, when we moved in, my parents met the neighbours and they said there wasn’t anything off about them.

Similar incidents kept happening(are still happening).We can often see the neighbour pulling away their curtain to get a better view of us when we’re in the front garden.I mentioned it to my parents but they told me to ignore it,they’re just a bit nosey.They would look when I left to school and stuff etc.
As my parents(mainly my father)kept having conversations with the man from the neighbour, he found out that the man knew every freaking thing about our “time schedule”.He knows when my father leaves for work,(my mom works at home)when I leave for school etc.What’s creepy and annoying is that he even knew stuff like what package delivery came to our house and when, if we ordered pizza, if we had guest over,when we would usually leave to grocery shop on the weekends etc.
Then another really annoying thing came.The neighbours started to copy us in the sense that, for example, if we got a new kitchen cabinet or new light fixture they would do the same, pretty similary.

The reason I decided to write this post is this upcoming part of the story; this was the last drip of water in the cup.The man and the women have a son.Now, I don’t know much about him, and I don’t mean to judge him either.The guys is in his late 20s (28 or something) and he still lives at home.(I’m not offending anyone who does for financial reason and stuff btw the guy has a job so...)Apparently the guy is crazy introverted(nothing wrong with that tho) but he’s very odd.He stared at me in a bikini twice before(he could see into out garden from theirs) and he looks like all he does is play video games, probably never had a girlfriend is his life,watch a shit ton of porn and jerk off.....lol ok.
A few months ago the started this thing where he would pull is curtain a bit to the side which I can clearly see from my window when open and close it.I think he is looking but I don’t know why.It’s super creepy cuz I’m a 18 girl that dickhead is almost 30.
Later on I realised something.There were some really annoying bugs on my window every evening so what I did was, I rolled my blinds up, opened the window turnd down the light in my room(cuz I didn’t want them to see inside) but i had to turn my flashlight on to be able to spray the bugs and that I a probably the time that creppy ass dude started watching me from his window.

Now I know this might doesn’t sound like a big deal to a lot of people however it is to me.My parents know all about these thing(as i mentioned, they’re also involved in some of them) The “starring at me in a bikini” part weirded them a lot and they’re also annoyed by the constant lurking.They don’t want to comfort the neighbours because the man of the family tends to make up rumors/ twist out stories to other neighbours and we don’t want him to turn the other neighbours against us or anything.
I’m actually really good at comforting people(but that’s out of the picture) I’m very hot headed and I don’t want to cause a sence either.
I know most people would tell me to ignore them(lately my parents have been telling me that too) but I can’t ignore it..everytime i open my window or roll down the blinds I see that freaking window with the curtain pulled aside and since that freak is in his room all day he could be looking.It annoys me that I’m scared to leave the blinds rolled up with the lights on at night because he’ll see me get changed and stuff.i’m out of ideas on how to make this stop..if you have any advice or tips, pls let me know,I would appreciate it.",25Jan2019,1
526,"For some background I am a 21 college student in a state away from home, so I'm not exactly around the house that much. Pretty much as the title says, my 16 year old brother is a compulsive liar who despite being punished numerous times (months long groundings, removal of technology, removal of privileges such as car use) has refused to change his ways. He will lie about anything, even things that seem completely inconsequential. Otherwise he is smart, but makes the minimum effort to apply himself in school. He's attracted a crowd of like minded kids who see him as some kind of role model. He craves the approval of these kids and seems to believe that partying and risky behavior is the only way to gain it. I've talked to him about these things many times. Told him about the opportunities he's blowing, that these kids are not his real friends, the importance of hard work and honesty, and he just doesn't seem to give a shit. Me and my two other siblings have grown incredibly fed up with his exaggerations and dishonesty and my father claims that this has led to us ""bullying"" him by constantly harping on him for his dishonesty. I admit at times I have grown frustrated with him to the point of confronting him in non-helpful ways. However, my dad says that because we've run out of patience with him on some occasions, that means anything we've tried to do to help him is worth nothing. I've tried talking him through these issues on a huge number of occasions. I've also made a point to spend time with him (playing video games, hiking, driving him around) while not talking about his problems but just saying I'm there for him if he needs me. When his school was trying to expel him a few years back (fighting) I wrote an impassioned letter that I believe helped him out a lot. I've reminded my dad of this, but despite this he says that me and my siblings need to be punished for not helping him more, and that punishment is cutting us all of financially. He says he recognizes that this won't help our brother but feels he has to do it. I'm looking for advice for how to deal with my brother and my dad. I'm no psychologist and behaviorally I don't have any idea what's going on with my brother. My dad has some anger management issues, but I wouldn't say he's been through any kind of trauma that would justify his behavior. My dad also makes no sense to me, he says that cutting us off isn't because my brothers behavior is our fault, but as punishment for not helping him enough. Also opinions on military school? I don't know anything about it and I'm not sure yanking him out of school and sending him to the south to get yelled at by some drill instructor with a bunch of other kids with behavioral issues is the best idea. Any advice on how to help my brother, and how to deal with my dad is appreciated.",25Jan2019,1
527,"I am 22 years old and a final year student in Computer Science. I've never worked in my life and did not do many household chores until this year when I decided to grow up. I've pretty much realized in my relationship with my bf that I have a lot of work to do on being capable and independent. Also, most students in CS work full time because the diploma is jack shit compared to experience. I'd also like to add that my grades are alright, but not stellar. I'm a good student that is interested in most subjects and I talk about the ideas constantly, but I always fall short on exams. I tend to be a little frightened by exams, usually going to the bathroom to breathe for a good chunk of the exam time or getting scared when I don't know an answer to the point where I refuse to touch the subject (even if I ""kind of"" know it). 

I sometimes give lessons to younger kids for extra cash and I enjoy explaining, but I find it really tiring. After 3 hours with one student I feel drained and I am worried 8 hours with hundreds will wear me off and ruin my alrrady shaky self esteem. Also, I'd like to have children one day and I don't know if I can bear the public shame of being a working mother in front of the most judgemental group of people(college students). One of my favourite teachers is pregnant and my heart broke for the things people said about her. 

My father, however, does not see it that way. In his eyes I am jeopartizing my possible intellectual future. Because I taught some of his friends' children(brats) the absolute mathematical basics he thinks I must be a teaching genius. He is unaware of how my grades are not nearly enough for an academic career and seems to think that ""being articulate and enjoying the subject"" is even slightly enough to make it. He tells me constantly that I should quit my job (I only worked there for 2 months and I am still in training). If he does not say it, he hints it very obviously. He works with people and he is used to ""playing them"", but I see through his acts and I want none of it. It involves explaining me how my future will look like on each path and giving me examples of people who failed their lives. He begs me to not ruin my life. He also wants me to remain in my shitty country instead of leaving it (like all true professionals in my domain). 

I only work 20 hours a week in my current job(a small company making software for constructions), which is barely enough, and I still live with my parents. I like my job, I feel confident about something in my life and I really think it helps my career and my coding skills a lot more than college subjects (that I still pass). 

Meanwhile, my mother is an educator and she begs me to reject the whole academic idea, because in her eyes ""people only appreciate you in a abstract way, when it comes to real life they refuse to understand the struggle of the job and how tiring it is. They think you go to work for fun and barely deserve to be paid. God help you don't make any mistakes ever or you will be scutinized for it"". 

What should I do? Am I a sheep for choosing to work a simple coding job over a more ""intellectual"" one? What should I do with my father? We are growing apart and if anyone had a hint how to fix that too, I'd love to hear it ",25Jan2019,1

I have been focusing on school and grades and my own stuff (mostly online work or fixing pc’s) and I noticed I have been lacking communication with the opposite gender and confidence. I try to be as self-aware as I can and I’m currently trying to build up that confidence. I have started talking to girls a lot more but it just ends nowhere, like they aren’t considering me as a potential bf or something. So yeah sorry for the long read bla bla bla",25Jan2019,1
536,"I’ll try to make this as quick of a read as possible. But it’s a long story. There is this girl I work with on Saturday nights. I just started working this job again during Christmas break and ever since I’ve been back this girl has been all over me imo. She’s constantly dropping sexual innuendos to me, touching my body in a way that I believe is more than friendly because I’ve never seen her touch anybody else that way. Also he always invites me back to her apartment. She just broke up with her bf a few weeks ago and she even told me she was going to do so before hand. She didn’t tell anybody else. 

I’ll start with the sexual innuendos. Saying that she liked my skinny jeans and how they showed her what I was working with. One night in the back of the restaurant where we work she said hey nick it’s dark quiet and it’s just me and you what are you gonna do about it. I said I’m gonna take out this trash. It was raining and I told he jokingly that she could hold my glasses. I came back in and she handed me back my glasses and I said without my glasses I would be bumping into walls, then she replied with saying that I could bump into her vaginal wall. Later that night when I was telling a story about my recent run in with a pot brownie that was too strong for me. I told her what kind of mattress I had. She told me that she’s never rode anybody on that type of mattress before. One day I was putting whip cream away in a back which she insisted helping me with. And while she held the bag and I scooped in the whipped cream she asked if I was going to do this to her later. There are plenty more of these type of stories but I’ll end there. 

She’s invited me back to her place after she told me that I was taking her out on a DATE after work, and nothing sexual happened. She still had a bf at the time. And now she asks if I want to help her take down her Christmas tree or how much her cat misses me. 

She’s also touching me in a very suggestive way. Weather it be running against me like a cat does when they like you. Knocking flour off my t shirt while standing within a 1/4 inch of my body while she literally rubbed me down. Hugging me and refusing to let go. Always touching my arms and holding on to them, paired with an occasional head resting on my shoulder. 

So the other day my sister in law got sick of me over analyzing this situation she wrote her a message on fb as me asking her how her weekend was and if she still needed help taking down her Christmas tree? She replied with a yeahhhhhhhh, I think I’m gonna leave it up forever. She’s normal shirt though texts I guess. 

So I’m asking you is she into me or I’m I just getting played with by the biggest tease of all time. I haven’t worked with her since I sent the text. And btw one of my women coworkers said that I’m still in a good spot. And everybody is telling me it’s that obvious so plz tell me what you think. Sorry it was so long but it had to be.

540,"17F. Around 5 months ago, after my parents spent a long time bullying me about my weight, I went on a diet. I was never 'fat' but I was never a skinny girl, although, stereotypically, I always wanted to be. The diet was strict and in a matter of months I lost 20kg. It became slightly obsessive, although I would always make sure I ate provided it was 'good' food. People were positive about the weight loss but concerned I would take it too far. I was adamant I wouldn't and that I didn't have an eating disorder. Then I went through an extremely traumatic experience which resulted in multiple hospital visits, and as a consequence of being so deeply unhappy, I stopped eating. For 3 days I didn't eat a single thing, and after that, I couldn't stomach more than a few mouthfuls in a day. In less than two weeks I dropped a further 7 kg. I wasn't originally looking for weight loss, or control, I was just so unhappy, my tastes changed, I wasn't hungry, even the thought of food was repulsive and I'm full after a few bites. But seeing how skinny I'm becoming is a small silver lining. Before, I wanted to eat but I couldn't. Now, I still can't, but I don't want to. My family and friends keep telling me to break my diet so the small amounts I can manage will be more calorie dense, but I won't do it. I can't. No one will push me because of how fragile I am, and the bones slowly becoming more defined are the one thing making me happy at the moment. I'm not looking for pity, I just want to know how to break out of this cycle",25Jan2019,1

544,"I've always been a PC user. I mean the possibility to just shove an extra drive into it when you're running out of space or take off the side cover when it's getting too hot is just neat and I love it.

My current PC has been my best friend for the past seven years and it's not getting old yet, works like a charm, I don't think I would be replacing it in next three years or so. I like playing games and working in virtual machines, so I need a computer that can handle that. Mine does so far and chuckles only once in a while here and there.

The problem is I will be traveling a lot starting July, probably until March 2020 or so. I cannot take my beloved PC with me as it's too big, heavy and clumsy. Last time I borrowed someone's old laptop and although technically it did work, it was pain in the ass to use it.

Should I buy a laptop (for the sake of comfort) or try borrowing it once again (college student budget)? What price range should it be? On one hand I am willing to spend more on a device that will last longer and provide me more comfort, but on the other it's just a year and I don't want to spend a lot of money on something that will go unused next year (I prefer PCs and after my travels I will switch back to a PC). For me, an affordable laptop is €250 (although that's still a lot of money) and less, expensive is up to €1000. Are used laptops worth it? I am afraid of worn out batteries and post-nuclear keyboards. Should I buy a laptop right now to get used to it, or wait until June because prices might drop just a few euros more?",25Jan2019,1

547,"Hi so idk where to put this but I’m in a pretty weird situation and I need advice on what to do. 

This past Monday I was depositing a check at the drive up atm at my bank at around 1pm, when a dude about my age (23) approached me and asked if I could cash his paycheck for him. When I asked why, he said because his girlfriend usually did it but she was issued a new card recently and forgot her pin. It was Martin Luther King Jr. day and the bank was closed, so being the helpful (passive) person I am, I said sure. He starts asking me about my paychecks and if I have direct deposit or not, weird financial questions. (Red flag)

That was when he gave his gf in the car about 20ft away from us a thumbs up and she left. Immediately freaked (I’m a small woman), I asked where she was going and he said “to get some blunts or something” This dude was obviously high. Red flags were going off all over but before I had time to process what was going on, he had deposited his check already, as my previous transaction screen was still up. Now, I’d figured it would be a reasonable paycheck; less than $1k I could do. It was for $2000. I told him I didn’t have that kind of money in my account at the moment and he got mad asking how I was gunna give him his money. 

I panicked. I withdrew as much as I could from that atm ($600) and he told me to drive him to another atm to get more. He got in my car without asking and I froze. Not wanting to escalate the situation, and really thinking I owe this guy $1400, I drove us to a nearby 7/11. Mind you, the whole time this was happening, he kept talking in circles, switching up the amount he was asking for. Not higher, as you’d think, but lower? “I need that other $600” or “this place will give me the last $400” very sketch but he looked like a normal guy, so maybe he was just too high.

We get to 7/11 and he tries to get me to load these prepaid cards, which you can’t do without cash. He’s getting angry with the cashier like it’s her fault and I tell him “listen man, give me your number and we’ll figure all this out tomorrow when the banks are open” (mostly because if this check is fake, it’ll bounce and I can have back up at the bank) At first he resists but eventually he gives in and gets back in the car. At this point I just want this to be over so I ask him if I can drop him off at a nearby grocery store for his gf to pick him up. He insists on going to Walmart to try more cards and atms but I’m tired and almost certain I’m being robbed so I stop caring and drive to the grocery store anyway.

We get there and he says “ok if they can’t do cashback, you can leave me here.” Yea dude, no shit. I’m leaving you anyway. This guy for real thought wegmans was gunna give him hundreds of dollars in cashback if he kept switching registers. So high. Naturally knowing we’re gunna get denied, I walk up the the service desk and ask for the maximum in cashback. $60. He is not happy. I told him I’d call him tomorrow and we’d meet at the bank and get this sorted out later, so he puts his number in my phone and I text him so he has mine (these are all dumb moves, I know). But when I ask to see the text to confirm that he gave me the right number, he flat out refuses.

For the past half hour this kid has been nothing but rude to me, a person genuinely trying to help. Calling me ignorant and rude, saying I’m stealing from him and since im treating him poorly, he’s gunna pay it forward and treat someone else poorly(?). Idk man, the phone thing was the last straw so I turn around and walk away. Not even caring that I was out $660. He doesn’t come after me or anything (thank god). 

Come Tuesday, work let’s me out about 2 hours later than the time i told him I’d call (thanks service industry). But I have no calls or texts from him or any other number I don’t recognize. That’s it, I was scammed. Shit happens. Live and learn. Luckily I’m in a place for the first time in my life where $660 isn’t a detrimental amount. 

Anyway, Wednesday I received an email from my bank saying someone may have been trying to defraud(?) me (surprise) and they were gunna send me a new card soon. Cool. I was waiting for this check to bounce so I could go on with my life. 

But instead of bouncing, yesterday the check cleared. 

I have so many questions. Was that dude genuine? Why did I get a fraud notice? If he really needed his money, why didn’t he make sure he had my number? Do I need to transfer to a new bank account? Is he gunna be staking out the bank from now on? It’s only Friday, it can still bounce right? I have no idea what to do. I’m afraid to call that number bc some part of me still thinks it was a scam but idk what to think anymore. Help?",25Jan2019,1

So the situation: 

I lost my job a week ago, for an unfair reason i contacted a lawyer who investigated my issue and decided that they were able to represent me. This will take place via a phone conference, aprox. 2hrs to settle any matters, now i have been burnt by this company twice and in both times they have failed to do their jobs and the employees have faced the outcome of poor management. 

Anyways, i got my condition of offer from the lawyer with the final fee i'll have to pay $3,285 to have them represent me. I mentioned it and made it clear i don't want to be reinstated compensation is fine but my ultimate goal is to put an end to a corrupted system. If i win the case and get compensation it'll be six months pay, which will easily pay the conditional fee. 

However my problem is, how do i handle this problem? My stress is through the roof because i'm going back and forth deciding if i should go through with it and my anxiety is saying "" what if it fails ""

553,"My joint bank account with my wife (fiancé at the time) was setup with my wife’s maiden name (as we weren’t married yet).

Several of our guests wrote checks as gifts. Unfortunately, some people wrote checks out to “(Husband) and (Wife) (Married Last Name)”. Shortly after the wedding and honeymoon, I tried depositing these checks. Both of our names were on the check, so it had to go into the joint account.

I'm currently enrolled at a university and living in a dorm but I am miserable. I did 2 years of college online, took a gap year and came here. I can't change housing arrangements and my roommate is a pain in the ass. I've been having a hard time adjusting this semester being back, getting adjusted to a fixed schedule and being away from home has me an emotional wreck. I'm curious if pursuing the rest of my undergraduate education with an online program like SNHU or Pheonix or another similar university would be a good alternative to a traditional education. Is there anyone out there with any experience with the quality/affordability of these programs? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! I want to stick it out and get my degree but in fields that are as heavily reliant on experience and practice as photography and writing is, I'm wondering if an Online degree would be a better path for me or perhaps even a more affordable one",25Jan2019,1
557,"Hi everyone, sorry for the wall of text and for formatting as I’m on mobile.  Minor details have been changed for privacy reasons. 

My best friend (K) and I have been friends since 2009, so just over 10 years and we met in High School. 

K is complicated. She suffers from a lot of mental health illnesses, all have been properly diagnosed by medical professional, which include:
- PTSD 
- Bi Polar Disorder
- Schizoaffective Disorder
- Depression
- General anxiety 

K also has a history of suicidal thoughts but has been deemed safe against harm for herself or others. 

K also holds down 3 part time nursing jobs to support her sick Mom and siblings. This burden falls completely on her as her father is highly toxic, drug abuser and gambler. 

She’s very highly functional but she’s always come to me at times of distress which I always accommodated for her. 

She’s in the habit of starting and stopping her medications and saying they don’t work so she doesn’t take them. She’s been on more than 8 different treatment plans and never sticks to it for more than a couple of months at a time (most I think was 7-8 months). 

I’ve always supported her. Always. 

I now have a family. I was married young (21) and had a family at a young age (22). I had twin girls at 22 and I had my son last year. I also work full time.

After my kids, I have still supported her and offered a safe place for her to visit. My house is her ‘safe and happy place.’ She’s come to sleep sometimes, comes to eat if there’s no food at home, comes to see my kids and is very loving and warm to them (90% of the time). 

Now to the real issue. She’s been in a depressive low for a couple of months. Last night she attempted suicide (again). She texted me her goodbyes and would not tell me where she was or what she’d taken. This was at midnight, and just stopped responding to my texts. I have no other means of contacting her family, as I’m not close with them and have only really met them a handful of times. 

This is NOT the first time she’s done this. She did this a month or so ago, and I told her how it was unfair of her to tell me this and not give me an in to find her help. I tried so hard to help her afterwards and to get her to actually go and see her therapist but she’s flat out refused any help. 

Once I noticed she didn’t want any help and was just saying her ‘goodbyes’ and she’d stopped responding, I did too last night.  I couldn’t sleep at all just worrying about her but she’d blocked me from contacting her. 

I feel it’s so unfair to me to put me in a situation, where she knows I can’t leave my house physically to find her, she won’t offer me any type of in and just blocks me out. I know she’s fine because she texted me this morning that she’s ok.

I feel like giving up on our friendship or am I being selfish? Is there a way to do it that won’t cause her to spiral more than she already is? I feel like it’s a lot to take on, plus I have my family and work FT. 

TLDR; My friend has a lot of mental health illnesses and has more than once attempted suicide and put my in a position where I couldn’t help and just worried overnight for her. Should I ditch the friendship or is it selfish?

562,"Excluding my 2 bosses, we have a 4 person team including myself. Three of those people are making a stink that they will leave soon, given our boss never comes to work. 

They told me this “in confidence” and said not to tell the owners, but I honestly don’t think they have it in them to leave. They make more here than they would anywhere else and 2 of them have a kid together. 

The owners have recently promoted me to business manager and most of the problems stem from late checks, no supplies and lack of guidance. With the promotion, I should be able to clear these problems up once I get access to the accounts necessary. The shift has begun but is a slow process. Quite honestly, I’ve only seen my boss for an hour in the past month and a half. The only communication to the employees comes through me and it is sparse. 

Basically what I’m asking, is do I tell the owners that the team is talking of quitting and causing a giant headache for myself or do I just take it as the bluff I see it for? The bosses despise these other employees so I only worry about their job functions not being filled- they take some specific training. Although their absence would only cause a temporary back log, it would also be a total shit show. 

I’ve been given the go ahead to start hiring but want access to the bank and payroll before I bring anybody else in. I’m thinking that even if they quit, I could get a replacement beforehand and it wouldn’t matter. FYI- I’m sticking around because the promotion more than doubled my pay.

566,"My ex and I dated pretty much all through 4 years of high school. We broke up our sophomore year (second semester) but got back together during summer the same year (going into junior year).  Everything was perfect! We got closer and more in love with each other than before. Traveled together and would be with each other almost every day but once graduation started to come up things turn for the worst.

My ex graduated but I didn’t and I always felt like maybe that’s what started it but idk. I was very happy for her and all my “friends” (we had the same group of friends) but apart of me was really sad and embarrassed because I didn’t graduate. I managed to get a job which cheered me up a bit. 

I left the job to go back to school as a “super senior” but that didn’t work out and I dropped out. Our relationship was still going well in till September (2018) rolled around. The first “red flag” was when I went through her phone and found out she had made a“finsta”. she would post pictures of her and our friends (pics I haven’t even seen before) and followed guys she’s had talk to before, after we broke up sophomore year. She also posted a booty pic and all the guys in our “group of friends” liked it and followed her. 

I forgave her but I started to gain major trust issues with her and my so called “friends”. As the months went by she seems to get more shady and would lie about everything (who she would be with, go to parties behind my back, catch her with the finsta again). I would always forgive her and go back to her. I finally had enough and ended our relationship in November. 

When we broke up I became really depressed. As time went by I thought I would get over it but it seems to just be getting worse. she seemed not even fazed by the breakup! She goes with our group of friends everywhere, had a New Years party at her house, goes to the gym, and go to parties. I’ve always had her and my friends, so having no one is a new feeling for me.

568,"I met a guy in school in October 2017 and we have been friends since then, the first day I talked to him we were walking on a boardwalk and he kept finding rocks and giving them to me, at that time I felt nothing for him but recently I have felt myself having a high school crush on him, I don’t know if he doesn’t like me or does but just wants to hide it.

Signs I’ve gotten.

-He teases me constantly, like poking at my waist my back and flicking my hair, arm wrestling, and he likes to walk and bang his shoulder against my shoulder.

-When sitting down just two days ago when I was sitting next to him in a desk his knee touched mine the whole time, it isn’t the first time either.

-Everyone thinks we are dating, even his sister; I’ve been asked if I was dating him multiple times by peers.

-Yesterday when walking down the hall to leave school a male from our class asked when he was going to ask me out.

-Yesterday we were fooling around and I accidentally touched his member I realized my fault immediately and apologized my face blood red with embarrassment, he only laughed and when I apologized he said it was no big deal he even said ‘it’s not the first time you’ve touched me.’ 

-There’s a girl in our class and whenever I come around he begins to flirt with her, I’ve seen how he acts with her when he wasn’t aware that I was around and it was in no way flirtatious, he does it when I’m next to him.

-He has taken time off lunch from playing sports with his friends to come play something with me.

-He likes to be stronger, taller, bigger frame, hands, feet and more dominant for whatever reason.

-When we walk down the hallway together he points out a random guy and asks ‘is that your man!?’

-He jokes about me being with a friend in our class, and he asks me about my sexuality and if I tell him I’m aromantic (Ive realized I’m not) he says he doesn’t believe me almost like he doesn’t want me to be.

-He often in any position has his feet pointed towards me.

-He tries to act like he doesn’t care if anything ever happens to me or if I get hurt infront of myself and others but once my desk fell when I almost tipped over and he grabbed the desk immediately, that’s not the first time he has checked.

-A couple times  I have seen him looking at me and when I look back he turns away very quickly.

-We have inside jokes and pet nicknames.

-He comments on my body jokingly (never mean.)

Sometimes it feels like he likes me and other times I’m second guessing, I wonder if it’s he actually has a crush on me and is too afraid to admit so he tries to hide it or that he’s just not interested.

Since everyone already has their friends, it's nearly impossible to try and make new friends.

So on top of not having time, I also have no friends here.

I love making music but I have no time for that and it's truly a mood-ruiner. I honestly have no idea what to do.

573,"This is one of those ""my entire life up to this point has been a disaster"" posts and I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

TL;DR
I'm 28. My parents are nuts and miserable to be around. I have no friends and almost never leave the house except to exercise alone. I had a wonderful GF but I pushed her away due to my emotional problems. I don't feel like it's possible to achieve any kind of happy life at this point.

Long version:
I want to have a real life with friends and family and love and strong connections. But my situation right now is almost the exact opposite of that and although I am working to improve, I am feeling like I won't ever have a happy life.

I'm 28 years old, I have almost no friends and none that I see regularly. I have a few hobbies and dreams but I waste most of my time playing video games and watching youtube. I had an incredible girlfriend who was the only person whos ever truly loved me, but I pushed her out of my life because I was projecting my self hatred onto her. Even after we split up she kept waiting for me and asking me to take her back for years. I would do anything to have another chance with her now but that's no longer a possibility.

My parents are kind of crazy and when I was a kid I emulated their crazy behavior. This caused me to be a real asshole and not make many friends. It took me a long time to realize that my behavior was the problem and even after realizing it I failed to truly change the ways I treated people. This left me feeling alone, confused and hopeless.

I still to this day have serious personality flaws, some of which prevent me from making friends or even getting through basic interactions (like going to my brothers birthday party) without being annoying or at the very least awkward and offputting. I have incredibly low self esteem and I also have some serious emotional problems. One of them causes me to feel almost nauseous any time I feel happy, and I begin to hate myself so much that I'm left feeling confused and drained.

So, assuming anyone is still reading, heres where I'm at now:

I am feeling like there is no way to get from where I am now to having any kind of normal life. I want to go to a bar and hang out with friends. I want to go to Thanksgiving and feel happy and loved and relaxed. My parents are crazy and confused people and I am miserable any time I go to see them. And I am such a bent up weirdo that I can't even make friends, let alone make my own family of friends to spend the holidays with.

I've laid out some goals like daily meditation, exercising and working towards running a 10k. I've yet to quit on any of those and I'm feeling good about the progress so far.

I'm open to therapy although I've been to therapy in the past and it's never seemed to help.

Before I met him but still... Anyway not all of it was gay and I didn't read all of the erotica but from what I seem it was mainly about him being dominated by men or woman, like he just makes up random guys and then writes out a fantasy of the guy forcing him to do stuff on pain of exposure or pain in general or a girl noticing he is wearing girls clothes underneath his work clothes and blackmailing him for sex and tease him blatantly in public about it (the girls always have a dick in the ones read) but I only looked at some before putting it all back
....

so my boyfriend is a crossdresser with a fetish for dick? There is one were he makes up having flatmate that walked in on him dressing up and it was the gayest thing I had ever read, he even have himself ""Jenny"" in a lot of them! I am really confused, our sex life is decent but I guess he isn't that dominant. I feel a bit knocked off guard honestly I can tell I was probably never meant to find the box.

I honestly don't know how to feel, I am not against the idea of him dressing up but I have not really had a chance to process it.

577,"I'll try to be as brief as possible.

Back in the beginning of the recession of '08 I was in danger of defaulting on my auto loan.  I owed about 8k, but my father was kind enough to loan me the money and I was able to keep my vehicle.  I paid him back 5k of the 8k until I was laid off my job and was unable to keep making payments back to him.

He was very understanding and kind and didn't pressure me for the money, although I always felt guilty.  A few years later, in 2012, I got back on my feet again and started earning a lot more money again. I told my dad I'd repay him the 3k I owed him since I was back on my feet, but he told me to forget about it and consider it a gift.

So fast forward to present: A few months ago I was going over old budgets and I ran across a stock certificate my dad gave to me when I graduated High School in 1998; it's 20 years old.  I look up the ticker and it's worth well over 4k.  So I try to deposit it my investment accounts, but they won't let me because I wasn't the original buyer (my dad was, he gifted it to me).

So... in coordination with my broker and my father we get all the paperwork together to officially transfer the stocks to my account.  But over dinner my dad let slip that the stocks were still listed under his account.  This came to me as a surprise because he gave me the physical certificate years ago, and I've been holding onto it all this time.

I know he's been looking at his retirement figures as a whole and he's been counting the stocks he gave to me as part of that because he simply forgot to account for it after all these years.

I just don't know what do do.  On one hand my dad gave me this gift when I was 17 years old and expected me to enjoy it.  On the other hand he has bailed me out of a jam on more than one occasion and I really don't need the money, especially if it's coming out of his retirement account.  Besides I still technically owe him 3k and this stock certificate would cover it and more.

I have this packet of signed papers to send in, and I'm just debating if I should or not.  I don't want to insult my father by not accepting his gift to me, but I also don't want to dig into his retirement account.  It just feels weird.",25Jan2019,1

This already puts me behind for graduation next year as I will have to make these credits up, along with the new semester's grades as I will most likely end up failing them as well. Since this is a new High School, they are trying to make everything technology based. Every core class is online, some electives are but not all of them. You are graded based on cognitive skills and if you do not reach them by the end of the term/semester your grade is marked as incomplete and turns into an F the following semester. Which happened to me. My parents are very frustrated at me, and have already been talking to my counselors about this. I'm the one to blame and can't do anything about it. This is not traditional learning I am used to, I already have anxiety and hardly have any social skills so that doesn't help. At my previous High School as a Sophomore, I passed every single class with no problems. I understand I have to adapt to new things as this is an entirely different learning style, but I don't think I can. At this point, its either I can try and transfer back to my old High School and somehow make up the credits there (during after school programs/summer school).

583,"So... last night, me and a close friend were texting. She was on a camping trip with some of her other friends. After we stopped talking for a few minutes, she texted me and said: “I have a boner.” And called me. (I couldn’t answer her because for some reason I didn’t get the notification.) 
I laughed and claimed someone had taken her phone or she was crazy, and she then stated it wasn’t that, and that she had just chickened out on telling me she liked me. I told her I still thought this was some prank, but if she wanted me to take it seriously I could because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. She told me to “be honest.”
I told her I thought it was sweet, and that she was a very nice person and a wonderful friend to me and we have been a good team for a long time, but I didn’t feel the same way and I really wanted to stay friends with her because I enjoy our friendship.

This is where It gets weird...

She replies “damm... this isn’t (name of friend I was supposed to be texting) this is (name of one of her friends original friend went camping with) but don’t 
tell (original friend)”
I responded with “ok?”
“I was testing something out.” She explained.
I asked her if I could know what she was testing out and got no reply, although I know she saw the text because it told me she’s seen it.

A few minutes after this I got a snap from (original friend) and she seemed in high spirits and continued the previous conversation we were having over Snapchat like she didn’t know what had happened on the other platform.

The original girl knows I’m happily in love with someone else, and has never shown interest in me in the past as far as I know. In fact, she’s openly told me about all of her up and coming crushes and dates and people she’s been interested. I know both of them very well and consider them really close friends, so I refuse to believe this was the second girl pulling my leg. 

I don’t like the idea of being a test subject for something I don’t even know about. I don’t like that she pulled me partially into something I dont know about and now I want to know about it. Or worse, yeh other girl was just a scape goat to get out of her fear of things going awkward between us (which they surely wouldn’t.)

The easiest solution is to confront my friend about it and ask her what any of that was for and even meant, and keeping the original girl out of any of it to spare her the idea that her friend used her account to gather some sort of information from me and halt any potentially awkward conversations.
Or, I could just let it go which is also easy, but the thought of me needing to be “tested” haunts me.

Any ideas? Thoughts? I don’t know what to do.",25Jan2019,1

585,"My parents have been together for almost 12 years now and we are a family of 4. Before my mom got married to my dad, she had 3 kids with her ex-husband and they are now in their 20’s. I am asking for advice because one of my stepbrothers is very depressed and is struggling in life and his dad isn’t helping him so he can only turn to my mom. He lives with his girlfriend and her parents, but her parents are alcoholics and always harass and tease them because they are in their 20’s but can’t even support themselves. As a result, they need to move into a new place by February 1st, but they cannot afford a house to live in or rent an apartment room. I told my mom to let them live in our house, but she knows that my dad won’t allow it because he does not like him. As much as my mom wants to help support him, my dad is an extremely stubborn person and never listens to what she says. He does not love them because they are not his children and denies my mom the right to support him. He treated my 3 stepbrothers so poorly that they eventually decided to leave. He would turn the internet off at night, make them pay an absurd amount of rent, make them buy their own food, etc. My mom cannot do anything to support her son because of my dad and she feels really bad for not being able to defend him. Is there anything I can do to help this situation?",25Jan2019,1

588,"I’m in quite a pickle. I’ve wanted a dog for years and my dad finally said I can get one. We rent and the owner said dogs are allowed up to 35 pounds. The owner of the house is never available, we’ve been here for six years and I’ve never met him. I guess one time my dad tried calling him and he got upset. Anyways, I really want to adopt a dog but I know if you rent they need to talk to the owner to confirm dogs are allowed. We’ve had a dog since we moved in (just passed away) so they are definitely allowed but I don’t have any way for them to confirm that. 
I know they won’t let me adopt without confirming so my question is if I should lie and say we own the house. Apparently my friend got a dog by giving a different number and having her mom pretend to be the landlord when calling and my friends keep telling me to do that but I feel like if I’m going to lie I might as well make it one step easier and not have to deal with a phone call? 

I’m absolutely terrible at lying so I’m super nervous but really the worst thing that can happen is I’m denied a dog.

589,"First I'd like to clarify that this is my first post on Reddit and that I apologize if my formatting is terrible, I usually lurk, but it's about time I ask this...

&amp;#x200B;

Also to get some other things out I am a female (trust me its relevant to this question) and I also happen to be black.

&amp;#x200B;

After the winter break and school started I was finally in a class that I would actually enjoy--this being Game Design 1, in this classroom, there are on count three girls (including myself) while the rest is male-dominated. Several times I've experienced harassment by four guys one being physical, one verbally, and two others being emotional.

&amp;#x200B;

For the physical aspect, this classmate of mine continuously touches me despite me asking **(nearly pleading)** for him to ""please stop"", an example of his harassment has been: While I'm working on an assignment on game component research (finding examples of video games to put in my essay) he will come up from behind me and place his chin on the top of my head, he has done this about twelve times since I've been in the class (forgot to mention my district does Aday Bday schedule so I'm in this class for about 2 hours since its double blocked) and I don't think he cares. Another part of his harassment is: while we're in groups coming up with story ideas that can be realistically implemented into a game, he'll constantly tap my hands, shoulders, or even place both his hands on my back and *RUB* it for me to give him some attention--I have made it clear that I wanted him to stop but he hasn't and I'm quite sick of it.

&amp;#x200B;

*(OP note: This is not in any of the categories, but this guy also looks up games while I'm speaking in class to make sure "" I knOw iF thAt'S thE gAmE I acTuaLLy meAnt"" so he's basically thinking I'm lying like I'm trying to appeal to the guys which #1 fuck that, I never dated before, never had a crush and plan on keeping it that way until college)*

&amp;#x200B;

The verbal harassment I've also had to deal with comes with this boy (a freshman so..) winking and telling me he'd be happy to go easy on me with Fornite, I made it clear in that class I do not like the game and would rather play an action platformer, and he just rolled his eyes, on one account he got a boy who sat next to me to get my attention and (sadly) I gave it to him, he winked at me, and looked me up and down, I told him to ""fuck off"" which he replied with ""I'm kidding"" the rest of class he was asking for my gamertag and when I told him I don't fuck with Xbox he looked at me like I was disgusting (no offense if you play Xbox I don't mean to start anything). Other times he'd try to make me laugh by dumbing down comedy to me like I'm a dumbass or something.

&amp;#x200B;

The emotional counts of harassment are by two guys who sit really close to me, recently they used a slur for gays (fa--) and when I told them that I wasn't happy with that word, because my uncle, who killed himself by getting hit by a train in his car for having HIV happened to be gay, they laughed and asked ""why didn't he shoot himself in Arkansas"" MY FUCKING DEAD UNCLE AND THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK ""wHY dIdN't hE jUsT shOOt hImSelf?"" made me physically sick that I had to stop talking to them for the rest of class (they're the type of guys to use Libtard and blame SJW's for everything.) Not only that one of them shared their opinions on Karen from rdr2 by saying ""she has big tits I like girls with big tits"" (no I don't have big tits but I turned away before he could even see them) the other talked about how makeup ages women and I'm tempted to come into class with a full face.

&amp;#x200B;

The girls beside me haven't said a word (majorly for the fact they don't speak in class) and I honestly feel alone and embarrassed in the class, I literally don't feel comfortable near them, but I can't change my schedule as its too late, I genuinely enjoy video games and would love to be a part of making one, but these boys make me literally on edge for two hours because I'm scared one of them will grope or even intimidate me to date one of them. I am already stressed out from my PAP and AP classes (I also take a prereq in Law which is us basically debating **every.day**) but I also don't want to be seen as ""AngryBlackTwitchGamerGirl"" so I just want them to understand and respect me like they do EVERY OTHER FUCKING GUY IN THAT CLASS.

 I hate to be confrontational but if that's what it takes then so be it, as the last thing I want to be seen as in that class is eye-candy for a bunch of assholes. ",25Jan2019,1

This  might sound crazy but I have a crush on this girl for three years now  and I don't know why she can't just accept me. Other guys seem to hook  up with her without a problem, so I have come to the conclusion that  maybe its because of my short stature which really brings down my self  esteem. Besides that I can't do most stuff that most boys of my age can  (riding a bike, climbing trees or approaching girls ). So is there  anything you can suggest which might make me stand a chance with this  girl.

For a little more background I  grew up with my sisters who are quite ignorant so I don't have anyone to hear me out. Sorry if I'm wasting your time",25Jan2019,1
594,"My mom has a chihuahua and lives out in a dessert area with lots of coyotes that eat dogs. You can’t have your dogs out between dusk and dawn. All night you can hear coyotes snarling and howling at something they’ve found. My mom has already lost three dogs to coyotes.

We have a front yard with a fence that her dog Cindy can fit through to go out into the dessert alone, and she does whenever she can. To prevent her from doing this, you either need to supervise her while she’s out in the courtyard, or put a big pillow on her so she can’t fit through the bars if she tries. Everyone in the family knows this as it has been the charade for years and years.

For months now, Cindy has been found randomly outside roaming during prime coyote hours which are dusk and dawn way too often. It seems to happen three or four times a week. No one has been able to figure out what is going on. Each time she has had her pillow on too, which makes it even weirder. 

One morning I was out on the porch hidden from view to anyone going outside, but easily seen by anyone coming in. I saw my dad come out, walk over to the gate, open it slightly and look around, and then very gently close it so it didn’t latch. To me it looked very deliberate to make sure the gate was not closed and could be opened by pushing. On his way back he saw me and said “Oh hi Tyler” and then went inside. 

Seconds later, the door reopened and out came my mom’s dog with her pillow on. She systematically walked straight to the gate, bumped it, and went right outside. It seems like a ritual event. I immediately went outside and grabbed her and latched the gate closed.

My opinion somewhat permanently changed of my dad when I saw that. It really scared me and still does. It just seems so callous and disturbing.

For Christmas we decided to get my mom this special vest with spikes on it that she could simply leave on Cindy at all times and then it wouldn’t matter if she was left outside. It would pierce the coyotes’ mouths at first bite attempt and they would leave her alone. We all kinda knew that my dad would hate that gift but we didn’t care. It solved the problem.

Ever since Christmas, the vest has been working great, and my dad is livid. He says he thinks it’s ugly and he can never pet her with it on. He keeps taking it off and hiding it the house, and then blaming my mom that she lost it. We find it in the oddest places, like in closets. 

Today, we found out that Cindy got out and bit our neighbor. My dad says that she simply can never be allowed outside the gate again, and we all agree with him.

The problem is, he is now stating that since she’s not allowed outside the gate, *we need to now send the vest back as it is no longer needed*. My mom is also telling me that the situation is extremely strenuous and is affecting their marriage.

Do I just give up and send back the vest? Am I under any civic duty to protect this dog, which would be at the apparent expense of the relationship with my dad?

TL;DR My dad doesn’t like my mom’s dog Cindy so he lets her outside on purpose where there are coyotes when nobody’s watching. I bought a vest that protects Cindy from coyotes but now my dad is demanding we send it back and it’s affecting our family’s relationship. If I give up the argument Cindy will probably get eaten.

596,"Preface: I’m a young adult, just finished high school and now old enough to be aware that her behaviour just isn’t the norm. 

I used to think she was just a very strict mum or just very stressed out,  but I’m starting to think it must be something else. She has incredibly violent mood swings, as in one moment she’ll be happy and calm and normal and within moments she’ll be calling my disgusting, useless, and idiot and calling my dad a retard and an idiot. This, triggered by my dad asking a simple question and me, having an empty glass in my room. When I was younger these raged would make me sob and hate myself, until she calmed down and apologised and bought me something to distract from her frantic screaming and curses before. 

Now I engage with her passively, not apologising but not getting angry or sad in return. Her behaviour is what drove my sister out and caused a kind of distance between us. My sister my dad and I remain close but still are forced to have that distance. Even my boyfriend dislikes having to be around her, the same goes for my brother in law. 

Now my question, how do I get her to seek he help she needs? I can’t run away from it like my sister did, but I can’t just keep ignoring it. Whether it’s medication or therapy or whatever, how do I go about this? ",25Jan2019,1
