0,"So me and my father rarely talk, we had a restraining order on him after he was charged with child abuse and now that I'm over 18 (I'm 19) and the order has dropped I try to ignore him whenever he tries to message me. I've still been close to my grandparents on his side of the family even though the live across the country and I haven't seen them in a few years.

He messaged me yesterday, and this is what he said ""Hey OP your grandad has cancer. I'm going to be leaving for two weeks to go out there can you stay at my house watch my dogs?"" Keep in mind, I'm currently living with my s/o, and I'm waiting on a call to see if I got this new job after an interview, where I would be working full time for the first time. The last thing I would want to do after a 9 hour day is go into his apartment to take care of his wild dogs.

His dogs have been known to jump fences and kill small animals, and even though I've worked at a vet with bigger dogs that were an issue I still dont want to have to take care of his pets without any pay. When you get dogs you should be prepared to pay for them when something comes up.

Regardless of all of this, he didn't message me to ask if I wanted to talk to my grandpa and didn't even tell me if it was bad or if he would be okay. He just wants me to watch his dogs and his house for two whole weeks and drop everything I have going on to accomodate him. I'm sick of feeling used by a man who was never really in my life and the times I do remember him being there weren't pleasant.

I just have a hard time saying no, can I get any suggestions here?",31Jan2019,1

Its a small amount that came off, about that size of a poprock. Can I fix this easily or will I have to see a dentist or is it ok to just forget about. Also how the heck did it break just by me biting my nails? does this mean my teeth are dyeing and becoming weak? and should I keep the tiny bit that came off my tooth or throw it away? whenever my tongue touches the spot it feels so weird now and my tongue naturally goes there so this will be annoying.",31Jan2019,1

- Girlfriend, single mother with disabled child

- Girlfriend has poor health due to health conditions

- Girlfriend is a widow and was not left with much from her previous marriage

- Girlfriend cannot work and I have been helping her pay rent when she lives with her mother

&amp;nbsp;

- Mother married to a man (stepfather)that molested girlfriend when she was young as a child all the way to a teenager

- Stepfather's cousin got ill, and he was taking care of him, for months and months

- Eventually the cousin died, and his cousin did not have a will

- Stepfather spoke to lawyers and somehow he inherited all of his cousin's assets which he has about $750,000.00

&amp;nbsp;

- Stepfather starts to do sneaky things like cheating by getting involve with a woman in Mexico

- He plans to abandon his wife and sell the house which my girlfriend and her disabled child lives in along with the stepfather's own daughter

- Stepfather constantly tries to justify himself saying it has nothing to do with that woman in Mexico and claims that he had to use the money he inherited to pay off his decease cousin's ""debt"" and for the funeral which has been confirmed as a like

- Stepfather's biological daughter has found transactions of money sent to Mexico which is to that woman in Mexico

&amp;nbsp;

- He also owns the house so he plans to leave and sell the house

- My girlfriend and her disabled child along with her mother and stepsister needs a home

- Girlfriend's disabled child requires medical attention all the time because she has cerebral palsy, seizures, wheelchair bound, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Plan:**

- Made agreement with the stepfather with his signature agreeing that he cannot kick them out until June 2019

- Currently my girlfriend and her lazy brother is trying to find work before then

- Meanwhile my girlfriend's stepsister will watch her disabled child

- They have spoke to 2 lawyers but they were both not very helpful

- Discovered that the stepfather never had his wife's name on his accounts, car, and other purchases so it's difficult to find a lawyer to fight him to at least give some compensation to his wife before he leaves, divorces, or marries that woman in Mexico

- Stepfather has history of sexually assaulting children, cheating, and he seems mentally off (long story)

- I myself am working but trying to find more work or a second job to assist my girlfriend to find a new place to stay before June 2019

Does anyone have any advice? We feel the time is ticking. Girlfriend is worrying. It is a very long story and I tried to be as concise as possible without typing a big wall of text. I am more than welcome to explain the situation in more details. Thank you.

3,"Well basically, im forced to live with my mother economically and we dont get along. As you can imagine, two adults in the same roofs with opposite ideas, specially when the one doing the mistake is the parent...it usually dont go well. But my question is more specific, and derives from that (sorry for bad english)

&amp;#x200B;

 Well, basically my mother is very very naive and prone to fall into crap (no offense to those who didi) like reiki, pyramidal schemes, chain spam, really bad advices, people trying to deceive her,sales (even when they are a lie), religion (including weirdly funny ones like gnosis), etc. And trust literally everyone but me (its a common issue tho...you have no idea how many times i had to prove to a close friend his uncle, although professional had NO idea what he was talking about). Because of that, and because i always told her options that were and ended up being better (since im 8 i told her ""that person will swindle you"", and they did, or ""if they say this, then why no one that and this happens instead?"", or i show her that what she bought was actually more expensive and worst in quality because she didnt bottehr to check the quantities, and a really long etc). Of course i make mistakes, and when i have to, im more than happy, unlike some people, to recognize it. I do my research on what they propose and when its not important to me and theres no consensus (being stubborn person or not enough information) i just give up in a ""tie"" and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

  Because of that tho, my mother thinks im a narcicistic that is ""always right"" and that she is an adult and can make her own decisions even if those are wrong (wrong tho, it affects both me and my brother not just her). I tried to talk to her, for years, but theres no way, we tried she approiaching, myself approaching, checking therapist, everything. and patience goes thinner and thinner every year. Im doing my best to leave, but sadly, i culdnt find a job yet. So i need ot find something, and stress is eating me alive.

 Is there any way to prove her, to make her understand that is not that i pretend to be right always denying to be wrong, but her making mistakes and that things will end up really really bad if she dont listen?

 I warn you, she has no sense of magnitude (she can say im a worthless hearthless bastard and worst, but if i say moron, i am \[insert the previous bashing\] and gasp in almost threatrical offended drama) and tend to close herself, or cry or use - i want to beleive, unwillingly - emotional manipulation. Then sehe acts like nothing happened and expect me to do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 I honestly think that given the situation, im managing myself more than good but again. is harder and harder to cope with reality instead of escaping towards an inmediate ratification like my pc. I cant focus, im always tense and i need to relax.

 Thank you",31Jan2019,1
4,"Hi, guys! 
So, I’ve lived with 2 roommates for almost a year now. I have a fully trained dog that I registered with the property management. My roommate ALSO has a dog who is untrained and unsupervised by my roommate, I recently learned he is also unregistered and therefore—not authorized on the property. 
The past year, I have been the one cleaning up constant pee on the carpet, on the counter that WE eat on, he will jump anywhere there is food and eat it, make a complete mess. I come home from school and work having to clean up poop and pee from the kitchen. It has been every single day. EVERY DAY! I have talked to my roommate about it, with promises that she would be more responsible about her dog, but that was 4 months ago and things haven’t gotten better. I got a meal ready in the morning to come home to after school, only to find it all over the kitchen floor. I usually incline the seats the dog climbs on to keep him from getting on the counter but it looks like my roommate sat down and forgot to put it up again. So, my food ended up getting ate, there was pee all over the stove, I went upstairs and there was tons of poop laying around that I had to end up cleaning because I know my roommate will turn a blind eye to it. 
I’ve had the last straw, and thinking about reporting the UNAUTHORIZED dog to the property manager. I e already made the effort to talk to her, I tell her every time I have to clean up after him or I end up lunch-less, and she just does not make an effort to make anything better.
Basically, is reporting the dog the best thing to do? I’ve reached the end of my patience and I’m stuck in a rut. I’d feel awful about reporting the dog, and I don’t want any awkward situations. But, I’m also very tired of being this dog’s maid because my roommate refuses to clean up or train him or make any effort at all to take better care of the damn dog. 
Any advice? TIA!",31Jan2019,1
5,"Basically, I'm having my first semester finals in a week. There's a lot going through my mind and I was trying to find ways to cope with it. So I took out some of the worst experiences I've had so far and shared them to two various subs.

Simply because this guy claims, he's lived a lot longer and hasn't been through that much. 

First, I've checked the person's profile, and it's got a couple of rude comments. But I dont want to judge. It's just that, he or she has been saying non stop that it's fake, and just claimed that I'm harassing him, threatened to point out if I posted anymore experiences, which he calls bullsh*t stories, and won't stop commenting on my post.

6,"I need some advice. Some superficial background story without too much detail (she might see this)...

My sister has made some unwise decisions and has had to pay the consequences. While I understand her hurt for certain consequences, I firmly believe she is in denial. With that being said, she does not, nor will not own up to her mistakes and face reality. Instead, I see it as  she chooses to blame everybody involved in the matter and sees herself as the victim...*ahem, wake up honey. You’re the problem.* Moreover, she makes nasty remarks and despite what she is going through, she has ill-minded plans for revenge and is still talking about future plans that involve continuing on this  toxic path. And quiet frankly, my morals 100% go against what she believes in right now, as well as her plans. 

So, I am here to ask for advice on how to confront her. Like anyone who is in a vulnerable situation, it is hard to get through to her with ensuring reason and no judgement. Plus she is generally an uneasy person and aggression is her go to response. So please, any help on how to confront her so I can explain to her that I can’t support her any longer with the path she is choosing to stay on. Any response is welcomed! ",31Jan2019,1
8,"Hey guys, 

For a little over a month I’ve been in talks with an employer about a job. After a great first interview a couple weeks ago, I was asked to come for a second interview yesterday. When the second interview was booked for yesterday (Tuesday) I was told that they would make their decision by today (Wednesday). That said, that was last week and nobody mentioned when a decision would be made in my second interview. It’s now the end of the day (7pm EST) and I haven’t heard back.

I think it’s possible that no decision has been made, but it’s for a TV show that starts airing in a couple weeks so I know it must be soon.

Is it worth shooting an email tonight? Wait until tomorrow morning? For apartment/living situation reasons I’d really love to know by tomorrow so I can tell my roommates I’m moving out end of February. If I get the job I’ll stay put.  advice would be appreciated — but I’m realistic and have a hunch I just didn’t get it.

9,"So i've always wondered why i can't grow facial hair because I know my mom's side of the family has the ability to grow and well my dad has a stubble so Im just confused as to why. Hell even my younger brother has some beard hair. I really want to get favial hair to hide my week chin and i just look weird because my skin is really smooth so yeah i look like a fucking kid.

10,"So, context, I wouldn’t say it’s something I’ve aspired to my whole life but for the last 7-8 years I’ve been obsessed with hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. It’s a 2600 mile trail that take about 6 months to finish. 

Fast forward to now. Me and my Fiancé recently purchased a home, and are making mortgage payments, and my job is in a bit of a growth phase. I have about 28k in savings that I intend to use to fund the trip plus mortgage payments, and utilize after I get back. And my fiancé has received a gift that will cover our mortgage payments for about 4 months completely. And I have a pass to attempt the trail this year (they are limited). And if I don’t go this year I won’t get another attempt for two more years, in which I would be putting my life on hold until I do go.

But I’m afraid, afraid that I’ll need this job after I get back. Afraid I won’t be able to find a job that pays at least 16/hr which is the minimum I need to support my family.  Afraid that I’m making a huge mistake by giving up my sense of security for the unknown of debt without a job. And it’s too late for me to leave without potentially burning a bridge that I may need. Afraid to give up the 5 years of seniority and pay that I’ve worked hard for. 

The trip very well could be worth it, a true once in a lifetime opportunity. But I’m afraid to pull the trigger. 

Am I overthinking this? Underthinking? Are there plenty of other fish in the sea so to speak when it comes to jobs? I just need advice. ",31Jan2019,1

14,"I'll add a TL:DR if it gets too long.

So 2 and half years ago I met a girl and we started dating, but few knew for a few days. Still getting the feel for the relationship.

I then got texts from another girl I supposedly matched with on tinder and suggested we meet up. She acted super weird and never showed to the bar even though she said she was at the place we said to meet. I decided I didn't want to bother with weird girl, and said not interested. 

My girlfriend a few days later got messages on FB asking where I was and that we had ""Plans"". I thought it was weird, then noticed the same person likes most of my statuses from the past few weeks. They then deleted their account. It was weird they knew we were dating or found both our profiles.

This happens on and off for a few weeks of new accounts trying to get in contact with us. And wouldn't say who they were. Then new numbers texting me and her every once and a while being flirty with me (I'd ignore it), and telling my GF that I was seeing this person or list of my ex's. They all seem to be from an app called Text-it I think? It just generates new numbers I guess. 

Then about 6 months in and they texted me pretending to be my ex. I had a gut feeling it wasn't her, but was the stalker. All the stuff they mentioned was easily seen on Facebook. **Then** they made a total copy of her Facebook and messaged me. And tried to message my GF again. I screen shot it, and then they deleted the account. 

I had to contact my ex and tell her this was happening and to change her privacy stuff. She had gotten messages too it seemed. The weird thing is they knew A LOT about our relationship and us. Then at times it seemed they were missing other big stuff. 

Then they made fake accounts of me on sites I don't use, and tricked her into conversation week or so later, and then sent screen shots to me. 

That was mainly the worst of it. We can't pin point who it is. The rest of the time has been random accounts and numbers messaging us still. Saying harmful, but not threatening things to us. Trying to split us up.  

**SO** can I do anything about this? The one friend of friend cop said it probably wouldn't be looked into if I reported it. We've been ignoring it, but that doesn't stop it. It's just exhausting and I'm starting to get drained from it. 

TL:DR Girlfriend and I have been stalked and basically harassed for 2+ years by an unknown person who keeps making throwaway accounts and numbers. Seem to know a lot about my past. Don't know what to do; ignoring isn't working any better than engaging. Can they be tracked to an actual person, or is this my life now? ",31Jan2019,1
15,"TLDR: My older brothers and i were abused as children by our mom. I haven’t seen her in 5 years, never addressed the abuse and don’t know what to do/how to cope anymore 


Ahhh I don’t know what to do or how to feel at this point. I don’t even know if this is the right sub. I’m a 21 year old female who was abused by my mother as a child. Luckily I have the most incredible, patient father in the world who would do everything in his power to stop the earth from spinning if I asked him to. 

My earliest childhood memories are of my mothers boyfriends. Covering my ears at the age of 5 because the current one is nailing her brains out in the other room at 3 in the afternoon. My brother, who is 4 years older then me, cradling his face and silently sobbing in the back of the pick up truck during our vacation in Mexico because our mother decided to get in a fist fight at the restaurant with our then stepdad. Who knew a 13 year old CHILD attempting to resolve conflict between his parents deserved it. 

T h i r t e e n punches in the jaw for embarrassing our mother in public. 

My then step siblings being beat with hangers, choked out by their own father, by my own mother.

My then 17 year old brother being kicked out of the home for addressing the abuse in front of me 

I was a child, knew what was happening, but I didn’t know why it wasn’t happening to me at first. Why am I being resented by my brothers? I just want to play with you, why are you hitting me too? 

After my brother turned 16, he moved in with my father full time. We originally visited every other weekend while mostly living with our mom full time. 

my mother got a divorce from abusive step dad and this is where I lived alone with her from 12-16. The scariest years of my life.

every single fucking day of my fucking life I heard about how horrible my brothers were for abandoning my mother while she took my cell phone and sent them message after message, pretending to be me, calling them horrible names ((that myself as a 13 year old couldn’t conjure up)), it got to the point I was blocked from both of my older brothers ((reasonably so)) so she couldn’t contact them. 

this is when the whipping and screaming started happening to me. I couldn’t believe it, my mom who I loved and idolized, whose anger I thought I understood as a fucking CHILD, who I worried for every single time I heard her yells while being fucked from another man i didn’t know, HOW COULD YOU BE DOING THIS TO ME? WHAT DID I DO WRONG? MOM PLEASE YOURE HURTING ME. I CANT BREATH. MOM ITS DARK IN HERE PLEASE UNLOCK THE DOOR. IM SORRY FOR WETTING THE BED PLEASE DONT MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE SHEETS AGAIN. IM 14 YEARS OLD WHY AM I WETTING THE BED? TAMPONS MAKE YOU A WHORE. IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION? PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME HERE ALONE AGAIN FOR 10 DAYS. OH FUCK SHE JUST SIGHED, SHRINK AS SMALL AS YOU CAN INTO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM SHE WONT NOTICE YOU. 

my brothers nor my father know about half of what I endured being alone with her for nearly 4 years. I just assumed they did, but it makes sense they wouldn’t when my mom would force me to record myself calling my brothers pieces of shit for not contacting their mother and sending it to her. 

At 16, with the help of friends who acknowledged the wrong doings of her actions and basically shedding light on “wow uh this is not okay” after she broke into a friends house while I was there ((didn’t knock on the door, didn’t call me)), dragging me by the hair as my 15 year old friends watched and screamed “WHAT ARE YOU DOING STOP” at this monster hurting their friend. It all finally clicked that I CAN stand up for myself. 

on the way home from my friends my mom cracked her windshield with my forehead, yelling at me for something I didn’t even know. She was stressed I could tell. I didn’t cry. I took her phone and called my dad, begging him, sobbing to please come pick me up. She called him back, walked in my room and rocked back and forth on her heals, telling my dad she scolded me for calling her a bitch when leaving my friends house ((yeah good one mom, i would deff instigate you as a child to beat me more sounds real!)) my dad said “hm well uh ok” and that was it. 

she then handed me the 6 month old child she was fostering ((came home one day to a baby, she said she’s a foster mom working with abused children to get back with their families)) OH THE FUCKING IRONY!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA))) and told me she was leaving and I was to bathe the child, feed him and put him to sleep. With every hair on my body standing, the weight of the baby crushing me and my breath trembling. I mustered 4 words. “This is not legal.” 

she was shocked but that was quickly subsided as she got in my face and growled through teeth that she was going to beat my ass with the baby in my hands. She turned around. Left.

after calming//bathing a screaming, sick, shit covered fucking infant I grabbed my iPod and took him to the nearest restaurant with WiFi, iMessaged my stepmom an SOS message begging to be picked up. 30 minutes later my dad shows up, making sure to stay on the side walk ((he knew my mom was insane)) called my mom said he was taking me, she was apparently hanging out in a friends car around the complex bc she comes running to the front of the building, holding her hands behind her back and saying “so you want to go?” In the fakest, most high pitch voice I will never forget. 

at this point I’m fucking SCREAMING, my dads physically holding me back because it’s all coming out. All the questions WHAT THE FUCKS WRONG WITH YOU HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO STAY WITH YOU HOW CAN YOU LIE YOURE A FUCKING FILTHY FUCKING LIAR I FUCKING HATE YOU HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME

to be met with a single phrase from her. “You can go pack your things, this is the final time I will see you.” 

and that was it. That was it. I defended her I tried to understand I idolized the person who beat me and you’re just giving up on me? 

fast forward 5 years, both of my brothers have mended relationships with her. The roles have reversed somehow and im the one that needs to contact her because apparently once a month “she’s not doing too good” is what I’m being told. I don’t really believe it. 

Not once has she tried to reach out to me other then a forward message on Facebook about god. Not fucking once in 5 years has an attempt been made to fix or explain or just fucking APOLOGIZE. 

I just don’t understand how I can sit here and miss her and be hopeful that one day I will get the simple two words “I’m sorry.” 

I guess I’m making this post because I’ve realized my behavior the past 5 years has been mostly self sabotage when it comes to the simplest of things and most importantly my relationships with my friends, current family and my SO. 

none of them understand the extent of which the shit I went through, they don’t need to. I guess I just don’t really know the next steps in fixing my toxic self or being okay with the fact I’m never going to get that I’m sorry. 

I’ve always downplayed how I felt, or coped with high stress situations in the worst ways possible beings, drugs, self harm, purging and I guess I’m just now realizing you know maybe just maybe these constant feelings of anxiety and the weight in your chest ISNT normal. 


I don’t know what to do next and I’m also sorry this is really long/jumbled/missing a lot and mostly all over the place. I’ve kept most hidden in the depths of my brain and kind of lost it typing this. Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks dudes ",31Jan2019,1
16,"Hi, so I've been working here for about 9 months and overall the people are nice and understanding. The job isn't in my field and working this job nonstop (for really low pay) and another job before this has really left me frustrated. Originally I told them I'd leave the job at the end of April but now I honestly feel like leaving in two weeks. This job isn't helping me at all and contributes nothing to my resume.

I had asked them before and they said they could give me a good reference (which I need as I am young and I don't really have any other experience), but if I suddenly hand in a two weeks notice will it catch them off guard and cause them to give me a bad reference?

I did break up with her and for good reason. She was unfaithful and often rude. I never wanted to break up though, I wanted us to truly work. And that’s why I’m heart broken but I can’t be wronged and stick around.

Anyways, she had this one ex, her first EVERYTHING that she kept talking to during our relationship. I already know she is going to take him to prom, and grind on him, leave with him, and do lots of other stuff, if you catch my drift. 

What’s messing me up is she doesn’t even act like she does any of this stuff. She acts like a good person with her head on straight and it messes me up and throws me off sometimes. 

Anyways, I am kind of jealous. I did everything for this girl and well, it seems like she tended more to him than me, maybe? Or at-least wanted to. I don’t want to see her grinding on him and I don’t want to think that they are leaving to go have sex but I already know I’ll see and think that.

18,"Context: A member of my family is elderly and my family house which I have been living in alone for the last 2 years has to be sold or rented to cover the costs of the skilled nursing facility. My work has me on call every day but 6 days per month and I could be gone until my next set of days off. I have been trying to move out as fast as I can and was told by my aunts and uncles, who control the estate, that the house is going on the market on March 1. 

I have been trying to sort through all my belonging which include my late father's things. They have all consistently made me feel like an obstacle and a burden they have to work around because of my work schedule. They show up unannounced in the mornings while I may  be sleeping after a long night at work, schedule work on the house without consulting me or notifying me because they all have keys to the house. 

I have no issues with the actions being taken by my family to sell the house but one family member has been particularly verbally abusive and I don't feel safe alone with them anymore. They are only attack when we are alone.

Today I was called a worthless POS, worthless SOB, after multiple attempts to diffuse or disengage by physically distancing myself. A couple weeks ago this person told me that my current behavior toward the women in my family is indicative of my ability to be a good partner to my partner. Previously I was able to tell them they needed to stop and they would but today there was no response until they felt they had unloaded the tirade. 

I don't know what to do because this person needs to have access to the house to clean and sort though all the other family things in the house that aren't mine. I'm thinking of telling the other family members but they are relying on this family member to take care of the elderly family member.

The text I was thinking of sending to the family calls out this person and highlights that I no longer feel safe alone with them. But I'm not sure how this will solve the issue of them needing access to the house and me potentially being at home. How do I communicate or ensure that when that person comes to the house I can: either not be here or have a someone else with me to make sure it doesn't escalate again or get twisted into a circumstantial evidence battle. 

Note: I currently do not think there is a risk of physical violence from this person but I don't want any false accusations thrown toward me. ",31Jan2019,1

I find myself losing every significant battle, and even the small day to day goals are always extremely frustrating and irritating. Circumstances are never in my favor. No matter how hard I try to fight against this behemoth of negative constantly around me, situations are always the same. In fact, recently, I _expect_ bad things to happen; that way, when they eventually do, it’ll just confirm my superstitions even further.

22,"Last night I was playing some games with some friends, let’s call them John and mark (not real names) and I was talking to John about his girlfriend, I just asked him if she still plays games and he said she hasn’t in a month, I made a joke saying oh she isn’t cool anymore and he knew it was a joke  and then he responded with “it doesn’t matter what you think she will never get with your fat ass anyway, look at how fucked up Mark looks and he’s still better looking than you” I responded with saying “actually I’ve been losing weight the past couple of months” then he responded with “ that doesn’t matter that still won’t fix your fa” he was about to say face, but quickly changed the word half way to “that wont fix everything” I just laughed it off but I was really dying inside and I just wanted to go to sleep then, I’m really really really insecure about my looks, I don’t have any deformities, I really don’t know if I’m actually ugly nor do I have the confidence to post on subs of pictures and get a definite answer. What he said bothered me so much it came to the point that I had a dream talking to John telling him he’s ugly and shouldn’t be talking shit then I started making fun of him. Then I woke up depressed and hopeless for the entire day. I’ve known John for 4 years, since sophomore year of highschool, I’ve always considered him one of my best friends but after this I’m not sure I even want to talk to him anymore. I don’t understand why people make fun of others looks, as if someone has control over it. ",31Jan2019,1
24,"Hey, so I have 2 siblings, a brother of 24 and a step sister of 27 who I have yet to meet. The step sister is a very touchy subject in family, because my father previously had a girlfriend who got pregnant and wasn't ready for a relationship, so she removed my father from her life. I know my brother wanted to meet her, so he once dragged my father to her wedding and it was awful. It tore my dad up inside. For a brief period of time I think my brother and her were close, and they chatted and shared books and such. I really wanted to meet her, but everyone in my family refuses to speak of it, including my brother. It stayed this way for a while until recently when my grandfather passed away, I saw her at the funeral but neither of us really spoke to each other, we said our hellos and goodbyes and now I am afraid I will never get to truly speak with her. Would it be alright for me to talk to her? We've never met but I have such a strong need to be close to her.",31Jan2019,1
25,"Hi everyone,

I am currenting working as a Recruitment Consultant at an Generalist Recruiting Agency. I'm underpaid, work long hours, have to pay for parking, and generally am not happy with my job. I've asked for a raise twice and both times have been told that they don't offer raises because we have the opportunity to make comission. My three co-workers are much older than me and always complaining about how people are disloyal these days. I feel they will be extremely rude to me if I leave.

I have been offered a job as an Executive Recruiter at a Specialist Agency (specialising in the food industry). The job is closer, pays more, and has better benefits. I am extremely excited about this opportunity but I'm worried because I signed a vaguely worded non-compete clause when I first got my job one year ago. I doubt its enforceable, but I feel like my current coworkers will make a big deal of it. I'm worried I will be burning a major bridge if I leave this job in this way.

Any thoughts or suggestions?",31Jan2019,1

28,"So I have a ""friend"" and I was rather good friends with him since my junior year of high school. After high school I went to college and during my second semester I was hanging out with said friend after ages of not hanging out. While were hanging out he tells me that he had done something that had gotten him in trouble the night before. I wont say what it is but I will say that it caused property damage, and that he did it to a former friend. So then that night were being idiots and I honestly can't remember who did it but we ended up texting the person who he had caused property damage to. I Personally should have known that this was a horrible idea but for whatever reason it didn't click so I texted the person telling them what my friend was saying to me(towards the end they werent very nice). I go home go to bed and wake up the next morning to find out that that person had called the police on us. So that freaked me the fuck out. So my friend and I end up getting together and discussing this whole thing. I end up finding out that my friend who told me that I was possibly going to be arrested was told I wasn't in trouble and wouldnt be unless I contacted the person I had texted the night before in any way, shape, or form and didn't tell me until the last minute. So as we are talking this over he tells me that he may be in even more trouble from a another issue that happened the same day. So we go pick up my other friend and they talk about that issue as it mainly concerned them so they end up dropping me off, and I live my life. So later down the road I catch up with my other friend and he tells me that our friend tried to throw him under the bus for the entire thing so he cut off contact and warned me to do the same. So then later I talked to my best friend and he told me that he had also cut contact due to him not liking him for a lot of reasons. So now out of the old ""gang"" only 2 of us still talk to this ""friend"" I dont talk to him as much as possible but more recently he has been asking to hang out. I simply can't bring myself to hang out with him due to what happened. I know I should block him and try not to speak to him again, but I feel I owe him an explanation why.

* I had Vietnamese food in Korean and the sauce they used was definitely different.

I'm not bad at socializing with people in person, and I can even get people's numbers and make friends with random people easy (did this with a girl in the elevator the other day), but I text almost no one except for friends back in my hometown a couple times a day. It's not that I'm always busy but I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say to start a conversation. I want to hang out with people and be good friends (and even get a girlfriend eventually) but I don't know how to initiate a meaningful conversation. I'm not sure whether I should ask to study, or go to dinner or just have a regular conversation. 
On another relatively minor point, when people text me I usually don't respond for some time because I don't know what to say. If they say a statement, I'm not sure whether I should open it and say ""ok"" then change the subject or something to not make it awkward.

33,"My mother is the head of a small non-profit organization in Oklahoma City called Skyline Urban Ministries. They are affiliated with the United Methodist Church and are primarily focused on assisting the homeless and needy in our community without asking for anything in return. (I know some Christian charities insist on proselytizing to the needy. Skyline doesn't do that. They just help: no questions, no demands, no preaching.) The organization is incredible and I am proud of my mom for being a part of it. Unfortunately, they had a trailer stolen from their property which contained thousands of dollars worth of supplies and equipment that were being used to help and feed people.   


Police have since recovered the trailer, but all the items within are gone and the trailer was vandalized and damaged. The thieves broke the trailer lights, appeared to attempt to paint over the side of the trailer, and stole the hitch.   


I just want to help get word out for her and don't really know where to ask for financial help or donations without appearing to be a scam. Are there any specific subreddits that are good for these kinds of requests? Anything outside of Reddit to consider? Right now they are only asking for donations on their Facebook page, and a local news story is the only word they have put out.

Me: Hi, I have a class at 3 which conflicts my 2-4 work schedule.  Can I work 9-11 instead on Wednesdays and Fridays? 


Them: 9-11 is fine on Wednesday but not Friday. I rather you not work on Friday. (I wanted to work another 2 hours so I will be able to gain all the money that workstudy will provide me) 


Me: what about 3-5 on Friday? Also 3-5 on Wednesday as well since I am going to add another class at 11. (This was my fault partly because I should have planned it better but I decided last minute to add another class and wanted to tell them ASAP because their office closes soon and I was waiting for their reply.)


Them: 3-5 pm on Friday is fine and I rather you not. (Rather me not what?? Add another class?? How do I respond to this?? And it seemed they wanted people in the morning so I decided okay I would give them what they wanted) 


Me: okay how about I work 8:30 - 10 on Wednesdays, 9:30 - 12 on Thursdays, 3-5 on Fridays. (Which is very similar to what we planned)


Them: At this point, this schedule is not beneficial for our spring workload. We have decided to terminate your employment, thank you for your efforts last semster. 


This made it seem like they fired me for personal reasons because they never offered any suggestions or ask when I was free and instead fired me. Their office is open from 8-5 and I know what time slots are free and what aren't. It seemed like I was the only one trying to make it work.

36,"Alright, so, I've known my group of 7 friends since I was about 8 and they were 5. I've basically grown up with them in the same neighborhood and have hung out with them everyday for over a decade. We did a lot of stupid shit and have smoked a lot of weed and it has been all in good fun. The reason why we got along so well apart from everyone else in school/town was that we're all very real, intelligent, deep thinkers who don't really relate to anyone else. Plus, none of us are alike. We have things in common, but, when it comes down to it, we're all very different people who come together every night for weed, music, games, inside jokes, immature banter, real helpful talks, and intricate debates on just about anything from existence to politics to off the wall topics. We do this stuff all night, every night, and we have been for years now. 

Nowadays, they all live in a large house and I trek over there every night to partake in the usual antics. It's a bachelor pad tbh. Kind of a mess, and most of them are okay with living in it. Their lives basically revolve around intaking substances and ""kicking it"".

Now, as a 22 year old (going on 40), I've become very meditative and thoughtful about my ""True Self"". I've become very spiritual and have recognized that I have a very strong intuition. I've fixed relationships with my parents as well as my surroundings and so far, it's been very healing. I'm getting closer to living life with my true potential that I've seen and felt in multiple visions. It's honestly so rich that it scares me, but I'm so close to realizing it, that my mind starts slapping me around every morning after I've done all this dumb shit that we've always done. It's suffering, essentially. The way my friends live is NOT living life. We've talked about it often and have come to common conclusions where some of them agree and wish to change but feel trapped like me, while some of them are very content.

Their lease is up in about a year, so I feel like that will help dissipate the stew of bad life decisions, but my body, mind, and soul are telling me that my involvement in their environment is causing problems with my own growth and every day I wake up at 1pm after being up all night with them with this looming thought of needing to stop right NOW.

I want to hang with them all the time, but this paradigm that has set in has made it poisonous to my well-being. Half of me feels bad for wanting to leave them, while the other half feels scared of initiating the final steps to change into someone I truly admire while being very alone.

I can do it, but I want them to come with me. I just don't think they're ready to make that big of a change, even though I know they are open minded enough to grasp expanding their conciousness (considering we talk about it often). 

**Plus, I rarely find people that I connect with. It seems like everyone is living this fake life and have no desire to make any change. They just lament in their suffering while hunting for money to bandage it. It makes social encounters extremely uninteresting, and finding true friends very difficult.**

Any help is appreciated.

43,"Basically, we see each other literally every single week 3 to 5 times. We go out to dinners, walk around the park, deep talks, all that stuff that couples do except the kissing, sex and all that. &lt;--We've discussed that too (I was like dude we're like a relationship minus that stuff she agreed). 

I'm SUPER confused whether she thinks I'm a friend or more and used counselling for the first time to get some advice. Some preamble before though:

I had a huge house party 2 weeks ago and I tasked my friend's GF to ask what she thinks of me. She said ""We hang out all the time and spend so much money each other, so basically hahah"". She never said she doesn't want to date me and she brought me my favorite flavor of coffee from a special store that night. 

Here's what's confusing: While she was hanging out with me, she was dating other guys a few months ago. She now has an FWB and we still hang out often, go out to walks, etc. 

Last time at the walk, I asked for her scarf and she wrapped it around me while being close to my face. I was like ummmm in my head but didn't make a move because.......confusion! 

The time before that, we wemt for breakfast then to a park to walk. She was walking on a thin curb and she made me hold her hand to keep her balance. It felt weird and I still didn't make a move because she told me earlier her FWB was coming over to make dinner later (hence lack of interest in me maybe?)

What the counsellor said: Carly may be confused too. she may be dating others and have FWBs but she may just be into you. Otherwise she wouldn't hang out as often. Since you have deep conversations on your walks all the time, you have it a little easier. I suggest you do this: Ask her honestly, on a scale of 1 to 7, where do you see me? 1 being a friend where we are now, 5 being an FWB and 7 being a full on romantic relationship. You should ask this to her too, because it is her right to know as well. 

I am super confused about the relationship and the thing the counsellor told me to do. I think that's a great idea but what if the friendship just disappears after I ask that?

Here is a few other examples:

We had this completely joking argument where he said European SUVS are not true SUVS, i was joking around too, and then out of no where he gets all serious and says ""gees you care so much about that, you take it too seriously of what I think)

And then another time we were looking at mods to add to his car, and he was thinking of adding this one part. He asked for my opinion on it, and I said he should possibly check out this other style. Then a bit later he says ""you care too much of what I want to do to my car, it must really bother you"". Even though I was just trying to help since he asked for opinion lol... 

That same one sort of seems to try to compete with me in certain things, because he thinks it's a competition, when really i'm just purchasing what I am interested in.

49,"Hi,
I hope you folks don’t mind my somewhat trivial question, but as the title says should I start using social media again? (I know reddit technically counts but besides this)

Background: 

Since 2014, I’ve gradually scaled back my social media usage to help with my mental health and because of increasing privacy concerns over facebook and linkedin in particular. 

A couple of years ago I moved abroad and since then I’ve been unemployed but was using social media to keep in touch. 

I kept my instagram account as this was the most popular network but got banned around 18 months ago and my account was deleted - the Facebook algorithms don’t like my use of privacy controls - and since then I’ve not been back.

——

I feel incredibly suspicious of social media now due to my own negative experiences and a pervasive feeling that it’s ruining friendships. 

Over the years I feel like our relationships have gotten really shallow and casual - people won’t keep in touch with you outside the bubble.
They ignore your sms / emails, agree to things in person then flake on the day (or just don’t show up), and it’s regarded as strange to ring someone for a chat. 
Nobody wants to arrange do a Skype / Facetime call, go for a coffee or a burger,  let alone a night out. It’s like being ghosted, just by everybody simultaneously. 

I feel quite bitter about it all but I try to be positive and I really don’t think its personal. It’s more that people are just lazier now, so friendships are less of a priority. 
Social media makes it easy to just browse a profile without ever interacting and thats seen as equivalent if not superior to real human contact. 

Sometimes people don’t trust me for not having any SoMe and occasionally folks will try to pressure me back onto  facebook for their own convenience. 
But the most persistent irritation is being unemployed, as I’m told to get a LinkedIn every fucking day.

I’ve had nothing but negative experiences with LinkedIn, and the idea of going back on there makes me really anxious. 
It has all the worst features of other social media - with the added bonus of being linked to your professional life and leaving you open to Doxxing and other identity theft.

It’s really hard to decide what to do because I’ve gained so many benefits from not bring on these networks.
I have lots more time, it’s severed the need to look at my phone constantly, I’m far more relaxed. 
My attention span has improved a lot and I don’t get FoMo. 
But most of all I don’t feel the need to compete with others any more and I’m much more contented with my average domestic life without seeing the continuous highlight reel of everyone elses.

But then, I very rarely ever see or hear from anybody now and it’s a lonely place to be. 
I don’t have a ‘network’ to call on to help on the job front (not that I ever did) and writing this I can already feel the looming anxiety about it all - the pressure to engage and post, to play the game. 

In a kind of silly way, I feel like going back now would be like quitting, and I’ve already come so far.
But I miss my friends, even if they’re not very good ones. 

So should I get another account?

50,"I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink as a result....or something like that.

51,"I'm really behind on my game, and I'm currently on track to receive my driver's license about a month before my senior year of high school (way too late).  I wish I had gotten started earlier, but at this point all I can do is grind and try to get the license as fast as possible.  I took the permit test for the first time today and failed it by one or two questions.  The computer at the DMV said something about waiting seven days before taking the test again.  According to my family, however, this is only the case if you fail thrice in a row, and I'll probably be able to try again tomorrow.  If anyone knows whether or not I will be able to do this, please let me know.

Also, regardless of whether I'm able to retake it tomorrow or next week, I'm going to need to be able to tackle some of the issues that stem from still not having my license in junior year.

What do I do if I need to go somewhere really far or really sketchy?  My Uber account sends an SMS (to both myself and my dad) whenever an Uber is ready to pick me up, and I need a workaround for this if I'm trying to go somewhere undetected.

Also, what do I do if I'm going out on a date with a girl?  I can't pick her up and take her anywhere without a car, and I feel like it's probably awkward to order an Uber for myself and a date.  How do I get around this issue?",31Jan2019,1

I am filing for disability but that takes months for it to come around, and I cant file for unemployment, since I cant work since almost any work environment is considered hazardous due to my seizures or i cant fulfill the lifting the requirements.

55,"I’ve had the same group of friends since middle school. The only difference now is that our circle of friends has divided itself into smaller cliques within the 20 or so people that have always been close. It doesn’t really bother me because I have my two best friends and I know that friend groups split up over time. However, for the past couple months I’ve found out around 8-9 times that my two best friends have been going to parties or events with everyone else in the group and just telling me that they’re busy. For example, they both told me that they were going with their separate families for New Years but they were really going to a house party that one of the other guys was having, us three made plans to go up to my friends cottage and go icefishing overnight tonight and they gave me a speech about how even though everyone else was going to a house party tonight it was “the boys over everything”. I went to pick them up only to find that they each weren’t home and had both made plans a week ago to go to the party tonight. It sounds to me like they’re trying to hide that the other guys in the group don’t want me around but I’m not gonna let them off the hook.

How do I tell them that I know they’ve been lying to me? They’ve been my closest friends for 12 years but I’m tired of sitting at home doing nothing because neither them nor anyone else will text me back until the morning after",31Jan2019,1
56,"Ok so I got invited to a screening/assessment session, the bulk of it is going to be a sort of IQ test which I'm not all that worried about. Though, there will be an unspecified interview, apparently focusing on effective oral communication skills.

I've already mapped out a lot of standard questions you could expect to see on any general interview. But I was hoping to get some insight into what they will be asking, or what sort of scenarios I might be suddenly thrown into. I really want to make a good go of this, I'll never have an opportunity like this again probably.

58,"I used to casually frequent clubs after work. It was just a way to ease my depression for a little bit at local spots. Never meant for it to be anything more. I was fully cognizant of the fact that this was purely lust and not a long term solution. But it helped me get through super dark times. 

I was fully in control and even thought the girls were pretty they only satisfied very specific aspects of my loneliness and I still needed to fulfill a more deeper, wholesome connection outside of this environment.

That is until I met this one beautiful Asian stripper. The difference was that her personality seemed more genuine and aside from the sex, her bubbly personality fulfilled more than just the sexual deficiency. It's no doubt always about the money, 100%, it's pure, I satisfy desire and she fulfills a need (income). But beneath all that I felt something. Like a genuine attraction. She always gave me extra time, grabbed my head and pulled me in closer in ways that only a couple making love would do. Maybe she's just that good. The thrusts, the positions, it wasn't just getting my nut off to keep me sane, it was a good solid real 30 minutes of intimate sex.

Problem is now I'm addicted. It's not even a financial problem, I make healthy income with enough of a buffer to afford seeing her twice a week. I only see her once a week. Well ""only"". It's becoming a problem where I constantly get impatient and look forward to the weekend when I get to see her. It's affecting my mental a bit, and there are some days where I'm so eager and anxious to see her, I can't focus on work and just want the day to end.

It hasn't gotten really bad yet, I'll have these episodes like maybe once or twice a month. Is this bad? What should I do? She is satisfying a need of mine, that left unmet, I feel suicidal, depressed almost manical. It keeps me sane. Should I just continue to treat it like therapy and see her?

62,"On New Years eve I (17M) went to a party with my best firend. My bestfirend (17M) was talking to this girl on instagram couple days before the party. So the host of the party (16F) gave them alone time in her bedroom upstairs (the party was downstairs) so we could consistantly go up stairs to check up on them, while going up and down the stairs she became very flirty (holding my hand, sitting super close to me while downstairs). Throughout the party one of her mates at the party got super drunk and broke a beers bottles in her kitchen, which stressed the fuck out of her. So we went up stairs again to check up on my mate and her firend. After closing the door she hugged me and we evently ""made out"" for a few seconds and then we went both went downstairs. Throughout the party when we went upstairs again so I kissed her. This time i suggested we go the spare room, which we did. This was a interesting hook up as we were consistantly stopping because of noises (there was no lock on this door) and me saying funny shit. It was nothing but kissing, there was no indication that she didnt want this. One of her firends came in the door and we stopped. While  we were downstairs talking we made plans to smoke weed the next day after as we both smoked and I had some dank as weed at home.
I think she regretted hooking up with me as she didnt open my snapchat until a few days before today. Anyways I told a few of my mates about the hook up and my one of them wanted to get with her. But she was not interested. Which killed his ego and started talking about her behind her back. Today I found out that one of her mates who also wanted to get with her at the party but had a girlfirend at the time messaged my mate who got rejected confronting him about saying stuff about the stuff he was saying about her. But that asshole also said "" *****"" (me)rape her ""so no he(me) didnt smash her"" ""hes (also me) talking big shit"". I didnt tell anyone that a smashed her. Im still a virgin. Now im accused of being a rapist.

65,"Ok so here's some back story.

During the beginning of the summer ish time in 2018 a girl hmu saying she liked me. I didn't know how to talk to girls so I weirded her out and she dipped (obviously).

Fast forward like a week or 2 ago. My friend tells me he has a girlfriend. I said cool, who's the girl? He tells me it's the girl that hit me up a few months prior. So, I didn't really care cause good for him (no I'm not jealous).

A week later. He's non stop talking about his girlfriend. Like, if we're hanging out (cause we're really good friends) he's non-stop talking about her. I'm a guy. I don't care about your girlfriend. That's not my business.

 I ranted to him telling him ""Hey no offence but I don't care about your girlfriend"". Not in a disrespectful way but as in I don't care about her cause it's not my girlfriend. He brings her up constantly and even texts her in the most retarded situations. Example: I dropped 30 dollars for us to do laser tag and this guy was texting his girlfriend while we were in the stadium LITERALLY as we were playing.

Anyways, I'm off topic.  Come 2 days ago I message my friend out of the blue and tell him ""Hey what's going on"". He responds with ""I'm tired from fucking my girlfriend"". I thought this was a joke. But he continues to tell me that he lost his virginity in the bathroom at a community center that day.

So I'm sitting here like what the actual fuck. That's too much detail for me. I don't care about that, why would I care about that.

He then tells me that I shouldn't be getting upset and that I should be happy for him. I told him dude that's not my business in the slightest so I don't give a single fuck. On top of that. That's really fucking shitty that you're telling me you fucked your girlfriend in the bathroom because that's really trashy. And then he makes a joke about not going into the bathroom because there's a used condom in there. So obviously. I'm grossed out and really upset at him.

He starts getting upset at me telling me that ""I don't care about his feelings and that he can't talk to me about anything personal because I don't wanna hear about and that I thought we were best friends"" as if I haven't done so much for this guy.

So I said if that's really how you feel fine. And I blocked him.

Today we met up in person with my other friend. And we were silent the first time. And then my other friend told us to deal with it. So we started arguing. The conversation ends after that. We start talking again and I think everything is smooth.

Come to find out the entire time he was shit talking me to his girlfriend on text messages and that he was being fake as shit.

Anyways, here's my question. Am I wrong? Was that really my business?",31Jan2019,1

69,"I’m so sick of everyone hating me, it sucks being in hostile environments all the goddamn time where nobody wants me to succeed. This normally means I’m an asshole, but I really feel like I’m somewhat pleasant to be around. I don’t make rude comments, I’m somewhat shy, but I try my best to be liked by everyone, and I fail. My teachers don’t like me, for instance, today I got chewed out for not buying bubble wrap for a school trip by two teachers, who didn’t tell me I had to buy it when I volunteered to help out, and then told me yesterday that I was in charge of buying it and wrapping two little jars. They also said I had till Friday. well, we have a meeting today and the first thing one says to me is, “hey great job on the bubble wrap bud!” And the other went off on how I couldn’t do something as basic as bubble wrap two objects. So I had to go out during lunch, buy bubble wrap, and stay after school bubble wrapping. People were dicks to me over bubble wrap! I’m rather sensitive, this ruined my day. 
     My advisor at school hates me because I let my grades drop a bunch last semester, for really unknown reasons, but instead of asking me what’s up or trying to help out he just gives me stern looks and refuses to talk to me now. 
   My parents hate me, pretty much for existing. I stay out of trouble as far they know, and all they do is tell me how I’m going to be a deadbeat and already told me I’m getting the boot on my 18th. I’ve been kicked out of my house multiple times for backtalking when they are going on power trips. To give you an example here’s a text from my dad yesterday: “You don’t have any skills, you don’t have any ambition, you don’t have shit, and you won’t ever do shit.” So that’s basically my relationship with them. 
   My friends hate me, because why the hell not, they have parties without me and shit. 
My girlfriend is naive and 2 years younger than me, she will probably end up hating me too. 

I’m just so tired of living in a world where everything I do is wrong, and nobody likes me. I wasn’t made to live in society, or really anywhere I guess.

72,"Hello, I'm 28 soon going on 29 this year. I feel like the mistake I made in the past has offput my life so many years off and therefore it's made life difficult and awkward. 


So I graduated in 2008 from high school, spent two years in my home country that I never really got to visit and got to know my family. I figure two years from high school is relatively normal for some adults. 


Then I went to community college and it took me 3.5 years to get my AA in Pre-Med with no summers off (I had to repeat a few, classes and I was put into remedial math classes upon coming to college). Upon getting my AA I found out pharmacy wasn't what I wanted so I applied for Computer Engineering after taking a year and a half of requirements at university. 


Well I flunked out of the program after a few semesters so I salvaged what I had and went to IT. I'm set to graduate this summer so about 4-4.5 years it took me since getting into university. 


So about 9 YEARS it took me just to get my Bachelors without going to school nonstop. It's so embarrassing. I feel like such a loser. If I had just picked the right degree from the onset I could have EASILY shaved off 4-5 years. Compounded with that, I can't meet anyone because most my age already have careers or are having their Masters so it's hard to meet anyone and not be looked down upon (which I have been). 


Even in this internship I got, all of the other interns are at least below 22, graduated, graduating, or already having their Masters. When they found out my age they were surprised. I feel this is why I don't have any friends or I can't make any friends because of my age and how slow I am.

78,"Yeah, it's not what you think. But the title is accurate. I'll cut to the chase. I'm in my late 20s, I'm poor, have lots of debt, bad credit, a 20yr old car and I have a kid who's growing up fast, is siphoning my cashflow even though I love him to death and it scares me to death.

I work at a very exclusive 5 star spa making $11xhr. Where I live I can barely survive and feed my son and ex with whom I reside. I'm well educated, have a B.A. I'll never use and dream of becoming a writer. I even nearly got rich trading crypto last year but lost all my profits in the crash.

  


Anyway, this very nice, very professional and friendly rich guy comes into the spa every night and chats me up. I can tell he's lonely and all he does is work. He's so rich for being 40 that he owns a house within the resort property and told me he controls ""nearly 110 entities worldwide."" And claims to own 6 businesses.

I've casually hinted several times I'd like to work for him, like ""you guys don't need a trained writer do you?""' To which he says no. Lol. Or ""man that all sounds really exciting. You're growing fast, you must be hiring!"". No reply really other than a standard response. I know he knows I'm not an idiot because we have discussed politics and his businesses and even his family life at length. He's just a normal miserable overworked, overpaid business man and I'd like to join his ranks.

  


So how do I directly approach him without seeming creepy or entitled? I have the balls to ask for a job, I just don't know what to say. Also, it isn't that I deserve to work for him. I don't feel that way. I just know that with as many irons in the fire as he has, someone with my skillset as a writer with a bachelor's in professional and technical writing , there must be something I can do. Basically I know I'm obviously not living up to my potential in life and he just seems like my opportunity in life. I mean I talk to the guy for 45 minutes at least 3x a week but he is also a guest at the Spa and I don't want to get in trouble asking him for a job.

  


It's also worth noting every night he gives me a $10'and even though I'm grateful I worry that I now have a symbiotic steward/guest relationship that's hard to break. Also, I don't want do anything to get myself fired.

79,"So I lived with my great grandma until she passed away one year ago, she left me the house and my grandma (my great grandma's daughter) lives right next door and didn't like me living alone since I was hardly there, so she told my mom to move in. Along with my 3 brothers and her husband. 
Anyways I've been living at my grandma's for other reasons but now my mom is moving out and I can either move back in and live alone, having to pay for lights and gas or whatever or, i can let my auntie move in and have her pay me rent each month. (Probably just $200).

81,"I don’t want to tell my mom her cooking is bad, because it’s not. We’re not poor by any means, and I’m greatful to even get meals everyday, but it’s so disgusting I’ve started to lose weight. We used to eat out everyday but we changed our habits, now when my mom makes something, she freezes it and we have the same thing a month later, it’s absolutely disgusting to the point where it makes me want to vomit, I usually have to line my pockets with napkins then just hide the food, spitting some into the napkins I use aswell. Today I almost just had to tell her because I couldn’t do it,.My mom took 1 month old vegetable soup , thawed it out in a crockpot, then took a 1 month old frozen steak, thawed it, the. Cut it up in the chili. This was chili, I can’t hide this, I ate as much as I possibly could, then quickly went to take a shower. When I went to take a shower I vomited for about 10 minutes.

I can’t keep pretending like this food is ok, but there is no way in hell I’m gonna tell my mom that the dinner she just made is is so bad I can’t eat it without throwing up, and it’s not even her fault it’s the freezing, but I don’t wanna sound ungrateful, I’m really in a tough spot.

82,"I just got laid off my job because I was sick for a month ( had to go to ER, outpatient facilites, doc visits, etc). I am burnt out by the work I do anyway. I'm not happy I lost my job but I'm glad I don't have to go back.

I've moved to a city a year and half ago and the whole time has been a struggle. I'm planning to move this summer.

I want to sell most of my possessions and drive for Lyft until my lease is up on my apartment until I can move. 

Now, I know this sounds far fetched, unrealistic. I've been doing nothing but binge watching people on youtube who drive for Uber/Lyft, what their experiences are like, ups and downs for them etc. I've been reading articles online and trying to make a plan in my head how I could go about actually DOING this. 

Most informations suggests I won't be making as much as I'd like, unless of course one really knows how to hustle. There is the cost of gas, and wear and tear on your car and people making it dirty, plus rideshare insurance and 1099 forms for taxes. 

On the plus side, I can make my own hours, won't have a boss leaning over my shoulder every 5 minutes and I can talk to people. 

I want to know what people have heard from their friends or themselves driving for Lyft/Uber? I don't expect to make bank but I need something different. I live in a large west coast city and the market would be ok. Thanks in advance. ",31Jan2019,1
84,"Throwaway account. I'll start off by saying that I am Mexican and I'm basically the first kid of our family raised in the United States. The current conflict between my mother and I is that my aunts are visiting and I'm not completely supportive of it. My mother gets immediately upset when I just shrug at the news and go ""alright."" My aunts are loud, their humor is completely different to mine, being from another country and all, so I don't personally get much good out of their presence. They keep my mom busy and happy, though, so I don't really mind, though.

But she takes my hand and says, ""why did my son have to turn out like this."" That upset me a little - I think implying to your kid that something is fundamentally wrong with him is a pretty obvious mistake. So I pull my hand away and tell her that's hurtful and to go away. She buzzes off for a couple minutes, but then calls me into the kitchen to go into a rant about how there's something wrong with my attitude.  We've done this plenty of times, and I've concluded that where she comes from, teenage boys are supposed to be exceedingly enthusiastic and affectionate by American standards. I'm pretty much the average American teenager though - I'm not going to pretend to love the idea of something that I don't really find all that exciting and I'm not particularly affectionate with my mother, maybe even by American standards.

I understand our cultural differences, though. I understand her expectations call for something different than what is natural for me. She doesn't. Despite how many times I repeat it, she refuses to entertain the idea that I'm anything other than a broken sociopath. I know I shouldn't let it get to me, especially when her completely non self aware xenophobia and hypocrisy  show when she blames the blood of my Honduran father for my mannerisms (there are tensions between Mexicans and Latinos of other countries and many stereotypes held between them). I get tired, though. Just because I live under her roof and she provides the amenities parents are supposed to provide for their children, I'm expected to break my nature for her comfortability because she can't understand that how I act is normal. I mean, right? These aren't unreasonable claims I'm making?",31Jan2019,1

Somehow her friend found the dogs. My girlfriend has been best friends with her since elementary school, so she trusts her completely. My girlfriend told her the back window of our bedroom was unlocked so she could bring the dogs in. Little did we know, her friends mom was with her. Her friends mom is a heroin addict. She stole from us while she was here. She said she had to use the bathroom and stole from only the bathroom because her daughter couldn't see her from there. At first we thought she just stole a bunch of makeup. My girlfriend called the cops but the cops said they couldnt do anything about it because we dont have proof she was here and ""we shouldnt leave our window unlocked, anybody could get in."" Today we realized she stole more than makeup. She stole a ring that my girlfriends father gave her when he was still alive. She also stole other jewelry. That ring means so much to my girlfriend.

91,"I am 23. I graduated from University in May 2018 and it took me until September to find a job despite the fact that I was super involved, had jobs/internships in school, and graduated with honors. The job was not directly related to my degree but was something I had experience in.. and most importantly it is at a nonprofit that I love. It is a very stressful high-stakes full-time job that often requires unusual hours (ex: a shift starting or ending at 3 am) made even more stressful by my 2 hour a day commute. But I am so passionate about the job and organization so I have put my EVERYTHING into it. I have lost so much sleep, gotten very sick many times, missed out on family/friend events, etc because of this job.  I have worked so so so hard since I started this job. But my job is the only thing I take pride in about myself and the only thing I can be proud of. Today, my department’s director sent an email to me and my 2 coworkers (we are the whole department) saying that are sales are too low and unacceptable. We tried to explain it’s because my coworker and I have only been allowed to take sales ourselves for the last 2 months, so of course our sales will be less than usual. He said that that is not an excuse and that we’re all just sitting around doing nothing. This DEEPLY hurt me. I know I’m too sensitive but when you put 100% of your energy into something and get told you’re doing nothing, it hurts. I was so upset I broke out in hives. How can I continue on - continue to work as hard, and to be positive at work?

His interviews and documentaries have me mesmerized. He was not your average person, he was wicked smart, and an excellent speaker. He just knew what to say, and how to say it. He had so many people fooled. 

He most certainly deserved to suffer for the things that he did, BUT, part of me wishes he was never executed.

97,"To start off I'm a 17 year old who attends college and for the past 7-8 months has been best friends with one of my coworkers.  She is a senior in high school at the school I used to attend.

About 7-8 months ago I befriended this girl I work with.  It started out with me picking her up at school before it got out and we would go out for 2-3 hours get something to eat, hangout, and talk.  He parents at crazy.  I know lots of people say this but her parents are legit crazy.  They don't let her drive, hangout with friends, even talk on the phone with people.  She has never really been anywhere else but work school and home or to a few select locations with her parents.  After she had told me about her parents on the first ""date"" where we went out I decided to make it my goal to show her as much as I could and have her experience High School the way she should.  I kinda asked her if she was interested in dating me about two weeks into hanging out after I got pretty messed up one night and said I would be friends with her regardless.  She turned me down and said she was only looking to be friends.  Then when I picked her up the next week to just hangout she told me she's not interested in dating anyone and made fun of people who need to be in relationships.  This was fine by me I still had strong feelings for her but I was happy just to be her friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about 6 months.  We were hanging out 2-3 times a week sometimes for the whole day and she just wouldn't go to school or would resort to making fake shifts at work because her parents wouldn't let her out otherwise.  Me and her had gone to a dozen different local nice restaurants she hadn't gotten to try.  We drove down to the beach one day.  We went to the park and the nature preserve a dozen times.  We would talk on the phone for hours when her parents would leave and I would legitimately email her when her parents decided to take her phone for a few weeks cause they had found out she was hanging out with friends (just me) after class.  naturally I fell in love with the girl.  So a little side note I have a slight drug problem.  I like to experiment and spent my high school years smoking weed, making and selling fake ids, selling some bud and alcohol to the freshman, taking LSD, shrooms, coke, XTC, stuff like that.  Shit I knew was bad but I was always hurting or bored.  I had cut down my drug use for her but still smoked weed and drank frequently (yes I am only 17 I know how bad that shit is I don't need to be reminded).

&amp;#x200B;

One day at work me and her were talking and she said something like ""you'll never go completely clean"" or ""nothing would make you go clean i mean come on its who you are"".  I told her that there was something or someone I would stop for.  Her face went red because she knew that I never stopped loving her.  Later that week which was the end of Christmas break it was brought back up and I was more upfront about it.  I basically told her that I would go 100% clean for her.  I would stop even drinking and I wouldn't sell anything anymore.  but I also made sure to tell her the alternative was me smoking weed once a week and not me doing coke every night so she didn't need to worry about my health or addiction because I know I put a lot of pressure on her with that question but I didn't know how else to tell her I truly loved her and would do anything for her.  She said she didn't know but she would tell me next week.  I had told her that I've waited 6 months and didn't think I could wait anymore and kept pestering her (mistake one).  I then wrote out a long message telling her exactly how I felt.  She didn't respond with much just we would talk at work.  Work was busy and I didn't get to talk to her much and because of that I got upset and told her she needed to tell me and got mad(mistake two) because I had told her it was fine either way but I needed to know.  I had pushed her for an answer and been a little hostile over the whole thing.  So I got the worst answer I could have imagined it was a ""maybe"" that she didn't see me that way but maybe she could with time, then she told me it was a no because i was an asshole to her over the whole situation (which is true) but also she was having a hard time that week because of some family shit she tried to talk to me about but I was so wrapped up in my own thing.  We then got into some screaming matches crying on both sides.  Shit was fucked up for about 2 weeks but we rekindled our friendship and were about back to normal.  Things are still a little weird but its okay most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where the actual question comes in and big thanks to those of you who made it this far.  Is it worth it?  I love this girl but I'm dying at the same time.  She the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and i've lost interest with all other girls. I honestly haven't been able to really look at another girl in months.  She's my best friend and truthfully I've never been closer with anyone else.  And although she doesn't admit it often I'm her best friend or was at least last month and she does love me but as a friend.  So what the fuck do I do?  Shaking a cocaine addiction at age 17 has been easier than trying to forget about this girl.   Is that even the best thing to do?  Should I forget or are friends like this to good to throw away?  I still think I have a chance despite knowing she doesn't see me that way and probably never will.  If i do decided to move on cut off contact and try and forget is there anything I should go out to do?  I don't want some one night stand I don't want a bump or coke or a tab of lsd I just want her.  I've lost interest in everything else entirely and feel like I'm becoming more and more depressed and don't want to get to the point of suicide or where I've got a fucking needle in my arm.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Fallen in love with my best friend.  I offered to stop doing/selling drugs for her if she went out with me (sounds awful I know).  I'm her best friend and she told me she loved me but that she doesn't want to date anyone (she's told me this from the get go).  Back to being best friends but don't know if I should just get out of the relationship because I am hurting so much.",31Jan2019,1

I’m in a masters accounting class in which we meet once a week for 3-4 hours, for 11 weeks. We are supposed to be learning natural resource accounting. This encompasses oil, gas, and forestry. I’ve had this teacher before, and he tells stories for approximately 90% of the class, not stories that directly pertain to or help us learn any of the class material. In natural resource accounting we need to learn to a certain degree about the industries we will be accounting for. 

First class: Introduction, video on forestry, video on oil. I figured ‘okay, this covers the background we need for these industries, I’m ready to learn the accounting side for them.’

Second class: he introduced a board game called ‘Wildcatter’ which boils down to an oil version of monopoly, with oil wells instead of houses or apartments. Think ‘okay, I see the point of playing something that shows you the costs associated with drilling for oil.’ 

Third Class: Wildcatter again.

Fourth Class: Wildcatter.

My tuition is about $3,800 for this quarter for 3 classes, approximately $1,260 per class. If 3 out of 11 classes so far have been Wildcatter, I have payed about $343 to play a board game in class.

My classes are small, about 15-20 people. There is not a place in which I can report an anonymous complaint, or any complaint actually unless it deals with discrimination or sexual harassment. The only recommended action the school website gives is to contact the supervisor, in this case it is the Professional Accounting Department Chair. I would prefer not to set up a meeting, I would prefer not to let them know my identification. I have a class with this teacher next quarter and I graduate at the end of next quarter and do not want that hampered in any way. 

Do I grin and bear it, email the department head  regardless of my identity? 

I just don’t know what to do and I feel the end of quarter teacher reviews are not taken seriously. I’m not learning any accounting. I’m playing a board game.",31Jan2019,1

100,"So I have a friend who well call John. John and I were rather good friends when we were in highschool. John and I got into some trouble a while back and since then I barely talk to him. He has contacted me asking to hang out. There were a group of us when we were in high school, There was John, myself, Jimmy, Jake, and Jack(all fake names). 

Once I was finished high school I went to college for a year. during my second semester John and I got into a bit of trouble. 

It all begins one night when we were hanging out. John and I hadn't hung out in a while due to me being in school. I got off of work and he picked me up. We were driving and he told me that the previous night he had gotten into trouble with the law due to him causing property damage to a mutual friends house well call them Chris. Chris and john were then no longer friends due to this. As the night progressed we began acting like idiots. Towards the end of the night I ended up texting chris about the events the night before John told me to text some things to Chris which weren't  very polite.

The next morning I got a text from john saying chris had called the cops on us. In later text messages he told me that one of the cops had threatened to have me arrested since I had texted chris. I was freaking out and about 4 hours later he came and picked me up. He then told me that he was having unrelated issues to the thing thay had happened the night before and that we needed to go pick up Jack to talk about it. So we pick up jack, and jack and john talk about the unrelated issue and after an hour or two of us being in the car, I am still freaking out about the cops coming to arrest me. John then informs me that I have nothing to worry about as long as I never attempt to communicate with Chris ever again and that he thought he told me that. So jobn drops me off so he and Jack can talk about the unrelated subject in peace.

I didn't talk to john for awhile after that all went down due to me being freaked out over the whole thing. I'm at work one night and I see jack we talk and I ask him how the unrelated issue worked out and he told me that john had tried to throw him under the bus so he blocked him and wont speak to him. Later that week I was talking to Jake who is my best friend and he tells me that he has also blocked john due to him all around being a bad nut. So this leaves only jimmy, and myself who still talk to john.

A couple of months later I still havent talked to john but because of me being close friends with him I got to know his family.  So out of the blue john texts me and asks to hang out and I tell him that I couldn't due to work. So we go back to not talking for some time. So one night I see his mom and his mom looks like she got into a car accident. I couldn't talk to his mom at the time. but I later found out that John had assaulted his mom.

More recently he has tried to contact me about hanging out. I really think I should block him due to what happened with chris and due to him assaulting his mom as it disgusts me that he did that. But I feel as though before I block him I should give him a explanation as to why. I suppose im asking advice on how to handle the situatuation.",31Jan2019,1

105,"Hi, so this is a throwaway account as this topic is really personal for me and I just want people to help me understand my situations


To get started, I am a teenager (M) and quite  introverted. My biological parents are still together and support me. I am currently in high school and I haven’t made any friends that I keep in touch with after class since middle school. So with no social life with anyone other than middle school friends, I indulge myself into video games and TV Shows. And I’ve noticed that they impact me irl a ton and this is the point where I would like advice on how to process these feelings. First of all, I’m not talking about guns, shooting or anything.(I strongly dislike guns)

But rather the relationships character have or things they do make me feel strange. For example, in video games, you see these protagonists doing these amazing things and it just makes me admire and idolize them so much. And for TV shows for example, Gossip Girl,(which I watched because of blake lively), gave me a completely different perspective of life and drama that its as if I got traumatized in a way. And in other shows, say Lucifer, I get completely obsessed with these lifestyle these people have and it’s like I want to be them. And as I am still deciding a career choice, every game I play and tv show I watch completely impacts what I want to be such as: architect, archaeologist, detective to name a few. 

It just feels like I’m not supposed to be here and all these privileges I have, I shouldn’t. It’s like to good to be true and I just want to be alone with nothing to worry about, and just have video games and tv shows. I don’t want to live to old age at all either and I feel like I just want to cut everybody off and do nothing at all, but I need them.

Struggling on how to step away without seeming like a jerk to everyone. I am always afraid of being selfish or coming off like I don't care about the person anymore. So I usually don't even confront people if they do something that was not okay.

113,"A friend in a community discord server has been telling us her parents are neglecting her (specifically not being fed enough) as well as feeling uncomfortable with her transphobic stepdad. (she is a closeted trans girl.)

All we know is that she lives in New York state but not NYC. She is in high school so she's around 16.

She isn't very forthcoming with details as you'd expect from a young, scared trans teen, and she would probably be upset that I'm posting this and wouldn't agree to give any further personal details, so this information is all we have.

As an aside, we've urged her to speak to a teacher or guidance counselor and she has hesitated but said she will try to tell someone. We can't make her do anything or speak to an authority, sadly, so we would like to know what we CAN do, legally, if anything. Thank you in advance. ",31Jan2019,1

I added her on facebook and she accepted and then added me on Instagram which isn't connected to my facebook so she had to do some lurking. I broke the ice on messenger by talking about class and we joked around a bit. We look at each other all the time in class (unless I'm wrong and it's just me which would be super weird). I want to ask her to get coffee or something but I don't want to make it weird in class because we always sit beside each other.

115,"A little background about me.

I lived in Russia for 15 years. I went to to kindergarten and middle school there. I had high social anxiety and never really got along with people. My dad was into business and the only memories i have of my childhood are him getting drunk on the weekends, coming home shitfaced and me trying to calm him down by pouring water all over his face( I was 8 at that time). I barely talked to girls and always felt like I was inferior to other people.

   After middle school my parents sent me to the U.S. to go to high school here. I lived with my grandmother who didn't care about me at all. I have 2 grandmothers. The one in Russia is the cool one. She cooks for the whole family despite being over 80 years old and she never complains about her health despite having gone through many many surgeries. The grandmother I lived with never cared about what I did or what I accomplished. She only cared about herself and constantly complained how she comes home tired and does not want to do jack shit. Also she forced me to say hello to her because I was so disgusted by her that I didnt even want to look at her. My meals for the first 2 years of high school were warmed up walmart potato puree and frozen beef burgers.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents sent me to a private school. I didn't really know what a private school was until I realized that I could not resort to fighting when I was bullied. People would message me things like go back to Russia or we don't want you here and all kinds of things like that. This lasted for about 3 years until I became a senior. During that time I have never felt more alone than ever. My grandmother wasn't close to me, I felt like she wasn't even mine. And the people at school were so much different from me that I never really developed any sort of connection to anyone. I ended up spending my free time on videogames, racking up over 2000 hours in dota 2 and league. Making a lot of friends in these areas but I did not feel like I wanted to spend my life playing video games.

&amp;#x200B;

My first year of college went great. I lived in a room with 3 people and we drank almost everyday and went out during the good ld summer days of the summer midterm. I ended up joining a fraternity and my alcohol intake reached a Russian level of consumption. However, there was still something missing. Some days I went home alone drunk because I couldn't talk to anyone or because I was ditched by a girl I was talking to. Some days I just drank in silence. Something was getting back at me. While being in a fraternity, I only had one girl who ditched me because I left trash in her car.

&amp;#x200B;

My second year I turned to psychedelics for help. For about 4 months I dosed myself with lsd, shrooms and marijuana. My grades dropped significantly and I ended up with a 2 gpa but I was happy. I found meaning in reading literature, meditating and just trying to understand poetry and literary works of Russian and English writers. Unfortunately, my dad told me that if I were to still get bad grades then he would stop paying for the apartment that I live in. I had to stop doing all the psychedelics and get back on track with school and I did. But the depression came back again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am a junior with a journalism major and a good gpa that I managed to bring up after fucking up. I have no idea what I am going to do with it. My parents have no idea either but they force me to do this shit because I need the degree. I feel empty, I feel useless and everyday I wake up feeling like somebody dropped a big pile of shit on me. Sometimes I cant get out of bed. I go to a psychiatrist once a month but after his visits I still come home to myself. And I wake up knowing that the only person who can change is me but I just feel unable to do it. I write here because I don't know where else to write, I read a couple of posts here and it looks like this is the place to talk about this issues. I don't expect anyone to give an answer but I hope that there are similar cases of people going through things.

116,"I’m married but separated and planning on divorcing. My reasons for divorce are much bigger than this, but I have fallen for a coworker who is leaving the company soon. This person has recently revealed to me that their marriage isn’t doing well and they are separating from their spouse.

This person and I have had long chats over email and IM and in person about, well, anything really. We share a lot of interests and I can see myself with this person in the future. It seems they feel the same way about me, but they may be wanting to work things out with their spouse, I don’t know. We began as friends and there was a clear connection early on. Problems with our spouses have only just come to light to each other and now it seems we may have an actual chance at dating.

My question is, should I casually reveal my feelings for them? As in, suggest to them if we’re both single in the future it’d be cool to get together? And just leave it at that.

117,"My parents have a bit of a complicated relationship. My dad went overseas for university and met my mom. The fell in love, my mom says that dad was a great guy, very kind and loving and caring. My moms parents disproved of him, but my mom decided to marry him anyway which caused a rift in the family. They got married and my mom was pregnant with my older sister soon after. Due to work and family duties they couldn’t stay in the same country and were long distance for 8 years (more like separated since back then there wasn’t very easy means of contact). My dad didn’t see my mom and sister for 8 years, till they finally moved together to a new city. That’s when thing started to go downhill. 

My dad had a horrible temper and would verbally abuse my mom and sister. But as soon as he’d have an anger outbreak, he’d feel guilty and apologize and try doing anything to make up for it. So my mom stayed with him. 

Fast forward a few years and I’m born, and then we all move back to my dads home country. My mom is now in a country where she has no family/friends and doesn’t speak the language. My dad is still angry and temperamental but he’s always away for work so we don’t really have to deal with him much. He also feels more attached to me as I’m younger and he’s raised me since birth, whereas with my sister he feels more distant and so doesn’t care for her like a father should. But again, he’s always away and so we don’t have to deal with it for too long. 

When my sister became a teenager my dad started to touch her inappropriately. I’m not sure about the details but it made my sister very uncomfortable. She told my mom and my mom went to my dads sister for advice. She basically gave her none and shrugged off the situation.  Unsure again about the details since no one has really spoken to me about this and I’ve only recently found out around 15 years later. My understanding is that my mom didn’t do much about it and my sister threatened to tell my dads family, so he stopped. My mom may have intervened but I have no idea. 

Fast forward and I just find out that my dad has sexually assaulted my sister and nevertheless, my mom and sister still have a normal relationship with him. I think this is the case because they’ve been so broken down by his abusive behavior that they feel like they need him in their lives. I was lucky in that my dad treated me very differently than my sister, and with time he’s become less angry and has less of a temper, so by the time I was a teenager I didn’t have to cop the same abuse my sister did.

I also recently found out that my dad has been cheating on my mom with prostitutes who he pays to fly overseas to his house (while my mom is away overseas visiting my sister). My mom told me she thought he may have had a woman over and so I checked his email one day and found that he purchased tickets for the prostitute. Also, she’s younger than me and I’m 22.... 

My mom hasn’t confronted or left my dad, and she’s asked me to act normal around him. She hasn’t worked for over 20 years and lives in a country where she can’t speak the language and so she feels like she can’t leave him. She also says that if she does leave him, he’ll cut my sister off financially to hurt her (unsure if he would but quite possible- my sister and her husband are struggling and so she needs  the money). I feel disgusted by my dad but I’m supposed to act normal around him? I’m disappointed in my mom for just letting him do all these hurtful things and not standing up for herself or my sister. I just don’t know what to do or who to talk to. ",31Jan2019,1

Ok so I’m going to be moving/ starting college in the fall. Right now I’m living at home but I still have bills to pay, I’m in about $1300 in debt but I get paid tomorrow which should bring that down a good bit. 

Anyways I just started a new job, because I need money and something to keep me busy before school starts, but only 3 weeks in and I already despise getting up everyday and going to work.

I’ll start off with what I like about the job.

1. It pays ok, I would like more, but I feel like the work and pay balances.

2. I have to wake up relatively early, but I’m off and home before 4 p.m. so I miss the 5 o clock traffic. 

And that’s the end of that list, onto the cons 

1. I’m extremely mentally exhausted at work and when I get home and I don’t work out like I used to, because I just want to lay down.

2. The hours and even minutes drag on at work, which is the same for a lot of jobs but it makes me almost insane.

3. The work is very repetitive, and very verrryyyy boring. 

4. I’m constantly micromanaged, there is a camera above every damn cubical. My boss walks around constantly, and likes to check in on me just a little too much. 

5. I know it’s my job and I’m just supposed to work other than breaks and lunch but I like to write. Thing is, there is some sensitive information that the company can’t let write down and do whatever with it so all I have at my desk is my computer and telephone. 

6. Being in a cubical all day, with the insanely bright Fluorescent lights, and my computer screen. Makes my head feel like mush, and sunglasses don’t help 😂.

7. There’s nothing about to what I do that I can get excited about or happy about. I honestly feel like a zombie. 

So that’s that, I don’t like jumping from job to job, but it’s just so depressing. I can actually feel myself wasting away in that cubical. I just want to do something that has purpose, something I can get behind. Not some corporate bs. I really need some advice so please, I’m willing to listen and one more thing. Since I am living at home with parents at the moment, they’re kind of on top of me to stay at this job. They don’t care about how I’m feeling about my job or my emotions at all. They want me to build “perseverance” and just do it. I know I’m sounding whiny but I can’t talk to anyone about this because no one really understands.",31Jan2019,1
119,"I work as a graphic designer at a small, family run creative agency and the guy who hired me works as an accountant as well, in another business run by the same family. This means he’s usually not in the studio, unless we have a very time sensitive project. 

Being a small studio we also work on very few client projects and a lot of projects for the studio itself.

I’m not happy with the job. I don’t particularly connect well with the other people in the studio, no matter how much I try. Everyone talks to each other, but it never goes beyond boring small talk. I’m in the studio 9 hours a day, 6 days a week which is a lot considering the small number of clients we have and how little work we do each day. I find the studio projects boring and not for me, and my personal projects usually go in a completely different artistic direction. I often find myself waiting to get home so that I can work on projects I’m actually enthusiastic about, only to get home and immediately doze off because I’m tired from sitting in front a computer all day. I understand that working for someone else means that I’m going to have to occasionally work on projects I don’t like; what annoys me particularly is that there are very few projects to work on so I usually have very little to look forward to while working on a project I don’t like. The fact that my boss isn’t in the studio a lot definitely plays a big role in there not being much work to do, and when he’s in the studio he likes to micro manage a lot. He also doesn’t communicate his ideas well, so I’ll often end up working on something for two days, only for him to come in to the studio the next day, tell me everything is wrong, say something vague like “make it look cool and fun” (my definition of “cool” and “fun” is very different from his) and leave after 10 minutes.

The pay isn’t much, it’s enough to buy some art supplies for my personal projects, but only because I live with my parents and don’t have to pay for food and rent. I want to leave the job because there is nothing motivating me to go to office everyday other than the fact that I’ve signed up to work there and so I have to. However, I don’t know how and where to look for another job, and my portfolio isn’t strong enough for me to freelance. This is my first full time job and I’ve been working here for about 5 months. I can’t tell if this is a job that’ll get better if I stick around and give it some time, or if it’s a good idea to leave and look for another job. The art and design community isn’t particularly huge in my area, so finding another job seems a daunting task. I also have a history of running away from situations the minute things get a little bit unfavourable and I cant tell if I’m doing that again. I have only been at this job for 5 months, after all.

120,"We grew up in a really good church. A megachurch, actually! My dad was fairly ""high up"" in the staff there. In 8th grade, my family uprooted and moved a few states away with almost no warning. I found out a few months later, he cheated on my mom with a college student in the area. We moved away to start fresh. Over the next 5 - 8 years, everything went to hell. My mom got very depressed, my sister went through a crazy destructive rebellion stage, my dad continued to cheat on my mom, he was very verbally and emotionally abusive to me and my sister, they filed and unfiled for divorce multiple times and, possibly the most hurtful, he didn't even bother to show up for the custody hearing for me and my sister.

***Please note, I am new to Reddit, I do not know where to go to ask things like this. So I'm if this is in the wrong place, and if it is, please tell me.***

I am a almost 17 year old, who drinks a lot of soda. I get terrible caffeine withdrawal headaches when I don't drink soda for about three or four days. I've very recently found interest in bodybuilding, and I'd like to change myself for a healthier life, physically and mentally. I'm very unfit at the moment. When running in gym class I get sharp pains in my right shoulder and other things I can't name off the top of my head. I know one of my problems is I don't breathe well while running. My coach and friends say I need to breathe in through my nose and out my mouth very slowly. I can sorta do this at the moment but not slow enough. My stamina is also very low, I can run somewhat fast but not for very long or I run out of breath. I plan on learning to swim soon, something I had a lot of difficulty with as a child and never successfully picked up as a skill, I can barely float. Finally, I plan on starting very soon on building my strength up significantly, with my long-term goal of trying to be a bodybuilder (naturally). I have some goals of what I want to try to get to, albeit, they are significantly ambitious and will take me 10+ years of work to reach. One example of my goal is [Alexander Ludwig](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1573253/mediaviewer/rm584655360).

Thank you very much for reading, I'm open to any advice I get. 

**Here's a TL;DR list of what I'm asking for advice on:**

What can I do to get rid of Caffeine Withdrawal Headaches to help me stop drinking soda and more water?

What can I do to improve my breathing while running?

What should I do to improve my stamina?

What should I start doing for workouts and warm-ups to start myself on my goal of getting significantly stronger and likely start bodybuilding?",31Jan2019,1
127,"I really have no idea how to start this, but here we go.  Being in the military for the last 8 years everything in my life has been regimented.  From the time I woke up in the morning till the time I went to sleep I did what I was told, when I was told.  Since transitioning from this lifestyle into a more civilian oriented one, I’ve had extreme internal difficulty adjusting.  It’s not so much the various styles of clothing, hair, or personalities that bother me, but some of the ideologies.  To clarify, I don’t align myself on any political spectrum but more so with ideals of morals and ethics (because once again, this is how I was trained).  BUT, I consistently find my teachers and peers bashing individuals who match my description.  

For instance, in a lecture I attended this week we analyzed a war oriented short story.  The gist of this story was about a young white soldier fighting in WWI who makes a promise to God that he’ll spread his message if he survives this battle.  The soldier survives, and doesn’t spread the word of god which is where the story ends.  Of course, from both a literary and critical perspective it’s important to interpret and analyze this piece.  However, I found my peers making comments such as ‘maybe he picked the wrong occupation’ or that ‘he’s a bad person for exploiting god in order to survive’.   It’s difficult not taking this to heart because after sacrificing both my physical and mental health I find myself relating more to the soldier in the story than any of my peers.  

When faced with situations such as the aforementioned (and there have been plenty) I tend to keep to myself and internalize my thoughts.  Whether this is healthy or not is up for debate, but I foresee myself dealing with this issue a lot in my future.  I’m in the process of becoming an English Educator which is an increasingly liberal field that will require me to engage in similar themes.  Granted, I’m not blind to this or the implications surrounding liberalism as a whole (which I’m neither for nor against), it’s hard being painted as a villain.  Being a white male veteran, it consistently feels like my peers have these indirect hostilities towards me which is hurtful due to the liberal nature of the field.  So, I guess what I’m trying to ask is: are there any ways I can better myself or learn to cope with my peers opinions in regards to individuals similar to myself?

NOTE:  I’m not trying to spark any political nonsense.  

TL;DR:  Veteran with PTSD trying to become teacher has difficulty coping with being painted as a villain by his peers and professors despite him not being a villain, seeks advice from strangers.  ",31Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Basically for the last 6 months, I haven't spoken to someone who, for the longest time, I considered to be one of my 2 closest friends since childhood... a little bit of backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

He has had a girlfriend for the past 3 years (living w each other for 2) and in the last 6 months before july her and I began to get closer (platonically)... They both live a couple of hours away from me, so whenever they're around we try to hang out. His girlfriend happens to work nearby me sometimes (she trains horses) so she would come around after to hang out, for an hour at most when she was done working just so she wouldn't have to immediately drive all the way home. The first time she did I was aware of how he might feel so I made sure to ask her if she let him know she was coming to chill and he seemed cool with it... a few months later she was in the area and we did the same thing, we went hiking at a local preserve (me and all my friends go there quite often) and I unintentionally waited to ask her if she let him know until around the time she was leaving, which was a mistake because I found out later that he was really upset by it. Since then we decided it was best to not hang out unless he was around. I still considered her a friend and someone I could talk to at the very least, usually for advice, so every once in a while we would talk if I needed an opinion or just needed to vent when nobody else was available. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to right before shit hits the fan, her and I were snap chatting and she sent me a snap where she mashed her nose in w her finger (some ppl have super buttony noses and mine doesn't do that) so I replied trying to do the same and captioned it something like ""lol mine doesn't smash like yours""... he opened it on her phone before she had the chance to see it and COMPLETELY mis-interpreted it. He called me up afterward and confronted me about it in a very indirect/cryptic way and thought I was playing dumb when I told him that I had no idea what he was talking about... anyway, he thought I was talking about my JUNK to her and flipped out. I told him how ridiculous that was and explained the situation to him but he didn't believe me. I didn't bother talking to him for a few months after (except for when I wished him a happy birthday) because my friends told me he wanted a break from me. Okay, fine. Less than a year before this all, he would tell me how he wanted to break up with her eventually, was using tinder and saying nasty shit to girls behind her back... despite the many lines he has crossed with his gf, she forgave him.

&amp;#x200B;

A week or two ago I figured that enough was enough and that if he cared about me the same way I cared about him that he would maybe want to work things out, so I sent him a text telling him that I'm sorry for how we left things off, that he's my best friend and that I want to work things out... but today I discovered that he blocked my phone number and all my social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I get that in hindsight it would have been smart to just leave her alone and I would respect that now if I had the chance, but after almost a decade of memories and of being there for each other at our best and worst, I feel incredibly hurt. It seems impossible to convince him I wasn't going after his girl. What can I do to make this better? Just wait it out and hope he gives me a chance eventually? Do I just let it be and find better friends? I'm lost",31Jan2019,1
139,"I'm 29, have a full time job during the day, have a car and drivers license, but whenever I get home from work it feels like all I do anymore is sit around here or lay down on my bed.

I used to play plenty of videogames, read books, draw, and watch movies, and even listen to music during my free time. Not really anymore tho. 

Its been like this for me since the end of September when one of my best friends who I also love, left the country because her family wanted to help take care of her while she is going through a pregnancy from a past relationship.

After she left I fell apart to a degree. Since then I have been trying to pick myself back up and push forward. I had started to do better for awhile but after about a month ago, my other best friend ended up leaving too because he felt he needed to get away from the area and ""re-find himself"".

She's going to be gone for a year, and he is going to be gone for an undetermined amount of time.

Since then I've been feeling pretty alone and I can't seem to bring myself to do things like I used to.

Sometimes I think, maybe I'll go drive and go somewhere, but I don't know where to go. I used to go on lots of walks, but since winter came around its always dark out when I get out of work. I don't have anyone to hangout with. My circle of friends has always been small and now it feels almost like its all gone. And it's always been hard for me to push and reach out to try and make more. 

I've tried doing the things that I used to but I always feel empty and down when I do them now.

What do I do when nothing feels good to do anymore and I feel lost all the time? It honestly feels like I'm grieving for a lost family member and can't get out of it.",31Jan2019,1

142,"Throwaway for reasons. Sorry for being so long, you can skip to the words in bold if you don't care about the background.

I'm 23, Asian. I got hired entry level at a good sized company about 18 months ago that I had to move to a completely new city to accept. In the past several months I've informally transitioned into being the personal assistant of the #2 boss in our department, an older Asian man. This is a guy who has 40+ employees under him. I'm so close to him that he'll ask me transcribe all sorts of internal communications that I'm pretty sure somebody at my seniority shouldn't be seeing because my boss sucks at typing and I can type faster than he talks.

He'll bring me lunch occasionally, tell me about his girlfriend troubles, vacation pictures, etc. I went to his house for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner with his family. Recently, his son helped me find an affordable apartment near the office instead of the hour+ commute I was doing everyday. He has given me good advice and opened doors for me. I've likewise shared details of my personal life with him and his family.

Only now typing this out, do I realize how close we've become. But I don't mind, he has never harassed me, more like we just get along really well.

Now that I've laid that out, **here's where I need advice.**

We're looking to hire several more entry level employees, a similar position to where I started. This morning, he called me to his office and said that he wanted me to sift through a big stack of resumes and pick out the promising ones. (Is it weird to ask someone whose only been around a year to do this?)

Anyways, I start going through the resumes on the table while he does paper work. As I finish the first pile, I reach across the table to start on a second pile. He sees me reaching for it and here's the conversation as I remember it:

**Boss:** *Oh BeetNamJam, you don't have to look through those resumes, just give me the ones you liked and put the rest in the bin.*

**Me, casually as I gathered the papers:** *Oh, what's wrong with these?*

**Boss:** *Here bring them over too, let me show you.*

I bring them over

**Boss:** *Look at these names, what do you think?*

**Me:** *Uh, I don't know? Brown... Washington... look normal to me?*

**Boss, whispering**: *They sound black. I don't want to hire any more black people.*

**Me:** *Oh... wait, ok. Are you sure? Can you do that?*

I was really confused, not sure if he was just trying to make an off color joke or something.

**Boss:** *And look at what part of the city they live in. Hmph. I won't hire those. Oh, and I only let you know because we're so close. OK?*

**Me:** *Ok, yeah, haha... I'll just put these with the rest and get back to work.*

I saw those resumes in his bin later that day. I'm actually kinda in shock that somebody was that openly racist in front of me. I think this is the first time I've witnessed it so blatantly in a professional setting. Our workplace has a reasonable number of black people, but now that I think about it, all of them were around since before my boss was promoted.

So now what? Ethically and morally, I feel like I need to do something. But I'm hesitant because of our relationship, professionally and personally. Like, if I found out my dad was a KKK member or something, I would try to change him.",31Jan2019,1
143,"My friend got me a job at a restaurant a few 
months ago. By ‘got me a job’ I mean she just told our boss ‘hey this girl can work here’ and my boss said ‘okay!’ with no questions asked.

My boss only hires her friends, and I didn’t know her personally so I’m a bit left out at work. I also think it’s kinda stupid because she doesn’t care if her friends mess up at work but it’s the end
of the world if I mess up because she doesn’t know me.

I got the job just because I should save up for college and stuff, but work is taking up all of my weekends. I only work 3 days a week but it’s still so much time and I don’t have any time to do homework or have a social life and I have to leave early from my practices to go to work.

A lot of people think I’m lucky because I actually have a job and I get food after working, and I know I should be happy, but every day before work I just get so stressed and I feel like what I get paid isn’t enough to compensate for my anxiety levels.

144,"Ever since I hit puberty I would stare at women who I thought as attractive and objectify them in my head.    
I would stop if I got caught or after maybe 10-20 seconds which is a really long time now that I think about it.  

I've gotten better at not staring in recent years as I know it makes people uncomfortable but I am really socially inept and I still find myself objectifying women.  

Granted I never follow women to stare at them, if I know they're uncomfortable or if I feel like I've been looking for too long I'll stop.  But my feeling of too long and a woman's feeling of too long may differ obviously.  I never try to talk to these women or catcall/whistle.  

I don't have any female friends or have had a relationship and I think that has a large part in this issue.  I've mostly worked in the construction industry where this type of behaviour seems to be accepted.

I've tried to ""just stop"" staring but with mixed results.  I've tried thinking about how people staring at me would make me feel uncomfortable but again, mixed results.

Should I go to a therapist?  Would a female or male therapist be better?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a startup, been going about 2 years. It's a non-profit, but it does good work and the work is steady. We've talked about running a business together for over a decade, but he moved to the West Coast of the US when he got married and I've only ever lived here on the East Coast/Midwest. I figured that was a done deal - nice idea but not gonna happen. But.   
I've been doing remote admin stuff for him - about 4-6 hours a week - for about 6 months. The books are organized chaos, and he needs someone to figure it out before they get bigger or it'll be an unsustainable problem. But if they start making good choices now, I have high hopes. He wants me to move out, start full time, and be their admin person - essentially COO - because they desperately need someone with front-facing customer service experience.  


I live in Florida. It's not just me, either, it's me, my spouse, our almost-4-year-old, and 2 cats. We know exactly 4 people in Oregon. My friend and his spouse - (who tried to convince me I could do better than my husband back before we had our daughter, so there's *that*. To be fair, we were going through a tough spot, but we worked through it and we're better than ever. But she's in a higher... tax bracket? Than we are? And there was a lot of ""you could marry up"" subtext) -  and one of my spouse's cousins and her husband. The rest of our family except one of my spouse's sisters live on the East Coast. We're ok being away from family, but Oregon is FAR. And expensive. Spousatron is currently stay-at-home and taking classes online, so we're not worried about transplanting his job, but it's a big leap and I have no idea what to do. I'd be starting at $45,000/yr with health insurance (a step up for sure), but I don't really know what cost of living is like out that way beyond what I can find on cost calculators. My partner has been infuriatingly supportive and laid back about the idea of moving there, particularly as we've been planning on leaving Florida (generally) within the next year anyway. But we were looking at, like, NC and MI. (I have a solid lead on a job less personally fulfilling but with a large company in Detroit that, which is closer to family, which popped up literally 3 days ago).  I'm overwhelmed.

150,"So as the title says, I am in a situation where my direct supervisor is becoming a bully. My position is one of supervision over other team members, and my boss and I had a meeting during which I was told that I was breaking confidentiality by conveying too much information to the team. Bear in mind that I was never told ""this is top secret"" but also, the information was pertinent to the team's ability to do their jobs effectively. It was information that I felt they required so as to not be abruptly disciplined and/or let go very soon with no idea why/what was happening.

When I told my boss I was uncomfortable lying to the team, I was told that it was my job. That I was meant to be the boss's right hand and to display a united front. However, I have serious issues with withholding information, and I told my boss that I felt there was a lack of transparency that was necessary for a healthy team. 

I told my boss that if there was information that the team shouldn't have, then it shouldn't be shared with me. As I don't like being put in a situation where I know damning information and am expected to sit on it and stress under the burden of knowing that if I just told people, we could solve the issues and attack the problem as a team, head-on.

Immediately after this meeting, the boss attacked a team-member, claiming that person was incompetent and needed to work on self-improvement. It was handled in a manipulative, passive-aggressive manner with no constructive criticism provided and no guidelines on how to go about improving, or even what was needing improvement. This person was simply told they weren't as good as others, which in my opinion (and everyone else on the team) is simply not true. This assessment is based on work that the boss is judging in a highly subjective manner, filled with personal bias. (I can say this because no examples of ""bad"" work was ever provided.)

Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions on how to handle a boss that is power-tripping like this? And what to do as far as the ethical side is concerned where I'm being tasked with withholding information?

Every day this is becoming messier, and I'm trying to gather enough material and information to perhaps approach the leadership at the next level up with my concerns. However, the company culture has been one of ""managers are never wrong"" and ""fire the subordinate"" instead. It's very much a hammer the nail that sticks up sort of workplace. 

While I'm fine with that personally, I'm not sure how to handle the situation so that there is no blow-back against the other members of my team (especially since I feel somewhat as though the attack on my co-worker was prompted by the meeting I had with my supervisor where I insisted I was uncomfortable telling lies to said co-worker.)

Let me know what you guys think!

TL;DR: Boss is manipulative, two-faced and wants me to lie to the team. I'm extremely uncomfortable lying when it affects others' jobs. How to stick it to boss?

156,"So i guess as a background I’ve played basketball my since about 5th grade and I’ve been a pretty good player ever since, although I’ve never been on a winning basketball team ever. It’s my senior year in high school, I’ve played for the high school team all four years. Again this year we aren’t a winning team. Who was the jv coach and assistant coach for varsity then has now moved up to head coach and for the past two years he’s been head coach. He talks about how he’s gonna turn this program around, things are gonna change we’re gonna do this and that and if we don’t then we’re not going to play, no tolerance for bad attitude etc. And although I don’t agree with the defense we play or how he wants us to play it and some of our offense, I’ll give him this, he says all the right things when it comes to teammates how to treat them, playing hard every game, energy, effort, attitude, how he’s going to play the best 5 guys playing, we have to move the ball on offense, hustle on defense and if we don’t we’re coming out, etc. The two biggest problems I have with him is that he doesn’t enforce any of these things he says though, he basically lies to us and he is big on favoritism. Favoritism is something I’ve seen my whole high school career from him and the other coaches who coach jv and v although not like this year and the other two problems I’ve noticed more this year. There are three seniors in particular that usually get consistent minutes regardless of what they do (consistent bad shot selection, turnovers, defensive mistakes) and their regarded as our best players because they score (given they’ve been allowed to do what they want their whole career, playing bad or not) now I don’t want to bad mouth my tm8s or anything because when they play good they play good but nothing is said or done to them when they play bad or don’t do what we emphasize in practice like move the ball on offense etc despite it being the part of the reason for us losing games. Then there are three other seniors who get basically no burn now despite also being good players. At the beginning of the season and in the middle I still didn’t get much playtime but I played a decent amount and played well, obviously I had screw ups. I’ve been a starter my first two years in HS but I broke my arm last year where I would’ve been 6th man and then there is this year. I’m not a scorer because I don’t take shots (although I do have a good mid range shot and pull up) and I would but don’t because I understand we have to move the ball on offense way more than once before we decide to shoot and we don’t do that and me being pg I pass the ball when I come up the court and I usually don’t see it again after that, we haven’t moved the ball decent as long as I’ve played basketball in this town, just certain moments. But I handle the ball well and can get us into our offense and organize the court and I play good defense. At this point of the season he’s kind of blamed the seniors for what’s happened, however, the sophomores and juniors play just as much as us if not more and play well worse than us, I mean for most of them this is their first year playing varsity minutes and they’re decent players but they are inexperienced. They only play a quarter of jv which is regarded as unimportant to our coach and then play 4 varsity quarters. For most of the season they’ve been given big minutes and the seniors have kind of been put on the back burner since we haven’t won many games despite them playing more than us and probably the same amount of time as those three seniors I mentioned earlier. If you’re gonna play varsity basketball you should be held to the same standards every other v b-ball player that’s a senior is being held too. If you make 4 turnovers in a row, why are you still in the game? If you take terrible shots, why are you still in the game? These are things our coach has said he won’t tolerate but his actions say differently, besides when it comes to me, the first mistake I make in the game I get pulled immediately and I’m not complaining about that, it’s just not the same with any other player I’ve watched my tm8s chuck, turnover the ball 2-3 times in a row and stay in the game despite not adding anything else to it like scoring/rebounding/good defense etc. I’m not a perfect player by any means, I’m a pretty average player but I am a varsity player who does have more experience and doesn’t turnover the ball as often as the other players in the game are (usually about 1-2, which isn’t good but compared to our guards who are giving up about 4-5 is better), is not taking terrible shots and moving the ball in the offense to get the ball to the guys who are stronger at shooting 3s or posting up etc. I nor the fellow bench players aren’t getting obvious rotations in the game and sadly have to settle for about a minute or two in the entire game or less. If I got in the game and was f’ing up turning over the ball shooting just any shot I could understand but I’m not doing that I’m playing better and taking care of the ball more than the ppl who get in. (I’m trying my best not to sound arrogant, I just know what I’m capable of). He says he hasn’t given up on the seniors and started looking towards the younger guys and next year but his actions show the exact opposite of what he’s saying because despite their poor play they stay in the game and we get overlooked. Previous players, parents and just ppl in the town have pointed the finger at him and previously I defended him but I can see now and this is not like I was buddy buddy with him and my pt slipped up now I’m angry type of thing. We had a game just today I played for a min, played well (hustled, played good defense, got us into our offense, got an assist) then in the fourth quarter I along with another senior am asked by him if we’d like to get in with 1:30 left on the clock down by 30 which we were the whole game pretty much, we both declined I mean to me that’s just disrespectful I told him to just play the younger guys like he’d been doin the whole game and I take more offense to it bc I was a player who was getting more minutes at least more than one which I’m getting now (used to get like at least around 8-12) and I’m sitting on the bench watching my tm8s chuck shots and turnover the ball and I’m just getting overlooked despite my good play or history of good play, whenever he compares film of when we were playing well and not guess who is in the film of us playing well? Me). The seniors that he loves still play and he always makes excuses for them and just stays quiet whenever they do something worth taking them out. Even my tm8s admit openly he shows favoritism and is doing us dirty basically. It’s my senior year, I’ve never quit anything in my life so pride is really the only thing keeping me on the team riding it out but I honestly think there’s no point of staying because I know what’s going to happen the rest of the season now for sure the three seniors and younger guys will play and the rest will sit despite what those players do in the game and we’ll continue to be a losing team despite wether I play or not. Since I broke my arm last year I don’t really have much passion left for the game, I don’t plan on playing professionally or in college and could probably just be spending my time better working so idk sorry this was super long just looking for some advice/a outlet to vent.

157,"Hello, I’m considering moving in another country to pursue my career after school. I am a graduate from a business school with a masters degree, with international experience (lived 2+ years abroad during the studies) and enough past work experience (2 years approx in business including 6 months abroad).

This seems like the path I should follow but I have doubts about whether I should try a completely new life for few reasons:

Contracts are long (1.5 - 2 years) and I don’t want to be stuck in a country that I dislike. I would not go in a country that does not interest me, but since I have never lived there who knows.
I am extremely bad at making friends, I have very few of them in my home country (and not living close) so I would certainly struggle to get social. I have never been fully integrated somewhere in my home country or in the foreign country I’ve lived in.
I fear that I may end up lonely, and my family would not be there in case. I prefer living alone, I have done it successfully in the past, but when I did there were always at least few acquaintances that I could see weekly.

Basically length of contract in case I don’t like the country/job, and isolation/loneliness are my fears.

Pros of moving:
Living a new experience, somewhere else and to fully use my diplomas and experience abroad (English + my native language are required) instead of wasting the “international” part at home.
I am excited by that fact of moving by myself somewhere remote and new, to force myself into adulthood and stop being a teenager who plays video games all day (currently me - finished school in December 2018). I want to start achieving and functioning in the society.
A new start could (if successful) help me get over all the problems that happened lately: got left by my partner, feeling down and very stressed because of it. Also I get the pressure to start working full time. A new start would make any further contact with this person worthless and impossible so that would make me get over it by force.

However, I am unsure if it is necessary for me to throw myself in a potentially unfriendly environment (different country/climate/culture etc) to help me grow and if, given my personality, it could backfire and leave me stuck somewhere I may hate.

What do you think ? Any advice is welcome, thanks !",31Jan2019,1

He'll tell you what he thinks and when you're being an idiot, which I respect. These two are married, which I suppose is important. 

On this particular day, I was in class with him. He also taught an academic class, so this was pretty normal. We had discussions in class and he seemed in an okay mood, nothing to be concerned about. I was having a good day. Spoke to friends at lunch, got lots of work done early, got to read a new play I was able to find. Just generally good. I went to my female director's class (drama) and we joked around and were able to do some fun stuff in class. My day was shaping up to be stellar. I suppose that's where I went wrong, expecting things to be good, right? 

After this last class, I went to rehearsal. I did my normal thing, went down to the big dressing room to change into my first costume so that we could begin, and as I was doing so, I was speaking to my fellow cast-mates. Light conversation, I remember it being about smash ultimate, when the technical director careens in looking pissed. He looks at me and my friend and says, ""You guys have *got* to be kidding me. This show is going to hell because of *you*. I can't believe you people."" I was so surprised, and I didn't really know what to do. I didn't know what I did wrong. ""I *hate* you, and this show, because you don't even care about what you're doing."" Upon saying this, he slammed the door, and we all stood in silence. I could barely register what happened, and I could only think about the fact that he was looking at me when he said that. I was finished getting ready so I walked out, and he called for cast and crew to gather round. We all did so, and he started talking. 

""Crew, if you were to walk out and leave, to tell me, 'up yours,' to never come back to this stage, I would totally understand. There have been very few experiences in my time directing worse than this one right here. I am so *appalled* at the cast of this show. I don't know how to express how unreal it has been to watch this trainwreck. Day after day, they come here to rehearse, and nothing changes. Its here to be made better, but it hasn't. And the *attitudes* of these actors, this self-importance and arrogance, is maddening. Breaking props, losing things, messing up costumes and leaving things out in piles, all for you to fix them. Well I encourage you all to no longer stand for that. If any actor tries to take advantage of you, you walk away. Leave them there to figure it out themselves because they don't deserve the help. If that *character* tries to give you hell about something, you walk away.""

I must inform you that he pointed at me when he referred to the character. I felt so ashamed that my knees were wobbling and I felt sick. I've never done that. I never once lost anything or messed up a costume, and only once have I ever stepped on a prop, which was by accident, and I apologized profusely, given assurance that it was an accident and it would be fixed. I would never mistreat anyone on the cast or crew purposefully, and for anyone to imply that I would was crazy. After this rant, he left. Our other director looked at everyone, but mostly me, with disappointment and disgust. She gave us time to talk to the tech crew about what was wrong. 

I promptly went over to the person who helps me with costumes and asked what I could do to help make it easier on her, and what I was doing wrong. I suppose she felt empowered by my tech director's speech, because she started berating at me violently about how when I changed, I never put costumes away properly. I told her that it was completely involuntary, and my hurry (roughly 1-2 minutes per change) did not give me enough time to hang up my clothes then, but I always made a point to go back whenever I had reasonable time to put away and do so. She was not satisfied, and she walked away. 

I addressed my friend who deals with my props, and he told me that I was fine, just to be mindful of all my changes and such. I told him I was sincerely sorry for not doing well. He dismissed me. 

The people manning the set walked to me and told me that I was constantly in the way, and that it was irritating them that I was so incessantly inhibiting their jobs. I apologized for that, too. 

Rehearsal was difficult. I had to put on this happy face all practice, and when i finished, I got a ride home and tried not to cry. I thought that we were all friends, a real team, and I'm just shocked to know that they all see me as a problem. I got a little sympathy for being targeted, but only a little. If I had known this, I would've changed it, I swear, and if I'd been aware of the attitude toward me, I suppose I might've just left so I didn't bother them. 

I don't know what to do. I'm heartbroken, and I feel like my trust has been betrayed. I just need some kind words and advice. Thanks. ",31Jan2019,1

A vehicle.

I live too far from bus stops to feasibly use them, and too far from work to bicycle or walk (like 3 hours each way). It's also the middle of winter here in Michigan and like  -10F.

I've saved up $2,500 to get my first car but have literally no idea what to do next. I have no way to get to cars to check them out, and even if I did I have no way of knowing whether or not the car is in good shape, or how to tell if it has a clean title etc.

The problem is that I feel my potential rotting away. I want to volunteer at a local place that gives food to hungry kids. I want to help out at the homeless shelter to get people to safety in these cold winter days. I want to go enjoy myself by learning to ski or snowshoe, and I can't do any of those things right now.

2. General social life might be a bit weird with a kid in the house.

He’s “allowing” me to leave work at 12 to attend the interview at 1:15. However I live an hour and a half from the interview and genuinely perplexed on what to do. Obviously you need to look and smell nice for an interview, and the option I’ve been given is taking that out of the equation and was told to simply change clothes beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

This story begins when I was four years old. My dad left my mother because she would continually write hot checks and overdraft their bank account. Several weeks after my dad left, my mom met my step-dad. She brought my sister(1 year old) and myself in to a bad living situation with my step-dad and his family. Mainly being that they would leave us kids alone for hours to fend for ourselves. Once my dad learned what was going on he faught to get custody of my sister and I.

My dad was given custody of us and my mom had visitation rights. My mom started doing drugs and didn't do what the courts mandated of her and she lost all rights to see us. My mom was then sent to prison for 2 years for selling drugs. During this time, my dad met my step-mom. They then decided to get married. About a year after getting married, they decided to have my step-mom adopt my sister and I. My dad made a deal with my mom while she was in prison to pay off all of her debt if she signed over her remaining rights to my sister and I. My mom signed over her rights thinking it was the best thing to do because she was not in a position to take care of us.

I know this sounds all great and happy, but it was not. My step-mom was and still is a very abusive and controling person. More mentally abusive than anything. There were times when she would get mad at me and pinch my shoulder or neck really hard in public and make me cry because I wasn't doing exactly what she wanted. The mentally abusive part is much more difficult to explain. I think I have blocked a lot of it out. One thing I vividly remember is that I would pee in the bed when I was around 6 years old. She would make fun of me for doing it. I then started trying to hide whenever I had an accident. She started searching my room whenever she suspected I did it and when she found the underwear that I hid, she would have my dad spank me with the belt because ""hiding something is the same thing as lying.""

School was also difficult for me. We moved quite a bit and then finally settled in North Carolina when I was in 7th grade. I was always an A, B, C student. Any time I ever asked for help with homework or a project it always turned in to a fight because I wasn't understanding the subject or I wasn't doing something right. She told me she didn't understand why I was like this. She would say ""Your dad made all A's in school and was a star sports player. Why can't you be more like him?"" I wish I could think of better examples to better explain how she is.

My entire dad's side of the family knows how my step-mother is and they all pretty much hate her. I didn't know this growing up with her. One day when I was 19, I decided I have had enough. I called my grandparents, my dad's parents and I asked them if they would help me get away from her. That night, they bought me a plane ticket. The next day, without me telling my dad, sister or step-mom, I emptied my bank account and I had my friends drive me to the airport. I was on my way to Texas to live with my grandparents. As you can imagine, this has caused a huge rift in the family.

Once I moved back to Texas, I reached out to my biological mom and I have had a relationship with her ever since. She and my step-dad are doing great. They both have well paying jobs and are contributing members of society again. My mom has tried very hard to try and make up for what she did. I do forgive my mother for what happened and I am so happy that we are able to have a relationship. Me having a relationship with my biological mother has also caused major issues between myself and my dad, sister and step-mom.

My dad and step-mom moved back to the Dallas area a couple of years ago. I recently was promoted at work and my company moved me to the Dallas area. I thought me living in close proximity to my dad and step-mom would help me repair our relationship. We went to dinner when I first moved to the area. I thought everything was fine until it wasn't. The conversation turned in to ""We can't believe you are having a relationship with that woman after everything she did to you."" They told me to stop posting stuff on facebook about my biological mom because people don't understand why i'm having a relationship with her. I have tried to continue to repair the relationship but to no avail. My sister came down from NC to visit my dad and step-mom for Christmas and they completely ignored my requests to get together.

About a week ago, my step-mom sent me a text telling me about a person that died that we knew in NC. After I responded about that, I asked her why they didn't want me around for the Holiday's. I'm going to copy and past the texts exactly as they are in my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** So I am curious... is there a reason why y’all didn’t want me around during the holidays?

**Step-mom:** I suppose there are just things to work through. Different people have different feelings, so a lot to process. I know you haven’t ever reached out to anyone on my side of the family. They’ve had no contact with you since you cut them out of your life ten years ago. It would be awkward given the circumstances to just have a holiday with people who feel hurt maybe. I was sick and we didn’t know until day before when Whitney’s family was able to come. One of Jeff’s sisters committed suicide last year, so they had Christmas with her kids at a cabin away to try and ease their pain. Also Eli’s bday. Just a lot. So then we asked Kaylee about meeting up before she left and she doesn’t feel comfortable with that since you are very involved with Misti and Cissy and all the others now. She has zero interest in those people and doesn’t want any tie or connection. Dad doesn’t like it either. You have every right to choose that, but we don’t understand it and are hurt by it. It causes lots of questions from people we’ve known forever when it’s broadcast on fb. Maybe sometime you can talk through it all with Dad. We really do want to connect with you, but a lot of things like those people are not any part of our world for good reason.

We didn’t know about Christmas in Austin until it was the weekend. Tammy didn’t send anything to Kaylee and Tata shipped things after Christmas. So that was weird Christmas was planned early and we didn’t know and weren’t expected to come. Dad had work Christmas party and we couldn’t, but it was assumed. We invited papa and Tata to come here at Xmas so we could all spend a couple days together and she said no they only wanted us to go there.

Anyway, sorry we have so much going on. Nana is starting to get around. But I helped over there all of December. Dad has lots going on with work. Maybe we can meet up again soon.

But we are curious, why do you really want to see all those people who didn’t care anything about you as a child? And Kaylee (or any of your family) wants no part of or connection to at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** I would love to meet up with you and Dad again soon. It would be great to see you and give us a chance to talk about everything. Let me know when y’all are able to meet up. Any night or weekend works for me. Love you Mom

&amp;#x200B;

**Step-mom:** Dad will be setting up his travel schedule for work soon. They just bought another company and he’s closing out the year, so lots going on at work. But we will try to meet up before too long. Again, you can do anything you choose with misty or the others. It’s just that none of us want any connection to any of them whatsoever. Just having her blocked on fb isn’t enough. It’s the contact and all the others still on fb. It makes us all uncomfortable.

It all goes back to the time you were in touch with her secretly when we lived in Charlotte and she came to visit without our knowledge. She was in our space, in my car, in our lives and we all felt very violated. Dad worked very hard to protect us from the crazy stuff that did happen and more that could happen. We paid all her debt to be a legal family. She gave up her parental rights as long as she didn’t have to pay child support or do anything the judge said. I can’t imagine a mother doing that. And I can’t imagine the hurt a child must feel knowing that. But i know y’all had a great life with us and the love and support of your extended family. As long as Kaylee continues to say she wants no part of Misty, Kenny, Cissy et al, we will continue to support her wish to avoid that unnecessary stress. I don’t know if you’ve ever reviewed the court papers, but those are available if you would ever like to do so. Dad has saved everything. We love you and want to help you process everything so you can make decisions that help you live your best life. But we have to do the same.

Maybe you could talk to Kaylee and get her viewpoint. See, she gets very upset when those people act like they’re your sister/brother/cousin whatever. They are not blood related, legally related and have not been a part of your life. Yes, misty is your bio mom. But that hurts Kaylee and makes her mad also because misty made choices and did not raise y’all. It hurts everyone in the family for different reasons. We would never tell you not to have a relationship with your bio mom. But we would certainly hope you’d think long and hard about all the ramifications and domino effect that has on you and others. We can def talk about it more when we get together. Hope 2019 is off to a good start for you. Have a fun weekend!

Also, forgot to mention the other thing about Christmas was Tata mentioned you were spending the holiday with the girls in white oak. We didn’t really get notified or included about any of the Akers fam plans this year, but were staying here any way bc of Nana’s recent surgery and Kaylee’s travel schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I never responded to her after that. I talked to my grandparents and they told me I need to stop trying with her and that it's going to drive me crazy. I really want to have a great relationship with all of my family but I don't think it's possible. I refuse to block my biological mom out of my life. I miss my dad and sister terribly though.

I get up every morning at 6 am, go to school for seven hours, come home for half an hour, and then go babysit for two hours every single week day. I get paid good money, usually $60-$80 a week, but lately I’ve been feeling so overwhelmed.

And on top of that I have homework and other things that I have to do on week nights. When I get home I take a shower, have dinner, do my homework, watch some tv and then I go to bed. I used to like babysitting, but now I almost cry every time I think about doing it. I’m not even excited for early dismissals or days off school anymore because that means I’m going to have to babysit for even longer. Especially school cancelations, because there is literally no excuse that I can come up with to get out of it. The kids aren’t bad, but I just feel so overwhelmed. I’m only a junior in high school and I feel like I can’t even have a life outside from school and babysitting, or even enjoy time off from school. I know that in just a few years I’m going to be working everyday and have so much more stress and responsibilities, and I understand that the parents work long, stressful hours too, and that while I’m babysitting they’re working, but I just feel so overwhelmed. However for some reason I can’t just say no when they ask me to watch them. I feel like a nanny when all I signed up for was a half an hour after school everyday.

179,"I'll try to make a long story short.. I work at a college where I'm the daily administrator for some of their software. I'm basically a business analyst that does some light tech work in form of customizations and workflows. There is literally nobody else in my organization that can perform these duties, as I'm the only one who has done it since 2013 and it's so heavily customized that it would take a few months to walk in and be able to continue business operations as they are now, especially with no specific training. 

In June of 2017 we lost a director and my boss filled in for that role while I filled in for his. Nobody filled in for me so I have been doing both of those jobs since 2017/ For a multitude of reasons I couldn't quit - but my boss resigned in October and he has been gone since Jan 1st. I was approached in November about taking his position permanently and was offered the title and no additional money. I declined unless I was getting a raise and so management had **me** write the job description for the role again and they would get it reclassified; Though I had done the job for a year they were not going to allow me the same raise and same title for reasons they chalked up to budgetary constraints.  I did that in November and heard nothing through the holidays. Fast forward to now and I've accepted a new position and I start next week. 

However, I resigned last Tues. to give them 3 weeks of me training who I anticipated would replace me. They ignored my recommendation and they are giving the job to someone in their ""circle"" and they requested that I rewrite the description to ""beef it up and make it worthy of a director title and a two pay scale increase"" so they will be making more than even my previous manager was while having zero experience. i have in writing me saying I was uncomfortable doing this because I'll be leaving and feel it's inappropriate and they ignored my wishes and told me to hand it in and make sure it can hold up to scrutiny.

Recently I was awarded with an Employee of the Year for my work and was asked to become a supervisor. So I think I'm doing pretty good.

Well I've done all the testing (which took three weeks of studying on my own time), I have my certifications done, I'm over half way done with training and they just asked me, literally not even a few hours ago, if I can ""open up my availability all the way"". When I said no, my boss basically took my promotion away, saying that maybe in the future we can come back to me if they have different needs. When I asked for an honest answer if my promotion would be taken away, I was given a vague answer about what's best for the restaurant.

I don't know what to do at this point. I feel disrespected, used and like I wasted weeks of my time. They have taken away at least two promotions from two other people that are still working with me, but they were both taken out after they failed their testing, weeks before where I'm at now. But obviously this is something they do often. I'm looking for advice for what to do next. Do I quit? Do I wait it out?",31Jan2019,1

183,"Before I start, I just want to clarify that this isn't a sob story. Usually when I tell people about this aspect of my life, all I get is pity and that's the last thing that I want. This is my life, it sucks, but that's just how it is. 

Here's some backstory. Like the title states, I am a caretaker for my disabled parents. When I was six my mom was diagnosed with MS, and two years later my dad was diagnosed with it too. Their MS gradually got worse, so I stepped up and began doing more around the house. By the time I was 13 I was doing all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. I tried to raise my younger brother (14M) as best as I could, as parenting him stressed out my parents and when they're stressed they're in more pain. I didn't have time to hang out with friends or do extracurricular activities, so I didn't have many friends. I played volleyball briefly but all I could think about during practice was my parents and if they were ok. I am always worried about them and when I get a text or call from one of them I assume the worst. When I got my driver's license, I took on even more responsibility. Now I do most of the grocery shopping (occasionally my dad feels up to it, and my grandma (77F) does it sometimes), go to the pharmacy to pick up one of my mom's many medications, and drive my brother places. I work full time on top of all of this. My brother is learning to cook and clean and all of that, he tries to help out as best he can.

I graduated high school last year and decided to take a gap year to make some money for university. My boyfriend (18M) and I plan to move to a city that is nine hours away from where we currently live and attend university there this September. Most of my friends are already there. I want to leave so badly. I want to start my life so badly. I want to live and not have to worry about my parents so badly. I have never wanted anything more than I want this. I love the city and the university so much, they're everything I've always wanted. My boyfriend is also escaping his own family issues, this is what he wants too. But I feel so guilty. If I leave, my brother will have to step up like I did. I don't want him to have to do that. I want him to be a kid for as long as possible and have fun, because I never did. My teenage years were horrible and I never fit in because I had to grow up too fast. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I don't want this for him. 

There's also the matter of my parents. I am convinced that they'll die without me. While my brother tries sometimes, he is a very typical lazy teenage boy and it can take a lot of convincing to get him to do what he's told. I'm not sure that he'll be able to step up and do the things they need him to do. Then there's my mom. My mom is in a wheelchair and hardly ever leaves her bed because she can't walk anymore. My dad takes care of her while I'm at work and my brother is at school, as his MS isn't nearly as bad as hers. He's on disability leave at work so he doesn't actually have to go to work at all. The issue is that my dad has grown bitter as his MS has progressed and isn't the same as he used to be. He refuses to help around the house, even when he is feeling up to it. His personality has changed. He often belittles my mom and seems to resent taking care of her. Many days I come home at 4 or 5 and find that she hasn't been fed since breakfast. I am afraid to leave her under the care of my dad and brother.

So reddit, there's a condensed version of my life story. I'm mostly asking for advice on how to deal with the guilt of it all. I know that I'm supposed to just go for it and live my life, but it's not that simple. I am definitely leaving, my boyfriend promised he will drag me away kicking and screaming if he has to. How do I prepare my brother for this? Is there anything I can do to help them while living nine hours away? For years my life has been centered around them, how do I adjust to a new lifestyle? Most importantly, how on earth do I live with myself for leaving them? ",31Jan2019,1
184,"I think I might be asking for too much by posting here, but I need some glimmer of hope, some realism talked into me.

I'm 21 and a high school ""dropout"", no job either. I don't live in the US but the country below, so things are a bit different here. I technically coursed all of high school (three years) but last semester a deeper depression struck me, I skipped around a month, and when I came back I had to beg my teachers to give me a second chance - many teachers seriously saved my ass, but I expended all of my chances on one class and failed the last makeup exam, so I never received a diploma because of one subject. A teacher told me that everybody gets ""depressed"" like after a break up or because their parents divorced. I always had issues in HS, I've had issues in school since middle school. I had terrible socializing skills and never found my niche so I'd skip a lot, on top of not being able to pay attention. This was almost two years ago.

Anyway... I won't get into specifics about my mental health and academic history. I was diagnosed BPD last year after a messy pseudo-relationship, but in my opinion it doesn't fall into the ""histrionic"" or ""narcissistic"" subtype; I'm reserved and withdrawn, insecure, sometimes I even doubt the diagnosis but I can't deny a severe depression that has cast a shadow over my entire life since puberty.

My mother constantly makes a bad example out of me to my three younger sisters. *""You don't want to become like her, the failure, the one who sucked at school, the one who doesn't have a job, the one who should have graduated at 18 but is lazing around like a bum at 21.""* I'm deeply ashamed of what I've become. My ex-classmates don't remember me and think I'm a loser anyway, because I always had trouble passing my classes, 0 friends. My family does too, technically. I love them, but at times like this I just feel so hurt. They think I'm nothing. I get along with my sisters but I can tell they think poorly of me. My mother scapegoats me. I know she has given me everything, hence why I clean around the house and do favors for her, because I hate sitting around doing nothing and being a leech. But it's too much. I'm constantly yelled at and berated, humiliated, painted as the worst of the worst. Even when I was younger and chubbier she would tell them not to eat too much or they'd end up like me. She does not understand my mental health issues and suicidal feelings, in fact, she ridicules them, and says the nastiest shit, you have no idea. I don't want to victimize myself anymore. I've sat around long enough and now I just don't know how to make up for all of this lost time. 

I am writing this after another episode of her yelling at me because I'm incompetent and useless. 

I don't want to be like that anymore.

I want to be somebody. Something. I want to prove that I'm not nothing, and then leave. I want to take after myself once and for all. Do my own shit. Go someplace far away. Meet people who don't look down on me. I don't want to be looked down on anymore, and I know existing as a human isn't enough to deserve this... I know I have to do shit. I try to be a kind person, I try to defend them from my mother, I try to talk sense into her, I'm the family mediator but I get all of the backlash. I'm unassuming. But it's not enough anymore.

**So please. How. Do. I. Un-become. How do I transcend my failures? How do I get a job? How do I finish school? Get into university? How do I focus? Have goals? How do I build confidence in myself? How do I become someone that others won't look down on?**

185,"Been working with this girl for about 7 months but just recently (about a month ago) realized we get along really well and have similar outlooks on a lot of things.

I feel like I’ve made it pretty clear I’m crushing on her (asking her for her weekend plans, trying to set things up, minor flirting on Snapchat and text) but it seems like she’s holding the fishing line just out of reach of me. 

Recently we had a work party that we spent the entire time together at and she was very touchy and flirty so I figured she was interested in me. We hung out in her hotel room for 2 hours talking and listening to music after the party. We didn’t kiss that night but I felt like that would’ve been a lot for it being the first time outside of work we’ve spent time together.

Since then she will leave my snaps on delivered for HOURS at a time and continue to be on other social media’s and post on her story. But at work all seems fine. Just a very on and off interest is what it seems like.

Maybe I’m over analyzing the situation and letting my crush on her cloud my thoughts as to what she might be doing?

I know this is going to be swept away into the sea of asks, but I truly ask for someone, anyone, to just... clarify if what I'm feeling is wrong. Because I don't know anymore.   
This past week has been a whirlwind of emotions and new information and I just feel so... overwhelmed. And scared. It's like I don't know myself anymore, and it's like I never did at the same time.   
I was talking to my friend the other day about the pool, and why I haven't swum with them in years (we live in Florida, so swimming is pretty frequent) and I told her I felt uncomfortable in a swimsuit, that it would probably pass with time, and that I just needed a little more time. She kind of pushed a little further and I ended up telling her that I just don't see myself in the mirror. It would pass. It would be fine. She asked me if I was dissociating, and after doing some research I can safely say that I am.   
I've had body dysmorphia for a long time. Years. But looking back, I've never really hated my body, per se. I've hated that I had this body, more so. I've just felt... disconnected, y'know? Like I'll look in a mirror and I'll *know* it's me, but even still I don't see myself. I see someone else. It's me, but not.   
I hate being called she. I hate my name, I hate my face, I hate that I need to wear shirts that are showy. I hate this body. I hate myself.   
I thought I was happy. I really did. After attempting suicide in 2016, I really thought that things were looking up, finally. And they are. My life is... okay, right now. But I'm not. I'm not okay. I can't take this anymore, and I've been pushing it down for so long. It hurts. Everything hurts. Looking at myself hurts. Drawing myself as a *girl* hurts. Suppressing everything fucking *hurts.* and I can't take it anymore.   
I'm scared. I'm really, really fucking scared. And I need clarity. Please, someone, anyone, just tell me that what I'm feeling is normal. Does it pass? Does it go away? Is there any way to make it go away? Because I don't know if I can take much more of this. Is it normal for me to feel so numb, and at the same time feel so much pain?

189,"So, I have been sexually active for almost two years now and the only time I actually wanted it was the first time, every time since then I’ve just been pressured into it.

190,"I’m a freshman in college and just signed a 12 month lease for an apartment with my three friends (all girls, I’m a guy). This is no problem for us—I’ve had female friends for my entire life and was raised by women. Plus, I am extremely close with them and we’re very open to one another. 

The problem is: I think I love my absolute best friend. But she’s part of my close friend group. The BIGGER problem is that she is one of my future roommates. I am very particular and slow to date because I connect very deeply with few people and it’s hard to find someone that I share things in common with and that I can completely open up to. 

We really really really get along, better than anyone I’ve ever met. We’re a duo that’s always together. When I’m with her, I always want to hug her and spend close time together. When we’re away, I imagine what it would be like if she were there. 

This feels so hard to turn away from, despite my better judgement. It is so special and unique to find someone that I feel this way towards. I always lean this way; I find it hard to feel romantically or initiate something without knowing someone very personally first. Is this something I need to grow away from? Am I just doing this because this person is familiar? 

The other thing is that there are a lot of attractive people to meet at college. I wasn’t originally attracted to my best friend, but have grown to love her as a person (which is so much more important) and now think she is physically beautiful as well. 

Should I stay away and look for someone outside of my friend group? Someone that I find traditionally attractive at first impression? I have a few love interests that seem promising but I’m awful at initiating anything because I find it hard to open up knowing that it’s unlikely for me to feel something without knowing them very personally first. There are lots of attractive people but it’s hard to turn away from such a close, intimate, personal connection with someone that I know could turn out to be something great.

I'm 20F and I'm in my second year of undergrad.
I stay in hostel about 2000 km from home.
I have a fairly good relationship with my parents .
I've always been an introvert and slow at making friends. But I'm glad to have a good circle of friends in my college by the end of my first year. 

One of my friends from my group has confessed he has always had feelings for me. He's a really nice guy and I feel comfortable around him. I've never dated before and I've always told my parents everything. But they(parents) are really not for me dating. They want me finish my education and get a job and then marry when I'm ready for it.

It's weird because he keeps telling me that he likes me lot and not in a creepy, forceful manner or anything. And in the last few weeks, I've even started to like the idea of getting together with him. I haven't answered him properly yet)

What do I do?

I've never dated and I'm not sure what to do.
I want to date but I'm sure my parents wouldn't like it. And I don't want to hide it from them either.

# also it's not like we distract one another from studies/goals. We've been doing our college work as well.

Please advise. I'm confused.

And yeah, I live in India, where dating isn't very common thing to discuss at the dinner table. :/

**I'm Asian, I tend to cook with meals that have strong smells, but sometimes only, and there is only 1 person who cannot stands it. This person told me he doesn't like it. I understood and refrained myself from cooking it.**

However, he even complained to the landlord about me, **and the landlord's wife** for cooking meals with strong-smells. The wife told me not to worry. She said everyone has to adapt / accept it because each person has his/her own choice of cooking and we are all living in 1 small community. All 9 people must respect each other culture. 

**Once again, she (the wife) is complained too; and every other members of the house have no problems about this. If every single one of them hates it, I will stop it immediately!** Only this person hates it among the 9.

I thought he understood it after he talked to the wife. So I didn't think much. I think he can accept it peacefully!

Until one day, he opens every single door to get rid of the smell.

I get it. This action is reasonable. But he opens it then goes inside his room. There's no one in the livingroom/kitchen when the door is open. Someone may break in. It's extremely dangerous! I have a huge problem with anxitey and I was afraid that I may get robbed in the house.

I ask him and suggest that he should tell me so I can open the door and guard it myself. And he starts to threaten me saying he doesn't care. He has the advantage of being a tall big man and starts walking towards me saying 'so what', 'i don't care', etc...

I have never experienced this situation. If I talked more, he would use violence, he even was about to. I was able to step back and apologized to him. The landlord has been out of town (for 2 weeks) for 2 days. 

Should I call them? Should I inform them that I'm afraid about my own safety? I will have to call them! BUT if I call them, they will complain to this guy, and I'm risking it as well. Who knows what may happen?

199,"So I suffered a very bad sprain a few months back and it's been healing slowly. My short term disability switched over to long term last month and it's been hell ever since. The last two visits to my ortho doctor have been very stressful because after about 5 minutes of me explaining and demonstrating my stiffness and limited range of motion he says okay and schedules to see me in several weeks. However his notes are always the same: ""I want patient to stop wearing wrap and sling.""

Mind you I've made him aware that the back and inner part of my ankle stiffens up when I walk on my crutches (I went from two to using only one crutch) barefooted. But I still have sharp pain(not discomfort, pain) near/on the inner bone of my ankle whenever I try to put more weight on it. He took more X-rays and says he doesn't see anything that'll need operating on, and writes and sends the same notes to the insurance. I had called his nurse a week before my latest appt. and explained that I tried it his way without the brace, but I did leave it wrapped and I wore my mom's ankle boots for support and went to the mall with my family to walk around leaning on them for support and taking breaks as needed, but I walked (if you can call it walking, it was very trying and still painful) but I tried to ignore it though it was hard to. When I got home I took off the wrap and boots and tried to do some of my foot and ankle stretches/exercises and my ankle felt very stiff(mind you I just spent at least two hours at the mall walking) I wake up the next morning and I grab my crutch to go to the bathroom and as soon as my foot touches the floor (hardwood) I can tell something is wrong! It feels like the first day when I sprained my foot, it's very tender when I take steps and my foot will barely rise off the floor (I still can not set my foot in an upward 90°angle. My ankle is to this day still very stiff making walking almost impossible, I walk with a limp I have very low range of motion, ankle does not move fluidly at all.) I had to use both my crutches to make it to the bathroom. 

The nurse made a note of it and flash forward to my appt. date, and he examines my foot and ankle I once again explain/demonstrate my symptoms and lack of motion and he notes to himself outloud that my foot is swollen and he diagnosed me with lymphedema and recommends me to a specialist. 

Now I get a call from my disability case specialist and he informs me that the notes that the orthopedic has sent them has no mention of this diagnosis,  they do contain my statements I made to him ""Patient complains of, lack of mobility, tenderness, etc. But his notes remain the same ""I want patient to stop use of sling."" 

And he's also not filling out my ""Work Restrictions"" pages despite diagnosing me with lymphedema and the appt. with the lymphedema specialist being weeks away. I've talked to his nurse twice this week and today got back with: ""He says to release you without restrictions."" 

I ask her how can he release with no restrictions if he diagnosed me and sending me to a lymphedema specialist? 


She quickly states that, ""Just because your going to therapy doesn't mean you can't work."" 

I'm internally losing it but keep my composure, staying polite as possible but keep my voice firm. ""I can not return to work unless I am 100%"" 

Note: I have repeatedly told the Dr. this during every visit. And made him aware the type of work I do since the first visit I've told him. (I work with individuals with disabilities wheelchairs, hoyer lifts, etc. and it is unsafe for me and the clients and if I were to return to work in this condition and that is why my employer will not allow me to work period if I'm still in physical therapy of any kind, it's a liability to my job.) 

I relay to the nurse that because of the swelling in my foot that I can't even put on a regular tennis shoe (which are required footwear for my job). 


She proceeds to tell me that it is no longer his (the doctor's) job to write out my restrictions that would be left up to the lymphedema specialist. 

Keeping my voice firm that the seriousness of the situation is apparent I continue on to explain that since my job will not allow me to return, the disability is all the income that I have and depend on and if the Dr. does not write out my restrictions or condition that my claim will be dismissed next week Monday and I can not receive treatment if I can not afford to pay for it and therefore will never be able to get back to my job. 

Through out my statement she's saying repeatedly, ""Okay, I'll let him know."" I guess in an attempt to rush me off the phone and quickly hangs up on me without saying goodbye (not a big deal but thought worth mentioning.) I'm expecting to hear back from them tomorrow. 

This whole situation has been stressful and it really shouldn't be, I should be focusing on healing and getting back to my job but instead too busy being stressed out. 

Please let me know what options are? I don't live in a big city so there aren't really any orthopedic doctors where I live.

202,"Hi. I'm a student studying abroad, and I have a problem that regarding me with my housemate (just 1 person living in the same house as I am; I'm renting a room in this house). There are 9 people in my house. 9 not-related people, there are couples too among those 9.

**I'm Asian, I tend to cook with meals that have strong smells, but sometimes only, and there is only 1 person who cannot stands it. This person told me he doesn't like it. I understood and refrained myself from cooking it.**

However, he even complained to the landlord about me, **and the landlord's wife** for cooking meals with strong-smells. The wife told me not to worry. She said everyone has to adapt / accept it because each person has his/her own choice of cooking and we are all living in 1 small community. All 9 people must respect each other culture. 

**Once again, she (the wife) is complained too; and every other members of the house have no problems about this. If every single one of them hates it, I will stop it immediately!** Only this person hates it among the 9.

I thought he understood it after he talked to the wife. So I didn't think much. I think he can accept it peacefully!

Until one day, he opens every single door to get rid of the smell.

I get it. This action is reasonable. But he opens it then goes inside his room. There's no one in the livingroom/kitchen when the door is open. Someone may break in. It's extremely dangerous! I have a huge problem with anxitey and I was afraid that I may get robbed in the house.

I ask him and suggest that he should tell me so I can open the door and guard it myself. And he starts to threaten me saying he doesn't care. He has the advantage of being a tall big man and starts walking towards me saying 'so what', 'i don't care', etc...

I have never experienced this situation. If I talked more, he would use violence, he even was about to. I was able to step back and apologized to him. The landlord has been out of town (for 2 weeks) for 2 days. 

Should I call them? Should I inform them that I'm afraid about my own safety? I will have to call them! BUT if I call them, they will complain to this guy, and I'm risking it as well. Who knows what may happen?

NOW: I know for sure I will have to stop cooking these kind of meals. Until the problem is resolved.

***In short: I cook strong-smelled meals. Everyone has no problem except 1 person. He threaten me for it.***

My apology for mixing up past tense and present tense of the grammar. 

And the problem may not be that big but my anxiety stresses me out really much. ",31Jan2019,1
203,"I live in an apartment complex in North Texas in a nice area in a big city. My building was built in the 30s and so did not come with central air/ heat so the complex put in these LG smart dual inverter wall units.
Last Tuesday, Jan 22nd, i woke up to it being 58 degrees in my apartment. Both wall units flashing between heat and cool lights, which I now know is an error code.
The days that followed were spent calling and calling to varying degrees of response. There were quite a few days were no one came at all. On the days someone did come, they would just reset it but the same problem would happen overnight. They finally got a ""professional"" out here on Tuesday night who spent 2 hours just reprogramming the remotes even though I told him that wasn't the problem. I stayed home from work Wednesday for half a day just to make sure someone paid attention and knew that I was done  getting fucked around. They brought another guy out who seemed a lot more knowledgeable and was able to at least describe my situation back to me but he disappeared without anything being fixed or updating me. 
I'm so tired. I work a lot and my work takes a lot of mental and physical effort. I'm also tired of being cold. I'm so exhausted that i can't figure out what to do from here, what my next steps should be. Please help. Any advice is welcomed. ",31Jan2019,1
204,"Okay, so for a bit of background to this long tale, me and my best friend (we’ll call her A) have been best friends for at least eight years. We’re both just over 18, so most of our childhood was spent being close friends. We’re like opposites, yet we always got along. I was/am the more emotional, outgoing person and she’s always been the more logical, introvert of us two. 

Well, we both attended this class our senior year that took up an entire half of our school day— a training class like college almost. Our teacher (we’ll call him B) was a guy, kind of a dork who was interested in things like Harry Potter and was overall a cool guy. I personally thought he was one of the cooler teachers we’ve had given I’m a huge Harry Potter fan and this class was full of them, so I wouldn’t get berated for being an oddball. My friend, who was also a minor at the time, suddenly developed a crush on this guy who’s in his late twenties. Since she’s always been the emotionless one out of the two, I’m guessing these new emotions were automatically very intense for her, so she changed every aspect of her life for this guy. She got a dog that’s the same breed as one of B’s dogs, changed her college to be an online course of the school B went to, and suddenly started reading Harry Potter (which was annoying given that I tried to get her to read the series throughout the entirety of our friendship and she hated it, yet her excuse for suddenly liking it is that she’s “matured.”)

Well, around that time, or it could’ve been going on beforehand but I just noticed it really then, she started being more self-centered, not giving equally in our friendship. Where I was always asking how she was, offering to come help her with stuff, or distract her if she’s upset— she was ignoring me, giving dull responses and changing the topic to herself, and canceling on me at the last minute. A few examples of this would be the time my grandmother died around middle of last year, it was sudden, so I had to cancel plans we had that day. A said “Aww, I’m sorry” and then ignored me for days afterwards until I messaged her again. She knew my grandma, knew how much of a huge part of my life that my grandmother was, yet never once asked if I was okay, never offered to come distract me or even come to the funeral. In fact, weeks later, she told me how she wouldn’t care if her grandparents died because they weren’t close. And when my cat— whom I’d grown up with— died shortly after, I begged her to come get me from my house, to distract me, to do something. And she came up with some tale that she couldn’t because one of her parents had her car, when the three people in that house have five working cars. 

When her dog died, I offered to come visit, to take her out somewhere to distract her, to stay up texting her or calling her. To do whatever she wanted to feel better. I wanted to make her feel better, to not let her drown herself in her sadness. 

During our Senior Year, we had to ride the bus to this class that B taught, given that the school was in a separate city. A has her license, I do not. A rode with me for the beginning of the school year, but shortly began driving herself to the school— which was allowed. When kids began bullying me, throwing stuff at me on the bus, I asked her to let me carpool with her to the school and she came up with some BS that we would get in trouble, which wouldn’t happen. Even when I came into class crying (which I almost never cry in front of people) because these kids were throwing pennies at me, she did nothing. It wasn’t until the last few weeks of the school year that she let me ride with her, when the whole incident had already been taken care of. 

I didn’t quite realize until just recently, when things between her and B got more serious after a year of her crushing on him how awful she’d been to me. I don’t know if she’d always been this way or if this crush suddenly brought it about, but it hurts me to talk to her knowing I put more into the friendship than she gives back. I’m leaving in two months for the military, so I’m conflicted on how to handle talking to her. Her parents want to come to my BMT graduation and I’d love for them to, seeing as I love her family like my own, but I don’t know if I can spend these next two months trying to act like everything’s okay. I feel like if I confront her, she’ll refuse to see my point and instead think she’s in the right (as that’s what she always does when she has any sort of problem.) I’m also worried about completely ruining the friendship, as I do care about my best friend, and if something with her and B happens, I want to be there to keep her safe. But, I just don’t know what to do. 

Should I keep pretending like everything’s okay or should I say something to her? Am I overreacting/overthinking things?

TL:DR: I just noticed my best friend of 8+ years hasn’t been contributing equally in our friendship— such as ignoring me when my grandmother died or allowing kids to bully me during our Senior Year of HS. I leave in two months for BMT and don’t know whether to confront her or allow this to continue, as I’m worried she’ll not see my point if I confront her yet I don’t think I can continue dealing with this any longer, even though I love her family like my own and care about her a great deal.",31Jan2019,1

208,"My best friend graduated college and moved out of the dorms. And in his old room is a new guy that was pretty friendly. We vibed a bit and started hanging out. He (early on) mentions that he thinks I'm ""easy on the eyes"". I reply that I am in a relationship with someone. He said he respects that. I think okay as long as he does we can still be friends. Due to some very cold weather we have had some snow days, so we have hung out quite a bit. 

Today he was a lot more playful, it started as poking my arm and trying to annoy me when watching a movie. Then at one point he tries to sit on the arm of the chair, and I pushed him off in a playful way and then he wrestled me to the ground (not pain causing, playfully)

In retrospect this is super red flag raising but he mentioned before that he didn't have many friends and I struggled with that a lot growing up. His playing was very similar to how I interacted with some friends before. 

Just after leaving to go to bed he texted me ""is it bad that I want to cuddle you"" I replied it was.

211," 

Any time I am having a particularly bad day I have this moment where I will 'hide' from the world and go home and to my bed. I do not communicate well with employers and professors at school about my mental state and a common defense of mine is to just hide and hope it all goes away. This has been a problem of mine since getting diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, about 5 years ago. I used to struggle with this much much more but I have been actively trying to combat my unhealthy habits and have generally been able to keep up with my responsibilities.

Today, I came to work (it is a federal work-study with my university) and worked until I had to leave for a class. I was supposed to return to work two hours later. Instead, I skipped my class, went home, and took a nap for the rest of the afternoon and evening. I did not email my boss that I was not coming back to work, even though I was scheduled to. Honestly, I don't feel like I chose to do this. My anxiety was getting the best of me (I was supposed to do a speech for a class today and it wasn't prepared) and so I reverted back to a pattern that felt 'safe'.

I have not disclosed my anxiety and depression to my employer, and I'm not even sure if I should but I want to know what the best way to go about this is. I plan on arriving early to work tomorrow and I assume she will be upset with me since I work in a small office and she really does not like last minute changes.

**TL;DR I did a no-call-no-show at work today since I was having an 'off' day, which I sometimes struggle with (I neglected my responsibilities and slept). I am very worried about what to say to my boss tomorrow and I am not sure if I should disclose my mental illness. What should I do?**",31Jan2019,1

I started out a little before I left trying to transition him to the dry food, and he loved the stuff!

But about six months ago, he stopped eating his dried food (at this time I had came back from the job). I did the responsible thing, and changed him back to his mealworms, but he wouldn’t eat those either. I then tried crickets, and still nothing. He became super hostile toward me, constantly smashing his head against the glass at me. I tried everything, holding him more, changing out his substrate, even giving him new decorations, but he still wouldn’t eat and hated me. 

It’s now six months after he stopped eating, and he is just scales and ribs. He won’t move at all, and I have to put him on his heating pad just to keep him comfortable.

217,"I (22F) was helping my mom (50) out today and was cleaning up her room. I went to put something into her bedside table drawer and stumbled upon some old baby books and pregnancy journals my mom had kept from when I was a baby. I flipped through a few and opened another journal. The first and only thing written in the journal was her thoughts and anxieties about life. Within the entry, she wrote how she and my dad have a great relationship, but she feels guilty for not being “enthusiastic” in bed because “she can’t get the memories out of her head”. She goes on to say she confronted her dad (my grandpa) about “the incident” which was a “big step”. At the end she says how she is proud of her sharing her story with others because she has helped them. The problem is, she doesn’t outright say what incident occurred.

Under the baby books, I found a book titled “surviving childhood sexual assault”, which pretty much summed up what I was thinking but I still can’t believe it. I don’t want to believe it. I have no idea where to go from here. Should I ask her about it? Should I just keep it to myself because of how I pretty much snooped to find out?

218,"tldr; our grandma lives with us but causes lots of damage in our family and doesnt want to move to another house or to retirement house. What to do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Long story... our grandma lives with usfor over 10 years now and there are issues for around 5-6 years. Its like a infected teeth. She causes a lot of problems, stress and pain. My father started drinking because her shits.

&amp;#x200B;

The main problems: She leaves the light, water taps, once even the oven ON. She costs a lot of money and we are not the richest family, not that poor as well, but we can well this kind of waste. Especially the oven that can screw up more thing than just the bills. She likes to ""air"" the house opening up windows, even in winter increasing the bill even more.

&amp;#x200B;

So about 4-5 years ago we told her and talked her about this and asked her kindly and there comes the problem. She think we hate her and we just want her to die??? we told her thats  not true we just want to keep our money in our pocket and anyways we dont want to damage our home by flooding it or set it on fire. She went total mad and literally hates us and she not even saying a word to my father. (shes my mothers mother but my mothers knows the isseus and well and she gets stressed even more than my father)

&amp;#x200B;

Other things: she is lying, literally always and doesnt admit anything even tho i captured it on camera ( she doesnt even know what is camera), she is really mean and says to this day we are the ""special ones"" and we just want to fuck with her because we doesnt have anything else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The next big problem is that my father started drinking 1-2 years ago because of all these stress and now i feel like i lose him as well. Im totally angry at my grandma at this point and just want her to die already (shes 87 so already having a lot of health issues and pain and its hard to watch and she doesnt want to go to the hospital, she never been to hospital for the 10 years yet she can barely walk) that would be the best for everyone, just all our problem would be solved really. She doesnt like us and at this point i we dont liek her neither. Its just so annoying i wake up to her noise at 5am before work already full stressed out. I feel im more stressed as well and just my overall comfort feeling went into an angry-stressed out, depressive mood. 

We asked her to move into an retirement house where they take care of old people or we have a house that we lend to get some money and we told her she could live there. So she has plenty of choices but she said no and went totaly mad again.

&amp;#x200B;

Im so hopeless im already planning for long term and now since i started to work for 2 years now im planning to move to an apartment but that will just leave my family in the shit.

She tells me that money is tight and that she told her husband she would only spend X amount. 
I want to be able to go out together with out it being a constant problem. I actually have yelled at her before because she was pushing so hard to pay, for NO REASON. I told her,  we are not dating. She has no obligation to pay for me, I have a good job and make good money and I dont have the same financial responsibilities and restraints as her and that I should be the one paying for her.

225,"I'm 19 years old and in college. Despite being decent looking and having good social skills (at least in platonic situations) I am really struggling with women. Two weeks ago I was in Calculus with my crush (Let's call her Cindy) and we both turned in our tests at the same time. As we were walking out she told me that she would be out of town for the next two classes and needed some notes. I gave her my number and we set up a study session for the upcoming test. I went over to her dorm and it was clear that she was interested in more than Calculus. Mostly we talked for about two hours about our activities, who we hung out with, gossip, and life at college. We connected pretty well and I was feeling confident so I asked her if she wanted to grab sushi with me sometime next week. She said that she'd love to. Friday rolls around and a bunch of her suitemates showed up at my dorm drunk. They wanted to meet me because Cindy was talking about me. I end up going over to their suite and taking a couple shots. We play some card games and then it escalates into playing Never Have I Ever and eventually Truth or Dare. During this, I realize that Cindy is the most experienced out of the six girls and I'm the least experienced out of everyone. I'm eventually asked about who I liked out of everyone and I confess that I had a crush on Cindy. She reacts positively and the night winds down. Everybody separates and I end up in Cindy's dorm. She tells me that she also has feelings for me and talks about her past relationships. She seems a little uncomfortable with me being so inexperienced but claims that it's ok. We talk for an hour or two before we decide to call it a night. As I'm about to leave she hugs me as I'm reaching for my keys which results in this awkward goodbye hug. Today I hung out with her again and she told me that I'm cool and likable, but to not expect anything romantic. I really had feelings for her and I was certain that she did too. Looking back on the whole situation I'm pretty convinced that she rejected me because she felt that we were sexually incompatible. If I had more experience I would have gone for the kiss or at the very least been able to respond to her flirting/ sexual jokes in a way that wasn't awkward laughter. Even though I hang out with a lot of women as friends I'm really out of my element when it comes to anything romantic. Not only am I a virgin, I haven't even had a first kiss. I am not getting any younger and my lack of experience is becoming more and more of a burden both socially and romantically, but my romantic relationships fail because of lack of experience. What should I do?

226,"This happened a couple days ago but a little back story...I was on tinder a couple weeks ago not really expecting to match with anyone but then basically right away I match with this girl who by looking at her pictures looked very cute so of course I engage a conversation and we continue talking and getting to know each other through out the night and in the following days everything seems to be going fine including making plans to meet each other...but a couple days ago she tells me that she found out that she's pregnant from a previous relationship so of courses I'm pissed and cursing my bad luck.. because she has no kids and I liked that about her and now this!...so anyways I told her that we should continue talking and see what happens but at the same time I don't know if I want to continue this I don't know if I wanna be with someone that's pregnant...but I also think what if I do stay with her (she's coming over this weekend and I hinted that I'ma ask her to be my girl) but I really don't know yet...if I do wouldn't it be a romantic story also?

227,"So I booked at a bed and breakfast for the weekend directly after Valentine's day because the price was waaaaay better than anything in town. My dumb self booked before really looking into the place though and now as I try to look I find next to nothing on it online. No reviews or proof anyone has even stayed there before and it seems to be a private house. So should I eat the cancellation fee (basically no refund on the price at all) and pay for a new place to stay or is this just a common new B&amp;B and I'm reading too much into it being new?

228,"Okay so, me and this girl are talking, we had a class together and we talked a bunch during that time, and after the trimester we switched to talking on Snapchat. We talked more on there and we even flirted a bit, but after a while she wouldn't talk as much or just send pictures with no captions. I tried complimenting her without being outright creepy, but after a few times she stopped flirting back. So after a while I asked her if she was deflecting my compliments, because I just wanted things  to be clear (I didn't want to flirt with her one sided, but I would like to know if she doesn't feel the same way back, and that would be fine. I just wanna know.) she asked what I meant and I elaborated. And so she said that if we saw each other more there would be more of a chance, she was apologizing and I told her she was fine, her feelings are her own, I can't change that. So, I set myself to hang out/talk to her more. But since that day I feel like things have become awkward between us, and I tried my hardest not to make it that way. I do have ways to talk to her more and I plan on doing that but I don't know how I could easily transition into having a conversation without making it immediately awkward, even on snap it's a little hard to now.

234,"I'm 18 years old, this is my first year of college and I have a lot of goals, which my mother doesn't agree with. I'm currently attending a 2 year school  for general ed courses to save my parents some money. The other day I mentioned wanting apply to the school I've dreamed of attending since our move to Georgia (it's public) and talked my mom a little about it . I STRESSED that I don't by any means expect her/my dad to pay for it. She was insanely upset, calling me entitled and badgering me as to why other schools aren't good enough. Honestly, I'd enjoy most schools in the state, I just happen to be attracted to one more than the other. The science program is epic and it's just an amazing school. I had this whole plan which entailed continuing to apply to scholarships, enrolling Spring 2020  and working to lower the cost. She didn't care..My mother also isn't happy with the fact that I want to become a doctor, as she doesn't care doctors and the programs are too expensive( I mean sure, but it'd be worth it)  She thinks a nursing degree is more practical than a biology degree( eh okay, it costs the same really and I'd still go to graduate school). My dad on the other hand is a ""you go girl!"" type of person, as he wishes he pursued his dreams at my age. Which definitely helps me feel less discouraged, but it's pretty tough when your mother tears down everything you hope to do or interprets your dreams as ""ego strokes"" for yourself. When I decide on anything that is remotely pleasing to her she'd say ""I knew you were going to do that"",  or ""good I like..."" I wish I could have ideas and claim them as my own. Literally everything seems to become about her and I hate that she calls me selfish because nothing has ever really been about me. I've compromised a lot in relationships, friendships, with my family and with life itself, which fine but I just want one thing to myself--my future. I want to plan a goal and accomplish it, no settling for anything less than that. I'm not saying if I can't find enough funds to go to my dream  undergrad school I'd still go, by any means. I mean I'm not going to give up on anything just because the path is rocky or the route is unclear.I want to atleast try before calling it dead. The negativity I've heard from my mom is so hurtful sometimes.  ""You shouldn't try out, you're way too uncoordinated""(I made it btw), ""I don't think you should major in science, you're not good at it, your friend is though, she's brilliant"", ""are you sure you can handle..."", ""I prayed you wouldn't get this"". Anytime I want to explain anything (about my day, my plans, social life) to her I'd get three words out and she'll literally badger me with ""Mmhmm I had this friend..."" ""You need to do..."". Then when she's done misunderstanding the entire subject for 20 minutes, she stops listening and does something else, so she goes about her day thinking I said something I never said.

237,"A little backstory:

I'm currently 17 and in High School and I have awful social anxiety (can't even look at my own parents/siblings eyes when I talk to them because it makes me uncomfortable). On top of this, I absolutely hate school, and this brings me to my problem, because I hate school and I have social anxiety, college seems more like a nightmare than the great life experience many people make it out to be. With this, I realized I had to do something in order to avoid going to college, and I've always been passionate about politics and my parents often talk about how smart I am about politics, so I decided to start a blog. My hope is that by the time I graduate I could be making at least a decent amount of money each month, that way maybe my parents would give me a few more months at home to see if I could turn it into something I can live off, I realize this kind of farfetched, turning a blog into a full-time income in a year and a half, but it's really all I have.

When I first decided to start the blog, I had it up and running and a full blog post written within 24 hours, and then...I let it sit about 2 weeks, then I wrote two blog posts within 2 days. I've always had this problem where I get really interested and motivated in doing something then I just kind of fizzle out and stop doing it. 

I guess I need advice as to how I can get past this and get it through to myself that I need to sit down every day after school if I want a shot of skipping college.

240,"I’m turning 23 this year and should have graduated college in May of 2018. When I was a junior, my parents revealed that they had no money and had been lying to me about our financial situation. They had told me they were paying out of pocket for my tuition but had accrued about $100,000 (not including interest) in college loans. So, I was left to pay my tuition by myself. College in America is notoriously expensive and I didn’t want to put myself into more debt, so I considered my options and decided to transfer to a school in my mom’s home country to finish my degree. I had very little money and was super stressed from my family’s home life falling apart, so I moved to said country by myself in February 2017.

I have been living here since then and have been working part time jobs to save as much money as I can for school and wait for my dad to find work so he can pay my tuition and debts (this is what he told me he was doing). Two years have passed and my parents marriage has fallen apart, my mother revealed more debt they had acquired, and I have saved about two semesters worth of tuition. At first, I didn’t apply to transfer yet because I had no money and as time went on, my friends all graduated and started working jobs and I started feeling depressed because I wasn’t where I thought I’d be. I spiraled and was feeling so hopeless and terrible and finally pulled myself out of it, only to find out that the school I’m trying to go to opens their transfer application once a year, in December. I missed the deadline by a few weeks.

I hate myself for not looking into further, for not saving more money when I was still in school, and my whole situation in general. At this rate, the earliest I can go back to school is March 2020 and when I graduate I will be 25 years old. I don’t judge anyone or think lesser of them for taking a break in between and graduating “late,” but I can’t stop hating myself for not being on the path I thought I was going to be on. I feel like a made a ton of mistakes and will look back and think I wasted 3 years of my life in a country I wasn’t born in. I’m so anxious that I’m even thinking maybe I won’t get accepted when I apply, because there was too much time where I wasn’t in school or when I ask an old professor for a recommendation, they won’t reply or they’ll say no or not remember me. I’m worried that if I apply and get rejected, I’ll have to spend my entire life doing part time work and never get a “real” job. I don’t have enough money to move back to my home country, and I don’t speak the language well enough here nor will anyone hire a foreigner who doesn’t have a degree. I know I could apply to other schools, but I feel like my parents will be disappointed in me and I’ll be disappointed in me if I don’t go to this particular school.

243,"I need to vent and I need someone to listen to my story. To understand my why I feel the way I feel, your probably gonna have to learn about my life so far. Now my life hasn't been as bad as most, I mean some people's lives have been so shitty and it kind of makes me think that I shouldn't care about my problems, but I shouldn't do that. I have problems and that has to mean something. My main problem is my dad. He's bipolar and a narcissist and lives in a fantasy, which is not a good mix. He's just the biggest dick that I know. And what makes it worse is the fact that he does everything he can to break my mom until she doesn't feel like she is worth anything. They're divorced and they both have joint custody of me and my younger brother. I've never had the best relationship with my dad but my brother is one of the lucky few who actually respects him. My dad was never really there for me growing up. And when he was, he wouldn't really treat me like I was his son. What makes things worse is he would treat my cousin like she's his daughter. I mean how does he not treat me as his child but can treat someone who's not his child as someone who's part of the family! This ended up giving me a bit of an inferiority complex. Not to mention I'm short which doesn't help when everyone else is just too tall. I guess my dad's always been an asshole but what I think drove him over the edge is when my younger brother died at birth. I was four when my younger brother died at birth. That just set sail to a depression that made my dad just sleep all the time and never keep a job for longer than a year. I'm not going to act like I don't understand why he is the way he is. He lost a fucking child for god's sake.  I think it was a year later that my other brother was born. The good news was that he was a nice healthy boy. And I'm so glad that he was able to be born. I think he was a lot better of a father to my younger brother because I don't know why he still can stand him. Maybe it's child innocents. I don't really know. Even before my younger brothers death, my dad when he was there, even just for a moment, he was a dick. He was rarely ever nice to me and he was a dick to my mother. It was a nice day when my mom divorced him.  My mom, unlike my dad, was there for me. She was the parent that took care of me in my youth and was one of the only lights in my childhood, and even now. I am only pissed with my mom over one thing, and that is the fact that she took so long to divorce him. Fifteen years she had to deal with him. He spent most of our money on stupid stuff and he wasn't financially stable. My dad is not that emotionally stable either, being bipolar and all.  That explained a lot when he had to go to a mental hospital for a week when my mom told my dad she wanted a divorce. When my dad was a little bit better, he was able to get a new job and moved into a nice mobile home. I don't understand why he was given joint custody. I hated my dad, but I also felt pity for him. He was definitely suicidal and though I hated my dad, I didn't want to lose him. So I was nice. I put on a mask and put my feelings towards him deep down where I was even fooling myself. And eventually, I got good at that. But soon my hatred started to grow and grow when I learned how he treated my mom. He would try and do everything he could to make my mom feel like trash. And it hurt. Seeing the woman who had given me so much, be put in such a low state. And it's been three years and it's still the same. I try to be there for my mom, but being in a position where you can't do anything is a really shitty thing. That mask is still on to this day, but my hatred left a few holes in that mask. It's really hard for me to show my hatred but it sometimes shows. But it's not enough. I can't do anything because if I do my mom gets the yelling at. He tries to act like he was the perfect father and if anything goes away from his perfect fantasy then it's my mom's fault. It's mentally taxing to watch this. It's mentally taxing to do nothing. And what can I do? I need to do something. But again, what can I do? I need help. Just something to do. Is it possible for my mom to get sole custody of me and my brother? Can I get sole custody for my mom? What can I do? Please... I need help. Thank you for whoever read this far. ",31Jan2019,1
244,"I recently moved back into my mothers house after a couple years of traveling until I can find some work. Everything was fine at first. We got along well. We talked to each other. She made it clear to me that when I got back I could stay with her for a little while. I didn't foresee that anything could possibly go wrong. 

I knew she was seeing this guy that she met when she was visiting her brother at a sober house. Apparently he had gotten kicked out for drinking. Off the bat I had a weird feeling about it.

Come to find out, he had been staying with my mom trying to ""recover"" from his addiction. (I was staying at a friends for the first week I was back.) 

So I roll over to her place, this dude is sitting on the floor just all fucked, slurring, basically slobbering on himself. I'm like, fuck man, this must be my moms new boyfriend. Called my mom up, she was pissed. Apparently the only condition of him staying here was that he doesn't drink.

 Warm bed, free food, free wifi. Beats sleeping on the streets. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, he's unemployed. 

This fucking guy only went a week before he started begging to come back here. My mom's a good person, so she's like alright, bet, you can stay here- as long as you stay off the booze. 

Fast forward a few days, he's drunk again. He was hiding booze all over the place. Putting into soda bottles to conceal it. I knew he was drunk, but it really wasn't my problem I figured. He wasn't bothering me, he wouldn't say a word to me actually. Which is very strange because she lives in a studio apartment. There's virtually no privacy other than a few room dividers. It's a finished basement with a private entrance in the back. There's a really nice family upstairs, wonderful people by the way, and this bum who my mom has known for a couple months is chillin' down here. 

I'm stressed. My mom is stressed. We got into an argument. She told me that she's not allowed to have guests. I'm like, cool, then why are there three people living down here. You might be already pushing it with me, but why risk a third? 

She kicks him out, AGAIN. During this period I actually spoke with the guy who owns the place, he knows I'm here. He's a chill dude, he understands my situation. He's helping me get a job and shit. Everything seems to be back to normal. 

About two weeks go by and one night, I was texting with my mom asking what time she would be back. She's says, ""I'm with Ryan, we'll be there soon."" 

At this point I'm just astounded. Whatever though, maybe it'll only be for tonight. 

I didn't want to be around this guy, so I went and stayed at a friends house for a few days. I come back, my mom is gone. Guess who's there? Oh and he brought a friend? The place is a mess. They kind of scurry out like they knew they shouldn't be doing what they're doing. The guy he was with was just the epitome of a piece of trash. Fitted cap. Baggy pants. Beard. Obviously a meth head. I held my shit together, I didn't want to make a scene as I do not want my mom to get kicked out. I actually prayed to the Inter Dimensional Masters? I don't know. I'm not religious. 

I'm just desperate for my mom to see the fucking light. This guy is toxic. He's no good. He's going to get you kicked out. 

She doesn't listen. In fact, she let's him stay. Apparently he told her about it before I had the chance. 

Because that makes it okay, right? At least he was honest. I'm sure that was the only time he betrayed your trust...

So for some reason that's beyond me, she was okay with him getting drunk here. Not only that, but she's going to join him! In all of my 23 years of life I have never seen my mom drink booze. I come home one night, and she's fucking wasted. She's obviously taken a couple of her OXY as well. I'm like YOU COULD DIE. She's all messed up, having a great time with this guy. He doesn't care that mixing opioids and alcohol could kill her, nah, he's chillin'. I'm too pissed to express my words. I don't want to assault this guy. I take some deep breaths, and I leave for the night. 

Next night I come back, nobody's home. All his stuff is still here, a TON of fucking beer in the fridge. By the way he drinks such shit beer. Natty Ice, Budweiser. Fucking disgusting. There's also some Laughing Lab and some Fat Tire. Not bad. I figure those were my mom's choices. She's civilized. 

I took all of the beer, poured it right down the sink. All of it. I wasn't trying to sit idly by while I let this dude turn my mother into an alcoholic. Looking back that was a little extreme, but hey, I care. They both come back at the same time. 

He's pissed, tries to even fight me at one point. He was really about to assault me over some beer. I'm sitting down on the couch, voicing my concerns. She's clearly not listening to me. I'm talking to a wall. She then asks me to leave...

At that point I really couldn't stay anywhere else. So I went for a long walk, when I return they're asleep. So I did as well. 

That was 5 days ago. After that day my mom stopped talking to me completely, she acts like I'm not even there. This fucking guy is still here. He's just been sitting on his all day for 5 days straight doing nothing but taking up space. Every time I leave and come back he's in the same position as when I left. All he does is eat all the food and watch movies on my my moms computer. He's obnoxious. It's crazy how you can be that way without speaking a word. 

There's no beer in the fridge anymore, but he still drinks discreetly. My mom came home drunk the other night. 

What should I do, if anything? Should I just leave? Leave it alone? What would you say to her?

246,"Hey guys, I'm a 30-year-old dude with lack of self-confidence needs your help, but let me inform you with a little bit of background about how it happened.

Well, I was about full confident when I was a teenager. Most of my childhood passed with observing people and their behaviours because it was fun to do. It comes with a great knowledge about their emotional reflexes and how to understand them wisely.

I was a popular guy on school, plays basketball, gets people's issues and solves them succesfully.

As a popular and sincere person, I had a lot of gf's and can't say I regret from it. Wish they were less and lasts longer but, meh, I made good friendships anyway.

So, this wonderful life goes until I reach to my 23rd year in life, I've met a girl who is shy and has a lack of confidency about anything. First, the relationship was nice and comfy. I teached her to how to talk people, how to achive her goals, how to believe herself in anything. I give a pc as a gift just because she feels much more comfort while talking with people online more than talking in real. So, to make her get used to talk with people I've done that.

We lived together and I put my effort on her to make her great again(lol). At this time I didn't realized a big problem reaching by.

After a couple of years, I mean, 4 years later, her lack of confidency makes her puts pressure on me and my social life. So decided to pull my connection back with most of my friends which most of them are females, would be nice until she regain her confidency somehow. And it worked! She starts to talk with people and achieve her goals one by one. And still, I encourage her for getting more, of course.

Some day, I realized, I Can't talk with people, I mean, I just couldn't. I couldn't start a conversation, I gain weight, doesn't wise or funny at all, like lost all of my energy. And I fell.

I fell like a meteor try to genocide dinosaurs in couple of years and I really don't know long I was like it and I really don't know how to achieve my skills again because it was a long period to gain it.

This summer we decided to end our relationship and I moved to another country. I have a big belly, feels older than before, -naturally-, and lack of confidency. It kills me, I can say that.

P.S: Reaching to women is very big deal for me not just because I lost my confidency, but also I look much younger than I am, it can be seen as an advantage but it's not. Because, just for looking same age women doesn't care about me anyways. And younger girls are, uhm, younger.

Oh, when I believe in myself and try to start a conversation, all the time the most stupid words comes out and embrace myself. I was a pretty good talker gosh darn it.

Or I’ll be talking and will just suddenly get in random fit of just anger and go on this war path too talk down to whoever I’m with at the time,

251,"So today I watched a short doco about Psychopaths and in it it was mentioned there a tests that you can take to determine whether you have psychopathic traits. I did a few tests online from various organisations and each confirmed I have considerably more psychopathic traits than normal. I think I scored higher than something like 90% of people who took the test. Basically I don't think I'm a psychopath. But the results are a bit alarming. It seems I have trouble specifically in empathy, caring about others, how my actions affect others etc. Is there anything I can do to change this as I would very much like to be more normal as I think it would be beneficial to me and in turn other people.",31Jan2019,1

I have chose to put this here because we are not dating, but friends.

She has a very, very big imagination with what our life will be like and I (being the pessimistic person I am) am wondering how to calm her down because we may leave each others paths (I move to another state on the other side of the country in June) and we may never talk some time into our lives.

254,"I live in an apartment building on the fifth floor. Today I came home and there was a man I didn't recognize at the bottom of the stairs next to my apartment, tying his shoe but seemed like he had just been standing there waiting. I didn't expect him to be there so out of reflex I said ""oh hi"" and he said hi. 

An hour or so later, while I was showering, my mom said a man rang our doorbell and was knocking on the door repeatedly. She asked him who he was or what he wanted but he wouldn't say anything, just kept standing there. Eventually he left. I asked her what he looked like and it matched the description of the man I saw earlier. 

Later I was talking to my cousin, who lives in the same building on another floor, and she said three men knocked on her door. When she asked them who they were or what they wanted they didn't answer, and eventually left.

I ended up calling it quits as it was cause him alot of heartache since he admitted to loving me but i didn't want a relationship nor did i want to ruin our friendship (ironically). Anyways, this week we went out and had a few beers together but i've been persistent to not go to his house as my will power is weak and sex with him is great. So, after our drinks he drops me off at my house as i had to finish an assignment for uni before 12am but i told him i'd call him after and then maybe we could go back out for more drinks. So... i call him at 12am and he's instantly sexual on the phone towards me and i keep telling him we cannot continue to do this and then he mentions that he'll pay me. At first i laugh it off thinking he's totally kidding. He asks how much, and i blurted out the first number that came to mind ($1000) and he agreed. At first i thought he just agreeing without thinking but then he continue to say he will pay me $1000, even if just to eat my ass. fuck, so i agreed. He follows through and e-transfer me the money the moment we're done.

260,"My father has never been of great health. He was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was a toddler. He has had prostate cancer twice. He has been dealing with heart failure, kidney failure, and copd, for years. last year on top of all that, last spring he had a knee replacement which entailed a lot of healing and physical therapy. He had been seizure free for almost 2 years and was doing great all through the summer but when it started to get cold he started using his cane again and complained of general weakness and pain. In addition, around christmas, he started to complain of incontinence and general gi issues. With each complaint we were sure to see the doctor, each one could not really explain the decline and treated the symptoms since that's all they could do.  So last Monday I get a call from my sister at 5am (he lives with her, I go over during the day while she is at work to take care of him and take him to any dr appts. We have had this arrangement after he had an episode 4 years ago) telling me that he has had 3 seizures and they are at the hospital. Those firstt 2 days in the hospital he had over 30 seizures. They also thought he had a stroke. Many eegs, cts and countless blood tests later, they determine he did not have a stroke amd could not find any seizure activity even though they themselves witnessed some of the seizures. He continued to have seizures through the week and weekend getting seemingly weaker with each one. He asked my sister who she was. He didn't know his name. I was sitting with him one day for about 5 hours and my sister comes in and he looks at me and asked how we got there so fast. He cannot chew, he's on a mechanical soft diet but can barely lift utensils. He can't walk,  just too weak. He stared having what they are calling “silent seizures” where he's just kinda catatonic, lasting, so far, anywhere from 2-15 min. Today he had 5 of them. the majority of the day he sleeps and when he is awake he is just not all the way there. During one of his fleeting lucid moments he told us that he was tired and couldn't’ do it anymore. He has a dnr. 

Right now it feels like I'm just waiting for him to die. There is nothing I can do, the drs don't know what is causing it let alone how to stop it. I feel helpless and don't feel like I can talk to anyone because I don't want to burden them with my shit when they have their own shit going on. On top of all of this, we are worrying about final plans, I know he has a small burial policy but due to his health history and being low income he wasn't able to get much. Reddit, as I wait for the inevitable to happen, what do I do? Should I be doing something I'm not thinking of? Any advice of how to deal with any of this would be appreciated

She recently got into a relationship and told me the child wasn't mine and I can no longer see him.

270,"I will keep this as short as possible but it is a complicated situation. 

My Mother does not speak to her Mother, my Nan. She hasn’t for 10 years. She thinks she’s evil and genuinely wishes she would die. 

My Mum is an alcoholic, and has been for pretty much most of those 10 years. My 2 half sisters are 9 and 10 years old. Last summer I phoned social services after failing to get my Mum to see she has a problem myself, and ultimately my sisters now live with their Dad. Because of this my Mum has removed me from her life. She’s threatened me with the police when I contacted her. But she has also been trying to ruin my life (e.g. she tried to break my partner and I up over New Year, she did the same to my sisters’ Dad). 

On Monday we found out my Mum has 3-6 months to live. This is due to liver failure. We are all sad, and trying to arrange access to see my Mum. 

My Mum does not want my Nan to know anything, but I think my Nan needs to know. If I don’t tell my Nan and my Mum passes I will feel awful, and I expect my Nan will feel anger towards me. I don’t want any of this. I rest easy because throughout this whole thing I have done what I consider to be the right thing, and even though this is against my Mum’s wishes, I believe it’s the right thing.

However, I fear if I tell my Nan my Mum won’t want to see me before she dies. She’s apparently ‘thinking about it’ now, but I think that’s just her trying to upset me. I worry that if I do tell my Nan I will then lose my chance to see my Mum and I’ll have to live with that.

It’s not like I can just hurry up and see Mum today so I can tell Nan tomorrow. Courts are involved, we need a supervisor for the children in place and she’s almost 3 hours away. There are also several people’s availability which impact when I’ll see her.

Issues with the school, work and etc. I had never noticed these things happening until today. Last 2 weeks were possibly the most stressful and one of the worst memory I could have in my life until now. It got me thinking, that maybe it was the worst decision to move in a new place. 
Previous to the accident, everything was totally fine. I was settling in pretty smooth. After someone pointed out- “You have the worst luck.

276,"This is a throwaway account just in case. This is going to be a really long post, sorry in advance! I'm really hoping I can get some good advice here because my real life resources have been depleted. Thanks in advance!

I currently live with my girlfriend, mom and stepdad. Mom and stepdad are both on disability. The way we ended up living together is I was living with my mom and stepdad under their roof before I was making enough money to support myself and girlfriend came and moved in with me. I currently make around 45-50k/year depending on OT and gf is somewhere around 35k/year. 

I wanted to do something nice for my mother when the lease of her last apartment was up and I'm young so my gf and I said screw it and offered to get a new place with her(renting) and stepdad. It's been about two years living in this new place and my gf and I are beginning to want to live on our own now as we are getting a little older.  

The problem is this; we'd have to move out at the same time obviously as the landlord wouldn't want us all out at the same time. Mom only makes around 700 take home from disability, she was in a very bad accident years ago and made very poor decisions with her settlement money. She is prescribed heavy medication just to function on a day to day basis and is still in extreme pain daily so working is out of the question. Step dad is an asshole. Makes somewhere around 1000/month, is obese, on dialysis, doesn't take care of himself at all. Really just given up. They both have a terrible relationship and so my mother doesn't know how long that's going to last. He also has relatively wealthy parents in another state he could run back to without any real worry. My mom doesn't like his parents and would not be willing to follow even if offered.

The CoL in our area is pretty high, a studio apartment you'd consider yourself lucky to find at 650/month not including utilities.  Mom doesn't get any government assistance other than disability and health insurance. It seems to me that it's completely impossible for her to live on her own. I have no idea how long her and my step dad will actually last. She is a very depressed person and wants me to just leave and let her fend for herself. I obviously am not just going to up and abandon my mother. 

I love my mom to death and want nothing but the best for her. We butt heads pretty often and my girlfriend doesn't really want to continue living with my mother either as we are getting older. I feel like once I commit to living with my mother because I feel I have no other choice that it will end up being that way for the rest of my life because it isn't like she is going to just get a raise one day. This would lead to my girlfriend eventually leaving most likely as well. 

I'm feeling pretty lost as this is the first part of my life I've encountered where I genuinely have no idea what to do. I'm in my early 20s, I know everything right? Do I have any options? Where do I go from here? I appreciate all advice you guys give me. ",31Jan2019,1

I knew i had to leave , because if i join them i knew that im not been a good person,right?

So today in class , a teacher told us that if we knew something about drugs or something similar ... we have to tell them

I don't know why I do it but i try my absolute hardest in order to push down every ounce of sadness or other negative emotion that I feel. Tonight it took every bit of my willpower to not fucking cry. I know that some of you if you do read through this and try to help will tell me to let myself feel and to just cry and that I will feel much better after but I am not going to. I don't know where to start with the things I want to talk about but I guess ill just jump in. I feel like my life is a sick joke. I live in a trailer and have to wake up at 6:00 (which now is like 5 and a half hours away) to go to school to prepare for my ""future"" that I know is not going to turn out well no matter what I do. I feel absolutely alone. I have friends and they are cool enough but I have no source of love. I don't feel wanted or cared about. last year I made a friend. we would talk every once and a while and hang out in classes we had. She was cute, nice, strange, and just awesome. eventually I developed a crush I guess. After someone found out they told her and online she asked if it was true I said yes and she felt the same. we decided to not do anything really and were just friends and started to talk more. for just about the rest of the year we talked fairley constantly and after a while I asked her out. She said no because she was not ready for a relationship. I was a little sad but was completely ok with it and we were still friends. well over summer we didn't talk and any times I would try to reach out she would either not see the message or not respond. so I took that as I had done something and she hated me. This is not where my ... sadness? started but it did start to get worse. I have asked her if she hates me but she said that she does not. after that short conversation online we went to bed and she still has not tried to talk to me. and because I don't want to bother her or somehow make things worse I don't try to talk to her either. I don't know what to do and so I do nothing. we are now into the second semester and I have tried my hardest to just forget about her. and it's working but I don't know if I want it to because what if she somehow feels the same or something.

Now, you might be wondering ""did you tell her to pull over so you could meet her somewhere?"" ""did you try to go find her to get her kids?"" yes, great suggestions except i live 1700 miles and 5 states away. I was helpless and there was nothing i could do but listen and hope she didnt crash. She was dropping fbombs and saying bitch that and cunt this. with her children in the back seat. She made it to their school, told me she was afraid to bring them inside because she was wearing slippers and reeked like alcohol.   


Another thing that has me worried was her sniffling. the sniffling was specific. last year she got into coke and told me she was only doing it once in a while and it wasnt a big thing. After doing her melodic sniffling she said ""I was so broke that i had to find my coke dollars so i could use them for gas"" I was like, wait i thought you werent doing that shit anymore. she said ""oh no, im not doing it anymore, i just had to find the dollars because i was broke."" Okay dude, you dont hang onto coke dollars for over a year if you arent doing coke anymore.  


well luckily she got them to school without hurting her children (physically) and texted me when she got home and said ""im home safe!"" i said, okay i love you but you worry me sometime. she said ""oh dont worry im just being silly."" Now, i know this girl very well. If i called her out and got aggressive she will withdraw and not listen to me anymore. I have to be very careful and cautious with how I approach her.  


Later in the day she texted me and said ""omg im such an embarrassment."" She was strictly talking about some personal info she blurted out about being sexual towards someone she shouldnt, shes my best friend and i am positive this is what she was talking about. I said ""no, i love you so much but i think its normal for me to be a bit worried when you drove the kids to school this morning a bit tipsy still."" no response. honestly, i dont expect her to respond because she is pretty avoidant and defensive.",31Jan2019,1

The past few days I have had a lack of sleep due to stress from school work (that I already turned in) and as a result I have been almost falling asleep in most classes. I slept through the entire 6th period and didn’t get in trouble / caught because my teacher is not really a good teacher, and I almost fell asleep in math (which I am doing fine with but today I couldn’t focus and missed most of the lesson). Today was my worst day especially, I could barely function.

My situation:
Since we've been talking a lot, and we've been supporting each other emotionally (she's been helping me through some tough times too, but not relationship problems), I started to have feelings for her. I dont know where these feelings are coming from, and I feel super guilty about having these feelings because I'm also really good friends with the guy. I really do like her a lot, I just dont know if I should go after her. Also, I'm not sure she feels about me the same way, she is a really kind and sweet person to everyone, and with me, since she knows I'm pretty introverted, has been trying to include me as much as she can when it's not just our friends. Long story short I just don't know what to do in this situation and just thinking over it has been killing me recently.

296,"I (F20) think I might be able to benefit from going to therapy. I used to think I wasn’t built for it, that my personality wouldn’t allow me to get anything out of it. I’ve never officially been diagnosed with anything but have had these issues for as long as I can remember. I didn’t have the most stable childhood and I’m not sure how much of this ties into that. 

I have a hard time being happy. Not to say I’m actively depressed or sad, just accepting things that are good for me doesn’t come naturally. I also deal with mood swings. One minute I’ll be fine then something incredibly minuscule will happen that puts in a bad mood. I tend to take things out on the people closest to me. This used to be my family and has mainly been put on my (now ex) boyfriend. It’s like I’m never pleased or am able to accept things and be happy. It feels like I’m creating problems out of nothing. I’m also an introverted person and my relationship with other people/being social is a complicated one. 

Insert therapy. I downloaded and paid for one of those apps where you text the therapist and can schedule a video call once a week. It wasn’t for me. Only lasted a month. However, the therapist did say something very insightful that I think opened my eyes. It helped me understand myself a little bit more. That’s what I can’t get out of my head. Maybe if I went and saw a therapist once a week I could get even more out of it. 

This is where I need advice. I’m not the most motivated person and therapy feels like something I can keep pushing off. I also don’t work the traditional 9-5 hours which makes things harder. I need to know how to go about finding a therapist. One close to me that also takes my insurance. Do I just call the closest doctor’s office? Search for it on the internet? I’m hoping some of you who have been through this will have better advice and can help me with starting this process.

So we dated for five months. Good sex and nice intimate moments of cuddling and talk about whatever that was amazing. Other than that, it was awful, we were constantly mad at each other or sad about something the other had done. So we sat down to talk and i proposed that we make one last effort where we would be really clear on communication and how we were feeling but he/she in turn said that we should probably just end it.  
Honestly one of the things that really fucking annoys me is that he/she kind of ""won"". We both agreed it was awful but since he/she wanted to break it off and i wanted to try one last time it counted as him/her breaking up with me. I feel like i'm the loser, the person that got thrown aside, EVEN THOUGH I HATED THE RELATIONSHIP TOO.  
And now i keep thinking about him/her. When i hear that he/she has slept with someone my blood fucking boils. I feel like were in a competition now.

303,"Please let me know if there is a more appropriate sub to post this in. Disclaimer: long. 

My boyfriend and myself have lived in our apartment for over 3 years now. We have been dealing with the bucket of crazy next door since the month we moved in. 

Some history: 
We moved in our apartment Dec 2016. We rent and crazy neighbour (CN) owns, in case that matters. We had a small housewarming/New Years party the month we moved in. Us and 3 other couples (8 total). It basically consisted of us playing board games, drinking, and watching YouTube videos. For the countdown we went out on our balcony and did the normal 3,2,1, Happy New Year thing. This is where the crazy all began. We come back in and it’s 12:03 and the neighbour starts banging on the door. Up to this point we had not met her. BF answers the door and this lady just starts going off on how we are being so loud, we’re so rude, she has to work in the morning, we are bumping music (watching YouTube??), etc. Now while I think it’s stupid to complain about noise on NYE right after midnight, I get it, living in an apartment you have to be respectful and keep noise to a minimum at night. But just the way this lady handled it so rudely just immediately yelling at my boyfriend upon him opening the door, I lost it. Keep in mind we’d never interacted yet alone met her and she didn’t just simply ask us to keep it down, she went off yelling from the get go. Drunk me went off on her, called her a cunt, bad judgement on my part. But we were not being loud to begin with and I will stand by that to my dying day. I did call the police non emergency line to see what we could do about her banging on our door and harassing us for noise we don’t believe exists but they basically said unless she threatens us, they wouldn’t do anything. 

Moving forward she keeps harassing us pretty regularly. Banging on our door, telling us she’s going to call the cops, every time there’s “noise” (aka none at all) or normal living noise - nothing excessive worth actually complaining about. We encourage her to call the cops instead of bang on our door because we are confident that we are not making the noise she claims and would rather deal with them than her psycho ass. 

From the first incident out it started a “war” if you will, with CN. Any little noise and she’d be at our door banging and yelling. I drop a dish, she’s at our door, movie on the tv has a crash in it, she’s at our door. You get the picture. It doesn’t help that her bedroom and our living room share a wall. 

I work evenings most weekends so usually I’m not around to deal with her and my boyfriend gets the pleasure. 

Fast forward to Dec 2017. We receive a letter from strata that someone complained about noise from our unit on a specific night at a specific time. We of course, assume it was her since we have had no other noise issues, or any issues at all really, with any other neighbours. We tell our landlord, who is already up to date on the CN situation, that this could not possibly have been us creating noise because we were both out at a Christmas party that night and did not return until 2:30am (letter stated noise was made at 12am). Landlord tells strata and nothing else happens although they do threaten to fine us if someone complains again. 

Now fast forward to present day. 

There’s been multiple incidents in between then and now but they all haven been her banging on our door claiming we are making “noise” that we just simply aren’t making.  A couple weeks to a couple months ago, can’t remember exact timeline, she did her normal bang on our door to complain about noise late at night routine, and this time she told my boyfriend she was going to send her boyfriend to “beat him up”. This triggered me and I told her I was going to “fucking kill her”. Not my smartest move. I did not call the police to report the incident since I threatened her back and didn’t feel like dealing with it. 

Last weekend she called the cops on us (we assume it was her) for more “noise”. Cops show up and my boyfriend is alone playing video games on the couch with the cat, I’m at work. BF opens the door and the cops are immediately surprised because it’s just him standing in his sweatpants, cat between his legs, probably looked stoned af lol. They can tell right away he’s alone and no noise is coming from our apartment (he even wears a headset for video games). While they’re talking to him they hear the neighbour directly above us banging around and bf confirms neighbours upstairs have been making noise most of the night. He admits he did bang on the ceiling a couple times in response to the banging. Cops tell him maybe someone got confused and reported our apartment number instead of the upstairs people because our unit numbers are similar and leave to go check out upstairs. I think it was CN who complained about us making “noise” again, and don’t think it was confusion of someone trying to report the neighbour upstairs. 

Fast fast forward to tonight. There was a huge crash and flash of light on the street perpendicular to ours, so us being overly curious cats went for a little walk to check out the commotion. Our building has multiple entrances and we opted for the garage door nearest our unit to come back into our building. Well as soon as we walk through the doors from the stairwell onto our floor neighbour rips open her door (she literally stands there looking through her peephole waiting for us to walk by) and starts accusing us of “opening the garage door multiple times”. We opened it once to come in (used a different door to leave) but maybe someone else opened it recently before us? Anyways she’s going off, and like, this lady does not just start complaining she goes off, I’ve never heard her talk without yelling. At this point I’m so fucking sick of her shit I start yelling back immediately as well (my boyfriend always tries to talk camly with her to no avail) and start approaching her telling her I’m going to knock her the fuck out. I take complete responsibility that I SHOULD NOT have done this. I wasn’t actually going to punch her but I was trying to intimidate her by approaching so she would go back in her apartment... didn’t work. Bf pulls me back in our apartment. 

Now here we are... and I need advice. I am not going to threaten or approach her again. We want to move into a new place but prices have gone up in our area and our budget really doesn’t permit anything equivalent to what we have (we would have to downgrade). So we feel kind of stuck where we are. I may call/email the landlord tmr to update him although because I acted so out of line as well I’m not to keen on having to tell people such as police, landlord, etc about my actions as well as hers but I know we can’t keep living like this. Like seriously she got mad at us for opening the garage door? 

Any advice is appriciated. Has anyone ever dealt with something similar? I do not feel safe simply because of how irrational she is even though I understand I’m the one who has made most of the threats. 

Almost forgot to mention, she’s no angel either and I’ve been documenting some of our issues with her. She has a dog that we often hear whining in the middle of the night excessively and she leaves her personal items in the “common area” which is the hallway both of our apartments open into such as umbrella (wide open), shoes, etc.

304,"Let me give you guys some context.

So I have these two friends of mine who I used to consider my best friends, let's call them John and idk fucking Tom or smthn . We were planning a summer trip for a whole year and we were really excited about it. Tom had a house up in the mountains and the plan was to go there and smoke as much weed as possible, enjoy the nightlife there and all that stuff. Long story short John gets caught smoking weed by his parents who call our parents to let them know. Mine already knew and were cool with it since they used to be stoners as well but my friend's parents didn't take it that well and were pretty disappointed from what I've been told. Either way, a few months pass and we decide to invite some of our other buddies which we weren't really that close with. Me and Tom have a bit of an argument cause he wouldn't let me bring weed because of what happened with his parents even tho virtually no one would be able to go near the house since it was in the middle of nowhere, getting caught was impossible and he knew that ( he recently started smoking again). Either way, by the end of the argument I made it explicitly clear that I wasn't gonna bring any drugs with me, I just found it a bit irrational. Apparently one day they all had a bit of a discussion about me bringing drugs and one of them took the initiative to uninvite me from the trip (through texting), didn't even give me a reason. I was really hurt and spent the next day drinking. I should've confronted them at that point but I was so disgusted by what they did that I didn't even want to talk to them. A month or so goes by and John and the guy who uninvited me text me to apologize. They explain what happened and I forgive them. Essentially everyone was a bit scared of their parents finding out about the drugs. I understand that. A few months go by and I come across Tom who pretends like it never happened. I was going through a hippie phase at the time so I thought I'll just let it slide (like I did with everything). One thing leads to another and we start hanging out again. We never even acknowledged what happened but to this day I can't accept the fact that Tom, my best friend at the time, allowed all that to happen since he was the one in charge for all that, couldn't just tell me, hey, man just don't bring fucking drugs (although he knew I wouldn't), never thought about giving me a call or texting me to explain what happened or apologize to the very least. A long time has passed (about a year) and I still cant fathom what happened. Maybe I'm making this a bigger deal than it is, but I still want answers. Should I ignore it ever happened or confront him? And if I should, how would I bring it up since a whole year has passed. ",31Jan2019,1

Hi all,

Very recently I began a new job at a boutique health/beauty retail store. I have never worked in retail before and mainly have experience in childcare so you can imagine how pleased I was that I got the job after the interview!

However... my manager informed me that I will only have four training sessions (two of which I’ve already had) before I am going to be by myself in the store for my shifts, as the store is very small and I suppose doesn’t need more than one worker on at a time. I am extreeeemly anxious about this. I managed okay the first two training shifts but there is still so much I don’t know and I’m terrified of being by myself and making a mistake, especially one infront of a customer that I don’t know how to fix right then and there. I’ve been taking a notebook to my training sessions and writing down everything she tells me so I can look back at it for reference, but there is still so much I don’t understand, especially the till system and the records we need to keep if certain of purchases.

What do you suggest I do? I’m becoming more and more nervous for my first shift by myself in about 4 days, but I need this job. Any advice would be beyond helpful right now.",31Jan2019,1

309,"Some background: I'm 41M, have one kid and a wife. I'm an engineer, have been working in various director positions in industry. I suffered with severe depression for a decade when I was younger. 

I've written two books on depression and how to get rid of it (as I did that myself), and I've been wanting to write more books. I actually drafted three new books in the last year, and in all three cases editors and others told me they suck. That's the immediate trigger of my current acute situation (although it has always been like this).

My problem is that I absolutely loathe myself. I don't hate myself, as I don't feel I'm ""worthy of hate"", but I think I'm utter garbage as a human being. I hold myself to extremely harsh standards. In my view, I should be a millionaire, a successful best-selling author, live in a fantastic house, live a great life with lots of friends and cool activities. 

Objectively, my life is pretty good. I have what I need financially, I have a great wife and kid. I have friends, although the friendly activity is a fraction of what it was prior to people getting kids. 

But the problem is the abyss between the (extremely high) standards I hold to what is a sufficiently good life, and the actual life I live. 

I know this is a logical fallacy, that it's irrational and unfair. The irony is that I wrote two books on how to use cognitive behavioral therapy to counter such logical fallacies. And yet I'm unable to bridge the gap, unable to really convince myself that living a ""normal"" life is fine and valuable. 

This is reaching a level where I would end my life if it weren't for the people that rely on me (financially and as a family member). I don't think I'm depressed (I know what real depression is, and this is different), I just think I'm a complete loser unworthy of anything that is good.

I also don't understand where this is coming from. My father was an alcoholic and died when I was young. My mother has never set strict standards or ambitions for me. None of my parents were pushy or pressurized me to achieve at a high level.

Can anyone relate to this, and did anyone find a way out of it?

**Summary if too long to read**: I have failed school semesters in the past due to mental issues; I did well in Spring 2018 and Summer 2018, but failed last Fall minus one class (Latin); my parents understandably want me to come home but there is nothing i want there; i have to stay in school and pass to have any chance at life; currently in English, don't think i fit in; the major is filled with peple that piss me off; i don't share same passion for film and literature as peers; my writing isn't that amazing and i don't know a lot of film lingo for classes; i like video games but doubt i could fit into the programming scene either; i type very slow and coupled with the adhd it takes me forever to get papers done; not many skills (I'm a literal jack of all trades, master of none, emphasis on the latter); i have too many internet tabs on my pc (400+, yes i'm dead serious its that fucking many. how does my pc even run? I'm guessing the power of Christ); i like a little of everything but can never sink into any one (I've been told by the internet to just pick something as passion comes later and I agree, but I'm saying that I can't choose anything because i know that i will get lazy at it and not be considered a hard worker and will become demotivated and ""down"" again. wow this section is almost just as long but fuck it im posting it.

I'm actually angry that i'm not suicidal because while it would be sad for my family and friends that i ended my life, it would would be less sad than being some loser that lives with his parents and doesn't have a job or any way of financing himself. but maybe im scared of becoming suicidal. is that even a thing? i don't know what future me will think about if i fail out of college. its easy now to stay up all night writing this with the mindset of getting better only for it to be 5 am with an unfinished essay due tomorrow. ill go to sleep in a second and then wake up feeling guilty cause i skipped class again.  i did well last spring but thats only becaue i stayed up all night to get work done on time. thats no way to live. should i only be focusing on passing college? why? what would be the point? to graduate in something that I know only slightly better than the averagfe joe. what of my others skills? when will i have time to get better at those?",31Jan2019,1

315,"My life seems to be a series of bad choices, and I don’t know if I can trust myself to make the right choices anymore...

I graduated two years ago with a liberal arts degree because I thought it was a decent choice of personal likes and job opportunities. Turns out it was close to useless and wasn’t even a decent paying degree. Even though I liked it, I kinda wish I just went with a high paying degree that I’d hate because at least it pays.

I got a job as a writer/editor for a publishing company where I wrote for a website. It was okay but the pay wasnt livable (entry level wage on my country hardly is) and since I wasn’t a regular (more like a consultant), I didn’t get benefits and worked beyond regular work hours. I was so done that I left and decided I wanted to try applying for grad schools in Japan.

When I left, I said I was going to take a sort of gap year to fix applications and refocus, but that was a complete waste of time. I just realized that I wasn’t going into grad school for the right reasons and ended up wasting a year doing NOTHING. 

I did literally nothing besides do some freelance writing and lose weight. That’s it. I decided I wanted to work abroad because pay in the Philippines is the worst. I applied to English teaching jobs in Japan and content writing in Australia and New Zealand, but so far it’s been nothing but a bust.

March marks the one year of me bumming out and shitting around, and I’m just so frustrated with my lack of progress. 

The start of the year I got a really good client that pays twice the starting pay here and I was like okay this is good maybe I can go steady with this. But honestly? I feel like it might end up not lasting very long and I’ll just end up unemployed again. 

I’m so tired and I just really need money like not just for me but for my mom who I live with, but I really cant stand to work in this country. Pay is way too low and doesn’t get better for another ten years, but I feel so desperate that I’m thinking of just saying fuck it and accept that I’ll be in a low-paying job because at least it’s consistent....

Sorry it’s so long, but I just feel like my time is running out...

317,"So today was my first day in a totally new school (im in year 10). I moved there because I was always late to my previous school. So today, I couldn’t work up the nerve to actually talk to someone new and try to make friends. Instead, I just sat alone at recess and lunch time at a table. I couldn’t look at my phone or anything because for some reason phones aren’t allowed there at all. I looked so depressed when I was sitting, to the point where the principal tried to engage in a conversation with me to cheer me up, which worked temporarily and I’m grateful for that. But I have no confidence to ask someone if I can hang out with them. I used to be really confident, and even popular. But now I’m just a mess.

318,"so im trying to figure out why i don't like school so hopefully i can fix it. 

Its hard to explain what happens. I get kind of like this uncomfortable feeling, and like i just really don't want to be there. 


But anyway, i've realised one scenario that causes me to feel this is when there's nothing to do at school. Like when the teacher is just talking on and on about stuff that isn't related to the subject or when the teacher is taking the roll or just basically anything that isn't work. 

Like when we're actually tasked with doing work its not that bad, when im doing something i don't actually have that uncomfortable feeling. 

Does anyone know why i might be like this and does anyone know any way i could fight this? 

I've been thinking, would doing some sort of program that isn't based around the class room be better? Like there's this distance education thing where you get a bunch of work, and you i believe there's a bunch of text book stuff to read and online resources and you can finish them all in your own time. Im wondering if that might be better for me? Cause i can just work hard over a smaller period of time and get my work done quicker and get to spend less time doing school stuff. 

Like, i do feel like im an autodidact, i've like to learn by myself and i've taught myself several programming languages and like if im able to get that same work ethic and motivation and apply it to my school work then i would do really well.",31Jan2019,1
319,"I'm a 17 year old male, oldest out of every one of my cousin's and older than my brother, I'm the eldest of the eldest and the stereotype plays true in my family. 

I cop it for everything that anyone does because I should be the role model or I should be this or that. Currently I've just started year 12 and I'm studying my ass off but I can't find any peace. My mum has a problem with everything I say, my brother has gone down the path of getting kicked out of school and hanging around with dumbass 'eshays' (it's an Australian thing) and my dad is really the only one with a cool head but often sides with my mum. 

Here's an example, so my brother recently got kicked out of school and mum and dad where pissed off at him ( I mean thoroughly pissed) for a total of 3 days and then they where fine and he got everything which had been confiscated back to him. I got a B in physics and got reamed so hard that I got deeply depressed for a fair chunk of that term (I had never been depressed before and it isn't part of my personality so that was a really hard hitter). 

Can be passed off as they want me to succeed. Sure I guess. 

Here's one that's pretty bad. This problem has been going on so long that I remember being 8 at my grandads house celebrating Christmas and everyone of my cousin's and my brother got $170 penny boards and I got a $7 model guitar (no price exaggeration) I didn't care though because it didn't mean alot to me at the time I've never been a really materialistic guy I don't think. 

What's prompted me to write this though was I got back from work at 9pm after being at school since 9, having to be up at 6 to catch my bus and mum picked me up with my brother, after saying it would be a good idea for my brother to read his English book for school (he's a 15M) I get told to get off of my period by my mum and it thrown in my face ""how much of a fuckhead I am because he doesn't have to read his book until next term"". I feel like an ass though because I said I can't wait to move out and I know there's only so much someone can take but it was made very clear that I can ""fuck off whenever I want, how about I pull you out of school while I'm at it and you can go rot"". Jesus, thanks mum. 

This only really happens when my dad's at work (he's an ICU nurse so it's alot of 12 hour days and nights) so I text him and I hear him trying to defend me while my mum outright states I'm the problem with the whole family and she's so happy I'm going to school so she doesn't have to deal with my shit. 

So yeah that's what inspired this and I'm wondering if any of you guys are dealing with similar things or have dealt with similar things because I'm pretty lost rn. I know I'm not perfect obviously and I've bought alot of fuck ups to our doorstep which my parents have helped me deal with but it's just gotten to the point where I'm laying here crying for the first time in so so long because I'm just lost my guys. Tryna stay optimistic and focus on my studies because they come first but sometimes you just need some advice. Thanks Reddit the best to you all!!",31Jan2019,1
320,"I'm 24 years old male. I've been supplementing with Vitamin D 2000 IU, Vitamin C 1000mg, Magnesium 200-300mg/day, Zinc Citrate 15mg/day and sometimes pop a Centrum Multivitamin for the vitamin B. The reason why I take these supplements is because I'm a college student and I believe (not tested) that I have deficiency in some way, so this is kinda a second solution and read things like 50% of the population not taking enough magnesium or vitamin D for example. So I'm not sure if it is the Magnesium exactly, but I definietly notice something after taking it, I've been taking Magnesium from different forms like glycinate, citrate, lactate and all makes me feel the same way. I take it before night as I read it is a good sleep aid and it doesn't really make me sleepy, but I feel my mind slowing down and I start to get foggy etc. When I wake up I just want to stay in bed and sleep more and have a hard time focusing. I'm also drinking coffee and after I have my cup I instantly feel my focus is back and energy is back, that I feel better, for example music sounds pleasing, it's like the complete opposite. So I'm not sure what is causing this. Too much magnesium? Calcium inbalance? Caffeine withdrawal? What to do? I'm not sure what to do, it is causing an emotional rollercoaster everyday as I'm trying to figure out what is wrong. Am I not drinking enough water? Or is it because magnesium is an NMDA inhibitor?

324,"Hello,  


&amp;#x200B;

I'm from France. Living in the Netherlands since late 2016, I moved in for my boyfriend. I went to school to learn the langage for 1,5 year, got the diploma. After that I kind of slacked. I wanted to work or start studying, but at the same time I was terrified of starting one of the two. I eventually found a job (Production work) with a 3 months contract. It started ok but I quickly realised that doing the same thing for 8 hours straight 5 days in a week is not for me. My mental health went down hill during this period. I had to take breaks to go to the toilet and cry for 5-10 minutes, and then go back and act like nothing happened, also had suicidal thoughts... Anwyay, after 3 months I was done, what a relief.  
I then applied  to a school (right after I was done with work) but then I got really anxious about starting, and sent an email to the director saying roughly ''Sorry, I'm not ready''.  


Back to loocking for a job... I eventually solicitated at an animal shelter. They said that they had enough volunteers and that they would get back to me when they need people. 1 month after, they got back to me, great! I went there in the morning to try... Loved it. I've always loved animals, taking care of them is what I would love to do in my future. So why not just stay working there and eventually make my way up the ladder? Would love that, but I am not getting paid since it's volunteering, and that is a issue for me.   


I live with my boyfriend and his mother and I really want to move and have our own place together with him. But I obviously need a job that pays me, and he needs a job too. (He is still studying) so for now, I'm stuck there. I really want to  move since I believe it will improve my mental health. But yeah, guess I have to be a little more patient.   
My boyfriend also wants me to go back to school, because it is really important for my future. (Apparently here in the Netherlands, if you don't have a diploma you will not recieve governement support once you've retired. It doesn't really bother me, since I don't think I or the human race will make it that far... yikes, that sounds edgy) I do have a diploma, a french one though, not sure if that count. But anyway, I really do not want to go back to school since I might have developed a kind of phobia due to my childhood experience (Bullying, loneliness, failure...) But my boyfriend really wants me to. I could combine 2 jobs but, is this really a good idea since I would love to go fulltime at the animal shelter?   


Basically my issues are : I think I found my dream job, but it's not paying me. Don't want to go back to school because I'm scared and don't really want to. Want to start having my own place but can't since my job isn't paying.   


What the wdzzzwkro should I do? I would love some advice.

325,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

It has recently came out that my SO has a serious drinking problem. Like straight vodka, every day, drinking to the point where her speech is slurred, her balance is off and is completely incomprehensible sort of problem.

I'll discover her 'stash' hidden in all sorts of old bottles hidden around our place in weird and wonderful places. Once confronted she admits it, apologises and promises it never will happen again and it does.

This all steams from some sort of childhood trauma which she won't go into details about and the drinking seems to be a fairly recent thing, maybe all within the last 4 to 6 months, but has accelerated so fast.

Now after a visit to her parents, this all came out, she put her hands up and admitted the problem. Which is a great first step and she has been visiting a councillor once a week regarding this.

Despite the counselling it just doesn't seem to be getting any better, worse if anything and I really don't know what to do? Or if there even is anything I can do at this point?

327,"Hello, never lurked or posted on this subject before but thought it might be a good idea.

So, live in a state where recreational/medical use of THC/marijuana is *still* illegal, I've been smoking pot for 2 years every night to help me fall asleep.
I'm going on 8 days sober now and I have a job interview this Friday at a certain construction/materials company that I read drug tests during the interview.

I understand, this substance isn't for everyone, and can induce incoherency when it comes to operating anything, sure, solution? Don't smoke right before work, simple as that.

That doesn't change the fact that I am a reliable hard worker that doesn't mind getting his feet wet in any condition that may require strong will and focus.
I'm concerned that I will still fail this drug test and I must mention at the interview that I use it for insomnia, and anxiety when I try to fall asleep at night.

I guess what I'm asking is, should I mention right off the bat that I use it for sleep before anything else said/asked in this interview? I'm actually trying to join this company to turn my life around and away from pot and an old night life full of people that abuse the substance heavier than I did back in the 1st year of smoking nightly.



P.S. it is excruciatingly frustrating to live in a world so closed minded from psychoactives, and other psychedelics that actually enhance your view of reality enough to create a dopamine bridge to gap the world's mess of lies rather than cause a detriment, but hey, I'm a firm believer in unschooled philosophy, and  I've only ever smoked pot, so what do I *actually* know?",31Jan2019,1

She seemed to have trouble being honest with me or something because eventually one day, when I apologised because u might've seemed pushy about wanting a proper relationship, she just got really annoyed and told me we would never be in a relationship and that I should've taken a hint. 7 days prior to this conversation we were curled up together on the couch and for that week nothing had happened. So as far as I could tell there was no hint I should have taken. Also, I don't understand why she thought I needed to take a hint as all I was doing was saying sorry. I wasn't trying to ask her out again or something dumb like that.

So anyway, she started being distant and I asked her why and she just said she was busy. A couple days later I brought it up again and she said she doesn't want to be friends anymore... So that sucked. She's the best friend that I've ever had. 

All of this was back in September. A while ago. On New year's I got far to drunk and ended up crying for a solid 2 hours about it. I thought I was past it all but clearly not. Now, one month into the new year, I find myself back at the beginning of the process, attempting to bargain with myself that I can somehow rekindle our friendship.

Today was the first day back at school and apparently when me and a friend walked past she waved at me. I was staring right at her but everything somehow just went blurry and I felt a little panicky.

340,"Long story short.

I met this guy lol.

He was just some random guy in my java clas that I tried talking to before nothing really happened between us. But after really meeting him, I learned we have a ton in common. We got really close instantaneously and developed feelings for each other. To be honest, I’m not quite sure if he developed feelings for me.

So, a problem then arose when his friend started talking to me. A close, good friend he would tell everything to. This “friend” was his wingman in this situation; however, I did not get the feeling that he actually wanted me to the guy I like. Instead I found it awkward, I wanted to get out of the situation immediately before I started solidifying my feelings for this guy. His friend was super controlling over him and later learned by other friends he was a manipulative person. He would try to control the progress of our relationship and he was so scared the past would occur again. In his friend’s past, he was a wingman for one of his own friends and successfully helped that friend get the girl. But soon after, he realized he had feelings for the girl and all I know from his side is that he was abused. On the other hand his friend’s friend was stressed out with him, impacting his relationship with the girl whom he really liked. The same thing is happening yet again but for this guy I liked and I. The guy I liked said he would cut off ties with him because he learned on his own that his friend was manipulative. They spoke in person and his friend blamed me for the guy I like cutting ties with him. Instead of protecting me or letting him know the truth. the guy I liked just said sorry for hurting me amd blocked me on everything. He said he needed time. But reconnecting to my past, I was in a very toxic relationship and it’s not fun to step in the same puddle when all I wanted to do was talk to some guy. I don’t know why his friend was so controlling over our relationship and had to know everything. And I can’t believe I put my trust in the guy I like when I’ve lost trust for most people. The guy I liked also told his friend everything about me, including the conversations I had with other people. I told the guy I like that I wanted to separate our conversations from his friend and that I don’t want his friend reading our texts but he totally disrespected that. As of now, I’m blocked and he  just left me. Alright, so what am I supposed to do reddit users? Get over him?

346,"(A Longer Article TLDR below)

So I’m just starting Year 12 in High School, and two days in I’m stressed out already. I had to pick my subjects last year and chose Physics, English Language, Further Mathematics and Mathematics for Methods. I’m aiming towards the Engineering, Architecture, maybe Aviation and maybe Medical field. Sounds semi fine at the moment, but here’s the catch, my Methods teacher is unbearable. She cannot teach Maths at all especially to me, she only teaches in an algebraic format removing any visual learning from the process because that’s “easiest for her”. I know people who love maths with a passion but have left the class because of her and how hard it’s going to be continuing through the most important year of our school career with this teacher. For a scale on how bad she is so far, if we need help it’s better to ask the other students on what to do. I understand that being newer is hard but at this year level you need to be able to teach. 

So here is where I need advice, I have two options.

-I can either A, drop out of the class and move into legal studies which will greatly decrease the amount of courses I can do and will only leave Civil Engineering and Architecture as a pathway. 

-Or option B, I can stay in the class risking failure resulting in me not getting a good ATAR, the courses I’d like, and potentially my VCE certificate.

With option B I might be able to get a Tutor to help out. The only other thing I struggle with is heavy procrastination, and committing to the work. I’m afraid that not staying with this is a far riskier option leaving much less opportunities.

What should I do?

TLDR: I have a teacher in my higher math class that is almost incapable of teaching at my year level. I can either risk failure and losing my VCE certificate or I can move into legal studies instead with a higher success rate. The catch is that the higher math provides MUCH more pathways in University especially in engineering. What should I do?",31Jan2019,1

350,"I could be making something out of nothing (I can be a bit extra sometimes lol) but thought i would ask the reddit brains trust for some opinions.
Back story: my son is 6. He isnt a neurotypical child. He has severe language developmental delay, sensory processing  disorder (seeking) and a very low IQ (in the lowest 2%). (Possibly due to birth trauma) he failed to meet the criteria for autism and ID. He has been labeled as a ""complex case"" and isnt eligible for assistant funding at school. He does however need to be shadowed during school break times for social issue reasons.

So his school has asked me to get another autism assessment privately (because he apparently looks autistic to them lol). I have agreed to do so as i want to do everything in my power to make sure he gets what he needs. Keep in mind his paediatrician, speechy, and two other independent psychologists who I've asked to have a look at his case all agree he wont meet the autism criteria. 

Anyway I contacted a autism assessment team and they looked over his case including school  psyc notes and recommended I see an independent paediatrician before going ahead with paying  the $2500 assessment. So ive been ringing around trying to find an appointment that isnt 6 months away. I recieved an email from the school psyc saying Hi ____, i rang the autism assessment  place and got (my sons) informarion Have you got an appointment  yet?
This doesnt sit well with me for some reason. I always keep the school  updated and wasnt going to email her untill had a concrete appointment. Part of me is thinking well maybe i should communicated better with the school, another part of me feels like she crossed the line. It isnt anything major, i know this but its bugging me.

I'll add im very familar with the autism  spectrum as ive been a special  needs assistant for 5 years and an ABA therpaist for 2. I also understand they want the diagnosis for funding  reasons which im not mad at.  And I'm  in Australia if that makes any difference.

352,"So I (21F) decided that I wanted to try out a social work class this term and I actually thought I would go into social work. The class I picked is online and there are these discussion posts that are due every Sunday. (Plus essays and group projects etc)I have been fucking up hard on them because the prof is really particular about what she wants. I haven’t got an actual grade so I don’t know how I am actually doing, but the prof usually responds to my posts telling me that my interpretation is wrong and why. If i had to guess, I probably have a C or worse. I feel really beat down about this because I really am trying. I really just want to scrap the whole social work idea as a whole because I don’t feel like I have the right mind set. 

I think I have about 4 “voluntary withdrawals”, not sure how this affects anything but I’m sure they stick on to your transcript. This would make it 5. Plus, this is the only class that I am taking at the moment. I work full time so it’s not the end of the world for me to not be in school but it just makes me feel like a fucking failure.

But of course, I had to fuck it up. I was stressed about school, and wasn't thinking straight. When anon1 was trying to wingman her, I'd kindly refuse without thinking. I wanted to talk with her one on one. But it was too late as the trip was coming to a close. I haven't seen her since then. It's been months and I regret it 100%. I feel like a piece of shit. I don't want someone to hate me because of a stupid mistake I made. I've been trying to find her and I think I may have found her Instagram but I'm not 100% sure. The bio says she's taken, which is a huge disappoint. If it turns out to be her account, does this mean she's moved on? If something were to happen, would she consider me again? Or is it too late? I want to talk to her asking for some sort of forgiveness. How would I go about messaging her in a way that doesn't sound like I'm trying to hook up?

Myself(23f) and SO(24m) have been together for about a year and a half now. He's my bestfriend and I love him so much. 

2018 was the worst year for us, we ended up being unemployed countless times due to nature of our jobs which eventually led to us being homeless and having to move towns to find a place to stay. Back in hometown now, and started a good stable job which we havent had in about a year. My partner and I suffer from sleeping problems hence why its caused us work issues in the past. His seems to be getting better and mine worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, due to last year being so bad financially wise I thought im not letting this job slip through our hands im determind this year will be good, my SO doesn't seem to care as much. Every day at work he moans about how tired and annoyed he is cause he's ""tired""(he sleeps better than me majority of the time). 2 weeks ago i ate something funny and ended up becoming ill(violently throwing up)all night &amp; morning while he slept.. When I then said i wasnt fit to work that day he pretty much didnt care and told me I have too(he doesnt go in if he sneezes because hes 'too ill'(i've noticed he likes to play victim-he's always worse off than anyone).. anyway, whatever, same as last year we had heavy snow and I was moving our apartment about and I fell down the stairs and sprained my ankle. (he still made me go to work and walk there through dangerous ice and snow with sprain while he stayed home).. when we're at work he doesnt make the effort to make money and just 'gives up'

&amp;#x200B;

 anyway, last night I didnt sleep more than 4 hours, he slept from 10pm-9am today, I accidentally woke him up by going to the toilet around 12;30am and his response was 'i hope you die'.. anyway.. I wake up at 8am this morning for work so tired from lack off sleep, i still made him coffee, didnt disturb him, despite all of this i tried to give him a cuddle and kiss today and he just said 'fuck off' and hes not fit for work today so im out here earning money on my own... Now I am starting to realise how childish he is and he does have a lot of growing up to do but i'm just really at the end of my tether. He is horrible and rude when hes angry and hes made jokes before about how I should earn us money and he just stay at home and smoke(he spends majority of our money on weed even though im in 1500$ debt.) I just want him to prioritise(not being homelesss again) and when I talk to him he says all the right things but i see no action tbh and it's always been like that. He doesn't walk the walk if you get me?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point now where am I just wasting my time?? Is he just living off me for an easy life? or am I being impatient and wrong?

I try not to be braggadocios about it or bring it up when it isn't relevant to the topic or situation, but it does come out sometimes, and the reactions I get aren't exactly empowering. People of fairly normal/healthy weight seem to have this patronizingly congratulatory response to it, while people who clearly have their own weight problems tend to respond with bitter envy, especially after I tell them how I did it after they ask (and they always ask). I haven't come across any other ascended chubsters in real life, which tells me how rare we really are.

364,"Throw away account for paranoia reasons.

There is a longer version to this story and a short.

Largely it started 10 years ago when i was bartending in a NY Bar. I had been working there since i was 16 and hated walking into the place. It wasnt my co workers, just the job itself. The hours drove me insane, but the money is what kept me going along with the fact that my father got me the job and i also worked there as a bartender.

I never really sought to look at colleges because i didnt feel i was confident enough to get into a good one, also the idea of owing that much in student loans would've kept me awake at night, so i went to community college instead. Decided criminal justice interested me, then decided to try and get on the NYPD.

My parents were thrilled with the idea of me joining the cops, they no longer had to worry about their one and only son fucking up in life. Give some background, they are Irish immigrants who came to the US in the 80'S and have worked hospitality their whole lives. 

Anyways, i obtained my associates in Criminal Justice and then transferred to a Criminal Justice School in Manhattan to pursue my bachelors in International Criminal Justice. I was fascinated of working for the UN or Interpol and the recruiters were very convincing. So i would commute 80 miles every other day to obtain this degree all the while waiting for my number to be called to join the NYPD and working at the Bar Thursday to Sunday.

I had taken the medical, psychological, physical and met with my investigators. Then 2 days after i took the physical i get the disqualification for psychological reasons. Im not crazy, far from it. I am very relaxed person and enjoy my time with friends and family. They never told me where i failed, just that i failed.

Just like that, the whole world came crashing down on me. Everyone at the bar was anticipating me leaving, my parents were telling everyone i was joining the cops and it all got turned up onto its head. I couldn't afford a psychologist to give a second opinion and a chance to appeal it. 

So i took more shifts at the bar and made more money. Found a nice but controlling girl that i dated for almost 5 years. She pushed me out of the bartending gig into a construction company in Queens. Now my commute is a 100 miles a day. 

I walked my graduation with a 115 credits but never got the remaining because International Criminal Justice requires a second language, something i didnt really think through.

Now ive been working at a Construction Firm in Queens for the past 5 years. Get paid decently but the benefits are incredible.  My boss is like a second father to me, he and everyone in the office treat me really well. The work can be stressful sometimes and there are a few people in the office who do nothing and get paid a lot for it which annoys me but i know that occurs in every work place. 

But i dont have a feeling of accomplishment. I know my parents were not pleased with results of the psychological or me taking this new job but i think they finally came around to it.

Now im dating this girl that im not sure i really like, almost like im just settling because thats what my parents did. Tomorrow i have another Medical for the NYPD, i took the exam back in 2016 and my number was called.

I havent told my parents i took the exam again, my current girlfriend wouldnt want me joining the NYPD and i have this immensely guilty feeling of leaving my current job. Im also nervous the same thing will happen again and my boss will know im looking for something else.

I realize ive lived a large portion of my life just settling for something and not what i want. But the kicker is, i have no idea what i want. My main goal in life i feel is to make people happy, whatever the cost. Where that will take me, i have no idea.

Any advice?",31Jan2019,1

I game at my desk in my room a lot which is right next to the wall we share, since moving in about 6 months ago I’ve noticed weird noises and quiet screaming occasionally but it’s very very quiet.

The 2 girls are in a relationship and just over a week ago I heard one of them screaming at about 3:30am, one was saying to the other ‘stop screaming, you’re not going to die.’ And ‘pass it here!’, while the other one just whined and cried really loud.

2 nights later I hear them arguing, one shouted at the other ‘what kind of relationship is this?!’, followed by some loud slapping noises and some short screams (these screams aren’t like super loud enough to wake the dead), but obviously one of them was being slapped quite a few times.

For the last 4 or 5 days I’ve heard none-stop what sounds like a really low humming/vibrating noise, at first I thought it was my pc but the sound stayed and is coming from next door.
I also hear what I’m 99% sure is hardcore porn being played on minimum volume (I hear this and think it’s one of the girls screaming but then hear moaning/panting that’s obviously from my neighbours as it’s louder, so it must be porn?).
I have also heard what sounds like gagged screaming/moaning quite frequently (I don’t know if this is porn or one of my neighbours).

I’m at the point where I feel like this has gone on for quite a long time now, I’m sick of hearing it, but I’m also concerned now.

They’ve argued and shouted quite a bit over my time living next to them (not always loud enough for me to hear what, but just that they’re shouting).

380,"I'm just sort of wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this, and to what degree. 

To make a long story very short. I met someone when I was 14 years old at a camp in my hometown and became immediately infatuated with them. Absolutely obsessed. I convinced myself it was love at first sight, and that my feelings were actually rooted in reality. I began spending all my free time with this person. It seemed as though the feeling was mutual, but they ended up with someone else. I moved states shortly after to live with my father. I still continued to sort of monitor their social media and continued to be friends with people that were their friends. Years later we reconnected and I actually got on a 30 hour greyhound bus to go see them in my hometown. It was almost perfect and we were briefly intimate, but I could tell they weren't really interested, and shortly after they ended up with someone else again. My heart sort of broke after this encounter and became desperate to know things about this person and their s/o. It was disgusting and horribly wrong. I have spent the last 4 years trying to break this spell (through therapy and medication for my bipolar disorder) and mind my own business. I have been in a relationship for the last 3 years, and I would say I am overall very happy. Around the beginning of 2019 this person reaches out to me to apologize for the past issues. Then it seems as though they would like to reconnect, but as friends because they are also in a relationship. It has started off innocent enough, but I slowly feel myself unraveling back to my pathetic stalker-ish self. I feel as though the center of my world has shifted and I am hanging on every word. I know there is no possibility of ever getting to be with this person, and what I am doing is wrong and will only hurt me. I sort of hope I can learn to be content with their friendship and be there for them in every possible way. Maybe I am leading myself into temptation just to fall back into my old ways? How is it that someone I met over 7 years ago has this grasp on me? I know that if I stop myself now I will be able to safely walk away and try to go back to how things were before, but if I wait longer and start to get too attached I may not be able to leave without further emotional damage to myself and the object of my obsession. Tbough things are fine now and I am extraordinarily happy to have the opportunity I currently have, will I be able to say the same in a year? What do I do? I need to leave, right? How?

381,"Hey all, so I've never asked strangers on the internet for help before, but I am really at a crossroads here and could use some advice. I apologize if this gets a little long winded, there's a good deal of context needed before a decision has to be made. Please, any advice is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

   So this all started last spring (2018). I was a sophomore in college, and was getting to the end of my dorm life tenure. I didn't dislike it, it was just too expensive. A friend I met freshmen year, who I will call Don, was looking for some roommates to fill in, as his current one was leaving, and he wanted to get a 3 man apartment. I looked at the rent, and said yes. Don already had another guy, codename Ricky, he had met earlier that year as our third compatriot, so it all worked out great.

   Flash forward to Fall 2018. Due to some familial problems, I moved in very close to the semester start date. Unbeknownst to me, the problems between the two of them had already begun. Don is a very hot person, and has a skin condition that itches when he gets hot, so he likes the apartment to be colder. Ricky, on the other hand, weighs 100 pounds soaking wet, and can't exist in temperatures below 80f without being cold. Don and Ricky both had the idea in their head that we were planning on living communally, sharing food/supplies/whatnot, and did that for about a week or so. Don then realized that Ricky, a lad of Spanish origin, not only hates Mexican food, he will only cook and eat pasta and hot pockets. So Don decided to move to his own food schedule.

   This has all happened before I moved in. As soon as I get all settled down and the semester starts, suddenly, I find myself as a neutral third party. Both come to me, to complain about the other, which is how I learned about all this. I called on my inner Geralt and tried my best to be mediator between them, but after 4 months I ran out of steam.

The problems continued to arise, I'd do my best to level it out, and we'd move on. There were some things I had to take a side on, which I felt bad about ganging up on the other roommate, but had to for the sake of survival. For example, in the early fall, we had the AC running a lot to keep Don comfortable. That spiked our electricity bill, and so Ricky and I had to talk to Don about alternatives, since none of us can afford anything more than basic rent/utilities. In the winter, I had the exact opposite problem, where Ricky had to have it 80f in the house to make it, ""livable"", and Don and I had to explain to him we can't afford heat, put on some socks. These situations tended to be Don and I vs Ricky, who has a different view on the world than we do.

   At this stage, please allow me, dear reader, to describe my roommates. Personally, I do not like Ricky. He has habits that annoy me to no end. He doesn't have a well developed ability to read other people, and doesn't seem to be able to think critically, even though he watches and reads science content constantly. He is a clean person, his room is never dirty, and he cleans up his dishes in a timely manner. My biggest grievance is how he consumes his content. Laptop, over the speakers, in an interactive manner. What I mean is that he talks to the characters, and makes asides to nobody. At first, I thought it was for our benefit, as I've seen him display mannerisms that I've seen children use to get attention from adults, to which Don and I have both gone full wtf to. But I grew up with 2 brothers, one older, one younger, so I am well equipped to deal with it, conceal don't feel. Be a man, shove it down.

 Don is an only child. He is not equipped. Don is the one I met at the beginning of Freshmen year. He was an ambitious, driven fellow, with grand aspirations. I'd worked on a few projects with him over the course of the semesters, and we'd hung out outside of class as well. He's less of a clean guy, and he sometimes has an odor that my nose doesn't particularly like, but he's an openminded guy, and he thinks about just about everything. He keeps to himself, mostly, but has social anxiety: he reads into mannerisms a great deal. He saw someone he knows walking across campus, and they didn't greet him? He begins to wonder if they might not like him. In order to assuage these thoughts, he comes to talk to me. I don't mind having philosophical conversations, but these ""talks"" tend to last for 2+ hours, when I'm trying to procrastinate homework. He doesn't even knock, he just comes in on my shut door, regardless of time. These conversations inevitably end up being him talking, and me nodding along, agreeing with him, giving him advice as best I can.

   As for myself, I'm probably the messiest of us all. I currently have 2 bags of chips sitting on the carpet, I have 1 piece of furniture, a chair, and my bed is just a mattress. The counterbalance to these problems is that everything I have is in my room. None of my mess is in any of their space, so I'm only hurting myself. I don't eat/share resources with them, because I have to mange my money tightly (which I suspect neither of them do), and keep to myself. I learned in the spring that I can live by myself for 4 months before I start to get antsy. Between video games, books, my imagination, I'm content. I don't require social interaction as often as my roommates do, but as their friend/cohabitant, I feel obligated to help them fulfill their quotas.

   Ok, now back to the story. The culmination of Don v. Ricky was just before winter break. Ricky was making pasta, like he did every day, and he took it to his room to eat. When he came back, the pasta strainer was gone. I had already left for break, and so I heard about this over text. Immediately, I thought Don had taken the strainer, but I didn't want to believe it. We're all 20+ year old college students, surely nobody would be immature enough to problem solve that way.

   It was Don. He took it, threw it into the volleyball pit, then later put it in the trash. He confided in me when I got back from break, and I tried to get him to tell Ricky about it, who had to go out and buy a new pasta strainer. He refused, and I didn't push the issue, because by now, I was getting fed up with everything going on. Now we are having more problems. Don told me that Ricky had put a video game disk out on the counter to watch something on the Don's xbox. Don told him not to do that, and he still did it 2 more times. Don's solution to this was to remove the xbox in it's entirety. It started with the HDMI cable. Ricky came into my room, and said, ""Where's the cable for the xbox?"" To which I said I don't know, Don might know.

   As it turns out, that was the second step in Don's plan. The first step was to send Ricky a message, in which he stated that he is not happy with how things are at our apartment currently. He finished the message by saying, ""I am writing an essay for you to read that lists my complaints. It will be finished this Sunday. Please reply, ""OK"", and I will proceed with this plan. Or, don't reply, and I will assume things are going how you want.""

   My reaction was mixed. I approved of his restraint in making the decision to not antagonize Ricky, but he effectively gave him an hour to respond, then blocked his number and left our group chat. A days later, Don came into my room again to talk, and explained that he was simply cutting off communication, as he didn't feel he was in control enough to confront Ricky. I agreed, then joked around about Don giving Ricky the silent treatment. Don said that was his plan, and right at that moment, Ricky got home. it was hot in my room, because there are 2 people in there, and my PC running, so I had the door open. Ricky poked his head in and said hello, I returned it, then he went about making his dinner. 

   Don and I keep talking, and after about 10 minutes, we hear the fire alarm go off. Nothing out of the ordinary, we've had that happen before. The smell of burnt pasta wafts over to us, and we roll our eyes at each other. Then, the smoke alarm in Ricky's room starts going off. Don and I sigh, another normal day, and Ricky is dashing around, trying to push the buttons on the fire alarms to get them to stop. He asks for help, and I tell him to open a door. He continues to push the button, asking for help, and after a few seconds I finally get up, go open the front door and side door to get air flow. Kitchen alarm stops, so I go and look at Ricky, who's still pressing the button on his alarm. It won't stop, so I get up there and rip it off the ceiling and take out the battery.

   I go back to my room, and Ricky follows. Don is still in there, and Ricky says, ""Well, you coulda helped a little."" 

No response. 

""Really, Don?"" 

No response.

Ricky goes away, back to burning his noods, and eventually, Don goes back to his room. I wake up the next morning, and everything in the living room that was Don's is gone. He put the couch and tv stand in his room, leaving Ricky's tv sitting there, nicely bundled up. Ricky puts it in his room, and walks angrily around the kitchen, saying things like, ""I can't believe he's this immature,"" ""a grown man doing this"" ""just talk to me"", loudly enough to where it goes thru the walls, where I, in my room, and Don, in his, can hear. I put on my headphones and ignore the problem. A day later, Ricky is sitting at the table, doing some work and eating. He goes to his room, comes back, and the chairs are gone. According to him, Don took the chairs, and also sprinkled something on his lunch, so Ricky threw it away.

   Up until now, I haven't really been on anyone's side. I don't like Ricky very much, and, excluding the strainer situation, everything had been ""legal"", so to speak. But Ricky had just talked to me the night before about how he might not have enough money to cover rent, and can't afford to buy anything to eat (while also going out to eat everyday at his job). So when I heard that Don had sabotaged Ricky's food, I immediately thought that was over the line. When I tried to confront Don about it over text, he left me on read. I saw him earlier today, said hey, he said hey, then went into his room and locked the door for the rest of the day.

   I chose the ""deal with it later"" option, and went to do homework. I finally get it done, and see I have 2 hours left before I need to sleep, so I put on a movie I've been wanting to watch. Ricky comes into my room, and asks what I'm doing, to which I (stupidly) reply, ""eh, just watching a movie before I hit the hay."" He asks if he could watch it to, and I say, ""sure."" We get through the movie, me gritting my teeth through the ""interactive"" parts, then get my laptop and start to go to my room. I can hear really loud music playing from Don's room, and Ricky and I exchange a glance. It stops after a minute. After that, I started writing this, because I'm at wit's end.

&amp;#x200B;

   Thank you for reading my tale of woe, I apologize for it being so long, I even left out some parts. How on earth do I proceed through this? I've been offered by Don to live with him again in 2019/2020 with some other guys, but I don't know how I feel doing that after these events. If you were in my situation, what would your actions be?

383,"TL:DR: I just noticed my best friend of 8+ years hasn’t been contributing equally in our friendship— such as ignoring me when my grandmother died or allowing kids to bully me during our Senior Year of HS. I leave in two months for BMT and don’t know whether to confront her or allow this to continue, as I’m worried she’ll not see my point if I confront her yet I don’t think I can continue dealing with this any longer, even though I love her family like my own and care about her a great deal.

Okay, so for a bit of background to this long tale, me and my best friend (we’ll call her A) have been best friends for at least eight years. We’re both just over 18, so most of our childhood was spent being close friends. We’re like opposites, yet we always got along. I was/am the more emotional, outgoing person and she’s always been the more logical, introvert of us two. 

Well, we both attended this class our senior year that took up an entire half of our school day— a training class like college almost. Our teacher (we’ll call him B) was a guy, kind of a dork who was interested in things like Harry Potter and was overall a cool guy. I personally thought he was one of the cooler teachers we’ve had given I’m a huge Harry Potter fan and this class was full of them, so I wouldn’t get berated for being an oddball. My friend, who was also a minor at the time, suddenly developed a crush on this guy who’s in his late twenties. Since she’s always been the emotionless one out of the two, I’m guessing these new emotions were automatically very intense for her, so she changed every aspect of her life for this guy. She got a dog that’s the same breed as one of B’s dogs, changed her college to be an online course of the school B went to, and suddenly started reading Harry Potter (which was annoying given that I tried to get her to read the series throughout the entirety of our friendship and she hated it, yet her excuse for suddenly liking it is that she’s “matured.”)

Well, around that time, or it could’ve been going on beforehand but I just noticed it really then, she started being more self-centered, not giving equally in our friendship. Where I was always asking how she was, offering to come help her with stuff, or distract her if she’s upset— she was ignoring me, giving dull responses and changing the topic to herself, and canceling on me at the last minute. A few examples of this would be the time my grandmother died around middle of last year, it was sudden, so I had to cancel plans we had that day. A said “Aww, I’m sorry” and then ignored me for days afterwards until I messaged her again. She knew my grandma, knew how much of a huge part of my life that my grandmother was, yet never once asked if I was okay, never offered to come distract me or even come to the funeral. In fact, weeks later, she told me how she wouldn’t care if her grandparents died because they weren’t close. And when my cat— whom I’d grown up with— died shortly after, I begged her to come get me from my house, to distract me, to do something. And she came up with some tale that she couldn’t because one of her parents had her car, when the three people in that house have five working cars. 

When her dog died, I offered to come visit, to take her out somewhere to distract her, to stay up texting her or calling her. To do whatever she wanted to help her out. I wanted to make her happy, to not let her drown herself in her sadness. 

During our Senior Year, we had to ride the bus to this class that B taught, given that the school was in a separate city. A has her license, I do not. A rode with me for the beginning of the school year, but shortly began driving herself to the school— which was allowed. When kids began bullying me, throwing stuff at me on the bus, I asked her to let me carpool with her to the school and she came up with some BS that we would get in trouble, which wouldn’t happen. Even when I came into class crying (which I almost never cry in front of people) because these kids were throwing pennies at me, she did nothing. It wasn’t until the last few weeks of the school year that she let me ride with her, when the whole incident had already been taken care of. 

I didn’t quite realize until just recently, when things between her and B got more serious after a year of her crushing on him how awful she’d been to me. I don’t know if she’d always been this way or if this crush suddenly brought it about, but it hurts me to talk to her knowing I put more into the friendship than she gives back. I’m leaving in two months for the military, so I’m conflicted on how to handle talking to her. Her parents want to come to my BMT graduation and I’d love for them to, seeing as I love her family like my own, but I don’t know if I can spend these next two months trying to act like everything’s okay. I feel like if I confront her, she’ll refuse to see my point and instead think she’s in the right (as that’s what she always does when she has any sort of problem.) I’m also worried about completely ruining the friendship, as I do care about my best friend, and if something with her and B happens, I want to be there to keep her safe. But, I just don’t know what to do. 

Should I keep pretending like everything’s okay or should I say something to her? Am I overreacting/overthinking things?",31Jan2019,1

388,"Please don't skip over this post, there is a bit of a story to it but I'll get to the point soon enough.

When I was around 6/7 I remember being a little brat and not wanting to sleep in my bed, I'd often go to sleep in my parents bed. One evening before they had come up stairs, I had decided to slip into their bed. I blink, and I swear on my mothers life, it was the next day. No falling asleep, no dreams, not wriggling around. I literally shut my eyes for a split second, and it was the next day. The bed was a mess as if people had slept in it, the curtains were open and it was bright and sunny. Compared to the cold dark of the evening before. I wasn't too scared as a child because I just thought I was dreaming or something like that, but eventually I completely forgot about the fact I was dreaming. 

Fast forward to me at 14, I'm hanging out in my room, and these thoughts flood my memory and I start crying, screaming, all the times I had had over the last few years might just be made up! What if I died that night? Or I'm still asleep and I'll wake up 7/8 again! These terrified me as a teenager and basically paralyzed me mentally for around 2 weeks. I was struggling with the thoughts, and I didn't really have anyone to talk to about this. 

Fast forward to today, I've just turned 21, I wake up from a horrid nightmare I've been having recently to these thoughts flooding me again. Im with my good friend in bed and she's reassuring me and yet I'm still scared.

I know I'm probably just over reacting, and that it's probably nothing, but for a short amount of time it ruins my life for a small while. I don't know what could of caused that as a child. This whole situation makes me incredibly paranoid and makes me lack trust in my judgement sometimes. If anything happens soon I'll add updates.

390,"Hey guys. Throwaway in attempt to not be identified, not sure if anyone I work with is on here. Get ready for a novel.

So I work with animals. I’ve been working with horses about 20 years. I still work full time with horses and own two of my own.

I volunteer with dolphins. I’ve been doing this less than a year. 

I’m struggling with my volunteer work. To most, it’s pretty awesome. I get to hang out with dolphins every week, and the volunteer position offers a ton of hands on stuff, not just dirty work. When I was little, I was obsessed with dolphins and wanted to be a trainer. Eventually I found horses, and was like...meh, this will do lol. So when I found out about this volunteer position, I was super excited to fulfill some childhood dreams.

I went into it kind of on the fence about dolphins in captivity, but I’m an animal person so I also had a good understanding why you couldn’t just free the dolphins. I was thinking that I just needed more education on how these animals are kept happy, and I would go in with an open mind and learn.

At first, I really felt sick about it. Really getting up close and realizing just how small the tanks are, how boring they are, how easy dolphins get frustrated and stressed, and how they spend the majority of their time just aimlessly drifting around.

Then, for a while, I started to see and understand other things and was changing my mind a bit. I didn’t love it, but I saw how absolutely devoted all the trainers are, and could see that most of the dolphins had good relationships with them, and some seemed very excited to work. Everything was worked on in baby steps, the dolphins would dictate the pace, and how each day would go. If they weren’t feeling well or didn’t seem thrilled that day, there wasn’t any force. I could see how when they did something right and were rewarded with a whistle, excitement and a fish, they’d often get super excited and squeaky like they were so proud of themselves.

It still bothered me that you basically had to have food in order to get them to stay interested and stick around. With horses, they get their daily feed regardless of if they’re doing anything at all. Regular food isn’t given in any correlation with work or training, they just get it. Sometimes I’ll get out some treats if I’m working with a horse that’s having a particularly hard time with something, but a horse that’s worked with kindly and fairly will work for a pat and a “good boy” and be happy as a clam. My own personal horse is a workaholic, and she is super happy when she gets that “good girl.” Now, granted, because they’re on land, we have the ability to somewhat “force” them to work with us to a degree, I guess. 

Now, I find I think I’m having a moral dilemma with working with dolphins. Almost every time I’m in, at least one isn’t feeling well, and/or everyone is stressed. They get frustrated and stressed very very easily. Many are getting daily medications for ulcers. I realized several are given an anti-anxiety and sedative just to keep them relaxed. They will go off their food super easy. Some regurgitate their food and eat it again almost every time, and no one knows for sure why...but I find it disturbing. They have to have small tubes passed down their throats daily to receive fresh water, which seems miserable. 

When one is particularly unwell, they have to be put into a small pool where the water can be drained to only several inches, then they are restrained by 8-10 people for whatever procedures need done that they obviously won’t like. It may be for the best, but it sucks. They know what’s up and don’t want to go into the pool. Sometimes we have to get out a giant net to basically force them into the pool. Also, dolphins can’t get sedation, or they stop breathing. So they have to deal with everything fully aware and awake. They fight but they seem to know what they’re in for. I feel like we’re betraying them...so much time is spent earning their trust and keeping them happy and then we have to all hold them down for procedures. They’re stressed and then we stress them out more and betray their trust. I understand it’s just the way it has to be done, there’s just no other way about it and it’s often a “last resort” to go this far. But I hate it. I may be anthropomorphizing a bit, but they seem to feel defeated, and when they eventually go back to their training later that day, they seem like they know they don’t have any other option than to interact with us again.

I try to do things in between their training sessions, which occur about five times a day and last from 5-10 minutes each. I can make them toys, or do things to entertain them. But they’re very often not interested and quite bored. We’re not allowed to give direct reward or to touch them during these entertainment times. I just want to rub one and talk to them and let them know they’re a good dolphin and they don’t need to do something to get my attention but I can’t because it confuses them during their training sessions, or they might bite or try to grab at me.

One dolphin is always the outsider to the others and is often alone, or the others are blocking her from going into other areas. She also has been eating paint chips.

They will sometimes beat the shit out of the dividers between the pools with their tails if they’re agitated and sometimes break them.

The past two times I was there, one of them has been “beaching” himself on a very shallow part at the side of the pool used for them to slide up on for tricks and other training. He’ll slide up there in his own time, and just sit and whistle quietly to himself. Sometimes he’ll thrash about a bit, even though he knows how to just slide back off. I may not be super educated on dolphins but this doesn’t seem like a normal, healthy behavior. I believe in the wild they only beach themselves if they are very sick. He’s not sick. He appears to just be that bored.

I really struggled this past time when the dolphin who is usually on her A-game...loves to work, super excited, really goes all out on her tricks...was not well. They think it was stress. She wouldn’t eat a thing. She just mindlessly drifted around the pool all day throwing a ball for herself, or taking the ball and sitting at the bottom of the pool. She had to be put into the small pool and be drained and restrained for at least three days in a row. Which is stressful. But she needed meds that she wouldn’t eat. I felt horrible.

Now I’m aware that everyone there is there for the right reasons and they care. I get that these dolphins cannot exist in the wild and even moving to a more natural seaside pen would be incredibly risky. They don’t know what not to eat. They may become so stressed that they don’t eat at all because they’re all used to a plain pool and nothing else. Everyone there cares a ton and is trying to do their best to care for these dolphins and only wants to see them happy and healthy. The things they have to do to make that happen that seem less than ideal, are literally the only way to do things. Most other zoo type animals have a more natural looking habitat but we can’t give one of the most intelligent animals in captivity anything but a plain blue pool because they would make themselves sick ingesting things they shouldn’t. I assume out of boredom, I guess even a more natural habitat still wouldn’t be quite stimulating enough for a dolphin to spend up to 50 years in.

Should I stay because I’m at least helping a little with an underfunded program or should I leave because I feel like nothing I’m doing is really making them happy...just keeping them alive and from being miserable? I feel awful because they ask you to commit to a year and I’ve only been there 4 months. I’m a volunteer so they can’t make me stick it out. But every time I’m there, I have a lump in my throat and a knot in my stomach and I hate having to participate in restraint and watching them just aimlessly drift about most of the day. I hate the fact that they are so used to this life in small blue pools and have become so dependent on people that they couldn’t care for themselves and often get scared or stressed. But I know this is basically all that there can be for these dolphins, and I know the people there have nothing to do with the dolphins being in captivity in the first place and are doing their best. That said though, none of them seem to share my sentiment, and I feel like they don’t see anything wrong with the way things are. Anytime I ask about why a dolphin is doing a certain behavior that I find odd and unsettling, I’m often met with a shrug and a dunno, and it’s brushed off as normal. 

On the other hand, I’m not sure if I’m being hypocritical. I work with horses and I ride, and there are people out there that feel what I do is not good for the horses, either. And I’ll definitely admit there is a lot of evil in the horse world and a lot of suffering horses out there. I quit working for professional riders and focusing on showing because I saw a lot of situations where the horses were stressed, unhappy, forced, in pain, pushed too hard too fast, and/or downright miserable. There were a lot of times where they weren’t put first and people anthropomorphize horses often and it’s a huge disservice to the animal (“they’re just being a jerk” “you need to demand their respect” “he needs to get over himself” etc etc)  

But, I see horses as a different situation. First, they’re domesticated. They’ve been working with humans for thousands of years. Second, they aren’t as smart as dolphins...smart yes, but it’s far easier to keep a horse happy. As a grazing, prey animal, all they want/need is plenty of food to graze on most of the day, water, shelter, some exercise, and a friend or two. Give them that and 95% of horses are perfectly happy. They don’t need changes of scenery. Most don’t necessarily need any mental stimulation beyond some interaction with a friend. Really we can mimic the life they’d have if they were wild pretty well. Like I said before, they get their food with no trade off...they just get it. When it comes to working, training, and riding horses, if you are kind and fair, your horse should develop a really incredible relationship with you, and you can improve their lives. If done well, there won’t be any yanking or pulling, fear or otherwise. You can train a horse to respond to the tiniest shift of weight. I’ve known many horses who thrive in work. My own, like I said, is a workaholic. She loves getting something right and lives for that praise. 

I can, and will (often) just go and hang out with the horses with no agenda and scratch them, talk to them, maybe give them treats for no reason. Sometimes I literally just take them for a walk, and occasionally will just take a horse for a hike like you would a dog. I can’t do much of anything to make a dolphin happier in spare time.

I also guess I feel hypocritical because my current job with horses does have some less than ideal situations for those horses. I only have so much power here. But, that said, we do provide them with all their basic needs, so they’re generally content. Some of them are nervous or unhappy in work, but I have the ability here to work with the horses I see are struggling, and help them. I know I’ve made a significant impact in a lot of horses lives over my career. I can see them clearly have a positive change in attitude and ability. 

I also don’t know if I’m being hypocritical because of course we have horses that are balls of stress that have ulcers and other ailments. Of course we have to medicate some animals to keep them together healthwise. And we also have to do things to them that they really don’t like in order to maintain health, like with the dolphins. That said though, we can sedate horses. They aren’t as intelligent, or perhaps they really do kind of “get it”, and if you’re kind and fair the majority of the time, they’re really quick to forgive if you have to do something they really dislike. A dolphin doesn’t seem to forgive so easy, but they have to come work with a human anyway because that’s the only way they get to eat.

I dunno. I’m so torn here. I just feel wrong when I’m with the dolphins and my stomach just knots up. I feel guilty and so bad for them. I don’t like them in captivity at all. But it’s their only optional reality. So part of me thinks I should stick it out and just keep helping with all the things, like it or not. Even though I feel like I’m participating in making them feel awful sometimes.

But I’m wondering if I’m being hypocritical, because we keep horses captive, we ride them sometimes, we do things they don’t like sometimes. But I truly feel like the situations are a bit different...the animals are different, their needs and intelligence are different, one is domesticated, and I can and do do a lot of things to make sure horses I work with are happy. I see the difference in horses when I work with one, and have turned more than a few horses around from unhappy or stressed into calm, happy, curious, confident and even playful partners. You can tell what horses I’ve worked with a lot, they’re the ones in the barn with their heads sticking out of their stalls nearly all the time, looking with interest at anyone that goes by and tries to solicit some sort of attention...and will be extremely happy with a treat, but perfectly happy just to get a pet. They lead politely, and they show curiosity in their work. They’re always engaged. They have big personalities. I have the direct ability to make a horse genuinely happy. 

I’d really like to hear input on this. And please please please know that I understand that not ALL captive dolphins may have this exact situation, and not ALL horses are treated sucky in the show world or whatever. These are my own experiences.

TL;DR:  I volunteer with dolphins, but kind of want to quit because I don’t like the reality of the kind of life we can make for them. But I don’t know if I’m being hypocritical because of my work with horses.

391,"I'll try to keep this short, but what I'm looking for is some real, genuine friends.

Since I moved to another country for my job with my SO and left everything behind, I find that **real** friends are VERY hard to come by. The friends I had back home turned out to not be genuine, as they completely dropped me after the move.

I tried to keep up contact but they made it clear they didn't want to make an effort for someone who lives so far away.

&amp;#x200B;

As for people here, I only have some 'friends from work'. And those are the 'how's the weather' kind of friends, rather than people you can have deep conversations with or ask advice of. I tried a few times, but it bit me in the ass (I got a new function and some of them turned super salty after that).

All I'm looking for is someone who's just nice, friendly, and wants to be friends. I try to give a lot to people and do nice things for them, but it seems they really couldn't care less so I gave up on that.

Does anyone have some advice they'd like to share with me? How do you make a friend who you've got a real connection with, who you can trust not to stab you in the back?

397,"Hi, I babysit every day after school from 3:10-5:00, however I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. First off, I’m only a junior in high school, and when I agreed to babysit two years ago, it was only from 3:50 to around 4:30. This year I agreed and then found out that I would have to babysit from 3:10 to 4:30, however the mother doesn’t get home everyday until 5:00. Also, anytime that there is an early dismissal, day off, or cancellation I’m immediately asked if I can watch them. I honestly feel like I’m their nanny, and that they don’t realize that I’m only a teenager who has my own life. Half the time the father or mother will tell me that they’ll be home earlier, but still don’t show up until 5:00, without even a text saying they’ll be late. I feel like I have no free time, I get home from school and then 30 minutes later I have to babysit. I don’t get home from babysitting until after 5, and by the time I take a shower, eat dinner, and do my homework, it’s already late and time to start getting ready to go to bed. I feel like I have no free time to do anything with friends or to even just have some time alone. Do you think that I’m being taken advantage of? I just feel like them constantly asking me to watch their kids on my days off and staying so much later doesn’t show any consideration for the fact I’m not their nanny, just a teenager that’s trying to help out. I completely understand that in a few years I’m going to have so many more responsibilities, and that the parents aren’t just doing whatever when I’m babysitting, they are doing work too. I just feel like the parents don’t realize that I’m young, stressed out about school, and don’t want to spend my days off babysitting. It’s almost like they expect me to plan my days off around them. Especially on cancellation days, the second the school calls it the mother texts me, and there’s not even a way for me to say I can’t.

And i'm not going to or i will be yelled at and fired on the spot.  

The problem i'm having is that there is a big chance i'll be invited to an interview with the companies in question.

404,"Hi guys. First time here.. I'm just gonna jump into this and it's gonna be long. I'm sorry!

 I met a guy through a Twitch streamers Discord. At first we just chatted about games and nerdy things. Normal friend stuff.  After not even a week he starts saying he has feelings for me and that all the girls he has tried dating before have made fun of him and told him to ""kill himself."" I tell him that I'm not that type of person, cause I'm not. And that I'm sorry he experienced those things. 

Anyway, he continues on and on about how friendly and wonderful and nice I am and how he hopes I give him a chance. I tell him I don't date online and am not comfortable trying to pursue a relationship with someone I've never met in person. Also, we've only been talking a week or so at this point. He then starts trying to plan a trip out to meet me. I tell him this is moving WAY too fast and that I'm uncomfortable meeting so soon. He gets offended and upset for a bit. He says that he doesn't know if he can ""take being rejected again"" and just wants a chance. I tell him that I'm not saying absolutely no to meeting one day but that right now it's  too soon. He says he understands and we move along..

He begins telling me he gets depressed sometimes and has tried committing suicide in the past. Again, I try being a support and talking to him as  a friend. He says he doesn't know if he could ""take another heartbreak."" He says the thought of me being taken by another guy is bothering him and he's upset he'd never get a chance with me. I tell him straight up that it sounds like he's telling me not to date people until him and I meet. He swears that's not the case. He goes on again about past rejections, suicide attempts, depression. 

At this point I'm well aware there's something not right and that this is not healthy. I make things very clear with him: I tell him I will be dating people and that it's normal for people my age to so this. I encouraged him to do the same. Once he reads that I'm planning on going on dates you can imagine he does not take it well. I end of falling asleep during my conversation with him cause it was getting late and I was in bed. 

I wake the next morning to a message on Discord from a random account saying this guy I've been messaging with was in the hospital. Unrelated to a previous accident he had. Kind of hinting that he hurt himself. Almost certain this is either the guy himself on a different account or a close friend he's told to message me. Anyway, I send the guy a message straight away telling him that what he's doing is completely unfair and unhealthy. I say that if he is really feeling that way to please get help and that I would never judge him for seeking professional help. I end it at that. I get a message from him just a few minutes ago saying ""Hey...."" And that's it. I haven't responded.

TL;DR.. This guy I met online is pretty much saying he'd hurt himself if I won't give him a chance or I start seeing other people. I've know him only a week or so now.   

How the hell do I get myself out of this? Can I just stop responding? I don't want the guy to actually hurt himself and I doubt he would but there's this nagging little part in my brain saying ""What If?"" ",31Jan2019,1

413,"## How do I use a condom?

**The first thing you want to do is make sure your penis is erected (hard) before you roll on a condom. The condom should be put on before it touches your partner’s genital area or their mouth. It should also be worn for the whole duration of having sex. This is the only way to help protect you against pregnancy and STDs (including ones caused by pre-ejaculation).**

1. **Start to peel the wrapper carefully so you do not damage the condom. Do NOT use your teeth or scissors to do this.**
2. **The rim of the condom should be on the outside when you take it out of the package. Do not reverse or flip up the condom while you put it on. You can unroll the condom a little bit to see if it can be easily rolled down.**
3. **Pinch the top part of the condom and place it over the head of your penis. Leave a little space at the top. This allows the sperm to be collected at the top.**
4. **All you have to do now is unroll the condom all the way down to the bottom. You can add a few drops of lubricant to the end of the condom once it is on.**

**To remove the condom, simply holy the rim of the condom and slowly pull the penis out of your partners body. You would want to do this before your penis goes soft and the condom becomes loose. If this happens, semen can come out of the condom.**

**Move away from your partner so you don’t get semen on them and remove the condom. Wrap the condom with the original wrapping or with a tissue and throw it in the garbage. Do not flush condoms down the toilet.**

My now job, at a call center ( I am a Quality Analyst), a girl was making fart noises on purpose and I heard someone say, stop doing that twice. I thought they were referring to the noises so I asked the girl doing it to stop. She got angry and basically said I was being a bitch because the other girl only told her to stop saying she was making those sounds. Of course I didn’t know this so I told her, that I didn’t mean to come across that way however she got pissy and was like fuck you.

417,"I could have 4 engineering degrees, math, English, German, philosophy, history, or physics degree in 2 years whichever way I go. My credits are so spread out and varied. I really dislike America, tried to kill myself 3 times now; hate engineering, and now it is revealed we're so well off I never need to work ever. But I am an old loser with no degree, and it disgusts me to think of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I ranted. I am so torn: either way loser there or here, 2 years of misery for worthless 'prestige', or go there and say I have nothing to show to my name. At least there we're in the upper class and it's a paradise.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just abandon my engineering degree(s) to live on the Mediterranean where we are ruling class in that country, or do I stay miserable in America for at least 2 years. I am 25, three universities, four degrees, and engineering courses do not transfer so 2 years from whatever degree. And I really hate engineering but not the theory, so I'd end up doing math or physics and it'd have to be post-graduate level to get to the area of my interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to do philosophy. ""The math is easy for you so why not do engineering and phil in your spare time"", and ""What are you going to do with a phil degree: teach?""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, ""Oh well you don't need to work. You can forget your degree. Go to the country with the beach and where we're upper class."" I hate everyone and myself so much.

&amp;#x200B;

It is disgusting to myself to be so old with no degree, but I had some very-- I should be dead 10x over--illnesses. Now I just have no motivation, and I basically have taught myself beyond taking these little individual classes, but of course I focused on the theoretical math, not the application so whatever little trick they throw in-- it's this way because that how it is in real life --would probably make me fail their tests since memorizing special cases of this or that random tangentially related thing is not what I was aiming for while learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I was supposed to have this done at 20 at latest, in the hardest best paying branch of engineering at a very well-respected private school in a city with a global top revenue company HQ where my Father is near the top of with all my relatives being engineers too at the same company very high up.

&amp;#x200B;

And now after illnesses, I don't remember years of my life. I don't feel 25. And I am repulsed that I have nothing accomplished.

&amp;#x200B;

The thought of going over there and starting fresh is sounding nice now, but I tell people I have what to my name? The engineering degree was for prestige it carries over there. I'll always do math and physics in my spare time, but I need something to my name, and unfortunately, no American University of worth does the older style depth of understanding evaluation just tests and thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

And I've tried to kill myself three times, so it may be best I do go. How I miss both jugulars by millimeters amazed the ER, and it really irritated me.

&amp;#x200B;

I love academics, but I hate university, and I have gotten to a point that is at a much higher level than undergraduate, but I truly hate America-- born and raised here, I just find this entire society awful. To feel alone in a city, not knowing your neighbors, this middle class meekness; it's a peeling veneer of civilized society masking pure selfish individualism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Waste more of life here hopefully don't kill myself for something to show as an accomplishment for the sake it and never working, or do I go over there a loser and just sit on the beach? Both options I hate; I've lost years of my life due to illness already but to not even have a college degree? I was on track to have it at 20.

&amp;#x200B;

Loser here but finally a worthless prestigious degree, or loser there but beach, money, I guess a wife now at this age. 

&amp;#x200B;

The never having to work made me lose my motivation after recovering, but then seriously depressed I am this old and a loser, something no one expected.",31Jan2019,1

I'm creating a website for a junk removal company and I'm the process of making there online order form and need some input on how to make it as easy as possible for people! 

If you have a minute to spare I'd love it you could answer these questions: 

1) When you are ordering a service (junk removal, house cleaning, furniture delivery, furniture pick-up) would you prefer to do it over text, email, or the phone? 

2) When browsing service companies do you keep a budget in mind?  
3) When you are ordering a service would you take additional steps to ensure that the quote given is accurate or prefer quick and easy action to get a semi- accurate quote?  
4) If you do want an accurate quote how would you prefer to provide the information/details (checking off items, adding items into a web page, telling us item size, telling us number or items, telling us room size, sending us a picture)?  
5) If it requires extra steps to make the quote accurate would that deter you from completing the order?

Can you let me know your age, so I know how much of a variety of users I have.

421,"I'm sure this is a fairly common question around here but I figure I'll post it anyway to get some outside views. I'm currently a freshman at Furman University which is located in Greenville, SC. I'm originally from Bluffton which is about 4 hours south near the bottom of the state.

The basic gist is this: I am struggling to make any friends on campus. I don't really fit the 'preppy kid' demographic that a lot of people at this school fit in to. Not to say that's everyone and I have met a few people I like, but I lack any real connections here. It didn't help that me and my gf of nearly 4 years (so basically high school) broke up shortly after I got here since she went to a different school. It's worth noting that I'm glad it ended, we weren't a very good couple but it still messed me up a lot.

I like this school, the food is good, the professors are mostly competent, and the scenery is gorgeous. I'm considering transferring to College of Charleston though on account of a few things: some of my closest friends are there, it's closer to home, it will likely be cheaper due to the amount of credits I'd have there from AP courses that didn't apply at Furman, and I love the city. The one downside is that Cofc isn't as reputable a school as Furman and the degree simply won't be as impressive (I'm undeclared as of now).

So it's between this for me, a better degree at the cost of what may be an unexciting four years or a less impressive degree but where I can enjoy my college experience. My parents are supportive either way. I have class now actually so if I missed anything please ask for clarification, and thanks in advance for any advice given! ",31Jan2019,1

I’ve applied to do a foundation degree in Mental Health (and a few other options) at my local college. I’ve also been invited to a job interview at a different nursing home which is very close to my partner and the college.

428,"Also posted this in a couple of Career places so sorry if you double-see this!

So I’m 22M, and live and work in London UK. I’m an IT Recruiter (like a combo of sales and headhunting for people who don’t know).

I’ve been in my current company for 2 years as of next month, and I’m kinda feeling like I’ve hit the ceiling here.

The company used to be a sales nightmare apparently. Loads of negative reviews online, horror stories from current and ex staff, the boss has a very set way of doing things, and when I joined 2 years ago I experienced some of that. I stuck it out however, whilst a lot more people left, and I think due to this mass exodus and some pressure from the leftover employees, the company changed a lot.

We moved from a stuffy corporate office block into a cool WeWork, which is a colocation building with fancy rooms and nice furniture, free coffee and beer, free breakfast and loads of other little features. Full of small companies, sole traders, startups and digital scale ups, it’s decent.

Our office shrank from about 30 people in 2015 (before I was here) to about 15 when I joined in 2017 and is now just 3 people + the boss (who doesn’t work or come in the office more than once every week or so).

The dress code changed from suited &amp; booted to smart casual, and I manage to stretch that to basically casual when the Boss isn’t in. I also have a very good relationship with the 2 people left that I work with.

However, I’m on a £24k salary (I threatened to leave back when others did to bump me up to that) and I’m worth more than that for a Recruiter with 2 years’ experience and a solid sales record. I know I could go elsewhere and get £28-32k, because I’ve spoken to my ex-colleagues who’ve done exactly that, and I know my boss would at most give me £25-26k because no one gets good salaries here. My Manager is on £30k with 10 years’ experience when he should be on like £50k

My benefits package here as well, apart from WeWork, is awful. Minimum holiday, no sick pay, no pension, no other benefits to mention. I could definitely get better than that too, maybe a nice phone or a laptop or more holiday etc..

My dilemma is this. I am comfortable where I am, physically, but the salary will never rise and the package around it sucks. Do I move or am I being hasty?

Thanks in advance for any advice given.

TLDR: Financially and mentally stagnant in a job I'm otherwise comfortable within but eager to earn and learn more. What should I do?",31Jan2019,1
430,"  

Hello All, I am concluding a week-long pity party for myself and wanted to share my story, hopefully get advice

So, just to give background into maybe why I am the way I am lol

I am 33 years old, 1 of my parents die when I was 11 and then had to take care of my younger siblings (we were 11, 5, and 1 month at the time) so I always had some issues with letting people in, and I also built my life around my younger siblings and didn’t have a social life till in my 20’s. I only had 1 boyfriend at 24 (for 6 months). Just before I turned 30 and I was with what felt like ‘empty-nest syndrome’ I decided I wanted to have my own family (always did, always imagined it, never put in the work to create that). I went on eHarmony and basically after a few dates, I found someone, fell in love and had what I thought was my karma for the terribleness of my childhood and emptiness of my early adulthood.

However, after living together and getting a dog together my boyfriend, realized he was in some debt, so he moved 3 hours away for a job and basically thought it would be best if I stayed behind so he could really focus on his goals. LOL I Laugh because I really tried to show how we could be a team etc… anyway we split because I did not like doing this long distance relationship and it just made me feel really bad. I guess that’s part of my insecurity and to be 100% honest there was, a feeling of jealousy where he would be in a fully beautiful furnished apartment, I would be struggling in a sh\*tty town. He was going to still help financially but I rather us work together and achieve financial goals than this odd setup. If I was his fiancé or wife I would’ve stuck in it, but this definitely seems like he’s afraid to break up and he’s trying to kindly phase me out.

So anyway, here I am. LOL I have no great skills, barely any family, and a handful of close friends. I only know how to be a homemaker sadly. 

For work, I work as a caregiver, personal assistant, dog walker and I do love it. If sometimes the business isn’t strong (because I don’t work for a company I do it on my own) I get a regular office job as I have admin experience. Basically, that’s how I like it. I would love stability, but I’ve never had it in my life, so I don’t seem to attract that and I definitely don’t seek it in my career. A you can probably tell I am someone who can’t just work for money I have to feel like there’s a deeper meaning or purpose to my job. (I’m an INFP personality type btw)

I always wanted my own family/ child and it just seems like that is not in the cards for me. I only want a child with someone who genuinely loves me and wants the child. I would never force someone into marriage or anything else, because it doesn’t work. 

So, I have my adorable little dog, who I do treat like a child. LOL and this were something else I was fighting against I did not want to look like a weirdo or one of those ‘childless women’ And I sadly don’t have much of a career either, so again this is my insecurity, but I feel like people must look at me like, damn your life went nowhere.

My current living situation is I am renting a room (which I have to be out of my May) living in the bitterly cold north east. I need a change, especially from where I am living. 

I feel like I will never have the dream of the white picket fence and to be honest I didn’t put my work into my so-called dreams because of fear. I’ve noticed in my life things seem to go best when I just go with the flow and don’t fight against myself or ‘destiny’ 

I want to give myself 3 months to save up money and then I need to move to a place where I can live the life, I am meant to live

I have done something like this before, when my youngest sibling went away to college, I got in my car drove across the country and lived in Los Angeles California for 3 months. It was awesome but I couldn’t find a job and I my grandmother was dying back home. Now I just want to ‘live in the sun’ I am already a nature girl, and I have never liked winter (that’s when the lose of family members and relationships have occurred the most). 

My top requirements for where I want to live, are dog friendly, close proximity to water or mountains, SUNSHINE- better weather than the Northeast

My 3 places that I would like to start a new adventure are 

Long Beach, CA 

Asheville, NC 

Tampa or Miami, FL

My really good friend lives in Long Beach so that's why I would want to go there, but it seems like it would be the most expensive to live definitely would have to have a roommate. 

I have acquaintances spread out in Florida but I really don't know anyone so Florida or NC would really be going into blind, but the move and everything else to get there and live there would be economical.

So, I don't know can anyone give me advice or motivation, on what to do next. 

I'm obviously devastated my relationship didn't work out but I feel like there's no use in even trying to get back together till he works on his goals. The memories are suffocating.",31Jan2019,1

434," I got mostly meaningless moralistic posturing in r/AmItheAsshole . I would like some advice on how to improve my philosophy.

Material things are more valuable to me than humans. I'm a pretty passive person. I would never purposely harm anyone. The reasoning behind my philosophy is that interpersonal relationships are more expendable/replaceable than material objects. To be fair, I'm too young to get a job or income. My parents have provided me with a comfortable middle class lifestyle, but they never spent their income on what I wanted.

The value of something is determined by its scarcity. For me, money is extremely difficult to come by. I've lived my entire life outclassed by my peers in terms of money (clothing, vacations, shoes, airpods, etc.). Whenever I go to school, there are over a thousand students. People are a dime a dozen. All replaceable. Like cattle. Like vermin. Humans multiply quickly as well. 9 months is all it takes for another one to be created. Another superfluous piece of biomass I have to share this planet with.

Contrast that with my possessions. I have an unusual hobby that I won't name for anonymity. The stuff I buy for my hobby is far more exotic and rare than any human. In addition, they (my possessions) never move away, get angry, grow to hate me, or die. All things that humans are prone to, unfortunately.

Emotional investment in objects is far less risky than humans. In addition, you can't tell if your friend you've been talking to for years hates you behind your back. If people were riskless investments, the divorce rate wouldn't be 50%.

""What about your parents/family??"", you moral philosophers say. I don't have a high opinion of either. Your parents are literally chosen for you and you have no choice in the matter. Do some research about the [veritable cocktail of hormones](http://files.webb.uu.se/uploader/271/BIOKand-13-027-Lagerlof-Jessica-Sammanfattning.pdf) that make reproduction and child rearing possible.

**I would hardly call any affection from relatives genuine when their behavior is written into their genes, not to mention the consequences of abusing/neglecting your child. It's like commending your butler for quick service because you're holding them at gunpoint**. They have no choice and neither do you. Also they dislike me as a person, so why should I feel anything for them.",31Jan2019,1
435,"I got a bill yesterday for over $500 for electricity in my two-bedroom apartment with a friend. We live in a cold city and the apartment is part of an old house. Last month's electric bill was $240 which was also pretty high but this one is insane!

436,"Hi, I’m a girl and I’m just sixteen. I’ve been homeschooled since I was 14 due to medical issues, so I don’t have a ton of friends. I did have a couple really good friends that stuck with me through the transition of public school to home school, but I had a major issue with both of them. One was male and admitted out of the blue to having romantic feelings for me, which I unfortunately did not return. It destroyed our friendship, and I miss his company a ton but I didn’t want to lead him on by falsely saying I returned his feelings. The same happened with my female best friend which shocked me. She did physically touch me a lot (hugs, cuddling when hanging out, holding my hand) but I thought it was just a typical thing for a girl friend to do. It shocked me when she told me that she had romantic feelings for me, and while I’m not against being in a relationship with a girl I simply didn’t have those kind of feelings for my best friend. So I’ve fallen out with both of the people that I leaned on the most all because they showed that kind of interest in me. Since then I’ve tried making friends on reddit now and then when I get very lonely, and recently I’ve found someone that I click with a lot. They’re interested in all the things I am, and they’re easy to talk to. However, they’ve told me after about two months of just texting(not even voice call) that they’ve fallen for me romantically. I don’t understand or see what could be so appealing about me that people I consider friends continue to tell me this, I’m even thinking it might be a cruel joke to end friendships with me? He tells me that I’m kind, understanding, and he looks forward to talking to me each day. I see all these things as something a friend should be, not necessarily a romantic partner.

I'd like to start by saying my mum is genuinely one of my best friends, we're very close so this is so annoying for me. 
I moved back in with my parents when me and my husband broke up when I was 16 weeks pregnant, I had a rough pregnancy and ended up spending most of it on bedrest/minimal movement, as a result of this my parents ended up looking after my toddler alot. As they've helped out so much its put me in a position where I feel like I am unable to parent my children the way I want to. 

My mum is very sensitive and for the most part acts like a petulant teenager when she doesn't get her own way, an example of this... I told my dad that I didn't like the way she kept getting my sons hair cut and I didn't know how to say something without upsetting her, she read the message, spent an entire day crying and didn't speak to me for 2 days. It's gotten to apoint where I genuinely feel awkward telling her not to do things or what I want to do in terms of my children because it creates such an atmosphere. My youngest is 5 months old and has basically had a cold since he was 3 weeks old 🤦‍♀️ he's been going swimming lessons on a Saturday morning and because of the weather being so cold, him having a temperature on and off for the last couple days and his cough I said I didn't want him going this week. She is now not talking to me, is in a mood upstairs in her bedroom doing the ironing.

443,"So I have a bit of an awkward situation potential. I had an interview for a graduate job today that went well. However they asked me if I could work full time within 4 weeks. I like the autistic I am, said yea sure I only have my uni dissertation to worry about. However In reality i also need to be I n at least 2 days a week at the moment with the other modules I'm doing. 

In about 4 weeks most of my uni stuff will have ended minus the dissertation. So I could maybe get away with it. The recruiter whom contacted me and works for the same company told me they could work with the fact I'm still at uni, and I could start part time.  But this was before the interview. 

What should I do? Should I contact the head recruiter or should I contact the guy who would be my boss and interviewed me?

448,"I hate college and now I've failed a repeat semester, so I threw away \~€1000 of my parents money.. I'm now dropping out.

I had an interview for an electrician apprenticeship last week that I'm waiting to hear back on.. I don't know if it's even something I want to do. It's with a well regarded company, pays relatively well, there's opportunities of training up into electrical instrumentation or going up to degree level.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me just wants to fuck off and play music for a living, get a job in a bar, start busking, playing open mics, meet musicians, form a band, write songs etc.. maybe make a career directly from music or songwriting..

I've played for years, but I never had any friends involved in it.. it was always just me, I'm tired of keeping to my bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard enough knowing I fucked up and cost my parents a fortune I can't imagine getting an offer for an apprenticeship and turning it down to play music.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just tired of letting everyone done.. but I'm also tired of being a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing to say I'll definitely get apprenticeship anyway, but I think the interview went quite well, there's a 4 week trial period where they see if you're a good fit and you get to decide if it's for you, so that's a benefit.

  
Most people will say 'so give it a go! you can still play music anyway'.. yes and no.

I live with my parents, the money from the apprenticeship wouldn't be enough to live off for the first year or so, let alone live in the city (I commute to college), plus I would need to run a car and buy equipment, so I would be living with my parents.

If I was to start a career in music I would move.. I'm sick of living with my parents and the city I go to college in.

Not to mention the hours.. it's 7am to 5pm everyday, I can be commuting 2hrs each way.. working overtime one weekends etc. 

I don't even know if I want to be an electrician.. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I was to go the music route I would need to work and live from home for awhile, save money and move.  
That could mean moving to a different part of Ireland, England or Europe.. America isn't possible with visas etc.

Within the last two years, I've been able to get my BMI into the lower range of normal, but since I have the tendency to rapidly lose weight if I fall ill or have a CVS episodes, my general practitioner wanted me to try to gain more, so I had slightly above average BMI. It took me months of weight gain drinks, rich, heavy foods, counting calories so I got enough every meal, and when I got to the target weight, I realized that I *hated myself*. 

None of my dresses fit without a corset, I gained a bit of a double chin, *none of my pretty dresses fit*.

Hey Reddit, I need your help. (Also, first post here, sorry for any format issues and so on).

I’m in a tricky situation. I moved to a new high school in January of last year, for personal reasons. Upon meeting my new classmates, I met a girl. She is very cute and smart, and I think she might be my type. 

I don’t live in the US, I live in a European country, and the main language here is not English. English is most probably the language I feel most comfortable speaking/interacting in. I speak the local language fairly well, however, I only use it when I really need to, f.e. during lessons or at the doctor, and I only speak to my friends in English.

Now, this girl I have a crush on was born and grew up here, hence she speaks the language flawlessly. She likes English, but she never really uses it. You could say she feels the opposite of what I feel, language-wise.

I have never really interacted with her, we barely ever talked. I am never around her except for in the school environment. The only times outside that is probably when we take the bus to school every morning and back, as we live close to each other. However, I don’t really talk to her on the bus either. This is a result of my insecurity/shyness and the “language barrier” between us. 

Common interests? Not really, nothing worth noting/paying attention to. And she has not shown any signs of interest towards me, at least not any I can recall at the moment.

What do you think I should do? Any advice?",31Jan2019,1

I could make excuses but it’s my fault, I forgot to plug in my phone and the alarm did not go off because it was dead. My prof. Has a pretty strict no retake policy so things are not looking good. If I were to get an 80 on every other exam including the final along with 100s on all the online homework/quizzes I would be able to get a 70 C. I already bought the book/access code (110$) and withdrawing from the class would force me to pay bright futures (my scholarship) around 650-700$. I’m not really sure what to do here, on one hand it is still possible for me to pass this course, but I would need to work quite hard and make no mistakes (don’t know if any of you have taken statistical methods 1 and could shed some light on how easy or hard the course is) but even getting a C would bring down my gpa, which is at 3.9 now. On the other hand withdrawing from the class would leave a not so nice W on my record and force me to pay a months worth of rent in addition to having a worthless access code, but I would not need to worry about my gpa being affected or stress about maintaining a perfect record in that class.

Lets get straight to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

I left an anonymous note in the box of my school counselor. The counselor had a ""talk"" with all five people involved (rapist and watchers) and they denied everything, and said whoever put that note in his box was lying. There was technically no proof of it actually happening, to the counselor at least, so they won't take further action until real proof is given to him and the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that M17 took a flash photo, like I thought. It spread around most of the school but no one so far has reported it to the faculty or police. I've been getting harassed for the past few days now, with people showing me the photo asking ""is this you?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too scared to show the photo to the faculty, because it technically doesn't show my rapist's full face or my full face so they *could* just say its unreliable evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the police station yesterday, and reported the crime. No one was dumb enough to actually send me the photo, so I just told the police the names of everyone involved and there is evidence on their phones. I was told they would look into it. Hopefully my rapist and the four onlookers get arrested.

471,"This is partial rant/need advice on how to handle this situation.  I'm a sophomore at a University taking a 300 lvl writing course.  We were instructed to form groups, and my group happens to be with three Chinese transfer students. Two of them speak little to no English, and one speaks/writes understandably (but not very eloquently).  Our 12pg research paper is due on Monday (giving me about 4 days).  As of yesterday, they let me know that they are going to just pay somebody to write the whole thing.  I was kind of taken back, because it puts me in a really awkward position.

Since none of them speak great English, they were hoping I could explain the paper/prompt to the guy writing the paper for us, and then they would pay for it (or indirectly their parents would, I assume). So essentially I would be the one getting everything done, even when it came to cheating. Awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, none of them can write very well and it must be very challenging to write a complex research paper as a group.  I can understand them wanting help on it but doing literally nothing and paying someone seems wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, THEY decided to sign up for the class.  Although it shouldn't be my problem, now it is.  I grouped with them because of proximity on the first day of class.

So what are my options here?  I can either tell them to figure out their part of the paper while I write my piece, or I can go through with letting someone write the whole thing and cheating through a course I didn't intend to.  I suppose a third choice would be to tell the professor what's going on but I don't want anything to happen to them.  Regardless, I'm just stressed about getting this paper done.  

Any/all advice is appreciated as I really don't know what to do in this situation.  Part of me feels like I'm going to end up having to write the entire thing unless I find someone to write it for us (something I don't want either).

I decided to confront my husband on the things that were bothering me. I let him read my original post and the replies. It seemed to have an effect on him, seeing where I was coming from and what I was feeling not expressed to him.

He got very defensive about not taking any initiative in family activities. He pretty much said he does not plan things to do because he does not care what we do, and not in a terrible ""I don't care"" way, but that he does not have an opinion doesn't care. Is it that hard to care where we eat when we go out or to decide on something for dinner? Its not torture for him to choose something for us to watch together on TV or a movie is it? Last summer (2018) I left the vacation planning to him, and we didn't go anywhere, I ended up taking the kids to a hotel with a pool so they would have some sort of vacation. He did come, but didn't swim or participate anymore than being present. It really frustrates and hurts me, I would like him to have an opinion about stuff, and plan things because it gets old on me to plan it all, and I don't want him to wake up one day when our kids are 20 and realize that he missed all the good times because he was indifferent and then be bitter for the rest of his days.

He did admit that he has been down or depressed since he cut his sugar intake, and also admitted he has really bad eating habits that contributed to his drastic weight loss. He does not eat all day, then comes home and is hardly hungry, maybe eats 1000-1500 calories a day. That contributed to his huge weight swing, he went from almost 170 down to about 130. Now he has ""stabilized"" he says at about 148-150.

He told me that since he quit eating sugar he feels like a different person inside, that his mind seems to have turned on him and that he has anxiety about things, and feels down a lot. He feels down about his body, his job, where his life is etc etc. I told him maybe exercise would help with all his bad feelings,and anxiety, just to take his mind off it but that middle school hates PE child comes out and discounts any type of physical activity or its benefits, and how he would rather just wither away than go to a gym or worry about exercise. (this really set me off and I kind of lost it on him) I told him he would rather rot than be a good healthy happy father for his family, he just stared at me, with a baffled unsure look on his face.

He has agreed to go to the Dr if I will ""shut up"" about his health and body issues, he has never been to the Dr since I have known him but once when he broke his arm at like 19 so that is a huge step. But will not tender the idea of going to counseling yet. It was a really frustrating evening with yelling and my tears. I am still frustrated we have been together since high school, and I miss the fun lets go and do this xy and z this weekend man I fell in love with, but your replies helped me get a conversation started, and I thank you for that!

479,"Hey all.

So I'm not sure how I should move forward with this. My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years and in that time she has struggled heavily with weight, self esteem issues and depression. I've always tried to be supportive of her, trying to help her with her various dieting attempts and even telling her that I don't think she NEEDS to lose weight and that shes beautiful and sexy and all that as is...But no matter what I say, nothing registers for her.

Now she's been looking into Dr. Bernstein weight loss program, and I told her that once she gets all the info we can look at possibly enrolling her. Note: She does not work, I have a pretty good job and I make a good bit of money, but with that I am also saddled with dealing with the finances of our household 100%. After looking at the information the program is going to be over $2000 for 13 weeks (Which she says is the length that she'll need for her target weight).

I told her I would think about it, but I could tell she could sense my apprehension.

I'm obviously not going to go into her space to get it and put it back but I don't want to be the one to get the blame for having it. She'll also get the broom and dustpan and bring it over and leave it by our door.

Guys, I'm in trouble.  


I just turned 30-years old. I have a wife and two kids with a third on the way. I have great friends, family, a home and we're active in our community. On the outside, I look like a successful businessman, husband, father, and citizen.  


Some of those things are true, but frankly, I'm mostly falling apart.  


I was killing all throughout 2018 in a commission only sales job but that fell off a cliff right around Thanksgiving and I haven't been able to recover yet. I haven't been able to pay my mortgage since December (working with the mortgage company on a plan) and I had to get an overnight job that doesn't pay great as well as a 9-5 cold-calling desk-jocky job. It's at least stable and I do have the opportunity to make pretty good commission, but so far it hasn't ""lit my fire"".  


People around me are telling me that I need to go find a ""stable career"" but that's the hard part for me. I've been a self-starter most of my adult life. I was a freelance writer for about eight years and made a good career -- this despite not having a degree in writing. I then got some good traction in my commission-only job, despite only having two years of experience.  


I personally feel my problem is that I am a jack of all trades and a master of none. I have many passion -- music, sports, sales, writing, motivating, my church (I thought I wanted to be a pastor at one time) but I've never really been able to lock in on one thing. Or when I have (the writing) it didn't pay enough to support a mortgage and soon to be three kids. Again, I don't have a bachelors degree in anything, though I do have about 60 credits all across the board and I have a certificate in radio production (again, I'm all over).  


Throw on probably an extra 30 pounds and even though I'm surviving (barely), I am miserable.  


What do I do, guys? How do I get motivated? I need your help and advise.

I have friends and is currently being integrated into a new one which are the popular guys at school (they’re not dickheads but actually the most social and kind in school). In my current (soon old) friend group there is a guy whom I have grown to hate. 
He is tall, muscular, broad, mediocre looks, pessimistic, mean, antisocial and unfriendly.

We have been close friends for a long time but I have hated him for abou 3 years. I can’t get rid of him cus he won’t underatand the hints I’m giving, plus he’s friends with my friends. Most of my friends I’m pretty sure also dislikes him. 
He is very pessimistic, 80% of what he says is either about something bad, mean, complaint or hateful. He can’t have a funny lighthearted conversation, it’s always something bad about someone or something. 
He’s mean, but hides it in humor. Most people roast their friends but does it because it’s funny. He makes roast but not because he wants to joke, but put the person down while hiding “masking” it by humor.

Today we maybe said 50 words to each other, I Try to not talk with him cus I know how he make me feel. But today he still managed to tell me that I’m ugly and that I’m a shitty person. This happens everyday.

When I try to completely ignore him he suddenly because incredibly caring and kind to make me like him again. So fuckin manipulative.

The most friendly guy I know dislikes him and wish he would move away from here, the second most pessimistic person who is his close friend said he’s a horrible person. He is disliked by almost everyone. He is still happy and thinks he’s on top. Recently he said he peaked cus now he got a girlfriend. I had the biggest urge to ask him if that’s all what matters.

I have been trying to get rid of him for 2 years. But somehow he still manages to be around me. 

I might sound like a asshole in this thread cus im just rambling about how bad my friend is, but I just want to let you know what type of person he is. 

Should I tell him to fuck off and move away from heat next time he tries to put me down?

LONG POST 

I am female, 23. F is male, 28. 

A year ago I got to know this guy, F, online and I tried the whole long distance online dating thing with him for a month. We met up, had some great times and all. But the edater/long distance didn’t work for me and I broke it off. I made it clear I’d give him space and once he was ready we could maintain the friendship we had. So that was fine. 

Except it wasn’t. He continued to expect special “boyfriend” treatment and attention from me directly and online. I tried to set that straight immediately by saying that I would not be giving him “special” treatment and would not treat him any differently than I treat my other friend. 

I even explained why. I knew he still had feelings for me and i didn’t want to confuse things. I told him my feelings for him had changed since that one month that we dated, and they’re no longer romantic, just platonic. We were pretty close though, and talked often. So our friendship was great when there weren’t complaints about how I’m not treating him. 

These complaints started to turn into meltdowns over the next few months. If I said something about being interested in another guy online, he’d deactivate and avoid everyone and then hit me up that night and say “can we talk later” and if I didn’t immediately text back and say yes, or if I said I was busy can I call tomorrow, it makes things worse. He says I’m not there for him and he just needs to talk and vent bc he’s angry and has no one else. 

Eight months after we broke up, after eight months of trimming down the time I spend talking to him and making myself less and less available to him, he freaks out and goes MIA for three days. Then calls me and tells me he loves me. I told him I do not feel the same, I’m sorry it’s that way, and I said I’d give him space for a while. I told him he can’t be just friends with me if he feels that strongly so we def needed space to keep things from being so hard on him. Meanwhile I’m just baffled because I’ve drastically altered the way I interact with this guy for MONTHS. I’ve shut down any inappropriate questions, I told him straight up when he makes me uncomfortable, and I’ve done my best to be only friendly to him. Yet he says he loves me now like what. So I didn’t talk to him for about a week. He apologized for making me uncomfortable. I scaled back even more since then (this was Nov 2018)

Now he gets mad if I leave him on read. I’m a busy person with ~3 hours of free time per day. I truly don’t always have time to focus on a one-on-one conversation. But oh god forbid I’m on twitter and not texting back. I tried to explain how mindless scrolling and retweeting takes nothing, but a full conversation takes lots of attention for me. I also feel like I don’t have to explain myself. My solution was to turn off read receipts. Oh he lost it over that so bad I turned them back on. His last freak out drove me over the edge I told him never to ask me about read receipts again and he hasn’t. 

Two days ago he asked me to be his valentine. I told him no. He asked if he could post pictures of us on Valentine’s Day. I asked him please not to as that gives off the impression that we are together. We’ll see what he does. 

He says I’m the only friend he has now. He has issues with family. Many of his other online friends have blocked him and quit talking to him. 

I try to be as honest as I can with him. I don’t like talking on the phone. I don’t feel the need to explain myself every time I say I can’t talk right now. I am tired of every time he freaks out (weekly) feeling stressed because I know I’m the cause of it because I’m not behaving how he wants. 

He bought me a nice pair of sneakers when we dated. And he got me Christmas gifts (I got him a gift too that’s on the same level as what I got my other friends) and he introduced me to many of the people I talk to online. I feel like if I can’t just cut him off because of these things. And because I feel like he has no one else and he’s been suicidal but won’t seek help and he’s really not mentally well. I myself am suicidal and have a shit ton of stuff I’m working through right now, so I really sympathize with his mental health. 

He has talked me through some things like friends will do, and I have done the same for him. When things are cool between us, it’s awesome having him as a friend. But I’m tired of the rollercoaster and the drama and the blame always being on me for not giving him what he wants. 

How do I pull back even more without being an asshole. Do I just have to be an asshole?? I can, I just want to try and be as kind as possible. I appreciate kindness. ",31Jan2019,1
492,"I (26F) had to bring my car in for service at the Kia dealership I purchased it from this morning. I needed to have my transmission fluid exchanged and it “had to be done” there b/c it is a capped system and the fluid needs to be completely drained with special equipment. 
During check-in they confirmed the transmission fluid service. I haven’t been financially able to due the normally scheduled routine maintenance since about 70,000 miles, so I asked them what was on the 90,000mile check. They told me it was nothing major: oil change, filter, tire rotation ... for a total of $280ish ((a ridiculous cost, in my opinion)) they asked if I wanted that added to my service and I said NO, only do the transmission fluid exchange. 

Less than 2hrs later someone from the dealership calls and tells me they are starting to work on my car and he starts talking about the 90,000 mile service. I stop him immediately and say No, I asked that not to be done. Only the transmission fluid should be changed. He told me my brake pads &amp; rotors needed to be changed too. I said NO  with that service as well. 
An hour after this I receive a text saying my car is ready! Great!! Then I look at the invoice and they’re charging me $440!!! They did the 90,000 mile service and charges me for it. I immediately called them and said they were NOT supposed to do that service and without taking fault ((still blamed me)) they said I wouldn’t need to pay for that portion. 

Now I wondering how I can tell they did the service I requested them to do

$139.14 total 

When I look up the first 2 parts I don’t get any kia part info and the last one is the transmission fluid. Can someone tell me how I can verify everything? I’m very leary about dealerships and believe they try and take advantage.

Last night I went to a get-together at a friends house. It was sort of an impromptu, ""unofficial"" high school reunion, there were maybe 25 people there. 

It was fun at first. We were drinking beer, listening to music, and watching junk TV. During all of this though, a girl that I knew there was making me feel quite uncomfortable. She was being overly flirty, touching my shoulders, hugging me too much, etc. I sort of shrugged it off and tried to move on from it. 

Fast forward to about 1 hour later, I was considerably intoxicated. I ask my friend who is hosting the party if theres any place I can crash. He says yes, theres a couch downstairs I can use. Great. So I stumble downstairs and lay down on the couch. About 10 minutes later the girl I mentioned earlier came down and started forcing herself on me. She kissed me, dry humped me, etc. I was trying to tell her to stop but I was too intoxicated to really do anything. I thought she would have gotten the point by then and left me alone, but she did not. I don't feel comfortable going into detail about what she did, but I will say she forced intercourse on me.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in middle school and it has never really gotten better (if anything it’s been far worse recently). Lots of things have built up to it, and I haven’t gotten any professional help (I want to but my parents are opposed). I am terribly self conscious and have a general self loathing, which is certainly where the diagnosis came from. 

However, I don’t think I follow the typical pattern for depression. I’m not totally sure how to describe it. Unlike a lot of victims of depression, who get into slums and only want to stay in bed all day, all I want to do is be with my friends. All the time. It’s the only time I’m ever happy, and if I’m ever even slightly concerned that they don’t like my company, I get extremely anxious. 

It’s gotten to the point where my boyfriend has had to ask me to stop asking him if he’s alright every time he doesn’t want to do something. I know he’s usually totally fine, but there’s always a nagging thought in my head that he’s angry at me or something along those lines and that I NEED to know why. I feel almost paranoid. I’m aware that it’s nonsensical, but I cannot help it at all. Sometimes it causes a full on panic attack (but usually as soon as someone I care about talks to me it gets better). 

I genuinely feel like a selfish prick because of this. I constantly feel like I’m dragging my boyfriend down, even though he’s expressed that he just wants to support me.

So, do I try and cling on for a little longer, or do I just go for it? My friends think this is a no brainer and I should definitely leave, but I'm scared!

515,"Sorry if this ends up a bit rambled, I'm very emotional while writing. Also on mobile so you know the deal. Hang tight cause this is long.


My (f22) Dad (69) is battling with some bad health issues. He recently had back surgery back in October, after having horrible back pain to the point he couldn't even walk. He was finally getting better and feeling better emotionally, but he fell on his side after tripping about a month ago, and apparently he has fractured another different vertebrae, and he cracked his fushion where he had his back surgery done. 


Now he's in a tremendous amount of pain again, and the doctors just gave him a new back brace and told him to wear it other than sleeping, and hopefully the new fractures will just heal. I've been trying to help him keep his head up (from another state) and tell him to just listen to his doctor and hopefully everything will heal and he will start to feel better soon.


All of this is happening, while his living arrangements are bizarre, and stress him out. My youngest sister from my dad and mom still lives at home (20) , she goes to college and works nights to help with bills. But my mom (my dads ex-wife) had to move into his basement with her two children (15&amp;16, my half siblings), and boyfriend because my mom was going to get evicted from her horrible apartment, it was a shitty situation, and my dad has a huge heart of gold so of course he let them live in his basement. 


This is all fine and good except my mother's boyfriend doesn't work because he has no license, and my mom has MS, and is slowly going blind at 45 due to this, and probably won't be able to work at his low paying job much longer. So soon they may not be able to contribute, and my dad can't work so he can't just take care of all of them.


Forward to today. My dad called me only 30 minutes ago and just broke down on the phone to me (I have rarely heard my dad cry even in the most stressful situations). He got laid off from his work in which he was employed at since I was 3 years old, because he has become more or less, a liability. 


He told me he isn't having an income right now other than his small social security check, and my sister and mom's incomes. His check bounced for his house payment. And he pays the house insurance and property tax on the house I'm living in (it's my dad's house I'm staying here until he retires). 


And now, his feet are swollen, like huge. His feet have swollen before and his doctor told him it could be heart failure of some sort. But they always went back to normal. Now his feet are huge and he told me my grandpa's feet did the same thing right before he passed away. I know he's scared. And it feels like there's NOTHING I can do. 


I'm in another state , I work as a car hop on tip wage, my husband is a cook, and is starting his second job at a newly opened store that will hopefully give him decent hours. And I found out last week I'm pregnant. So basically we're getting on our feet and I don't have any money to spare to help them out. 


If I had the money, I would pay every single one of my dad bills and never let him worry about money again... 


I told him he and my sister are always welcome to come move into this house, it is his house after all. But he told me if he does that my mom and other siblings won't have anywhere to go. And my house isn't big enough for all of these people plus my mom's obscene amount of pets, which I won't even get into..


I just....I don't know how to help. And I'm worried about my dad's health, I don't want to loose him...nobody wants to loose a parent. He raised me and my 3 other siblings alone, and always helped my mom out with money over the years and bought my half siblings clothes and anything else you can think of.


He's always taken care of everyone in his life and now I wish I wish I could take care of him. Any advice would be extremely helpful.....thanks for reading.",31Jan2019,1

Lately I've been thinking about doing something that sounds insane to me even if I say it now. Currently in the country I live, I'm extremely unhappy and I just wanna get out of here.
This thought first came up in me a few weeks back and part of me really wants to do it, even though I know I probably can't fully support myself.

At least in the EU it's easier to travel to another country that is also part of the EU. I wanna go away, for from home and start anew, instead of this depressing country. So I really need some advice on how to do this or why I shouldn't do this.

526,"I recently met a guy at a party and we sort of texted each other after. I made it clear from the beginning that I was in a happy, serious relationship and in no way interested in anything more than friends. 

A week after we met, he told me about a friend of his whom he fell in love with and confessed to her. She turned him down as she was just getting out of another relationship. I sympathized as a person who has been dumped, the pain is understandable. 

I never made any effort to meet him after, or talk to him on a regular basis. That is why I continue to refer to him as an acquaintance. I'm not in a place in my life where I can invest time into forming and maintaining a new friendship. 

Two days ago, I called to wish him for his birthday. (He reminded me multiple times that it was falling on the 29th of Jan). And he started ranting about this girl. I've never met her or even know her name. Again,I sympathized and suggested that he move on for his own good. He has since been calling almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day and saying he just wants to talk. And he says the same thing over and over ""I feel weird"". It's not that I don't want to help him but I feel that a person better suited would be a best friend or a mutual friend who knows the girl as well. 

I admit to being irritable when I'm studying for my exams and my patience is wearing thin. He calls me at 1 am or when I'm writing tests in class or when I'm relaxing with my parents. It's starting to bother me to the extent, I have started to ghost him. I don't want to be unkind to someone who is sad. But I also don't want to be responsible for giving advice and dealing with all the depressive episodes that comes with heartbreak.  While I sympathize, I don't feel the need to ""fix"" Things. Am I wrong to not want to be involved? 
As someone who has gone through and gotten past depression, am I obligated to help someone out before they come to that fate? ",31Jan2019,1
527,"I’m currently studying in a city which is a few miles apart from my hometown. It’s said to be the most beautiful and active in my country, but it still doesn’t compare to what I’ve seen abroad. 

I don’t feel good here. People around me are known to be reserved and impolite, so I have a hard time making friends. I’m at the best University in my country, but our courses are very old-fashioned, boring and non-interactive. 

I’ve talked to a former highschool classmate who’s studying in Denmark and she told me about their multicultural environment, their modern classes, the beautiful capital city and a lot of things that I fell in love with just by hearing. 

I want so much to be there and to escape from this place where I feel very lonely and constrained. I would really enjoy my life if I could stay with a good friend in a flat (I would stay even with that former classmate, even though we didn’t talk much in school), studying something that it’s interesting and taught in a captivating manner, meeting people from all around the world and living in a country which isn’t corrupt at all. 

However, I’m afraid to move to another country. I don’t feel ready and I’m not confident I would manage to handle all the new things. How can an anxious and late bloomer person cope with that?!

TDLR: I want to study abroad, but I don’t feel ready and confident for this. I wouldn’t know anyone there, I would be on my own and I know I couldn’t handle it properly (due to my family background and my anxiety).

528,"Here's the situation:

On January 2nd, me and my girlfriend abruptly broke up. She has family in the country, I do not. She suggested she go back to her family, and she will keep paying her half of the rent for the flat for all of January and February. I was terrified, sad and desperate at the time. So I also asked if she'd pay for March if I couldn't find a new, cheaper place until then. She said she wasn't sure; that she would if she had to but not otherwise. I think this is fair.

So I've spent 3 weeks now looking for flats (as the first week was spent sulking and in horror). I've found a few places but couldn't settle on them, I wasn't ready.

I don't want to inconvenience my girlfriend and it's unfair to her, when she wants to do her own thing, to stay longer than I have to.

So although I don't have a flat yet, I'm thinking of giving our landlord the 28 days notice today. That way we won't have to pay for march at all, and it still gives me another 4 weeks time to find a place to live.

Should I do this, although it has some risk involved? I think mostly it's the responsible and fair option here, but i always need to hear other people's input to be secure.

Let me know :)",31Jan2019,1
529,"So I just got out of my first and only serious relationship of 1 year and 2 months. I’m 18 and I’m a senior in high school. I met this girl a couple years ago and she was the love of my life. Lately I let her slip through the cracks and she broke up with me. It’s been a few days now. About 5 I think. I’ve done nothing but cry and lay around in bed. I try to talk to my friends and play games but that helps for about 3 hours and my entire stomach starts swirling. She already has a new boyfriend too. She made sure to rub it in my face too and destroy my soul just a little bit more. I’ve done some stupid things lately because of it too. I’ve been in a dark depression and I even cut myself a couple times. Nothing deep but I wanted to kill myself that’s for sure. I was too scared to finish through it. Now it seems I can’t get through a single day without thinking of her. I still love her and have no idea how to deal with it. Please tell me how to get over her and deal with this heartbreak accordingly

530,"I (27M) talked to my roommate (28M) last year about getting a dog. He told me he's not fond of dogs and doesn't want that type of energy greeting him after a long day at work. Understandable. Then I switched gears and asked how he would feel if I got a cat. He told me his only concern was the ""litter box smell"" and otherwise he loves cats and how easygoing they are.

A few weeks ago I was out of town and decided I had waited, saved and studied enough to pull the trigger. I came home on a weekday and gathered supplies then awaited RM's arrival from work to let him know what was up. Evening came and went and he never came home. Maybe he crashed at his girlfriend's house, no problem. The next day I went to a shelter and rescued a little black cat and brought him home to my room to get comfy and acclimate slowly. RM comes home and see's the litter box and I tell him about the cat. He tells me his girlfriend (43F) is extremely allergic to cats. I acknowledged that I should have spoken to him before moving forward and he was understanding based on our talk last year.

Now the issue is, he basically wants the cat in my room any time he's home and if his girlfriend comes over he has to be on total lock down in the room. I feel this is unfair based on a few things:

\- He pays his half of the rent, but I take the brunt of our real living expenses. All the furniture in the living room, dining room, kitchen, and common areas has been provided by me. The TV, saltwater aquarium, couches, chairs, shelves, lights, microwave, toaster, etc... I also take it upon myself (out of necessity) to buy all the paper towels and trash bags for the kitchen because he never provides them (or takes them out). I've never asked for anything in return and share all of this freely.

\- The majority of the housework falls on me. He only cleans if he has company coming over but otherwise he's kind of a slob and leaves messes/personal items strewn across the common area. He knows I have OCD so can't help but clean up after him so I guess I enable a bit.

\- He's only been dating his girlfriend for 4 months, and she never used to come over that often. On the rare chance he did bring her by it was straight to his room. I upgraded the living room about 2 months ago with a new big screen TV and home theater equipment... Guess where RM and his boo have to be EVERY weekend now??? The living room. This continued for about 3 weeks straight with them monopolizing the area basically the entire weekend and I talked with him about it. Told him it's one thing to watch a movie or spend an evening there maybe but Friday night going into most of Saturday was pushing it. Especially since when I bring my girl over I always take her to my room for most of the evening so he doesn't have to 3rd wheel in his own home.

\- His girlfriend doesn't live here. She's a grown woman in her 40's and has a place of her own.

The lease ends in August and I plan on getting my own place, so I'm trying to strike a fair balance in the mean time. I believe the fair resolution would be to keep the cat out of my RM's room at all times, and put him in my room only when his girlfriend is coming over. Am I wrong?

tl;dr Roommate gave me the thumbs up to get a cat last year before dating his current girlfriend. I rescued a cat on a whim recently but the current girl he's dating is allergic to cats. Now he wants the cat to be in my room at all times even though his girlfriend doesn't live here and he hasn't equally contributed to the household.",31Jan2019,1

532,"Theres a newer manager at my work place who asks me to go to lunch all the time. I really prefer to be alone at lunch. She is not my manager but manages an area where I work. I think she asks me to lunch because I'm the only person in the area who isnt under her, I'm a remote employee and my boss lives and works a few hours away. I have anxiety and cannot tell her that I would rather be alone during lunch. It hasn't been too terrible except earlier this week she invited another employee to join us, without asking me if I would be okay with it, the other employee is someone who when I first started working here 1.5 years ago verbally attacked and demeaned me. She never apologised and the new manager new of this issue between us. I had reported her and nothing was done about it. So needless to say I do not want to spend my unpaid break with her pretending to ok with it. Another note is I rarely get to be alone, I'm alone when I drive to and from work, an hour when my office mate leaves for the day and at lunch. My anxiety is pretty severe when I have to talk to people about non work related things and I'm just no good at idle chit chat. I do not want to ruin our working relationship by telling her i dont want to go to lunch with her as she communicates with my manager.

When I first started I was given an option to what hours I wanted to work, I chose 8-430, another option was 9-530. I'm thinking of asking my boss if it's still an option to change me schedule to be the later schedule which will have me go to lunch at a later time. The manager gets in at 6-7 and leaves at 3.  Theres another benefit of coming in early for me which is less of a rush receiving the stock that comes in anywhere between 1 and 3pm.

533,"The best way to put it is that I feel like my mind is mildly numbed. I'm not as quick on my feet as I used to be, but a bigger problem is my lack of motivation. I have plans I want to go through with, I want to prepare for the future. I tell myself it's just how it is because Im not particularly interested in it, so I just have to do it. But I used to have a feeling that made me want to go out and DO things and explore, but I lost a lot of my will to DO stuff now. I thought it might've been because I chronically smoke weed, and a little influence from others who weren't as excited to just join me out. But this feeling used to drive me to be more active and excited. I also blame this for getting rid of feeling stressed, I appreciate it a lot more now because I used to get things done under pressure, it honestly felt like I performed my best under pressure. Now that I dont get stressed about anything, I can never really ever put my heart into something and just do my best anymore.

I also noticed I just dont find things as funny anymore, I havent had a good laugh for a while, but at the same time I havent really cried or been upset about something either, any of these rearly happen. I can have a laugh and talk with my friends, but it doesnt really come from the heart when I'm laughing, to me it feels a but forced, it feels like Im back doing my old sales job. I just thought it was a part of growing up (21yrs now), because adults dont cry, and growing up is boring.

When I did sales, I think I felt my best or the most confident, I had just broken up with my girlfriend, but I liked the single life, I loved hitting on girls and just talking to them. Ofcourse I was still hurt after breaking up she was the love of my life, no girl can compare, and I have tried. So ofcourse I tried to get back with her and we sort of are now. I dont know how important this is for my diagnosis.

This is a bit funny doe, the only reason I think I have depression is because I saw an ad on youtube that just seemed to describe me too well. But from a marketing stand point you want to cater to as many people as possible so I was still unsure. After looking it up I still feel like it's me, but I know theres an increase of depression and everyone seems to have it. So I dont want to be someone that's crying wolf if you get what I mean, I dont want to blame my bad mindset on a problem that doesnt exist.

I can quit smoking weed when I want, I study in china now so I'm not gonna risk being euthanized cus I wanna get high.
I still laugh with friends it just doesnt feel like it comes from the heart, when I get upset(Like having emotional moments with my gf) I cant seem to cry, but I want to show that I feel and care for her.

But what's important to me is even if it's not depression I just want to get rid of whatever is going on if I can, maybe it actually is me getting older and my mind is slowing down. I want to become as fast of a learner as I used to be, I want to be as quick on my feet as I used to be, I want to be motivated so I can work on my future. If this keeps going on I cant be where I want to be at nearly the rate that it could've potentially been. I just dont have the energy to do it, even though I realize the power and potential impact I could have on my life if I just did everything I want to do in a day. But instead I sit inside and fucking play video games, I love games but I know I'm not making a big enough impact on my life if I just play games right after school.
I need to know if me blaming this on depression is just a way for me to look for an excuse and that I just need to listen to Nike and do it.

537,"I 17m and this girl 17f had become friends around June of last year, we ended up with feelings for each other but she was in a relationship at the time, she wanted to end it with her current boyfriend (toxic relationship). so the day after we kind of confessed our feelings, she broke up with him, after this we became a lot closer, we tried to agree to just be friends for a while but it never really stuck as “just friends”.

we hooked up a few times and even eventually started having sex, while trying to be friends but i guess we just felt too strongly about each other. as time went on we got extremely close, we would talk all day and night, see each other whenever we could, it was basically an unofficial relationship. we ended up fully in love with each other, but she was still missing her bf of 2 years.

she would always say she wanted to stay single for a long time while she gets over her bf and just be her own person. but at the same time she would tell me how she wanted to be with me so i was receiving extremely mixed signals, and felt like i was being lead on, this was also my first time ever being with a girl like this so i was very confused.

months later, around October 2018, she fully ended things, she told me to move on, i tried to so we could be friends, but i just couldn’t i still loved her so much. we would still talk but it was awkward, and eventually we just stopped altogether, i would still try and reach out, try to talk to her, but i would just get ignored so i stopped trying,

we’d still have a small convo every now and then but every time we did it was a reminder to me that everything’s changed. a few months later, she has a boyfriend now, and that really hurt me. she told me that she wanted to be single, but the next guy she meets she starts dating, and it makes me feel like the only reason she has feelings for me was because she was just using me, because she had just gotten out of a relationship she needed someone to replace that, so i’ve just been thinking the past few months if anything she told me was true, or if they were lies, 

i removed her on most social media because it hurt me too much to look at her being in love with someone else. school had also just started recently and it would be the first time i’d seen her in two months, and as soon as i did, all those feelings i thought i’d moved on from came back,  i still want to be her friend because she’s an amazing person, but i feel like i’m stuck and can’t move on, ive been trying so hard but seeing her at school just brought back so many memories, it made me realise that i’m not over her, i still love her.


if you read all of this i really appreciate it, this is my first time using reddit to make a post. i felt like i needed advice and also to get it off my chest a little.

I also skipped on all my class photos including my graduation photos i don’t have any pictures of me from the past 10 years or so. I was also a late bloomer so it couldn’t have been puberty. But puberty did end up hitting me hard. Thinking back I probably had depression or body dysmorphia. I also always dressed like a boy and I cut my really long hair off all the way to pixie short and I probably had gender dysphoria because I remember really feeling jealousy of my brothers and I secretly wished I was like them.

I dont really know how to control myself cause I literally get like a panic attack when I have to speak in front of people. FML... how do I get past this?

I found that character because I really like stereotypical nerds and asked on Reddit if there's a show that features a mean nerd.

Ever since I find him hard not to wank to and often dream about him slowly choking me to death with his thighs while nerding out about incarceration and robots. The fact one episode showed a realistic CGI version of him did not help, as his thighs in that scene were very large and skinny nerds having massive lower bodies is something that pops my cherry.

I've been really into nerds ever since he read about a stereotypical nerd very similar to how the character looks slowly strangled his friend to death in a scissor hold with his thighs after the victim threatened to kill him with a pen.

Whenever I hear the show's theme song I INSTANTLY go and grease myself up with only the utmost finest lube I can find, and by the end of the session, my dick is so dry and chafed it looks like one of those rocket popsicles that turn red the longer you suck them.

I've also wrote fanfics about him here https://www.reddit.com/r/Thighsexual/comments/abgm2k/the_warden_of_superjail_slavery_mm_asphyxiation/",31Jan2019,1
543,"Hello. As the title says, I’ll be getting a ct soon (not sure when that will be because they have to call me for an appointment)
I’ve had on and off headaches for a while, but this past month, after I’ve gone off my contraceptives it’s been there every single day. I I might’ve got a few panic attacks due to it, but it’s strange that each time has been during exams where I had to put mental effort in, it felt like a huge something was weighing on me and it was hard to read. 
I know I won’t be able to function like a proper person until I get it done and see what’s going on up there and I have no idea when that will be either. (Months, probably) 
Death is on my mind every single day. I don’t there’s been a day where I have felt healthy in about a year.

545,"I feel lost. My life is currently in what seems like an amazing position, yet I feel absolutely lost.


I’m a 27 year-old male working in Chicago as a consultant in the healthcare finance field. It pays great, (75k with amazing benefits) but I do not love the work at all (it’s very technical, heavy use of SQL). I've been with the company almost three years and the only reason I've lasted so long is because I'm extremely positive, well-spoken and charasmatic. In a client-facing role these qualities can get you very far. But I am just ready to leave, I am not happy there.

This is where I feel lost - I have NO idea what I want to do. I don’t hate consulting, I just dislike the technical aspects of it. My true passion is cooking, I love everything about it. So that seems like the obvious answer, get a job in the kitchen, right? Well, I’ve worked as a line cook in my early 20’s and it was VERY hard work. From the research I’ve done, it seems that doesn’t really change. Working in a kitchen comes with long hours, high stress, and low pay. 


My sister thinks I should work to open a restaurant, but I’ve seen one too many episodes of “Kitchen Nightmares”. I feel I do not have the experience to own/run a restaurant. So here is my current standing:


-	27 year-old male in Chicago making 75k annually
-	Degree in both Finance and Economics from University of Illinois
-	Have 55k in liquid cash saved, no debt. (I’ve made significant contributions to my 401k but I do not want to touch that).
-	Passion for cooking, but not for traditional kitchen work. 


If someone could offer me their thoughts or advice I would be so thankful. Should I just get a different consulting gig? Start a business? What would you do? I just need guidance..any help is appreciated.

554,"Background: I started working at a small (less than 20 people) telecom startup about three years ago as a support rep. About a year after I started, my boss, the only other person in the tech department, quit and was replaced by my current boss. Since then, our help desk now has 5 people and I was promoted two times, first to the help desk lead, now sales engineer. I really do not want to leave, as I've pretty much tripled my salary in 4 years and the company is growing very fast. 


My boss spends about 80% of each day playing video games. He comes in at 5AM claiming it's to beat traffic, but he uses those 3 hours before most others show up as time to play DND online with his friends. For the rest of the day he'll play other games that don't require sound so he doesn't get caught. Whenever he's asked to do something by another department, he just forwards it to one of the people on the help desk, and asks them to do it. The other day when I was in a meeting with all of support except for him, someone from another department asked him about a ticket and he didn't even know how to look up the customer in the system we all use every day. He has been here for two years. Occasionally when someone from his team has an idea, he takes their name off of the email/document and forwards it to our CEO as his own. 

I don't know what to do about it, but him not caring about his job is starting to hurt the company. We're losing customers because he passes off tasks our CFO and CEO give him to brand new employees that don't know what they're doing. Half of my help desk is looking for other jobs because they're tired of him taking credit for their ideas or making them do his job. A lot of bad business decisions get made because he just picks whatever he thinks is right, based on old jobs, without knowing any of our processes. I'm afraid to go to ""HR"", because my company is so small that HR is just our CFO, who I believe thinks he's a hard worker because of the amount of times he pretends other people's work is his. I'm also afraid that it will just look like I'm trying to take his job, and I won't be taken seriously if I go to management above his head. 

**TL;DR** - Boss plays video games all day and doesn't care about his job, which is starting to hurt the company. He takes a lot of other peoples work and claims it as his so that he doesn't get caught. Our company is very small and HR is just our CFO, so I'm not sure if I should go to her or not. ",31Jan2019,1

566,"Hi everyone,

So I'm going through a break up right now which has left me picking up the pieces and putting myself back together. I'm trying to only carry the best parts of me forward and so letting go of the negative or shaping the negative in a positive way. Anyway, I've realised that I have an insane problem with letting things go and getting rid of things whether they be personal items, friends, girlfriends etc. 

This girlfriend is the first proper relationship I've had, I use the term girlfriend to suggest teenage loves that didn't mean much other than the title. When I was with a girl when we were 12 I had difficulties getting over her, it took me over two years to be comfortable moving on even though we were seeing each other for like two months. Also before anyone starts, I know 12 is a stupid age to consider it love.

Anyway fast forward to now, my first proper girlfriend who I met when I was 19 has now broken up with me. I've always considered it but I never followed through because I didn't truly want it. I now realise after she said the words that I was thinking about it as a toxic thought, about being with other girls and things like that. And I am truly having the worst time of my life right now for a number of other reasons.

I've also had problems with friends walking out on me and our other mates, I think I have problems with change and adjustment. I've even had issues letting go of items that I own because of the sentimental value even though it may be a toy or something with minor significance to me. Is there anything I can do to help myself accept loss and move on easier? Or is it just a waiting game and I have to simply let it happen.",31Jan2019,1
567,"I'm a senior in high school (F) and my school's prom is coming up in May, and already everyone is talking about it. Last year, several friends tried to talk me into attending junior prom, but I refused. Now, I feel like the pressure is really on for me to go this year, because I have a feeling I'll regret if I don't. The only issue I really have here is money and who to go with - because yes, I'm single. 

My best friend is really excited about it, and already has her dress picked out, the money to go, her boyfriend ready to be her date, and friends lined up to do her hair and makeup for free. She has said she really wants me to go, but of course I don't have a date, and I'm not about to third wheel with her and her boyfriend (which I already do half the times we hang out). She offered to set me up with her cousin, who I met once over a year ago when I went on vacation with her family. He's a sophomore, and seems nice enough, but I'm also holding out hope on a couple other guys. I'm a pretty average looking girl, so I honestly doubt I'll get asked to prom by anyone unless I initiate a conversation, which I don't really have the energy to do anymore considering I'll be graduating and going to college hours away in a matter of months.

Not to mention the money concern - my best friend and I are going on a very expensive graduation trip with a couple other people this summer that's going to cost me a bit over a grand. I really am reluctant to drop at least $100 on a dress and the prom ticket alone (that is, if I can get my hair and makeup done for free like she does) when I'm trying to scrape together all I can save from my crappy part-time job. So the bottom line is, is it worth going to senior prom? Will I regret it if I don't go? Should I accept the date with my best friend's cousin and attend in a group of four? Or should I tell her to go and have a great time with her boyfriend for the second year in a row without me?

569,"It seems like no matter how ambitious I start my day/week, I can never get much (if anything) done. At least not as much as I’d like to. 

I work in an office and while it’s not a “do nothing” job, it’s also not a job where I’m micromanaged or have constant, immediate deadlines. At any given time I’ll have roughly 6-12 ongoing projects with various amounts of mental effort and prep required, with deadlines anywhere from 3 days - 2 months out. About 10% of the time, there is no deadline at all. (these are the projects I REALLY struggle with). 

What usually ends up happening is I put the project off until the last minute and do a rushed, panicked job despite having originally had plenty of time to do it. I hate this feeling. 

The other issue is that all of these projects actually come secondary to my “main job” which is to intake and route calls, answer email requests, run database searches for various purposes, write up short correspondences for certain things, etc. My “main job” typically comprises about 3 hours of the day TOTAL. But this is very broken up. I might have a busy 20 mins and then having nothing for an hour. Then a busy 5 mins and nothing for 2 hours. Then a busy hour and nothing for half an hour. Etc. 

So I need to be able to snap back and forth between my primary job and the projects that I really need to be getting done—but I never manage to. On my downtime I always end up playing on my phone, browsing reddit/Facebook/ watching YouTube videos for home improvement projects I’m working on at home, looking up things for my personal life, etc. 

Once I get into a “groove” on a project, I’m good and it’s smooth sailing from there. The issue is, once I get distracted (I.e. a task from my primary job comes up, needing my attention) I can never “snap back” into the project (or start a new one for that matter).

Yes, my phone is clearly the problem but I don’t know what to do about that. I’ve tried putting it across the room from me so that I have to get up every time I want to check it, but that only works for a short time. I either end up sitting in that area and playing on it aimlessly for hours until the work phone rings and snaps me out of it. Or I’ll end up being a sucker and bringing it over to my work station with me and wasting the whole day. 

Because of the “office” culture thing, colleagues will often pop in to talk to me for an hour or sometimes honestly two, not only distracting me (if I was focused in the first place) but also causing me to take forever to get back to what I was working on. 

I’ve tried making to do lists and following them, but that only works for a short time. I’ve set goals and that never works either. No I don’t “love” my job, but I also don’t hate it. It’s good pay and great benefits, so until I can start my own business, it’s what I’ll continue to do. I don’t think the job is the problem I think it’s me. Any advice?",31Jan2019,1

Before I got married I was a real piece of shit and I cheated on my now wife back when we were dating. I came clean and we have gone through the pain and she has forgiven me. Our marriage is truly amazing now and that is my number one priority.

Here are a few things I could really use advice on:

\- How to tell my wife? I'm planning on telling her about the appointment tonight once she is done with her activities for the day. She is aware that this could happen so that will not be a surprise to her.

\- Planning for my future family, I need advice on how to integrate my potential child into the family I might have with my wife? Not sure how any of this works to be honest. I want any child of mine to grow up loved and emotionally healthy. 

\- To be honest I'm not sure about anything in this matter. This would be my first time being a father.

\- The wife and I were planning on trying to have children starting in a month or so. Advice on how to traverse this conversation would be greatly appreciated.

   To close, I will say that I want to be involved if this my child. My dream would be to have some custody and make this child part of my whole life. My biggest fear would be losing my wife, which I am not afraid of. Second fear is being shunned by my family for being a POS. I feel like a terrible human being but I have a love in my heart that will prevail no matter what happens. But if you all have any advice on how to go about this so that I can have the best relationship possible, I would appreciate it. Thank you all.

575,"Hey guys,

So  I (19M)got this problem where its easy for me to get hung up on people. For example this week I matched with this girl on tinder and we spoke for a bit, and things seemed to be going well, she was answering me fast and was giving me good replies, we had already made plans to meet up etc. I replied to a message of hers a couple of days ago and she still hasnt seen it, and it says that shes been online various times, then i texted her today asking hows it going and she hasnt seen that either. This honestly felt bad coz it really felt we clicked, and theres nothing I can think of that I did wrong for her to just ghost me like this. I tend to take accountability for everything and I always think that whatever goes wrong is all my fault, but I just dont know what I did wrong here. Do people do this often, or am I just being too much? And how can I just stop getting hung up so easily?

I know the usual advise is to get busy, but its easier said this done when this is in your mind. I wanna be able to let go of these little things like not getting replies etc and I want to stop taking these things personally that its my fault for whatever goes wrong. All my friends seem to be people who dont care in situations like this, and things actually go well for them, but idk how to stop caring bout things like this, and it honestly ruins my days sometimes and I want to stop this.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated


edit : Another thing I have observed is that the more I get excited about things happenings, the more likely it is for them to not happen or go completely wrong, and that honestly scares me from being excited about them. Is this something that is common? and how can you fix this?",31Jan2019,1

579,"So like the title says, I was flying from the US to Canada. Delta overbooked my flight and was giving out an Amazon gift card for giving up your seat and getting the next available flight. I took it, the offer was too good not to take.   


Fast forward to when I got the gift card in the mail. It's a .com Gift card, I tried redeeming it on my .ca Amazon account, but after being told to contact customer support, they redeemed it on my .com account without my knowledge. I can't order 70% of the things I want to get *(Just moved out of my parents house, still sleeping on the floor and I'm trying to get cushioning for my back with the gift card)* 

&amp;#x200B;

Contacted Amazon customer support, both US and Canadian to try to get the funds transferred to my Canadian account with no avail. After a couple days, I tried phoning customer support again *(maybe I'll get a nice person that's willing to help a brother out in anyway what so ever)* 

After a couple days I received an email from amazon customer support, telling me that they can issue a refund to the purchaser (delta) and to contact them to be issued a new gift card. Called delta ""I'm so sorry but our hands are tied, you can pick up a gift next time you're in the states and bring it back with you though."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright now after all that, what do I do now? Anything I try to order can't be shipped to my address, and the small things I am able to get shipped have to go through customs and have to be charged for that.   


*;tldr;* Delta gave me a gift card for an overbooked flight, gave me a usd card. Can't order anything without being charged an arm and leg for shipping/customs to Canada. Amazon says they can refund it to Delta, Delta doesn't care.

Ontop of that I realised that I didn't do a lot of things I wanted to do (move overseas for a period etc) because I was always in a relationship that wouldn't allow for such things, and now it'll be even harder.

I'm a naturally nervous person as well so I tend to dwell on things for extended periods, and too deeply dive into the 'what ifs' which doesn't help either I imagine.

583,"Not sure if this is the correct sub to post this, if It is not please remove the post mods and direct me to the correct one if possible.



(Note this beginning is going to sound strange so bear with me) About a year ago I made an observation that at any given point in time we experience THAT as the present. I thought about this a lot, as in like ""Woah I experienced last night as the present but now its already this morning."" I know that is strange but I found it interesting. At some point I began using it to get through difficult things, like if I knew something I would not enjoy was going to happen(lets say a presentation in class in front of a lot of people for example) I would realize that from my future self's perspective It was already over and I was at home comfortable etc. This was not something that was on my mind often, but it was there. This is where other parts of my personality began to conflict with that view. I am Christian, and although from my beliefs I should not be afraid of death necessarily, it petrifies me. Although I consider myself Christian, small doubts have made this fear worse as I question if I would just cease to exist.(Note I do not wish to convert from Christianity, nor do I wish to change my religious beliefs). This slowly spread to the fear of death from my mother and father, as they are rather old for my age, each with certain health issues, especially my father. Once I moved to college(In my second semester of freshman year currently) It got worse again. I would fear waking up one morning to get a call that my father or mother was dead. That stayed with me most nights for a while, and still does sometimes.



This fear has started to warp how I experience life, since I start thinking how easy it is for me, my girlfriend, parents to just suddenly die in a freak accident. If I do not hear from any of those people via text for more than a couple hours my mind starts racing thinking how they are dead etc. Back to the initial statement, that thinking about how the future is the present in a way compounded with these fears, and now It terrorizes me that the day I'm at my mother, or fathers funeral is already here, or what scares me more is I am on my own death bed dying, or already dead. I get that the chances of me living a long life are pretty good, but with that warped view on experience/time its as if I am about to die any second. Most nights when I go to sleep I let my thoughts wander as I drift to sleep, but ever since I have been afflicted with this I spend nights thinking about these fears and emotions, scared, sometimes crying, and overall furthering this crisis. A day does not go by that I do not think about myself or my loved ones dying and its started to impact me.



I am unsure how I am supposed to tackle this. The college only offers three free therapy sessions so even if those could help I would only be able to get limited help. The only person I discuss this with, even a little bit with is my girlfriend but I don't think there is anything she can do.



(Another note, I don't have my license to drive. At first it was laziness and lack of a reason, but now its out of fear since I always remember how likely it is to die in an accident, or how easy it is to mess up driving, make one small mistake, and either kill me or my passengers.)",31Jan2019,1
584,"I'm a guy pursuing two majors, two minors and some certificates at a major public university in Florida.

Honestly, I'm not very motivated by my classes and I'm not a very diligent student. I didn't take my first few years in college very seriously and I skipped a lot of classes, just screwed around on campus, played tons of video games, stuffed my face at food places too much, etc. I got mostly C's in my classes and ended up with a pretty unremarkable GPA. Though eventually I started playing less video games and getting better grades and slowly bringing up my GPA.

As far as where I'm at right now, I'm feeling pretty unmotivated. I left my game console back in my hometown a year and a half ago to focus on school more but I still don't find motivation for my classes easily. I spend a bunch of my time sleeping, chatting with girls, browsing the internet for articles, YouTube, and going to various events on campus and in the community. Lately, I've got a pretty terrible sleep where I go to bed around 3-6am and wake up around 11am or 12pm.

I just don't have that much motivation for my classes. I only attend sometimes and I don't really stay on the ball about doing readings. I'm way more interested in other things.

I'd rather spend my time reading articles and books that actually interest me, listening to podcasts, watching content on YouTube, going to various events on campus relating to politics, economics, culture, etc.

588,"Okay so my whole life has been pretty weird. I've done well in school, but I had to work way harder than everyone else, and I never really understood why. I also sucked ass at playing sports games, despite having decent skills, because I would get so overwhelmed and just couldn't navigate a large visual field. I was emotionally abused my coaches and teammates, and honestly even my family gave me shit over it. I had so much trouble paying attention to people, and had very few friends. I also was just a weirdo, said awkward things, didn't know how to carry myself, had severe anxiety, depression, low self-worth, everything. My parents always told me that all my issues could simply be attributed to my personality. This made me feel like shit and they shut me down every time I mentioned maybe having ADHD. They told me I was seen by a doctor and checked for ADHD and epilepsy when I was younger who said there was nothing wrong with me.  

However, a month ago, I found that very assessment. The doctor didn't rule out anything and actually encouraged testing for ADHD and an EEG for epilepsy. He didn't think I had epilepsy based off a simple breathing test he did, but he still wanted to be sure. My parents never scheduled the EEG or had me tested for ADHD. I flipped shit on my mom when I found this out. She said she wanted me to have a normal childhood and not have to see a ton of doctors. I feel kind of bad for flipping out on her because I put a ton of weight on her shoulders and hurt her feelings. But I was just so angry. 

I saw a neuropsychologist two weeks ago and have been diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type and a learning disability. However, she thinks I should still get tested for seizures and maybe have an MRI done because some of symptoms (severe fatigue, head pain, severe inattention and slow information processing) are very concerning to her. I feel very worried that I'll be diagnosed with epilepsy and then have to start on medication with some very serious side effects. I'm a senior about to graduate college and I need to start my life in four months with a new job. 

It's true that I've managed to live a productive life, but it's been so difficult and nearly everyone who gets to know me at work, sports, social life, asks me whats wrong with me. This obviously hurt my feelings but I always assumed I was just a weirdo. I don't know what to do. I am smart enough to be successful but I have so many functional issues that prevent me from being a good employee. I'm just scared. Should I just continue on with my life with the struggles I have or get tested for seizures? I'm just scared that once I get tested there will be no going back.

Over Christmas break I signed a pre-contract with a Financial Firm doing life insurance, I did all the training and am all certified. I’m in the pre-contract phase now where I need X amount of clients, ie sales. It’s already it’s been stressful and random little issues (like additional agent costs) keep popping up .

I also have had some meeting with potential clients (mostly friends) and I just cant find it in me to get on the topic of sales. 

I have a decent amount of connections but I sort of hopped onto the first think that called me back since I was getting engaged and wanted to show I had a job.... I do believe I can get something before I graduate but would need that time I’ve been doing pre contract work to get it sorted.

591,"I just really need to vent my stress right now. TLDR at the bottom. First post on here, please tell me if I did something wrong in this post.

About my Father and Step-Mother. Over the past 2 years my parents have been up my ass about everything, from playing ""too much"" video games, or bad grades. I disagree with them politically and when ever I try to have a civilized conversations with them they say I am giving them attitude and tell me to literally fuck off or I will lose my phone. I have expressed my distaste with the way they treat me, like they own me and can make me do whatever they want. I know that I am going through a faze, but I am still concerned about my stress and mental health this puts on me. I have been depressed for the past 2 years, between school and my parents. I went to a tough school for a year before we moved across the country, and I had some trouble. I started becoming depressed because I had gotten a C or two, and they made me feel like shit for it. They would tell me I would get nowhere in life (never-mind the fact neither of my parents went to college, but are basically saying they are going to send me to college no matter my choice) if I didn't get at least B's, and that they would take my gaming and phone ""privileges"" if I didn't bring them up, ignoring the fact it was like 3-4 hours of ""homework"" a day. Elaborating on that school, I would go for like 2-3 days a week but like multiple hours of work to do a day, maybe 2 hours a class, in like 5 classes. A lot of work. I spent countless night just sitting in my bed trying to get through it. Playing video games was my way to cope with everything, my escape to a better world. When we had moved I had lost my few friends, and I felt come of them I just hung out with to try and fit it. I had one friend out here, because my step mother had lived here as a kid. Made a few more over the last year and a half I have lived here, but haven't hung out with them much outside of school ""in real life."" My parents think I am addicted to games and my phone. Recently, I spend maybe 3 hours a day, getting home from school around 3. Some days they don't care how long I play, others they make me get off after an hour on a game console. What they don't understand is how I have fun playing games, watching youtube, or on reddit. Most of the time I spend on a screen is watching youtube, not even playing games. Here was a conversation I had with my step mom about an hour ago:

My step-mom was talking to my brothers friends mom about her son hanging out at my house with my brother. She said it was fine, and that she likes that they have interactions in real life away from screens (I am making her sound smarter than she really is). So when we leave, I ask her why everything has to be about screens and such. She says that making memories in real life was basically the only was of making ""real memories."" I told her that that morning (there was a 2 hour delay) that I had recently been playing with my good friends from school now that we had a PS4. I said I had had some of the most fun playing games ever that morning with my friends. And she doesn't say ""I'm glad you had fun,""  or even ""is that one of your best memories"" to defend her own point, but no, she says ""thats sad."" I'm sure you can imagine how I felt after my ""mom"" had just said that my life was sad. I asked how is that sad, and she said that it wasn't real because I wasn't there with them. She said ""why don't you hang out with them."" Never-mind the fact this was at 7:00- 9:00 in the morning on a school day. I asked her how am I supposed to just ask someone if I could go to their house or for them to come to my house, almost immediately, in the morning. Not going to happen. She says ""it doesn't matter because you can't play later anyway,"" avoiding the question (I had lost it because I didn't get off the second she asked me to that morning). This was not the first time experiencing something like this. Once I had expressed my political beliefs to them and they called me disgusting. They also make me do chores, sometimes over an hour a day, for $30 in allowance. I have said I don't want to, but they say I have to because I live in their house, something I never agreed to, and they most definitely wont let me move out, they don't even want me to move out when I turn 18, and I definitely am. I said I might buy a PS4 for almost a year, but they said that they don't want me to, I'm guessing because they want to feel in control of me all the time. They try to limit my time on my phone, they check my personal stuff whenever they want, and I am tired of it. Now you can see how they treat me, and I hate it. If she had seen I posted this she would ask why I don't put this effort into school, why I haven't talked to her about it, when I have, or take my phone for a week for ""vilifying her online"" or something stupid.

TLDR: My parents are forcing me to do really well in tough schools, saying I am addicted to video games, and that it is sad that I enjoy them. I have told them they don't understand, but they still think they are stupid and a waste of time, that you can't make real memories with them. Basically they wan't to be in control of me all the time.

I felt the need to talk about this somewhere, and I thought here would be a good place to talk about it. If you have anything you think I should do in this situation, please tell me. I am trying my best to get out of the worst spot in my life so far, but they are just making things worse. Thanks for taking the precious time out of your day to help me.  ",31Jan2019,1

599,"Hi everyone, this is crossposted. This afternoon, my 2 year old and I were at his developmental pediatrician’s office. He was diagnosed with autism last May by the hospital we go through’s neurologist. It was actually kind of strange because with my oldest son (4), we went through this developmental pediatrician, she did his evaluation and then we went for the separate ADOS testing. The pediatrician was on a freeze so she said it would be quicker if we got in with the neurologist which is what we did. Given the history of my son’s autism and my husband’s, and my younger son’s severity, he didn’t see a need for an ADOS and quickly diagnosed him. 

Fast forward to seeing this developmental PED, she said he would need an ADOS due to insurance and him receiving services such as ABA. We didn’t utilize ABA with my oldest because he’s not as severe as my youngest, plus it would be $500 a month with insurance and we just couldn’t afford it. She was asking basic questions about him, and one of the questions came up about if he has any fear. He doesn’t have any fear. We recently had an incident, one of my worst fears where my two year old son got out of the house. 
Our front door is a little janky, you have to push it hard for it to shut and you have to listen closely for the click to make sure it’s completely shut. I was heading out to a doctors appointment, my husband behind me. Our house is very chaotic with two children, tv on, loud toys... I’m not sure if my husband heard the click when he shut the door. He said he thought he heard it but he went to go put the few dishes in the sink in the dishwasher and when he came back around the corner, the door was wide open and our son wasn’t in the house. It was freezing cold that day, it hadn’t been more than a minute. My husband immediately ran outside and when he went outside, our neighbor across the street was already carrying our son back over. If you don’t hear the door completely click, if it’s really windy, the wind will pop the front door open, I’ve watched it happen quite a few times when it’s really windy outside. Since this incident, I’ve gotten 2 deadbolts put on the door. We already had had a childproof doorknob put over the front doorknob but that won’t help the situation if the door opens on it’s own and he’s able to push open the screen door. 

I’m completely aware that he could’ve been killed, he ran across the street barefoot in a onesie in the snow, in 20° weather. I lie awake at night, sick to my stomach thinking about all of the things that could’ve happened and I swear I didn’t talk to my husband for days because his accidental mistake could’ve cost our son his life. When the developmental pediatrician asked me to give her an example of my son having no fear, without thinking, this was the story I blurted out. She looked kind of surprised and then asked if we have since fixed the door and I said oh yes of course, which we really have. It was truly an accident, but an accident I know could’ve cost him his life. 

But now that all is said and done, is CPS going to show up at my house? I’m a stay at home mom and a good mom at that, my husband is an amazing father. I’m terrified that we would ever have an open and shut case, even an open and shut case would be devastating to have. There’s never been any signs or indications of abuse, my children are more than well taken care of and get everything they need and want. ",31Jan2019,1

I still live with them, I’m a junior in highschool with good grades. I also do weightlifting but that’s pretty much it. Everyday all I do is homework, play games (on my computer league or mc) and spend time on my phone watching streams or videos on YouTube.

I have no job and I don’t even know if I’m going to college. I get first or second honors but I don’t think any of them will accept me because I’m not doing anything outside of school. 

The worst part is I’m ashamed to try because for some reason (I think it’s an injury to an organ I was hit under my rib cage in the left side when I was like 12) I can’t stop passing gas. It’s like constant no matter what I eat, even when I don’t. This ruined many of the friendships I had or was going to have, and I’m embarrassed to reach out because of it. I’ve tried changing my diet and all but nothing seems to work. 

Right now I’m a burden/deadweight to my parents all I do is consume resources and take up their energy and money. I can’t even drive because I haven’t taken my permit test. I’m a loser..

Please any advice helps.",31Jan2019,1
602,"I'm in my second year of college at Baruch College in NY currently as an Economics/Finance major even though I have hardly any interest in the subject apart from the money making aspect. My passion lies in music and photography, which my parents have discouraged me from pursuing because it doesn't pay and that I'll eventually ""grow out of it"". I taught myself photography as well as how to play guitar back in high school and consider myself to be fairly talented at both.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware of how narcissistic that sounds but I have had my photography featured on large magazines online as well as I've built a large fan base on social media. I've been playing music for around 3 years and it's basically all I do outside of school and working retail. I love it so much, it's all I look forward to and I'd say it's what gets me by day to day.  I practice my playing for at least 2-3 hours on a daily basis for the past 2 years, as well as studying harmony and music theory quite intensely and have seen amazing results, although my inner critic is my worst enemy and I am never truly satisfied with my playing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both of my parents are accountants and I grew up in a very rich area of NY. Whenever I mention any career path that isn't  a white collar job in Finance/Business/CS/IT/Accounting to my parents, they immediately disregard it as a waste of time. This has obviously tainted my view of myself and the skills that I have worked hard to develop in the past few years. I have no idea if it's even worth it to try and my passions because I have the expectation that I will most likely end up being  in retail my whole life if I choose that route. I have tried so hard to grow an interest for the Accounting and Finance but this stuff just bores me to death and I know that I won't have any time to play music or practice photography if I become an Accountant. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there's my dilemma, I guess what I'm doing now is completing a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance just so I have a versatile degree that I can fall back on and in the mean time continue to practice my music and photography and see where it takes me.  I am also saving and investing a lot of the money I make at my current retail job to ensure at least some financial security in the future.

603,"Advice? Help? Anything appreciated.... Earlier today while arriving from work , my roommates German Shepherds began to bark and growl at me from behind the entrance door to the house so I yelled loudly for them to "" shut the fuck up"" , then roommates gf came out to curse at me while I was heading to my room prompting an argument. We exchanged some nice words as she followed me, I try to close my door to get her to leave  and she pushes me on my chest multiple times almost causing me to fall back words on my floor as her bf comes by as pushes her away. I threatened to call non emergency for her assualting me and she verbally threatened to kill me twice, so I call to place a report but instead the operator says an officer needs to come by...
Long story short, cops show up. She said I put hands on her and walks outside with her child in the freezing cold to try to listen in on our conversations. Her bf confirmed she was the aggressor and threatened to kill me but the officer's said we would both be arrested if I press charges since what she claimed which isnt true and witness proved it..  
Now I'm having constant anxiety attacks and  dont want to go out of my room to eat or do anything in fear of her arguing with me or calling me names to provoke me.

604,"On mobile so sorry in advance.

So as the title says my younger brother is going through a lot of hard life struggles at the moment. Around his 18th birthday is when things started to visually go bad for him as far as his depression. Stopped showering, stopped shaving, stopped cutting his hair and started leaving his room less, started pissing in bottles and hoarding them, and other r/neckbeardnest tendencies. We've talked about his depression for years and he seamed to be managing it well until he turned 18. He's seen a therapist religiously since 15 and taken several different types of meds. I know prozac for sure but idk anything else. 

Well not long after this behavior started his girlfriend (f16, just a grade apart in high school) dumped him bc of how bad he started to look and even smell. She was a sweet girl but still young and didn't know how to handle his new severe depression. It wasn't long before he started cutting, and I mean really cutting, not little tumblr slits. Things that probably should have had stitches. Then for whatever reasons he started to meet up with literally anyone that would from online for different sexual activities. Men, women, couples, his age, or even 50. I dont think hes gone older than that, but age isnt the point here. It's that his self image is so low that hes going for anyone that will take him. 

Hes started smoking weed and drinking, which by no means is the end of the world, but he has always been adamantly against those things. It's possible hes even done more than that drug wise. I asked him and all he said was he would try anything once. So then the suicide threats started. He'd disappear for days and my parents would put out a missing persons and then he'd show back up like nothing happened. Then he ended up in the hospital after taking a few bottles of pills and stayed in some clinic for a couple months. Then came home like nothing happened. Doesnt understand why we were upset with his attempted suicide. 

So getting back to my title. He has met a woman in her mid thirties online who lives in ohio I think, we live in Tennessee. He has never had a job, my parents pay for everything of his and he has full scholarships in college at the moment. He 9s wanting to drop out of college, get a job at either gamestop or dollar general (bc for some reason these are the only 2 places he wants to work) and move to ohio to live with her and her husband. I have no idea if they have children or not either. And with him sleeping around with literally anything with two legs who knows if he has anything. 

I just dont know what to do with him anymore. He cant even buy his own gas without taking my moms credit card. Shes currently paying for all of his therapy and medication. Unless that woman hes talking to is ready to take on an 18 year old and pay for him idk what hes planning to do up there. 

Tldr: Suicidal brother with crazy medical bills wants to drop out of college with a free ride to move several states north so he can live with a woman and her husband.",31Jan2019,1

I looked up the laws in California (San Diego) and wasn't exactly sure but it looks like it probably is illegal. 

I can't find my strata rules which is frustrating - but I really want to know if I need to look for a new place to live or even a lawyer. UGH.

608,"I've been trying to condense my problems down to one central issue, and I think I've finally figured it out.

**In any situation where my primary concern is *someone else*, I will try my hardest to make it work.**

IE, my mother has a choral program and needs me for it. I'll practice every day, on the way to work, when I'm going to the bathroom, etc.

Or if I have a class where someone else is relying on me; I'll do my homework promptly, and do the studying immediately after class.

By contrast, if it's something just for myself, like working out, or learning a new subject, or even something I honestly care about, like writing my book, I have an almost impossible time making myself do it.

Unfortunately, I'm in a place in my life where nobody is relying on me for anything, which leads to me sitting inside all day doing nothing. It feels almost impossible to move forward.

So what I'm looking for is something that has others relying on me, a job or career or even just a hobby where I can direct my effort in the way I've found myself able to actually succeed.

616,"I work for (insert trash retailer here) and I was a shiftlead (supervisor/form of management) which is what I was at my previous job of 4 years before they shut down.  So, said current job is going to be making a change where we add a way bigger section to our cosmetics department and I stepped down into the position of “beauty advisor” to become “beauty consultant” once we made the switch.  So, I’d be working with makeup, which I love and so on.  Here’s the deal...they postponed the switch from October this year to NEXT YEAR because they supposedly didn’t budget good enough to do the changeover this year.  Anyways, since hours are now cut for the same budget reason of course I now am going to be getting scheduled more often in other departments and cashiering which forgive me for sounding like maybe an ass but I didn’t step down to be a cashier, it’s like I demoted myself because now I feel as if I’m getting taken advantage of because what I was intended to be there for has at the point in time fallen through.  So instead of getting the extra time to learn my department in current cosmetics and perfect my area, get comfortable, build future clients and get things flowing the way I want and like them I’ll be picking of the slack of other employees.

I moved here last fall, freshly heartbroken and totally on my own for the first time. Jen \[60s F\] is helpful and outgoing; she gave me lots of tips about living alone in my own place. She has a niece, Daisy, about my age, who I don't know that well but seems pleasant enough. 

The only problem is that they both smoke cigarettes, like, a *lot*. I've always known that they're smokers, but it didn't seem so bad when I first moved in. Sometimes it was annoying that they would be talking kind of loudly on our shared porch right outside my door (which, for cramped space reasons, my bed is right up against), but I figure that's just part of having neighbors and bought some earplugs. Now that it's gotten colder, though, one or both of them sometimes smoke in that shared heater/storage area. In my apartment, it seriously smells like I'm standing right next to them, only it's a little more stale somehow. I've taken to burying myself under my duvet to escape it, but even that doesn't totally work. I get really nauseated when it happens, too.

629,"I work a very high pressure job, long hours and mental stress from it. Last year I had a mental breakdown whilst I was undergoing therapy and after spending a lot of time and money (and realising it just wasn't working for me)  I went to my family doctor and started on antidepressants. They helped, and I got a lot better.

I ended up taking a short career break and went abroad for a couple of months where I met my partner. Things were just feeling so much better and after four months on my tablets I found myself forgetting to take them more and more, then just eventually stopped entirely. 

I ended up going back home and moved in with my parents after living out of area for a decade in order to save up and find my own place again after being out of work for so long. 

Due to a combination of things including work and living with my parents, Ive found myself slipping back into old habits since I've been back, I've become snappy, lacking energy and motivation, catastrophizing etc etc. I also get quite nihilistic when I get low and I've noticed that I've started to slip back into my old thoughts which is really scaring me because around the time when I had my mental breakdown I spent a lot of time wishing I could stop existing.

To complicate matters further, my partner (who is abroad, and is an immigrant) lost his job a few months ago and is now having to go through all sorts of lengthy paperwork in order to keep his right to stay in the country and work. I'm worried about him running out of money and/or not being allowed to stay. The money I can help him with, but if he ends up having to move away it would make our relationship impossible. I'm also worried about his own mental state as the situation he's in at the moment is really very unpleasant, I can't even imagine what he's dealing with.

I cut my losses on Monday and signed a lease to a flat which I'll be moving into in 6 weeks. I think it'll help improve things, but I also don't think its going to be enough. I'm scared for my relationship and I'm scared for myself. My thoughts are just spinning. I think I need to go back on my tablets.

I have really good reason to think it’s not in my head and I’m open to the idea that I’m crazy but basically I think I have no way of overcoming this. I didn’t keep at it with the docs cuz I didn’t have the heart, but basically just some physical symptoms that make it seem like it’s not just in my head:

- Very rarely get morning wood

- pretty rarely get horny

- my balls seem to be misshapen

- if I were to get hit in the balls it would hurt, but not to the degree it hurts other people, or used to hurt me

- there is also a clear before and after in my life when this began



There’s more but I digress

I can usually put this on the back burner and not think too much about it but the older I get the more suspicious it becomes that I’ve never been with anybody. Right now it’s on my mind because there’s this guy I like and it seems like it might flow both ways but I’m totally depressed because i don’t see how I could be able to make it work out. I’ve always thought if I actually find someone I like that likes me back I could make it work. I don’t think I can though. What i want most out of life is love, but idt I’ll ever be able to get it. It’s pretty sad, I feel pathetic. 

What’s saddest is that I feel the need to keep this a secret. If I could openly face my problems without being a little bitch about it, there’s at least some honor in that. But this is such a deep and upsetting problem that I don’t see myself being able to be open about it. I feel doomed to continuously forget about it and then get very very sad when it’s forced into the forefront of my mind.

I know this is probably outside the scope of anything most of u guys have heard of, but any advice about how to mitigate my psychological pain might be helpful (besides of course seeing a therapist which I should definitely do).

632,"This might be a little long, and jumbled (I have poor writing skills), I apologize.

I have been dealing with major depression and have thought about suicide since I was a child. My mother was physically and emotionally abusive, and my father was distant. I was neglected and my parents pulled me into homeschooling (barely) and I had to drop out in first grade. At 16 I had the mental age of about 9 or 10, and I still struggle with fitting in as an adult. A few years ago, when I was 19, I built up the courage to leave my abusive situation and ran away with my almost 17 (now ex) online boyfriend (lets call him D) to his home state. I was naive and didn't know what I was doing, I just wanted a way out. My life never really went anywhere after that, we were both abusive to eachother, I was constantly age regressing, and I was in a years long struggle with getting a photo ID for myself that didn't go anywhere. I was hypersexual, and constantly felt like I wasn't satisfied every time we had sex together. That turned into me doing stuff with other people online (which he didn't mind me doing) and a while after that, I did friends with benefits in real life with someone I knew. (let's call him M) I ended up connecting with him, telling him about my suicidal thoughts and he made me feel safe and calm the night we did it. The night ended, everything turned out fine and I went back to the hotel room with D, and we were about to break up, and I had a panic attack and begged him to stay. 

A few days after that, we went back home together, and I still talked to M, and he suggested we hang out in a different town and drink, as friends. This happened, and I made a mistake that night, drank too much (first time I ever got drunk, and with someone else) and ended up having sex with him again when D asked me not to do so. Our relationship ended up breaking apart, I was beating myself up and crying every day over what I did, all of my friends left me, and I didn't have really anyone except M.

After all of that, D got with one of my close female friends, that he used to talk to and hang out with a bit before we ever broke up, on Christmas. I only found out about this a few weeks after. I ended up getting into a relationship with M. Both me and D were rebound, and we still spoke to each other and saw each other sometimes. But every time we did hang out, he'd text his girlfriend in front of me, and made it obvious. Eventually, D's friend (who is also my friend) told me to go live with D again, and try to get my life together down there with him, while he was still in a relationship with this girl. At this point I was in and out of my relationship with M because I was indecisive with what I wanted, and D kept guilting me about not being down there with him. After a while I found out he touched himself to nudes of me while still in the relationship with this girl, and told his friend that as soon as I came down there to live with him, he'd break up with her so we could get back together. 

There was a point where I packed up all my stuff, and was ready to go back down there and live with him, because of how distressed I was, and reliant on him I was, but I backed out last minute, realizing that I was going to end up hurting myself in the process. After I told him it'd be a bad idea, he sent me messages saying things like, he wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't come down there with him, because he never thought i'd grow, move forward and become a better person anyways. The next day, he apologized about what he said and told me that if I wanted to be down there with him he'd love me in his life again.

After that, he cut me off completely, and told me that maybe i'll find someone else that I wouldn't give up on. He seems happy, and all my old friends and his new gf are there for him, and keep him company every day. He seems completely content, and i'm happy for him. Every now and then I struggle with nightmares of him and his new gf, and I still miss him alot, and I still inside haven't let him go, because I relied on him for years, and he's all I know. He hurt me alot, and abused me, but I glorified him in my head, because all my friends saw him as innocent and kind. Both M and D don't want to be friends with me again if I choose the one-another to associate with.

Yesterday, I deleted all the discord servers I was in, wrote a suicide note, and have been pushing everyone away in preparation of killing myself. I always say i'm going to kill myself every now and then when I get really depressed, But this time I want it to be done, and over with, so I don't have to watch everyone around me be happy and successful. It's really hard for me to see a future, and i'm not sure if I want one. Every day I feel extreme guilt and want to change things that can't be changed. Every time I think about suicide or death, I feel calm, and happy. I always feel like an empty shell, and i've been feeling this way for half of my life. Everytime someone tells me things will get better, or tries to help me think away from suicide, it doesn't help, because i'm stuck on it, and I constantly think about it. What do I do? How do I deal with everything?

633,"So right now I'm staying with family. Today I went and saw this house, it's rent to own, but it needs a lot of work. The base of the house seems nice and I have lots of ideas, I'm very inspired by it and think with work I could make it really nice. The price is good, but at I only have about $1000 in savings and it requires all of that just to claim it, not counting needing a stove, fridge, window units, washer and dryer, and that only one room in the house is fully floored. There's also no shower, but I can buy an attachment for the tub faucet at least tenporarily. The yard is also a beautiful blank canvas, as soon as I saw it I had ideas of what I could do to make it beautiful. I researched about flooring and some things I could do about windows and the junky cabinets/countertops, but realistically we are talking about at least a year before this house is semi presentable. I'm afraid I'm getting carried away with my urgency/desire to have my own space, and I really love the idea of completely transforming it, but I don't want to be unrealistic and bite off more than I can chew. If I wait another month I will have $2000 in savings, and I know there are other houses that are in better shape. I want to get out of my family's hair, and I'm very inspired by the property, but I don't want to rush in halfcocked into yet another thing that I will just fail at. Maybe an apartment or house with a smaller yard is more my speed. I just need some not-people-in-my-life advice. ",31Jan2019,1
634,"I have been feeling like at some point in my life I took a wrong turn but can never figure out where. It’s almost as if you’ve peaked at life and now the rest will be a perpetual stalemate. 

Out of high school back in 2006 everything went so fast pace. I graduated and joined the Army then in 2007 went to Iraq and got hurt and in 2008-2009 went through transitioning out of the Army for my injuries. During that time I started an anti suicide program that not only greatly reduced suicide by 33% in just a month but also had insane experiences with celebrities then when I got out they took it and dumped me. I’ve been in a band, ran my own marketing business and even worked for comic con. Then I found streaming and loved it. I was constantly growing back in 2014 but my child’s mother abandoned us and I had to work, go to school full time, stream and take care of my daughter. I chose to prioritize my daughter and drop streaming. Flash forward to today even with all the business experience and life experiences I feel like I’m just constantly waiting for a big break that will never come. It’s almost like a drug. I’m sitting here only 30 years old with a back that’s constantly deteriorating, PTSD and a smile not because I’m truly happy but because my daughter is, but I’m hungry for more.  I just don’t know where to go and how or what to do. I’ve always been good at motivating others and pushing them to do great things but never could do it for myself. I started streaming again but hell now with today’s market I feel like I missed my shot. Hell even at my actual job after having 2 business under my belt and 12 years of leadership experience I can’t get a supervisor position despite the fact when I did a temp supervisor position I had the best numbers and according to our survey (which I created and it was completely anonymous ) I was rated the best supervisor over all of our leadership. The people I use to stream with are all partnered and doing (in some cases) extremely well but I feel like I’ve missed that train and my plateau is coming. I guess the point of this is what now? 

I see success all around me for those I help and guide but for me it’s like running up an escalator.

I live with my fiancé(23M) since about a year and a half and everything is going great, we’ve had very good contact with most of our neighbours and especially this person im now afraid of... we’ve met several times hanged out a few times and even went for dinner at his place once (he’s about 45yo M)!!

Everything started going apeshit a couple of months ago when some random day He rang at our door asking if we wanted to hang out but as we’ve had people over we politely declined and told him some other time, few minutes later we hear these loud « bangs » comming from our yard so we went to check it out!!
Turn out it was our neighbour (who live on the 5th flour and we’re on ground flour) throwing flower pots filled with dirt (pretty big and heavy ones) in our yard and screaming gibberish  (We have several animals who go outside and could’ve totaly get smashed by this, not even counting we oursves could’ve been hit!!) 
We then tried calli g him to see if he was alright and perhaps needed help (we knew he had some depression...) to wich he replied and i quote
« Nothing mathers anymore we’ve gotta hide and barricade ourselves war is comming we’re all going to die anyway » and hang up.
Not know what to do we called my mother who told us to call the police (also for his own safety...) the police arrived and tried reasoning him, he didn’t want to open to them (he barricaded the door with i don’t know what (furniture probably?) and then threatened to jump off his balcony (5th floor).
Fast forward about à hour later the police managed to reason him and enter his appartement after wich he got « arrested » and left with an ambulance to the hospital. 
As the police entered his appartement they also found massive amounts of weapons (we’re in Belgium so no guns just tasers, swords, knifes,... (he used to be a security guard)) so the police got a warrant to search his appartement and took all his illegal stuff!! 
After this he spent about a month in psychic hospital and when he got back (seemingly back to old him) we told him it’s my mom who called the cops to avoid drama (wich he still was a  bit mad  about!) fast forward fed months of just casual hello how you doing fine, u, fine, cya, 2-3 days ago he seemed to start wanting to be more in contact With us (asking to borrow stuff, talking some more when we happen to run into each other, asking to hang out,...) today he came over o bring back something we lent him and he brought mushrooms and asked if we could clean them together (he’s a gardner now) (i was alone at that time, my fiancé was at work for several hours still) he seemed depressed and anxious so i said yes and invited him in, we drank a tea together and prepared the mushrooms but he seemed very anxious wich made me very anxious —(i’ve had à episode a few years ago where a friend of mine (schizophrenic) locked me up in a room and almost beat me to death...)— he brought his own knife (for the mushrooms) wich triggered my anxiety hardcore!! But fortunately nothing happened, we talked, drank tea and prepared the food and then he left after saying if i needed help someday i could come and talk to him, to wich i said we could paint together someday if he wanted to wich he seemed very excited about!

Now i’m extremely anxious i fear all the time he might enter my house and do stuff to us or i don’t know what he could possibly do but i’m just terrified and i don’t know what to do, i’m torn between wanting to help him (i’ve myself experienced severe depression so i know how much someone to talk to. Can help) - and trying to avoid him because i’m at this point actually afraid for my life...

- also there is a clear point in my life when this began

There’s more but I digress

I went to the doctors about it a couple years ago and I was shocked when they told me it is probably in my head. I was too disheartened to keep trying so they didn’t get the full picture of my symptoms but basically im thinking I’m a special case that no one would know how to treat.

Usually this remains in the back of my mind, but every now and then it’s forced to the front and I become very depressed. Right now there’s this guy I like (which is rare) and he seems to like me back but I don’t see how I can make it work. I’ve thought that if I ever found someone I liked enough, I could make it work, but now I don’t think this is true. What I want most from life is love but I don’t think it’s a possibility. It’s pretty sad.

What’s also bad about this is that I feel the need to keep it a secret. If I could at least not be a little bitch and just be honest about the problems I’m facing, there’s some honor in that. But this is just too upsetting so I don’t think I can do it. 

I know this is probably outside the scope of your expertise but any advice about how to mitigate some of my sadness would be appreciated (besides seeing a therapist which I should probably do).

641,"I live in Brazil and had a rough time with university so far. Back when I started high school I had a million majors I wanted to try out and I eventually enrolled in Social Sciences. I took lessons for a year and then dropped out. After a year of thoughtful consideration, I decided I want to pursue something art-related.

My first choice would be Film, but that's really hard to get in here in Brazil and it's a full time course (I can't dedicate that much time to it because I teach English for a living and need that to make ends meet). I thought about taking an online course, but there aren't a lot of options and most of them are focused on public school teaching - something I'm not really interested in.

There's an Art History major where I live in one of the most prestigious universities in the country. It's not that difficult to get in since there aren't a lot of applicants and it's totally free. Classes are at night, so I'd be able to work during the morning and afternoon. 

My goal with this course would be to develop a better understanding of art in order to become a better writer (Film and Creative Writing are my preferred fields in the arts). I'm also interested in reviewing film and teaching at University, which are career paths I could pursue after finishing the course. 

I don't really see a lot of problems with trying it out (the application process takes about a year, so I'd have time to organize my life in order to dedicate the necessary time to studying and all that), but I'm insecure because I've dropped out before and find SAT-like tests to be really really difficult. When I took them for the Social Sciences major I studied really hard and barely made the passing grade, so I'm afraid of that becoming too much of a burden as the year continues. 

Extra information about Brazil's University System - Public universities are free, but there are a lot of applicants and you need to take a combination of standardized tests in order to be accepted (a test created by the government and a specific one from the University). There aren't interviews or anything other than the test in the application process, but the whole thing is kind of a daunting endeavor (the government test is taken over two days for 5h each and the University test is taken over four days over a 5h period). I really hate these tests, but the fact that not a lot of people apply for this major means it wouldn't be so difficult to get in even if I didn't get a significantly high score. 

One last thing: Minors aren't a thing in Brazil, so you need to choose one major and stick to it. If you want to change majors, there's a really complicated system or you can drop out and take the standardized tests again. To make matters worse, our new right-wing government is planning to evaluate the tests in order to look for ""ideological questions"". They're not really into critical thinking, so no one really knows how the tests are going be after they've reviewed it.",31Jan2019,1

643,"(my first language is not english so this might sound weird, sorry)

 I am a 22 y/o woman.

I don't know if i am exaggerating a little bit by feeling down lately.   
My dad has always been very judgmental and strict with me since i was little, it gave me some problems (mental health) but we both improved as I went to therapy, he is now kinder to me, and I am stronger. But his nature is to be a little cold.  


I just graduated from university in december, and i was lucky to find a job, it is not the job i would like because it consists in home office,  and a 4 hour meeting in the actual office weekly. I don't earn a lot, but enough to pay my student debt mensually and I am adjusting. I've been working here for almost 3 months.  


So I always eat at home, and some days I just relax and stay in pants while working. I am pretty proud of myself because I graduated with a job (i starded working a month before graduating), and a week ago they offered me a small pay rise without asking because they like how I work.  One day we were eating and my dad says ""so, when are you going to look for a job"" and that was very unsetting to me, like, so what i am doing right now does not count? :( , I did not respond anything because, well, right now i am just adjusting to my new lifestyle and although i want a better job later I am not thinking for that right now.   


I respond that for now I am trying to grow in the job i already have and I wanna do drawing comissions on internet as an extra income. He almost indignated says ""so, I paid a lot of scholar tuition for nothing, i cant believe it"". And I say, well, drawing is one of my passions I am more oriented to cartoons and entretainment media than doing graphic design, so I feel it would make me happier (for now) to sell comissions temporarily while I get better opportunities.  And he kept angry.  


Today when he arrived to eat at home, he says ""so, you will be always in your room?"" and i say ""were do you want me to work? out side in the grass?""  . He is always judging me and it feels bad. I know my case is not very extreme, there are worse cases, but it's been like that, just very subtle comments on me that gradually in long term affect me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure he will be bothering and pressuring these months and that will annoy me so much. I wanna take my time and discover things with babysteps.

It is not bad what he is telling me, he just wants me to have a better life, a better job, more money, i totally agree, but the way he tells me it makes me feel down or even a little bit sad, because i feel like what i am doing is never enough.

644,"first off, my dad's sort of sexist and misogynistic. My mom grew up in a weird setting. When I was really young my father acted like it was normal to do the whole kiss on the lips thing and once I grew older and realized it was weird I stopped doing it. I'm a junior in high school now and I still feel like my person space is being violated constantly. Idk maybe I'm overthinking this but I just thought that you should teach your kids how to give consent and all that but my dad hugs/kisses me (not sexually) whenever he wants even when i tell him not to. It makes me so uncomfortable like I don't have a choice cause he just forces me to deal with it. And he always says he has ""the right"" because he's my father. 
And my mom always says stuff like ""you're my property"" and I'll keep saying that, no I'm not I don't belong to anyone and they just keep saying I belong to them, I'm their property, they have the right to hug and kiss me whenever they want even when I dont want it. 
My mom even slaps my bum sometimes and I know she's not intentionally trying to make me uncomfortable (where we come from in Europe, families are very close knit and touchy) but it makes me so uncomfortable, and when I tell her not to she just says yes she can because she's my mother. 
I don't get why they can't just respect my personal space. I've tried telling them not to and why it bothers me but they always say the same thing. 
Because of this I keep getting myself into relationships with possessive, dominant guys who don't give me a choice because that's what I know to be normal.

645,"First off apologize for long post.

My problem is that I just recently graduated with a B.S and I have applied towards several graduate schools for the Fall. The only thing I am currently working on is research. However, this lull has led me to just be fearful in general.

I'm extremely scared of failure and disappointing people who I admire and/or want them to like me (i.e., faculty). This has led me to procrastinate on things that I really care about (i.e., graduate applications). I have completed everything on time but it's always at the last minute or I finish it early or at a decent time and question everything I've done with realizing that I've made some mistakes. Though I double triple check everything.

Also, I just messed up (through not understanding fully) on some of my research which caused problems and headaches for my professor. I know I'm causing my own issues but I can't seem to figure out how overcome them.

I don't really think negative thoughts but I'm just shooting myself in the foot over and over. I get stuff done on time and make mistakes or do stuff at the last minute and make mistakes. 

I've realized that I've been living in fear of failure since my undergraduate days so that's how I was motivated to get good grades but now with no ""real"" consequences I'm floundering. So, basically I'm wondering if anything has figured out how to get past the fear and be okay with making errors or disappointing people.

I quickly forgot about it and moved on. Then, when I was in 5th semester, another friend of mine (let's call him Dave) decided to move to that same table where Nick decided to move to. Once again, no explanation for his actions.

And today it almost happens AGAIN. A friend called Laura changed to my class and sits with me and two other guys. Earlier she told me that one of the guys from the other table tried to persuade her of changing to their table. Se later explained that Steve was taking sh*t about me and how I work in class.

649,"So for background, I'm a 35 year old manager in transportation who has some very basic SQL skills, I know excel very well, and can build queries in access. I am not a data scientist, I don't know the first thing about writing SQL, but I know what it is capable of. 

My boss today asked me for a report that I know is well above my head. It'd be the equivalent of asking an HR recruiter to put together a budget presentation. My boss is pretty tech illiterate and thinks pivot tables are magic, so I'm sure they don't have any idea what their ask entails.

I know that in order to accomplish this task, lm going to have to write some pretty serious code. I'm going to have access databases I've never accessed and do a lot of joins I have no idea how to do. This is basically like asking me to learn an entire world of SQL or at least a good chunk of it. 

My current job basically entails managing people, tracking data, and putting together some simple excel reports when asked. It absolutely does not have data science/analyst rolls in it. 

So being conscious of my career, I mentioned to my boss ""hey, I really want to work on this but the requirements are a bit beyond my level of skill."" The answer I received back was ""well you're smart, you can figure it out"". Okay, so then I tried to bring up ""you know, what this entails is kind of beyond the scope of my role. It'd be kind of like if someone asked you if you could help replace their transmission"". The response I got to that was ""well sometimes we need to go above and beyond"". I said ok, I'll look into it and left. 

How can I professionally bring up to my boss that I cannot do what they're asking in the time frame they want without trying come off as lazy or uncooperative?They want it by Monday and there is absolutely no way I can learn all that is required by Monday. 

If they wanted me to go ""above and beyond"" by asking me to help clean the floor, put together an Excel sheet outside of my world, give a presentation...sure no problem. I'm always willing to put in work. But I can't seem to get my boss to understand that what they're asking me for isn't something that I can just Google and have an answer in seconds.

650,"I'll start from the beginning to give a brief overview. I don't want to give any information that could identify anyone away so most of the personal info is changed. 3 years ago (I was 19) I met a girl we'll call Laura on Omegle she lived in a different country to me and was about the same age. We had so much in common and before I knew it I was spending most of my nights on the phone to her and she had become more than just a pen pal but someone I trusted. She had mental health issues in her past and had to stop university because of them but was looking to start again soon and after meeting she decided to live in my country and study here. The universities in my country are generally better and so are  the chances of employment. She decided to go to a university somewhat close to me in a city about 30 mins away however she went through last minute and changed it to the same university as me. I was fine about this but thought it was definitely odd.  She moved over and that night we made love and she never stayed in her accommodation once and she cancelled her contract. Basically in the entire 2 year span of our relationship we never lived apart and basically lived (rather unhealthily) like a married couple. Her student finance from her country's government basically refused to pay out and for the majority of the nine months I was financially supporting both of us in terms of rent and grocery's. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had mental health issues and would spend most nights crying and sometimes couldn't leave the room we worked through it and she got a job and payed her way until things were 50/50 but I always helped in giving her my old computers and lending her money when she needed it but basically I wasn't the breadwinner anymore. This was the golden era of our relationship I suppose. Until I sadly got my own stroke of mental illness. I withdrew from my studies and social life and stopped leaving the house and after 6 months she left me. I withdrew from my studies at uni and we had a few days together before she went home for christmas. We continued making love, sharing a bed and she told me that when i've had the help I need we can continue our relationship but it would be better for us to part ways as it would be better for me to be on my own. We always said ""I love you"" and when she went home she still said it. We agreed to keep in regular contact and watch episodes of things whilst on the phone together. I truly believed she wanted to be with me but couldn't stand my illness. I also found out my dad had cancer around this time, so it helped that I could be home during this period

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my parents and sorted therapy and medication for myself and am seeking help. I would speak to her on facebook and on the phone but she refused to say I love you back I said it was too weird for me and needed a break from talking. after that break she basically hasn't spoking to me. I asked to talk about us and she said ""there is no us, I hope you find happiness"". That was the last thing she sent back to me before blocking me on facebook. I would send her messages asking for an explanation, basically begging. sent her an e-mail and now she's back in the country and in our flat she still  won't directly contact me. She basically said to my mother that she feels uncomfortable with me being near her and that the messages i've been sending are manipulative and unfair. If I continue to contact her she will call the police. I can screencap the messages if I need to prove myself but I'm basically begging for a reason to why she changed her mind about me and asking for closure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've basically lost my shadow. I haven't spent a week apart from her in 2 years and now I can't even speak to her. It got to the point where I was begging her to just talk to me about my day.

651,"My bestie and i have known each other for 3 years now, and we’re really close, but recently she’s been getting upset over stupid things, like the person i like. It’s genuinely annoying because i feel like she gets pissed at me no matter what i do. it almost feels like i can’t be in a relationship without her getting all pissy at me. i think it’s because she’s not used to not having attention. But i don’t know because i just spilled my guts anonymously to her, and she’s texting me about it, i feel so bad. i just told her how she’s gets so upset over the things that i can’t control. she’s really childish, but i don’t know if i can let her go, because i’ve known her for so long. i just don’t know what to do. please help me, thank you",31Jan2019,1
652,"Okay, so the story is pretty long, but I am gay and I was recently dumped by my ex at the end of November. Before we dated I was also friends with this other guy which I would hook up with once in a while. Before I got into the relationship, they both met each other and it was awkward. During my relationship, I did not talk to my friend that much because my ex was jealous. When we broke up, my ex slept with four different guys four days in a row starting the day we broke up, so then, I realized I should be moving in too and went on a date and hooked up with this guy who was visiting me. My ex got mad because I went on a date and was being really unfair. A week later we talk and say that we want to be friends with benefits and exclusive (kinda stupid label). He goes to the mountains for a week and I hook up with my friend, because I didn’t take my ex seriously, especially knowing how much he wants sex all the time. I always think he is hooking up with other guys, because he is very secretive and sneaky. When he came back I asked him if he had hooked up with this guy named, let’s say, Daniel. Daniel had been someone I had hookup up with before we dated that he didn’t like. He said yes, he hooked up with him two weeks ago because he was mad at me for going on a date. Daniel had been talking to me for the last two weeks pretending to be my friend. I felt stupid and played, so I decided to tell him I had hooked up with my friend while he was at the mountains. Again, he got really mad. We kept talking and decided to be honest and stop hurting each other. He moved two hours away because he had to go back to school. And that is hard because he doesn’t like texting or anything, so he is probably definitely hooking up, but he denies it and says I should trust him more. My friend, on the other hand, is fed up with him for being an asshole to me. And because I keep texting him, he told me he is mad at me for being so stupid and believing him. Today, he gave me an ultimatum saying that if I keep talking to m ex (I’m supposed to visit him this weekend and my friend found out) he will stop being my friend.

What should I do? What is even the right decision here? It’s not that I don’t trust anyone, it’s just that everyone is being sketchy!",31Jan2019,1
653,"*Not using my regular reddit account

I have to start by saying that I was conceived through rape, &amp; that my mother (&amp; family) knew this person. Fast forward to when I’m in my early twenties. I received a message on MySpace from someone claiming to be my sister, telling me that I have more siblings who I don’t know about. The kicker — they all look like me. I tell myself that just bc their father did something crazy fucked up doesn’t mean that they (my siblings) are bad people. I start to wonder if this is what I’ve been looking for, if this will fill the void that I’ve been feeling all my life. I’d always wanted sisters. 

In the message, she tells me the story they were given by “him.” He told them that my mom &amp; him had discussed having children, but she told him she was going to have an abortion or something (I apologize, I can’t remember all the details). I didn’t want to ruin their relationship with their father in case it was a good one (who knows, maybe he turned his life around?), &amp; let’s face it, they probably wouldn’t have believed me anyway. I didn’t know what to do. I agreed to meet them on the terms that he was not to know or show up. They agreed.

We met &amp; the feelings were overwhelming. I thought for sure this was what I had been missing from my life. However, I couldn’t get over the overwhelming sense of guilt. How could I betray my real family by hanging out with them? What was I thinking? I tried to hang out with them on one more occasion, but decided I couldn’t continue the relationships bc of the feelings of guilt.

Fast forward again over a decade later. One of the siblings found me on Facebook &amp; has been messaging me wondering why I disappeared, what did they do wrong, etc. I honestly don’t even know if I can reply, &amp; if I did, what would I even say? I know if my real family found out I was trying to forge a relationship with them I would be disowned &amp; my mother, who has a lot of mental health issues bc of what happened to her, would spiral out of control. She has addiction problems &amp; has attempted to take her own life. I can’t risk that again. 

What do I do, Reddit? I have felt guilty every day ever since we’ve been in contact, which, as I said before, has been for over a decade. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",31Jan2019,1

658,"Its easy to say we are humble, but how do we put it in to practice in day-to-day life? 

It might be better thought of as increasing our wisdom (to recognize we need to be humble) and  integrity (putting it into action). Lets say you did something bad: *was mean to the waitress.* Most often people 'justify' their wrongdoings, by saying things like *I was having a stressful day*, or say *people do a lot worse things than that so its no big deal.* But raising your awareness is more akin of this: I recognize it was my error or fault and I genuinely regret it. I acted in a wrong manner. I am going to apologize. In the future I am going to strive to not repeat that same mistake and be a better person. This requires a high level of social maturity and emotional intelligence. 

People often dont want to acknowledge their wrongdoings because that implies they are a 'bad person' and this causes inner conflict so its easier to deny it or sometimes its ego/pride. But you *can* do this without inner conflict, guilt or loss of self esteem because you can **acknowledge that you are human and therefore imperfect**. Acknowledging our mistakes takes character and integrity. But oddly most people never do this, they rather justify their actions or feel there were the ones who were 'right' during a dispute/argument with others, even if it means destroying a valuable relationship. 

Any ideas you guys can come up with so people can be more humble, have less difficulty in apologizing when they have done wrong. ",31Jan2019,1

From what I’ve gathered, it’ll be about 10 students and two interviewers, but beyond that, I have no idea what to expect. I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to stand out and differentiate myself from the others in a group setting like that, especially because I don’t want to talk too much and seem like I’m not giving others an opportunity to talk.

I’m really nervous. I applied for this job last year too, but I didn’t make it to this stage then. I really want this job and I think I’d be good at it, but I’m worried I won’t do a good enough job in the interview. Any advice would be great.",31Jan2019,1
660,"Hi all, I recently applied to do a bachelor of Nursing at University and didn't make the cut. I was never 100 % sure it was what I wanted to do anyway, but I will admit I'm a bit bummed about not getting in. Alternatively they have given me the option to do a Associates Degree in Applied Health &amp; Community Support. I'm even less interested in this but am wondering if I should just do it and see what comes of it? Apparently after a year you get a diploma and have a better shot at getting into nursing... 
Besides this option I don't know what else to do with my life.. I have few interests, work 1 day a week as a disability support worker (which I don't love) and besides that I just keep the house tidy, look after my partner and get high most nights..

I don’t want to meet her because we aren’t great friends and I have no intention at all of becoming anything more with her, and the situation makes me feel uncomfortable. Is there a way of letting her know this without it hurting her or making anything awkward? I see her around college quite a lot too, so I don’t want to be too rude. ",31Jan2019,1
662,"Hey guys, first time posting here. I'm not in a life threatening situation or anything but I'm pretty lost.  I moved from a small city to a big city at the beginning of this month. I live in a suburb around 30 min-1 hour away from where I work depending on how bad the traffic is. The reason being because my sister and I were supposed to move into the city once i moved out here. Things aren't going as planned because of her job and we have to delay the move, which is fine i guess. Anyways, the real situation is my place of work.  They hired me but I genuinely feel like they're regretting their decisions because they scheduled me a bunch of on call shifts and every time I call they don't need me. I finished the training and spent so much money on gas only not to be getting shifts. I thought it was because I was new but checking the schedule I see that the other new servers who got hired at the time I did got actual shifts, not on call shifts. I'm taking this very personally and it has affected me very negatively. I don't know whether to stick it out or look for another job. This whole situation has made me feel unlikeable and I've been locked in my apartment for the last 3 days. I feel like I'm unfit for the big city life.

663,"So I go to a small university and I’m in a smaller program of 3 students in my program full time, me being one of them.
We have our own area of the school where all of our classes are and because were so far away from everything we have a table with a kettle and a microwave where some people keep teas. Some people bring big boxes for people to share but I hate three tins of my favourite teas from David’s tea. David’s tea is pretty expensive especially when you’re paying student loans, and one of the other guys is just using my small tin of pricy tea without asking and he does it right in front of me. I have a locker and I’m thinking of moving my tea to there but the thing is this guy also follows me around for some reason and he lives in res so there really isn’t anywhere else for him to go. If he sees me moving my tea into my locker it’s going to turn into a whole other thing.

They support you and give you so much love, tell you all those sweet words that they'll always be there for you and that you matter to them and, then suddenly they just cut you off? I feel that it what's happening to me. One of my best friends who used to be so cheerful and so sweet has now grown distant. If I send her a message all I get is a short answer or no answer at all. Worst thing is that, I have no idea what I did. Both my best friends seem to just have grown tired. The other still shares some laughs with me and still answers my messages, but no longer interacts with my posts on FB. Why do I feel so betrayed? I've become so attached to the both of them. Any minute I'm not with them, I'll be in pain. They talk to each other normally, so I feel like it's me who is the problem.

The best friends I've ever had here in real life. It's honestly so heartbreaking. I've been betrayed over and over again. I'm not even sure if this is actually happening, but my friendship with them certainly isn't what it used to be. I don't want to ask them if something's wrong because I have done that too many times. I barely hang out with them since my schedule is really different than theirs. I really don't know what to do. I don't think I'd be able to let anyone in my life again if they are actually ditching me. I'm just so hurt and lost right now. Why do people do this?
