0,"I invited my friend over for a party and my brother and sister had a bunch of their friends over as well. My whole family was there too. We went in the pool and also had chips with dip with people most likely double dipping so germs were being spread around a lot. Few days later most of my family is sick and we are about to leave for a long family vacation overseas in a few days. We all more or less have a fever, sore throat, headache, chills, muscle sores, nausea and all that. It’s bad. I told my friend I’m sick and she said she had the same exact symptoms two weeks ago.

She’s anti vax and opposes medicine in general so she did not take antibiotics or any medicine for her sickness. I read that when you don’t take antibiotics it makes the sickness last in your body for up to two weeks even after symptoms have disappeared and you can still be contagious. Basically I believe she literally contaminated the majority of my family at my party and probably my siblings’ friends as well.

Bummed because we are literally about to go on vacation. It’s my parents 20th anniversary, me and my mom’s birthdays, and my graduation celebration all in one basically. I don’t know what we are going to do when we are all sick af. 

Also I don’t know if I should tell my friend and say hey you got everyone sick next time take responsibility and take fucking antibiotics so you don’t contaminate everyone around you. What do you think?",29May2019,1
1,"I don't post stuff like this...but oh well. My life right now pretty good, I have everything I could possibly need. 
One problem. I feel unsatified. I have great friends, I like my school, but it feels as if I am stuck on the same routine. I have been told a lot of people like me because I seem down to earth but I question if they like me for me or if they like me for my name. I overthink everything. It seems that everyone is fake these days. I know I am only in high school but it feels like it will never get better....how do I stop thinking this way?",29May2019,2
2,"Mom is an immigrant (permanent resident, non citizen), speaks little English (heavy accent), and currently works night shifts at Wal-Mart as a sales associate. She is early 50's, with a previous bachelor's degree from her home country. (self described that she doesn't know most of her education from back then anymore). She is raising my youngest sibling who is 10 and on the Autism Spectrum, which is why she works at night (she takes care of him during day, our dad during takes care of him at night). Soon (no definitive timeline given to employees yet) the Wal-Marts in the area will not be open 24 hours. Same with Targets, and other comparable jobs which means my mom will have to find a new job. She looked at janitorial jobs or maybe cafeteria/lunch lady, but I think she could go back to school for something like medical billing and coding. With online school, she could work towards a certificate of some kind soon enough. Money will be an issue, family is pretty in debt and doesn't make a lot of money. I'm seeing community colleges that offer ""Continuing Education"" programs, but what kind of programs would be right for her? Can she just apply to be accepted into studying for an associates? Any other kind of high education or career she could learn? What should she keep in mind while she makes some important decisions in the next 6 months or so? Can I do anything as a 19yr old college student?",29May2019,1
3,"Hi. I'm a 15 year old male who thinks is bi and i just lost my virginity to a guy who was older than me i don't know his exact age but definitely older than 18 he was cool and chill about everything even though he knew my age and i knew his. I was sexually frustrated and really horny and was basically going through grindr being extremely thirsty until i texted this guy named Mike. Now the thing about me on grindr is that i ask guys for pics and after they send and i send my own i normally just jerkoff and that's that. At first i texted him a few days through the app asking to trade pics and he declined fast forward to this afternoon he asked for pics while sending some of his own. I sent him some and he complimented me and told me to meet him in his apartment building. I was hesitant and finally decided that ill tell him i can only go for a little bit and he says it's fine and tells me to come. Now ive never done ANYTHING sexual with anyone in my life. Ive never had a boyfriend, girlfriend or my first kiss and obviously ive never had sex. So my horny self decides to go after i ask him for a few more face pics. It was a short walk 12 minute that felt like forever i was cold even though it was 70 degrees and i was shaking because i was so nervous. So i get there and find him and he leads me to the top floor staircase. He sits on a window ledge and im sitting on the stairs still nervous and he just talks a little trying to break the ice I guess he talks about how he declined me at first because he didn't trust me and explains that i shouldn't do something i didn't want to. He mentions how me being so shy is cute then asks me what do i want to do. At that point I felt like i left my body and was looking at myself from outside my body. Ill try to skip over the nasty parts but I say what i want to do (bj) so he takes it out and it feels like a dream. Not in the fact that im enjoying it but in the fact that i didn't feel like myself. I just started and tried to mimic what I see on porn. Then after a while he asks me to get up so he can see my ass i do what he says and he compliments me while feeling me up and I say ""maybe you could try putting it in"" WITHOUT A CONDOM I SAY THAT. IT WAS SURREAL I DIDNT FEEL LIKE MYSELF so he asks if im sure and i said ""Yes"". So he starts slow and after a while i ask him to ""go faster"" THIS STILL DOESNT SOUND LIKE ME I also say ""Talk Dirty"" Im not sure those were things i just found hot. He asks if i was ok multiple times and i say yes even though it did sting a little. So we finish and we tell me i should go down and he goes up on the staircase YES WE HAD SEX ON THE STAIRCASE he gives me a peck and i ask him if i could try again since it being my first kiss. Then i walk home with a million thoughts running through my head. He didn't seem like a bad guy he was genuinely nice and made me feel somewhat comfortable but he did know i was underage heck maybe he regrets it. I think about telling my friends but i think i shouldn't because they might think im dirty and I feel dirty refusing to look at my reflection. i think about being a highschooler and not experiencing sex with someone my age and i think about how overexaggerated sex is in tv and in high school. I think about if i liked it or not, I think about him saying ""if there's a next time"" and if i should see him again. I just felt overwhelmed. I always saw ""my first"" as something sacred even though im not religious. It was just weird I don't know",29May2019,1
4,"I really want to stop self pitying and victimization. I want to feel self love and self gratification. Maybe without a therapist, preferably.

5,"Sorry if this is not nearly as interesting or special as most threads on this reddit, but im not very socially talented, so some advice on this would be much appreciated.

A good friend of mine told me a while ago she's in a wheelchair due to a surgery because her spine wasn't growing correctly, she cant keep balance by herself now. I know she is very insecure about this and it took her a long time to tell me (it's a long distance friendship). Ofcourse i told her it wasn't going to affect our friendship in any way and i still cared just as much about her.

But even though i know she trusts me and she told me she's comfortable talking to me about most issues, she avoids the topic. Personally i would like to know more, both out of curiosity and because i care about her. But i am not sure how to bring this up, if i should approach this casually or in a serious matter, or just not at all. Any advice would be welcome :)",29May2019,2
6,"I'm wondering how not to be lonely and open up more because over the years I have closed myself off from people due to bullying and being backstabbed or forgotten by past friends even when I try to initiate contact.

However, because of this I have phases where I get really lonely and I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice about how to fix this?",29May2019,3
7,"Hey guys so I don’t know if this is where I should post this but I need to know how to answer in this scenario. 

So I have a friend from college that is in one of my classes with me, so we were texting today and he said there was something about me that looked different today. 
Long story short he said my new haircut looks cute, so I said thanks and couple of minutes after he said it looks sexy on me. I don’t wanna be the kind of girl who says “oh I have a boyfriend” for something stupid, but I just don’t want him to keep saying those things because it feels weird honestly and I do have a boyfriend. 

Also, I don’t know how to react to compliments so this is more awkward than usual and I don’t like it. 

TL;DR: my friend from college is complimenting me and saying I look sexy and it feels awkward because I have a boyfriend and I just need to know what to answer in these situations please",29May2019,1
8,"My friend and I talk everyday (he’s been busy with work lately so we only exchanged a couple of texts on Friday). 

I messaged him Saturday night and he got back to me Sunday morning. I responded in the afternoon when I woke up. I got no answer. I messaged him again Sunday afternoon and still no answer. I called him a few times Monday, no response. I texted and called today a few times and still no response. I am extremely worried as we talk at least once a day. I can’t stop by his house since we live in completely different cities.

9,"I have a bad case of this disease called exostosis. it's like extra bones growing out of nowhere on the surface of an other bone, i have it on my shoulder, knees, ankle and my wrist, it effected my life on every side, since i remember i always was ashamed of the way i look and walk, i always felt like people are watching how weird i walk, i always wear cloth in a way that they cover my legs and shoulder, always wearing baggy pants and like that.   


I walk weird and don't even talk about running, normally it's not painful tho, it' only gets painful on my ankle when i walk for long or run or doing some heavy exercises.  


the treatment is surgery and removing the extra bones but it's really expensive and insurance in my shitty country only covers just a small amount of it.   


so yea, I'm 21 here, don't have any money nothing near what i need, i'm barely making enough to pay my rent, got a poor family I'm really tired of living like this.  


please give me some advice

10,"Well, I'm a untalented person. I realized it about three years ago, so I decided to learn guitar and start a new hobbie. I didn't learn almost anything theoretical, but on the other hand I practiced a lot. It was cheering me up a lot and helping me to pass through hard moments in my life. But as time goes by, I got really discouraged. During almost two years, I wasn't improving too much, even though I was trying hard. I also had no one to share about what I have learned, so I gave up.

A few months later, I knew about a recently formed group from my neighbour. In that group, they practiced a lot of instruments, including guitar. But I also gave up quickly because there was a guy who was always hitting on me and being inconvenient. I had no incentive anymore.

I miss playing it, I just don't know how to encourage myself to start to play again. I'm afraid of trying and getting disappointed at myself.",29May2019,2

12,"So I just finished my junior year yesterday and now im heading into my senior year at a high school i didn’t want to attend in the first place. I wanted to go to this other school where my best friend goes along with some other people I knew.

When I started there my Sophomore year I didn’t want to be there at all but I accepted the fact my parents couldn’t/wouldn’t enroll me in the school I wanted. I started meeting people and hanging out all the friends stuff. I made it through the year and still wanted to go to the other school but just accepted the fact that wasn’t happening. 

Junior year starts and a lot of stuff happens to my personal life where I won’t go into detail. I make 2 new best friends and start losing contact with my friends over in the other school. I go through winter break and come back. By this January I had stopped thinking much of the other school but occasionally wonder and wished I’d be at the other school. But then I met my now girlfriend and then more personal stuff happened involving my love life and friendships. I’ve gone through a lot with my new friends. 

I’m about to go into my senior year now same school. But at my school senior year we have to choose our “propaedeutic package” which is basically a package including classes for regarding certain career paths. There’s “Chemist-Biologist”, “Physicist-Mathematician”, “Economic-Administration” and “Humanities”. Now, ever since I heard the 4 options I had I’ve wanted none of them and I had to forcefully choose which I would go into next semester. 

Here’s where my problem comes in. 

A few weeks ago my mom told me there might be a slight chance that I can switch schools to the one I wanted to go into the first place. Of course at the news of this I started getting a little excited but not too much. Tomorrow we are going to the school to see if I can get enrolled for my Senior year. 

My problem is that I don’t know if I should change schools. Even if I did my problem then becomes how am I going to tell my friends and girlfriend that I’m leaving them to go to another school? How can I tell them that in a way where no one is hurt? I also don’t know how to handle this situation since we all are out on summer break already.

Should I even change schools?
How am I supposed to tell my friends if I do?",29May2019,1

15,"Hello! This is my first post in Reddit and I'm actually excited lol 
I don't know if this kind of question belongs here, let me know if there's a better subreddit

So, I'm a 17 year old student form Mexico (So sorry for my bad English, and maybe this can affect recommendations) and I have one nephew (12 year old) and two nieces (6 year old and 3 year old) from my two older brothers. Recently I had the idea of, when I have money enough, buying my three little darlings some books so when they are older they can be more creative and stuff. 

My younger niece obviously can't read, not yet, but I would love to buy her some good book so she can start slowly.

My older nice can, but she's more of the nowadays kids that likes to watch YouTube videos and stuff, she's a completely energetic girl and like cute stuff (princess, ponys, sparkles, animals, etc)

And my older nephew is not really the type of reading kid, he's kinda been doing bad in some classes in school because he gets distracted and doesn't do his homework and I'm not sure if he would read the book but I want to give it a try, he's an amazing boy, likes things like Star Wars, Legos, action, horror things, but because he's a little bit more younger I want to give him something more appropriate for his age but still something he would like.

So, if you have kids or know a good book I can give to them please let me know! Also if you have some advice to create a better reading habit for them it would be so helpful!

Thank you so much in advance! (n.n)",29May2019,1

So about an hour ago my dad came barging into my room with a hammer saying he was going to put down all of my dogs. My wife was obviously against this and they ended up getting into a fight. He now wants to get all of the dogs out of the house starting with his dog. I won’t get rid of my dogs because I have had them since they were 6 weeks old. 

In about 45 days my dad is going to court for a felony drink driving ticket and is more than likely going to be locked up for a few years.

17,"So ya.

Usually its over things like movies or shows or games or other random junk. But it will be all I can think about and indulging in it is the greatest thing in the world. These obsessions can last weeks or months. I've sort of accepted this fact about myself, sure its weird but it doesn't hurt anyone. Plus its really fun to be obsessed with something.

Now the issue is when I get obsessed with people. Very rarely does it happen, but I kinda lose control when it does. Back in school I had a crush on this girl. Important note: I spoke to this girl maybe twice. Like ever. But she was all I could think about all day every day. Sure I was younger and had raging hormones but this above that. I masturbated to only thoughts of her for 3 years straight. When I wasn't in school I was always fantasising about her and this made up future of us. Its really creepy I know.

I'm currently really obsessed with a twitch streamer, and its hard to resist the urge to donate my entire life savings to her. I wish I could say that sarcastically but thats literally whats going through my mind. I dont even care that she won't like me back, just if it makes her smile and laugh then thats like the worlds best drug to me. Being obsessed with people usually just fucks with my life because all I care about is theirs. On one hand I want to stop because its not healthy but on the other hand it gives me joy and makes me feel all good inside. Probably because I enjoy others lives so much because i hate my own.

IDK what im asking advice for really. Just needed an outlet. How can I stop these obsessions if at all possible? It's hard because the instant I realise i'm starting to like something, all hope is lost, and i go immediately into a crazed obsession over it.

I'd be that creep ex or stalker. Well i wouldnt actually stalk them. At least not unless its convenient. If we were together at school then maybe a little. But not like follow them home type stuff. But i'd be that guy to find a hair of their crush and put it in a glass box and keep in my room and worship it forever.",29May2019,1
18,"So, there is a person who is a distant acquaintance who I started talking to on FB after a few years, a few weeks ago. We talked for a few weeks, maybe once a week - then the relationship went extremely sour.

I am ready to drop this when I can get my head around what is going on and what this person's intentions are so that I can be prepared to deal with them.

So, the conversation turned toxic in this way: 

- This individual critiqued my career aspirations, saying that I will not reach my career goals.
- They critiqued my hair style in the past.
- Said that I am not the only person that they talk to on Facebook , and I am not 'special'.
- They are indifferent to me and do not care if I talk to them or if I do not talk to them.
- The conversation always turns competitive. 
- Questioned how I got on to my degree course.
- Said that I was a 'weird and unusual person - but you can work with it'.

So, I distanced myself from this person, due to their indifference and mean comments. However, this person occasionally still messages me out of the blue - although the conversation goes nowhere as I do not take them on. 

Now, after a few months this person is behaving in a way that confuses me. They keep liking my photos and FB status'. I also notice that they immediately log out of Facebook Messenger, each and every time I sign on. 

Could someone please spell out what is going on in this person's mind? If they dislike me why are they messaging me randomly and liking my photos? This is confusing.",29May2019,0
20,"I had an interview for an IT job like a couple hours ago and they said on the spot that they weren't going to hire me. So I acted as professional as I could, said ""thank you"", asked questions, and wrote a Thank you letter to the interviewer and all that stuff. I thought ahead that this rejection wasn't going to bother me because I pretty much knew that they weren't going to hire me anyways but I CAN'T STOP THINKING SO NEGATIVELY ABOUT THIS!!!

I never mentioned to them that my communication was lacking because of my Aspergers Syndrome. They also told me that I wasn't being direct with what I was saying but that was mostly because I was too nervous since it's my first time.

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO??? I have never been so depressed in such a long time. I keep having these thoughts about killing myself because I know nobody is going to hire someone like me who has aspergers and not enough indepth knowledge about IT. My resume is a big mess and I have nothing else to show for it. I'm scared that it's gonna take years before I can get a job, maybe decades. Idk. It's scaring the shit out of me.

21,"I'm going to try and make this brief, but there's 7 years of history to discuss. 

The mother, let's call her Sam, used to live with my brother and his gf about 7 years ago. During that time, I stayed there alot when visiting my ailing grandma in the area. My family became enamored by Sam's daughter, Stella. Stella was the sweetest, funniest little girl. Stella was just barely 2 years old. My mom started babysitting her occasionally, and over the years our family has treated Stella like a niece and a granddaughter. Stella doesn't have a dad in the picture and Sam has no family, except for an alcoholic mother. My family was the closest thing to an aunt and an uncle and grandmother than Stella was ever going to have. Stella would spent holidays with us. I loved taking her to museums and the zoo and the movies. Stella made me want to have kids of my own when I never thought I did.

In the past 7 years, Stella's mom Sam has been married and divorced. She also had another daughter, Lila. Lila was an unruly child who didn't potty train until she was almost 5. My family would rarely take Lila with us when we picked up Stella, but Lila also had a dad and two half brothers in the house with her. When Sam got a divorce, she made a rule that my family could not take Stella without taking Lila. It made Lila sad and jealous, unless Lila was visiting her dad that weekend. I always had the suspicion that Sam wanted 9 year old Stella to watch 5 year old Lila, but I had no leg to stand on, so we complied. 

During this time Sam had her new bf move in. his name is Joe. He thought it was weird our family had gotten so attached to Stella and convinced Sam to pull back on letting us see Stella. Joe became convinced that my brother was sleeping with Sam which is why our family liked Stella so much. This is absurd for a number of reasons, least of all that my brother is happily engaged.

With this theory as his weapon, he told Sam to cut us out of her life or he'd move out. So Sam to stop letting us see Stella. It's been 6 months since we have seen Stella, and we used to get her once or twice a month. The ladt we saw her was to give her our Christmas gifts. My mom and Stella and my brother would all come to my house to help me decorate my tree. We were supposed to have Stella all weekend, but 4 hours in, Sam called and said we should bring her home by 10 am the next morning. 

My mother is devestated. Stella was the closest thing she had to a granddaughter. I'm devestated. Stella's birthday is next month. She'll be 10. I'm heartbroken to think I won't see her. I'm afraid she's wondering why we haven't seen her. I'm afraid she thinks we don't love her. And now I'm crying. That thought just breaks my heart. I would raise that child as my own in an instant. 

Talking to Sam had been fruitless. She's blocked all of us from social media and our phone numbers.

23,"It's been almost 9 months since me and my ex-girlfriend split. We didn't date long, about three months over last summer. It ended because of arguing and mistrust on my part, and a big factor was how far away we were from each other. But we had a lot of chemistry before the fighting and felt like we've known each other for years before we met, and clicked right away when we started to talk. We both ended up being in a ignorantly deep-infatuation with each other and I can say I felt like I was in love with her. I say ignorant because we both knew she was going to move hours away for college yet we still decided to pursue a serious relationship. Even though it was a brief relationship, it was the first time I ever had a girl confess her love for me and want to be with me as bad as she did. She was basically my first love. I still love her and we've reconnected again about three months ago as she said she still missed me and loved me and I told her the same. She even asked me if I would ever get back together but out of fear of having to go through another break up I told her no I wouldn't. After this we didn't talk for a few weeks and then I decided to that I missed her too much to not at least try to get her back. But by this point, after I texted her asking to talk about it, she told me she's moved on and is seeing someone else. I was pretty shattered by that and cut off all contact with her and told her it's best if I remove her from social media so I could move on. So I did that, took her off all social media, and deleted her phone contact temporarily so I could move on for good and the past three months I've been trying to move on. But yet, everyday since then she's all I can think about. I miss her everyday and it's starting to wear me down and burden me. Then yesterday (on her friend's snapchat story since I didn't delete them off) I saw her wearing my old basketball sweater that I gave to her. I guess this resparked the hope that I told myself to get rid of. Should I just forget about it and continue moving on? Or should I try to reach out and try things again?",29May2019,0
25,"This is someone with marked paranoia, very aggressive ways of talking, and occasional first of rage.

She is also very unstable and while charming at times, other times she is rude and makes no sense. Imagine a really mean Moira Rose.

Yesterday she called me and while the conversation was generally good, there were some moments I felt she was very aggressive (she kept asking me if I was on uppers in a mean accusing and why am I so high strung... I’ve never done a drug in my life. I was working. She has never worked a day in her life so I suppose she’s never been “in the zone”. She also was pretty rude about my “safe space” pin because I’m not gay and kept calling it very peculiar to want to be so involved in “the gay cause”). 

I just decided then I was exhausted of her and this morning I left her a message saying very kindly that I felt the conversation yesterday was aggressive and as a friend it’s my duty to tell her how I made her feel.
I was working for hours after so when I left the office I saw a bevy of messages that started kind enough, but became more and more irate as time went by- telling me what awful manners I have and how dare I ruin her day with an accusation of this sort. I blocked her on social media and on the phone. 

She’s already lost a lot of friends and it’s so emotionally taxing to deal with her.

I told her it wasn't true (despite the fact that it was) and she believed me so she has no idea at this point in time.

But anyway the point is we're talking and I don't really know what to do from here. I mean the school year is almost over, and the summer is approaching quickly. I have no idea what to do, say, or anything. Help would be much appreciated I guess. Although I would prefer fewer jokes and more serious comments/suggestions here, jokes are not prohibited. Even if you think your suggestion is wack, just comment it. Why not right?

So a little about the girl. She is a more reserved type who has dated guys who are significantly ""cooler"" than I am. She is not anyone to jump into anything, and I am CERTAIN that she doesn't look for anything where it's like ""wanna fuck?"" within 5.323 seconds. She is not a gamer (not sure if that matters but whatever). (Side note) I myself am also not one to jump into things like this, and I'm not going to say I love her or anything but I do like her VERY much. She is careful, and she thinks that she isn't very attractive (but she is lmao), she knows that other guys think that she is attractive but she doesn't take that in I guess. She makes self-deprecating comments sometimes while we talk and (it makes me upset xD) I try to tell her that the things she says aren't true but you know, coming from a nobody like me what does it matter.

I guess I'm just going to leave this off with this. I don't know how to handle a situation like this and it would help if any of you people could help me. I really want to tell this girl that I like her and I would like also to arrange times where we could hang out and such. I know that the last two parts may not come easy, but that's the way it is. I'm not necessarily afraid of being rejected, I would just prefer that it never comes to that. Even if you think just turning away from this wild goose chase is a good idea, let me know, I want to hear everyone's ideas (even if it's like 3 people because this dies in new, sorry I had to put it in here). Thank you for your time if you read all of this stupid shit, and thank you for your help/suggestions if you left any.",29May2019,1
29,"Am a driver for a pizza company, not going to say which, but anyways i just started like 3 months ago and so far I've been doing the most work in the store out of all the other drivers. So as it goes, if a driver isn't on the road there are stuff they need to do in the store and me being new I'm one of the only few drivers that actually do the work. The cooks like working with me because I get stuff done and 2 of the 3 assistant managers like me because they know I'm reliable. I'm also one of the only few drivers that actually show up on time for their shift and don't constantly call out either.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my problem, for whatever reason the general manager and the other assistant manager don't like me. I know i'm not gonna get fired because I have yet to be written up for anything and they're constantly scheduling me to work over 40 hr weeks. It has gotten to the point where the gm won't even talk to me most of the time and the assistant manger snaps at me for no reason and my co workers often times defend me because I'm just going my job.

33,"It all began with the divorce, my mom decided to divorce my ex step-dad, which was due to her being unhappy with it (might help if you knew how fast she got married, it took just one and a half years to decide that she wanted to get married), so while in the process of getting divorced I moved for my senior year of highschool to start in a different state with my aunt and uncle (I did this for two reasons, 1. I did it for the state lottery to help for college which only helps if you graduate in the state, and 2. I despised my mom, she is such a frustrating person to deal with, she is the type of person to yell if you fuck up even once she loves to micromanage. Anyway I moved I left finally, but during my senior year I started to get depressed I just felt incomplete I began to see a therapist, later that year I told my therapist that I had suicidal thoughts. I did have those thoughts, they still pop in sometimes but they aren't as bad as back then. So the therapist called my mom, my aunt, and told them what I told my therapist (which I understood as to why because of what the therapist tells you before you start your first session) I was sent to a psych ward. I spent two weeks and 3 days in there. After the stay there I was picked up by my aunt and then my mom picked me up. She was not happy with me, she was angry that I racked up a large bill, and she didn't believe that I was actually suicidal or depressed. She told me she was depressed and so she knew I wasn't (I am depressed.. And I was suicidal) (I already knew she was depressed) So I stayed with her at her apartment (she sold her house) she had no job since she got married and hadn't gotten one during the process of divorce or after the divorce. It's been a year that she has had no income (used to get it from ex step-dad) the next thing she did was buy a few acres of land in Texas

34,I (18F)was friends with a girl (21F) and we hung out a lot and became better friends than the girl she was already best friends with. I gave her a loan for rent and she promised to pay me back. During this time she was dating a fucboy and he of course fucked her for a few months and left. She was in love and so broken over it. After I helped her what I thought was getting over it she moved home and a month later came to visit and slept with him again. Then she went to Louisiana and said she was still going to pay me back. She lied to me about not having a job still and her other friend that was her best friend told me. Then a week after that happened the fucboy kissed me and I told my boyfriend and there was a whole ordeal but I was still hurt about her lieing to me. So I told her other friend what happened between me and the fucboy and the girl did a lot of drugs and asked me if we fucked and I told her no twice but she kept asking and finally I decided I was done with the whole situation and said yes. My other best friend was around and she heard me and thought I fucked the fucboy. So then I had 2 girls asking me details and I made up a whole story. The friend of the original girl tells the original girl I fucked her ex. It blows up and she occasionally texts me it’s not over still. I am haunted by doing this every night and it’s been almost 3 years since it happened. I am still with the same guy from earlier in the story but I think I dug my own grave. He wants to invite her over and talk things over but I’m afraid it’s going to start a whole new shit show that I can’t handle. I literally stay awake at night because I know what I did was wrong and I wish I could apologize but she would blow it up and I could loose my bf of 3 years. She introduced me to him and I love him and I don’t want things to blow up. But I don’t know what to do. I want to be friends again with this girl but I’m not sure if I should make amends or just drop it and feel guilty for the rest of eternity.

35,"I'm in high school and was on track to graduate this year (2 years early) and due to overcrowding and my ""lack of attendance"" ~60% they were pulling me from classes and putting me in online classes. 

After I attempted to access my online courses it couldn't so I went to my vice pricipal to see why. He told me he forgot to register me and now it's too late to register, so I effectively had 0 classes that semester. 

The school never contacted my parents about what happened so they think I'm still doing online classes. since I was gonna graduate super early anyways it didn't seem like a important thing to tell them, I just told them I was short a few credits and needed to take a throwaway class next year (in reality I need 2 core classes and 3 throwaway).

I'm worried now that if the school ever does decide to contact my parents (even though I doubt they will), they'll find out I've done jack shit for 3 months. But then again I don't think me telling them would make that exchange any better.",29May2019,3
36,"So I went out with friends a couple nights ago and I spoke to a neighbour of mine who I haven't previously talked to (but I did know of her existence and so did she about mine). I was pretty boozed up already but we had a good conversation and I felt a connection. So I can't remember how the conversation ended but the next day I thought to myself that if she wouldn't follow me on IG (I know, weird way to determine if someone is in to you but we talked about IG a bit) in the next week she doesn't like me. So a few days later at 2am, she followed me and I thought ""Oh shit that's cool"". But the catch is that she also followed my sister around the same timeframe, us being neighbours and all that. So there are two possible reasons for her following me AND my sister. She just followed us both because we are her neighbours and she talked to me now (and I did mention my sister as well) or she likes me and looked on my page and saw my sister (who she has actually already talked to before) and decided to follow her as well. The timing of the follow was quite suspicious as well. 2am is pretty late and she could've been with friends who pressured her in to following me or whatever. I know this is quite silly and that I'm overthinking it but I don't want to make a fool out of myself and I don't know the correct way to further handle this situation.

37,"Reddit, I need your help.

I've been in some serious conflict with a former friend of mine for quite some time. In the past he has wronged me, hurt me, manipulated me, and created emotional scars that I'm sure will be with me for a long time. The pain he caused has been monumental. I eventually cut him out of my life and said I need to move on. I tried to just block him out by ignoring he exists to move on, but our lives overlap too much with mutual friends, social media, and working at the same company and on the same floor that he keeps popping up. And every time he does, I'm reminded of everything he did to me, and the hate, resentment, and anger take control of me. I've decided the ""blocking out"" strategy won't work. This emotional state is not sustainable for me. It's been months and I'm sitting in an unhealthy amount of hate and resentment.

&amp;#x200B;

Until this point, I have been against trying to ""move on"" or ""forgive"", as I believed this let him off the hook for what he did to me. I felt like it let him get away with it and live free of guilt or shame for the wrongs he caused.

Then I found this site: [Definition](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/forgiveness/definition)

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm beginning to come to terms that forgiveness isn't necessarily excusing or condoning him, and doesn't even mean I need to reconcile with him. But it leaves me with 2 questions:

1. What do I do with all my hate, resentment, and scars for what he did to me? How do I just make a conscious decision to release it all? I hurt and I'm angry and I don't know what to actually do to release those feelings.
2. This still doesn't explain him getting off free of guilt and shame for him doing what he did. Why does he get to hurt me like this and ""win"" by just living on merrily? He knows how I feel and says he's sorry but doesn't have to go through the pain I have been. Being angry has at least let me direct negativity to him when I see him and his happy life. To be honest, even if I do forgive, I still feel like he's winning and ultimately getting his way. I feel like the only way I'll feel better is if he suffers or feels a shred of the pain he's caused me to feel, as bad as that sounds. Most of the time in my life, people react hurtfully back when they're wronged and I feel like that's what needs to happen to him.

I was not getting the attention I wanted from women sexually, and I had been curious about guys (I identify as straight, with curious tendencies) and decided to start posting nude selfies and sexual things online. I deleted them after a bit but a few got on to other site. I have been able to delete most of the pictures of myself and hope to get the rest deleted ASAP, since I have found a few more.

full name, but I hate myself for what I did and worry every day they could ruin my career. They are hard to find unless you know the usernames I posted under and I am going to try and get them removed from as many of the sites as I can.

For context Tom is overweight and has had depression for most of his years and he has been addicted to weed since he was 15. I have nothing against weed, I love getting blazed but he is at the point now where he NEEDS it to sleep and function. Being high is his new ""normal"". He has spent almost as much time high as he has sober in his whole life.

Tom had a shit mate Rex who had this younger girlfriend let’s call her Julie she was 17 when the rest of us were 25. They were both scummy people addicted to meth abusing my friend’s kindness couch surfing at his place. I never liked Rex and Julie but who am I to tell Tom who he can and cannot be friends with so I always kept my mouth shut and tolerated them. Tom has been unable to hold a job and has been living off government payments and his parents burning it all on video games, weed and smokes. His parents got fed up and told him to kick Julie out. Tom wouldn’t so he was forced to move out into an apartment with Rex and Julie.

I let life get in the way and for around 8-12 months, I didn't see or contact him and he didn't contact me either. We have the sort of relationship that after reuniting from not seeing each other for some time it’s like not a single day has passed so it didn't bother me until this happened.

I got a call from one of our mutual buddies and he told me that he was just at the police station with Tom because he attempted to take his own life. Tom didn’t want me to find out so I called him and acted like nothing had happened and we planned to meetup the next day. I meet with him and he is severely malnourished. He had lost over 70kgs I almost didn’t recognize him. He got into a fight with Rex and Julie. The apartment is trashed, things got physical between him and Rex. Rex went out of his life but Julie is still around. A few months go by and he confesses he has fallen in love with Julie and they are dating. Our friend group tell him Julie is just using him for a place to stay and for drug money. The next 2 years is just an off and on cycle of him cutting her out of his life getting depressed and going back to her. His mental state has declined so much and recently he was diagnosed with bipolar and would randomly call me up crying and I would have to speak with him for hours to calm him down and make him in a better mind state. 

6 months ago he cut her out for good, got a good job and has been consistent in saving money and working towards a future. But again we go distant as life got busy and I thought nothing of it. I got a text from a friend showing a Facebook screenshot of Julie and Tom in a relationship again. I texted Tom that I am done with him, I can’t support his destructive decisions anymore and wait around to see you get hurt especially when you said yourself she is bad news but you always keep going back to her. I have always been there for him to support him and drop everything but I feel as if it is beginning to affect my mental health as well now. But the other side of me feels like I am a shit friend for jumping ship. 
I feel powerless, I have tried to get him to quit weed or at least have less of it but he doesn't think threes a point to it. I have tried to get him to meditate, workout, eat healthier and so many more but he is so stuck in his ways. I don't know what to do anymore as I don't really have any other friends in my life.

I don't know what to do about it and summer starts soon so I might have time to play but shell probrobly kick me out to go to the pool.


I've tried showing her articlea avout how its not bad for you but (""IM THE PARENT"" so) it never works.


I dont know what to do about it because she's just being stupid and to be honest, she spends kore time on screens then i do (for her job) but when she has free time at home she watches hockey or whatever.


Any advice would be great.

56,"I always write when I'm truly rattled up. I dont know why know I just dont know what else to do. 

My little brother has threatened suicide on other occassions and we've always taken him seriously. Thanks to his froends speaking up when he talks about it, nothing has happened before.

Today I got a call at work that he was alone at home but his x girlfriend sent a msg saying she supected something was wrong.

I honest to god drove well over 100 mph today racing home bc my mom was far away and he was home alone.

I got home to my neighbor on my couch (my mom asked him to check on my brother while i came home) and it all seemed normal. I went upstairs and saw he was sleeping so i left him alone.

Over the next few hours i decided to work in silence to build his new PC i had built him and wanted to surprise him nxt week when my mom got home and went to check on my brother herself. 

Then I hear her scream. I instantly dropped everything and sprinted across the house to find my mom crying over my brother trying to wake him up. I then sprint back around to grab my phone &amp; called 911. I was close to damn hyperventilating but my first words was my address and something like ""my brother over dosed""

I knew he likely took some drugs as thatd be gis choice and i immediately went in a weird mode where i began locking up the dogs, opening the doors, shofeled in all the people who arrived, and ripped through all my brothers shit to see what he took. 

I couldnt find anything and i wpuld know either bc i dont do drugs myself. I just know he has access to it and uses when he's upset but i dont even know what he takes. I thought pot was his extent.

The relief  felt when i saw my little brother start freaking out was immense. My other brother is a paramedic and i know from him that A.) He's not dead and B.) He bagan showing classic OD signs.

I dont even know how to describe how happy i was he was moving but how horribly hurt i was at the same time. This is my little brother.. i was building his b day present when he tried killing himself and i sat around not knowing.

I calmly helped everyone, searched everything, and got to the hospital eventually to find out i cant go back and see him. As im sitting outside i keep thinking ""i have to say something. I can help him.""

But i keep realizing i cant do shit. I cant help him at all. I have to trust my brothers fate to professionals tonight and for possible years to come. I dont know what i can do for him or what to say. Its finally hitting me as i sit outside im a shit brother who only a bit ago thought his brother was dead. Im a grown ass man and i just want to cry. 

I just love my little brpther so much. Hes young and fucking stupid. Hes so damn smart and has so much to live for. Even now, with the worst case scenario on mind, i want to live. I love living, i love waking up and i just dont know how to share that with him. I want him to be happy. I want to always know he'll be okay. I'm just confused and hurt right now",29May2019,8

58,"I [F18] recently realised i'm in love with my best friend [M21]. We've been friends for years and he has always been by my side. I was in a 2 year relationship that i started to try and forget about him. A week ago i ended the relationship with his help, he drove out of town just to make sure I was ok. Since then, we started being inseparable again, we go out every night with friends and have lots of fun. I want to know if he loves me back (he has confessed his feelings towards me but it was years ago and I didn't do anything just so we don't ruin our friendship). He always tries to be around me, hugs me all the time, last night he took my hand and held it, even before i started my relationship, we've spent hours being in each others' arms talking, watching the stars, etc. He remembers every little thing about me and my life, he always watches over me, protects me, even gets a little jealous when his friends try to talk to me and so on. Are these signs that he loves me? 2 days ago I got the courage to apologize to him because while i was with my boyfriend, i always tried to find excuses to not see my best friend, we talked and talked and in the end he asked me ""Is there anything else you need to tell me?"" I'm still not sure what he meant by that, did he hope I'm going to tell him that i love him?

61," This all started back in December 2017; I had just gotten my first job, and after hours of labor, I had received my very first check. Many were to come after, but there's nothing like the very first. It was in a way, a reflection of what society conjured to be manhood: Independence, dignity, and work.

 I have always prided myself as being interested in science and for the most part that largely stemmed from the stereotype that fit me ever so well. I had always - and up until my writing of this post - enjoyed being at the upper echelon of high school academia( Top 2% of my class to be exact). I enjoy science, reading, learning, but most of all, I'm curious.

 With my very first check, I purchased Neil Degrasse Tysons *Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.* I waited for anticipation for my book to arrive, and when I got the notification at work that it had arrived, I was ready to get home and read it before bed. As soon as I enter the door, my parents call me into their room. Upon doing so, I see my package opened, but I don't see my book. When I inquired as to where it might be, the conversation went something like this:  


""This astrology crap is not welcome in this household. It is of Satan.""

""I ripped up the book.""

I do remember precisely however saying, ""That's very primitive of you. It's my money, I'll spend it how I want.""

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't know by now, I live in the heart of the bible belt, but I digress. At that moment, I hadn't been an atheist yet. I was inching towards it, but hadn't reached the resolve yet. Believe it or not, you don't go from being very religious, to an atheist overnight - it just doesn't happen. At this point, I was thinking that there was no way for us to know God's true will, or if he has one, because the Catholics misconstrued gods word, and everyone else just ran with it.

 After that one incident with my parents, they had been watching me like a hawk - all trust went out the window. My every action was met with the upmost suspicious. ""Where are you going? Who are you going with? When will you be back?"" It was very annoying. One of my friends had introduced me to Rick and Morty, and I fell in love. The sci-fi, dark-comedy, satire was perfect for me. Over the summer I had binge-watched the entire series, but on one specific day, I was watching what I recall as some sort of 'Rick Sanchez compilation' where Rick unloads an expletive in reference to god. My dad then burst into my room asking what I was watching. It was almost as if he was listening against the door. After this incident, my parents started checking my phone regularly, so I always made it a habit to clear anything suspicious, and to do it regularly. 

 Fast forward. I started watching a YouTuber by the name of 'DarkMatter2525'. Through his use of logic, interesting perspectives, and implementation of bible verses - ironically - I had become an Atheist. But one day, she decided to go through my phone, as I looked over her shoulders. She went through EVERY SINGLE APP, but I didn't sweat - there was nothing to be found. But then she opened YouTube, and to myself, I thought: ""Please YouTube algorithm, don't recommend any darkmatter videos."" Lo and behold, as she scrolled down, there was the video ""....but intelligent people believed in god."" This where things really took a negative turn. My parents took my car, made me quit my job, and took my phone(got my phone back). I actually lost my mind. I went on a long tirade, and it ended with me saying. ""I am an Atheist."" 

&amp;#x200B;

 Next Sunday at church, the Pastor called me up in front of the ENTIRE congregation to pray for me. I imagine my mother was ALL OVER THIS. So, I just walked out of the church and to the car. On the car ride home, I boasted how independent I was being with the money I had saved up from my former job, after we got into a heated argument. I was paying for my food, groceries, and pretty much all my basic needs. That was dumb on my part because, they started taking MONEY OUT OF MY FUCKING ACCOUNT. I was livid, but there was nothing I could do. What got to me was the spitefulness. But I recalled at my job, that people used to use the Cash App cards, so ordered a CashCard, and withdrew what was left in my account and put it in my CashApp.

&amp;#x200B;

I later had another confrontation with my mother, and simply refused to apologize for having a different set of beliefs. I respected my parents' beliefs, and I would have kept this all to myself, but they went looking for trouble, and they found it. On the last day of school, I returned home from my Debate Team dinner, and the door was fucking locked, and my key was not working - they changed the locks. I banged on every window for about an hour(except my little sisters, as I didn't want to scare her). After some time, I figured my parents are sleep I call the house phone seeing as one was located in the living room, and the other in my sisters room. I had hoped my sister would see my name on the caller I.D and answer. Luckily she did, and she let me in, but, she told me she wasn't supposed to. Was I being kicked up? At this point, I'm thinking: eff this. It's summer, and I'm not going to be somewhere I'm not wanted. At this point I didn't care if what they were doing was illegal; I didn't care for my bright future, I didn't care, I just had to get away. So I gather what I can, and hug my sister goodbye. The saddest part being she told me she'd hide me in her room. But now here I am: in a Starbucks with a back-pack, my laptop, my phone(Why haven't they cut it off yet?), two pair of clothes, some cash, and a Cash-App card with $79.85. It's the beginning of summer, I turn 18 in two months, and I just need advice. I'll try my best to provide updates, but any replies might be from a phone.",29May2019,83

63,"Hey guys,  


Me and this girl have been seeing each other for a little over a month,  I've taken her out, had her over, the whole nine-yards a few times over.  Recently, she's been pretty hard to get in touch with.  I'd call and she wouldn't pick up or call me back, and she doesn't respond to messages (something she told me at the start).  


My phone stopped working the other day, so I messaged her through facebook to let her know I wouldn't be able to respond to her.  She messaged back and said something along the lines of ""oh, I thought you were done with me.""  


Since then I've tried to set up a date through facebook with her, she leaves my messages unread despite being on facebook. When she does respond, she doesn't really give me anything to work with.  Like she won't suggest a time or day that works better, she'll just say ""I can't do that then, I'm doing X"", and then I have to wait another day for her to respond to my next suggestion.  I've gone so far as to ask her ""do you want to keep doing things"" and ""what day would work for you"" and neither have gotten a clear answer.  


I'm kind of running on the assumption that she's done with me, like she'll respond to me, but isn't really showing any desire to hang out.  As such I've set up a couple dates for this week with other women.  Is this too bold a move? should I wait things out?  What do you think?",29May2019,1

*Also, I posted a version of  this under a different subreddit, but I don't think it was under the right one, so it has been deleted. If you know of a subreddit that would be better for something like this, please let me know.*

 I'm a 17 year old cheerleader for a relatively small organization. In the past, we have had a system of the oldest and most-experienced girls becoming ""captains"", who are in charge of warm-ups, stretches, choreographing JV and Varsity dances, and all of the other things that typical captains are put in charge of. We're like big sisters. I have been made a captain after being a co-captain last year and I have been cheering for 3 years. We have a new coach since our old one retired after 5 years. She is just the parent of a girl who came in last year late. She has done many questionable things. She has said she hates the ""old system"" of the way we did things, even though she has only been here for about 7 months. Sorry it's so long, but here they are: 

1. She told me the second time I ever met her that she hated one of the girls because of her outgoing personality. This girl is 15 and has a lot of energy, but this 40 year old woman was just gossiping about her to me as if I was suddenly her best friend. I have been like an older sister to the 15 year old for a year now, so I obviously didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say I was so surprised.
2.  After a meeting led by the assistant coach, after the assistant coach had left, she told everyone to leave a room so that we would be alone and proceeded to ask me why I hated her 7 times. I obviously told her I didn't every single one of those 7 times, considering that I had only just met her two weeks ago, and she got mad at me, telling me that she would rather I had just told her I hated her rather than telling her the truth. She began insulting me and saying she had asked people I knew why I was such an awful person, saying she's taken notes every single time I've been a ""rude child"" to her. Basically yelling, she put her head on the table just making noises for a few seconds. She continued to insult me, calling me names and things that shouldn't be said to anyone and I had to leave because I was crying so hard. I'm 17 years old, so being put down like this and having that kind of reaction was very embarrassing, especially in a public place. I had to take the 15 year old home and the whole time I was sobbing. It was completely humiliating.
3. She has said in the past that I would be able to do everything captains do, which are the things I listed above, but then said I couldn't after the whole ""you hate me"" thing. I think it was revenge for me telling higher-ups what she had done, as it was explicitly, completely wrong in every situation. She said she did it because it says in the Bible to confront someone when you have an issue with them. Before this, we had had no issue, so I asked her why she thought I hated her. She could give me no physical evidence, just saying that I had a ""bad vibe"". I decided to have a meeting with her about what she had said previously and she insisted that adults be present because it would be inappropriate otherwise. Ironic much? At this meeting, I told a member of the board everything that she had done to me. She had apparently made friends with this guy as they had gone out before this meeting to discuss me. I am quiet and follow rules; I have never had an issue with basically any type of authority that I can think of. I told them of the taking notes thing and of the ""bad vibe"" thing as well, and she denied it all, telling them I was lying. Again, I'm 17 years old, not 5. I have no clue why a whole group of adults refuse to see the situation for what it is. 
4. AKA the aftermath: a girl my age who doesn't cheer for us has now been put in charge. My coach is entirely toxic and the assistant coach has already quit because she can't stand her. I have gone to the board about it and she had already talked to them, saying everything I was telling them about her was a lie. There is a ""daycamp"" next week in which this girl my age will be teaching a dance to us all. It will be the Varsity dance that I was told I could choreograph months ago (AT A 5 HOUR LONG MEETING). It's humiliating and childish that I have to attend a daycamp to be taught a Varsity dance for my own Varsity team by someone my age with hardly more experience than I have (she's a senior, I'm a junior as of 2018-19). I don't want to quit. The girls like me as captain and I love my team, but it's humiliating. I can't run warmups because it might be ""dangerous"" to have someone not certified telling a girl to touch her toes. I can't even choose uniforms, bows, poms, bags, shoes, etc.; ""It's already been taken care of"". 

More than this has happened, but if I continued to type it all out, it would get A LOT longer, believe it or not. Keep in mind, this all stared in DECEMBER of last year. Our season starts in LATE JULY and this is already how much control has been taken away from me. It feels like I'm the ""victim"" of a power-hungry person who has nowhere else to put their time. I have deep respect for people in leadership places, but this is a no for me. Please, if anyone has any bit of advice/a suggestion to offer me, let me know. I've tried everything and I would love to get some help. If you've had a similar experience, feel free to share. Besides quitting, what should I do?????????",29May2019,1

78,"Sorry, this part is going to be long. Let me start by saying that our father has not been kind to us. My sister used to be a chubby kid in like elementary school but who wasn’t totally different back then right? He used to tell her that she’s fat and a slob and she needs to lose weight etc, nothing you should tell a ten year old. Since then, she’s been exercising, eating healthy, going on diets, whatever, and lost all the baby fat. She was also bullied in middle school about it but told that bully off at the end of the year. However she still cries sometimes that she’s fat and ugly and she really truly isn’t. I told her that i’m an inch shorter and ten more pounds than her so what does she think i am if she’s “fat”, hoping to point out her flawed logic and she said “normal”.

I’m dealing with crippling depression. I cannot hold a job because I feel so much despair, so much anger, so much hatred, for being alive. 

I’m so uninterested in the way life works. We are born. We go to school. We build a career. We work. We die.


Even typing this is bringing me to tears. I don’t know what to do anymore. And it’s a shame because I started a new job recently and, like usual, I was the best worker there, even got complimented so much by strangers and I just moved to the area I’m in (with family).

My cousin and I are getting ready to move; our living conditions right now are just awful and we need to get out.
I don’t have a job right now, and won’t be able to get one until I move out, and she earns about 1200 a month at her job. I am planning on getting a job right after we move, so that will turn out to be twice what we make right now. The question is, is it possible to begin renting an apartment if we don’t make 3x the rent at the time we sign? Will we qualify for income-restricted housing? Will we be able to rent if I have all the saving actually in my savings account?

1. rabbit corpse with no head left on the side of our driveway in january. we live in the suburbs, but there is a patch of woods not too far from us so i just assumed that a fox or coyote had left it there. my mom was freaked out though. 

2. christmas lights outlining our garage were cut at the plug. didnt seem like an animal had chewed on them, as the cut was perfectly clean, like with scissors. i told my mom to report it to the police as potential vandalism, but it seemed so silly so we never did. this was february. 

3. last saturday, my mom received a call on her cell asking for me. my mom replied that i was at work, and when the caller asked for my hours and workplace my mom answered because she thought it was one of my friends. the caller replied that she’d be at my work when i start, but i started two hours later that day and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. the number isn’t in my contacts. 

4. today, my mom had told me that a different female voice had called on her cellphone looking for me (by name). the caller was casual and sounded young, so again my mom assumed this was a friend of mine. my mom told her that i was at work, so the caller said she’ll call again before 10 on saturday. she said her name was sophia. the only sophias i know are acquaintances, no idea what to make of this. number shows up as unknown.",29May2019,0

I didn’t think that this was impacting my life so much anymore but recently I keep getting into a sexual relations with this one guy even though I never seem to enjoy them and always end up almost regretting it after. It has nothing to do with him forcing me to participate in it, I definitely participate willingly and I even will find myself asking him when we can meet up again. But then when we actually meet up I don’t enjoy it at all.

I was doing some deep thinking about why I do this to myself and the only answer I can seem to think of is that because I never got much attention or approval from my dad, I am desperate for male approval. But the only way for me to get the approval i’m so desperate for is through sex.

We did not end on good terms at all, but I let my friends who are also friends with Julia stay friends with her because I dont really care too much.
 

So one of my closest friends, lets call her Lily, starts dating Julia which doesn't bother me at all, as long as their my friend I am okay with it. It was an okay relationship, Lily always told me that Julia never texts her and that she feels sad about their relationship. Sometime in January another friend of mine told me Julia was cheating on Lily with him. I did not tell Lily immediately because I am not really the person to stick my nose into anyone's business. Then after a few days I decided if I were in Lily's shoes I'd want to know as well. So I told Lily and she broke up with Julia.

Side note: Julia had tried to fuck over my life by telling everyone I'm not a good person and to not be my friend. Julia had even told Lily she wanted to fight me and Lily said nothing to me. I found out through another friend because he didn't want us to fight each other, which I am still thankful he told me.

Fast foward to about a few days ago. Julia contacted Lily and asked to talk to her, which they talked over the phone. Lily and I did not like Julia at all and wanted nothing to do with her. When she told me that they are friends again I kind of shut down. I wasn't mad that they are friends, but the fact she became friends with Julia so easily after the way she treated me.

92,"I’m going to start high school after the summer. I have the option of still being homeschooled or going to public high school. I think I will settle with going to public HS but I’m so scared! I started homeschooling about 2 years ago. The last time I went to public school I suffered from anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. I’m no longer depressed but I’m suffering the after effects. 

My parents are very abusive (which doesn’t help). They are narcissists and have physically and mentally abused me. I am the appointed scapegoat of my family. I was also sexually abused (in my home but not by my parents.) This has led to me having very low self confidence. Part of me wants to report them to CPS, but I can’t. I don’t want to ruin my siblings lives. Also, the last time I was physically abused was 2 years ago. There’s not a lot of proof of it. 

Last time I was bullied and depressed, they let me stay home from school for months. This was very unhealthy for me and I became isolated and even worse. When I told my father I was suicidal and wanted to kill myself, he said “do it” 

I used to be such a fun, outgoing and loving person. I even got voted best personality by my school. 

My anxiety is absolutely through the roof. I haven’t been to public school in the longest time and have extreme fear concerning it. 

If I get bullied again in high school, they said they will not let me go back to being homeschooled or switch to another school. So now it’s either having to be miserable and isolated in homeschool or take the chance of being bullied. Idk what to do and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.

Henry has been best friends with Amber for almost 10 years. They went to high school not together but around the same time. Henry started college and got a house by the time Amber was finishing high school. They went to the same college together and due to roommate problems opted to live together since they knew each other for so long.

Henry already graduated before Amber and he's been helping her with classes, jobs and her vehicle until she graduated. Since then she's been through a few shitty boyfriends and Henry would just help her through them.
Henry knows Amber enough to know that as soon as another guy comes around there would be problems. He practically saw her as a sister until some feelings developed after a few years. Every time Amber gets a new boyfriend, she'll alienate Henry. (Self-fulfilling prophecy) so he'd hang out with other friends. Until she gets sick of her boyfriend and eventually comes back to hang out with him. Amber is a home body and shy, so she'll only wants to stay home, watch Netflix and can be hard to be around. (I met her through Henry.) Henry likes to go out and see people and do things so being her best friend, he'll ask Amber to come along. She would always complain but enjoy the experience but would turn around and use it as an excuse to hate him for taking her out the house.

Their relationship got rocky when Amber moved in with a boyfriend and force Henry to move back home. (they live in the same town).

Henry helped his parents take care of his grandmother with Alzheimer’s up til she died. Amber breaks up with her ex and moves back home too. She tries to apply for jobs but gives up once she gets any rejection. (I understand that. It took me almost 2 years to even get a decent job in my field) They still hang out and even moved back in together but it's obvious that she's depressed and starts to blame Henry for her problems.
Henry liked her for a while but knew she didn't see him more than that until she started showing signs that she liked him back. (even sleeping with each other) 

Everything seemed mutual for them until Henry met some new friends and introduced them to Amber. She starts to have feelings for Keith (one of the new friends) but lies to Henry when he asked her for the truth. He's used to keeping creeps off her when they go to bars so he wanted to her safe knowing her history. I must mention that Amber has slept with many of Henry’s friends and ruined their relationships with them. Not to be mean, but Amber has used Henry as a dick wrangler. His friendship circle has gotten smaller after meeting her.

Keith is younger than Amber by a few years so he’s more interested in just sex than anything else. So Keith and Amber hit it off, but didn’t bother to tell Henry anything. If Amber had told Henry about her and Keith he would have moved out and left her to do her thing.

The problem is Amber didn’t do that. Henry didn’t know about their affection for each other and just wanted to keep his friendship with the new people. Keith’s best friend eventually tells Henry that Keith was dating another girl and didn’t bother to tell Amber that she was the side piece. Henry tells Amber the truth (he’s her best friend and didn’t want her to get hurt again) so Amber freaked out and seemed to believe him. The next day, Henry went to work and was making plans with her to do something during the weekend until Amber stops talking to him. When Henry gets home, an argument happened.

Keith then eggs Amber on about kicking Henry out and it happens.

I must mention that Henry and Amber were telling people that they were in a relationship, to get rid of creeps. Once the argument started Amber says that she could use the lie that they were dating to get people she didn’t like to leave her alone but Henry couldn’t.

After that Henry leaves her alone and finds a new place. Knowing Amber enough to just give her what she wanted, which was to be away from Henry. The only problem is that Amber is trying to force ME (OP) to choose who I was going to hang out with. To be honest, if it wasn’t for Henry, Amber and I wouldn’t have anything to talk about other than watching Netflix or YouTube at her place. She doesn’t visit me and I go out of my way to meet her. I’m the only one that make plans to see her and I can’t invite Henry since he knows her enough to get her talking but without him there, we have nothing to say.

It’s been almost a year since the incident and Henry holds no ill will. Amber is openly dating Keith but continues to blame Henry for “taking her friend away.” All because I invited like 10 people including both Henry and Amber to an event which I know they want to go to. Yet Amber gave me an ultimatum, if Henry goes, she’s out. I’m getting tired of being in the middle of this. Henry is convincing me to stay her friend since I’m all she has left in her friend group other than her boyfriend and his best friend.

I need some help figuring out who’s the Asshole is this situation. It’s not getting any better, and someone is going to miss out on fun stuff because of a confusing situation. What should I do?

113,"At the moment, I have to live with my Grandma.  It's actually kind of interesting getting to know her, since she is a spunky and outspoken.  Growing up, my mom always felt she was slighting her, so I always thought of her as being mean.  And apparently she has grown a lot over the years.  I think she's only known work, and has not fully developed into herself.  She grew up on a farm, and her and her sisters always worked and had to work fast (She used to always rush things.  I think around me, she learned to slow down.)  Anyway, she has some quirky behavior, and I think if she had a family that valued education and were a bit more socially developed, that would have been good for her.  Anyway, it's just interesting to get to know her.  

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that really bothers me about her is that she always randomly calls me to tell me something or ask me to do something, and it can be kind of rude and random.  For example, she used to always ask me for water, or she would ask me to turn off her fan.  That was in the past when I lived with her over the summer a few years ago, and I'd have to walk from my room to the living room (or even her bedroom!).  Recently, just tonight, she asked me within 30 minutes to turn on her oxygen, and then I went to lay back down and about 10-15 minutes, she called me to ask if I watch comedy central and tried to strike a conversation with me.  This is all at completely random times.  I feel like I am always getting up to do something.  I can recall her roommate, an older woman her age, annoyingly say, ""WHAT?"" when she yelled her name once.  My mom said when she was a kid, my grandma always asked her to get things for her and would forget to tell her things, so every few minutes or so she would ask her again to get something.  Now that I think about it, and am getting to know her, maybe she felt she would be annoying and ask TOO MUCH to get her everything as once.  Anyway, it still is annoying.  I don't mind helping her, but how can I get to understand that she has stop randomly calling me for things?

&amp;#x200B;

Come to think of it, the other thing that gets on my nerves is she turns the TV up really loud or talks really loud (right now she is laughing loudly in her room).  It's like I can't ever focus.  So any advice on how to ask her to turn it down would be nice.  I usually turn the TV down for her when she leaves the room for 20-30 minutes at a time.  I know it sounds like she has dementia, but she doesn't.  I think she sort just has been deprived of attention or something, and it showing in older age.  It's actually quite funny when I think of it, even as I write this now!  

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, sometimes she'll ask me to do bigger things, like mow the lawn or help in her back porch, and I don't mind helping her, but not just randomly, out of the blue, when I am doing something.  So, I solved that problem by saying, ""Let me look at my calendar and I will pencil it in.""  She gets the hint, thankfully.  

&amp;#x200B;

The good thing about her, it seems, is that she will respect you once you say something, but I don't want to seem too pushy.  It's like she's not quite getting it.  But, I would just like to be able to read or do something for hours at a time without being interrupted.",29May2019,1
114,"I'll start by saying that I'm not outgoing in the least. I actively shy away from invites to hangout by classmates and work friends, and even among my core group of friends I'm still ""the quiet one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why, like many others in my situation, I turned to online communities because it was a place where my social skills were not what gave other their first impression of me. Whether it be games, running a meme page, no-lifing on reddit, I enjoyed interacting with others on the internet because it was a place where I could easily show my love for games, my gross sense of humor and whatnot, and I would find an awesome community/group of people that would share my interests and passion. I made many more friends (quality friends) online than I did in real life. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I met a girl on Minecraft. She was scary good. I guess I wasn't so bad myself, as we immediately starting taunting each other and having a good little bit of banter. We added each other and started playing everyday. Days turned into weeks, which turned into months, and a very nice friendship was forged out of a block game (I know, cheesy as all heck, but hey if you can find a great friend while playing a game you really like, what do you care about it?) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, our friendship evolved to the point where we would ""hang out"" out of Minecraft. We went through a variety of messaging apps, going from Viber, to Google hangouts, to skype, to discord, to Line, and to Instagram. We would talk with each other everyday. Initially, it was small talk. Stuff about updates and new things in whatever games we were playing, how school was, that sort of thing. After a few months though, we both started talking on a deeper level. She talked about some difficult stuff going on in her life, her family, and her school. I was there for her all the way, giving her my perspective of whatever situation she was going through, comforting her when she was down, and generally establishing myself as a ""safe person""- someone who could be trusted and confided in. I knew that she was genuinely a good person, and didn't deserve a lot of the things that happened to her. Of course, she was also there for me when I needed the help. Our daily talks would see a wide range of emotions, and we often spent hours. HOURS. just talking about stuff, and it was the greatest. It got to the point where we were each other's best friend, even irl. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, our friendship hit the 3 year mark earlier this year. During this time, something changed, although I couldn't really explain *why.* It was my senior of high school, and I was hit with *something*, a wave of doubt about the future, a sudden drainage of self-confidence, a negative outlook on my grades and my shitty fast food job. Whatever it was, certain areas of my life took a noticeable hit. By the time February rolled around, I had missed close to 200 classes, I stopped talking (keep in mind I barely talked to anyone to start with), and my hygiene was, well, quite shit. I also started being more distant with my online friend. She knew something was wrong, but didn't press and instead reminded me that she would always be there as a listener if needed. Still, I was an asshole. I repeatedly told her I was fine, and yet I repeatedly ignored her messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, she got fed up with the cycle of her pouring her heart out for me, and me dismissing it and being a total dick. She (rightfully) told me that all she ever wanted was for me to be happy, and she tried her best to at least get me to communicate with her. She told me that she was really upset and disappointed because she thought we were going to be life-time friends, and that I was one of the most important people in her life. I (please give me the benefit of the doubt here) decided to ignore this and leave her on read (WHY BLANKCXNVAS WHY). At this point, she already had enough, we stopped talking. A few weeks of silence went by, and she deleted her social media accounts and removed me from her friend lists in the games we played (again, rightfully so). The only connection I have to her now is on discord, which I can only assume that she forgot about, or left for me if I ever wanted to do something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the really difficult part. This sort of thing happened before a few times, but we've always reconciled, and it never went beyond anything more than a few days of silence. This time, I knew I fucked it up, and about a month later I snapped out of whatever phase I was in. My attendance started going back to normal, my midterm was awesome, I got an awesome new job, and I was accepted into my first choice university. Still, something was missing amidst all this, and it was her. I've never connected to *anyone* like I did with her, and I knew that the way I acted earlier in the year was completely my fault, and I had to do something. Even if she didn't want to be my friend anymore, She still deserved an explanation for my actions at the very least. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings us to present day. It's been a few months since we last talked, and not a few hours go by without me thinking about her. I don't know what I should say to her, but she still has me on discord. I really need to take the chance to at least give her an explanation but I just don't know what to say to a person I hurt so deeply. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Had a best friend online for 3 years, went through a phase and acted like a dick to her. She got really upset and left, and it's been a few months since and I don't know how I can make things right.

115,"Hey guys, I need some perspective on catfishing (i don’t even know if you’d consider this to be catfishing). So I have been going on websites such as omegle  and Chatrooms like that pretty recently— most of you who have done this  know that many times people will ask for something like your Snapchat or Kik. 

I made a fake account on kik with a fake name and everything, even with a fake picture. I’m not using it for anything illegal or deceitful, I just wanna converse more with random people anonymously. 

Now here’s the problem, I don’t actually know if this is a terrible thing to do to someone even though I’m not creating an emotional bond with people, I’m just having surface level conversations. Do you think its ok to keep doing this or is it morally wrong?? Thanks for all your help

Tl;dr I made a fake account to talk with random strangers, is it morally wrong?",29May2019,1
116,"Please can someone just give me some advice on what to do with my life. I need help, I need some guidance. I have no one in my life to help me and my life’s a mess. 

First off I’m mentally ill badly. Not really anyone here can help me with that, I’m shortly getting help and trying new medication and therapy. I hope I get better. Just thought I’d mention it though. 

Second i don’t trust any of my friends and I’ve lost a lot this year. Without seeming like a prick, I’m too good of a person and the people I’ve became friends with are pretty self centred and attention seeking at times. Also they’re fine with people cheating if they don’t know the person who got hurt and love to stir drama where possible. They don’t care who gets hurt really. They will also use people to get a foot up in friendship or attention or sex or anything and wont care. 

Every single one of them ive been close with and introduced them to each other or to a bigger group and then I’ve become less close with them in the long run. Obviously nothing I can do and that’s just life but obviously stings badly.  I’ve been the only person who’s basically been left behind in a sense, but I’m still broadly respected. Also I’m not saying I’m perfect but I’m not self centred and a couple people have said I’m just too nice innocent and caring etc. You have to be a bit of a prick and selfish otherwise you will get stomped over and feel like shit 24/7.  In the past week two of my friends have said these two things to me( is this normal?)

1: ( I introduced a friend to another friend who I’d known a few months and was pretty close with. They’ve known each other a couple months.  I said to them ‘how do you know them again?- implying I introduced them and they replied with (with us three there)’ Well I’ve taken over now and we’re now closer’

2:I introduced a close friend to other close friend and in general a big group and he said to me the other day ‘I feel like I’m closer with them than you now’ either implying he’s closer to the group than I am or he’s closer with the group then he is to me as a person. 

3: I introduced someone who had ZERO friends apart from me into a huge social group even after they used me for my money out of the kindness of my heart. Now they spend more time with all of those people who ended up fucking me over. The recurring theme is I get no respect and no one cares about making plans with me. 

Even if these statements are ‘true’ and there’s no such thing as it depends on circumstances, is that okay to say to a close friend who’ve you’ve known for close to a year. A friend who introduced you to a whole new group or person, who changed your whole social structure, who you thanked because you feel much happier now??. I’d never fucking disrespect someone like that even if the majority would say I’m closer with someone else who wasn’t my ‘original friend’. Fuck me ive been used but that’s life. You don’t say those things to a ‘friend’ 

I’m insulted and used because I’m too nice. That’s why I’ve isolated myself from people. Because when I stick up for myself people think I’m salty or angry or creating drama. Nah I’m just saying what I prefer and that I don’t want to be used anymore. Fuck me life sucks. 

Lastly, can anyone help me from transforming from skinny to muscular and big?? I have no fucking clue where to start. Can i do it from home and equipment I can purchase online? I don’t want to be fucking disrespected anymore and want to get big and learn how to defend myself or win 95% of fights against a random person. I want to get strong and take my anger out on something that will help my health and confidence. Any advice for this? I have money if that helps. 

I wanna take my anger on all this shit out on something like personal training sessions or boxing. I feel like I have built up aggression and a lot of potential even though I’m a ‘nice person’. I used to be quite sporty and pretty damn good. I want to progress and get stronger and maybe even box against people I don’t know and get the shit beaten out of me and eventually beat the shit out of the majority. Is this possible in a few months? I’m willing to do whatever it takes.",29May2019,2
117,"Hello Reddit, this is the second time my friend has contacted me about their parents abusing them. My friend has a history of self harm and depression and has gotten aid from the school in the past but it never turns out better than how it started. Their parents seem to single my friend out as the ""bad child"" and act as if all the other children are angels. My friend has told me multiple stories of getting bricks thrown at them, getting pushed down the stairs, and lots of verbal abuse (""why can't you be better"" ""why can't you be like the other children""). Most recently the mom saw a cut on my my friend's arm and proceeded to pull on it causing it to rip open and then didn't want to get them any help.

I, obviously, want to go to the school and let them know what going on but my friend doesn't want me to. Both because it hasn't done much in the past for them and also somehow after all the abuse worries of the finical burdens their family would go through because of their lack of health care. My friend also thinks the school wont trust their word and will trust their parents word instead. I have also offered many times to come in with my friend to tell the school but they wont do it. I am very afraid of what might happen if I don't do something soon. I fear the worst.",29May2019,2
118,"Last week, I was in the waiting room of my therapists office. She walked in without seeing me because I was sort of around the corner and I overheard her talking to a colleague about a patient who has been coming for a year and a half, never has anything to talk about, and went off insurance recently. I freaked out in a panic because all those things describe me. I’ve been feeling like I’ve been pretty steady for months now and I’ve been dreading therapy every week because I don’t have much to process at the moment and also all the insurance info and timing applied to me. I guess I got scared that I’d hear her say she was so tired of hearing me talk or something like that so I bolted. The thing is, I texted her later in the day telling her the truth. That I heard what sounded like the start of a conversation about me and I felt uncomfortable so I decided to leave. She responded with an apology saying she was discussing another patient who has been paying out of pocket and she’s trying to suggest moving her to a biweekly appointment. She said she sometimes mentions these situations to her partner to get advice and she’s so sorry that I didn’t stay to address it with her in person. She also said if she ever felt like I should be cutting back sessions for me she’d talk to me directly first. 


I’m thinking...well ok I guess? I still don’t know what to say about the fact that I was in earshot during her conversation about someone else. I don’t have problems with paranoia, but now I feel silly and I really just don’t want to see her again. Like I said, Ive been wanting to stop my weekly sessions anyway. I never replied to her text mostly because the text cut off and I never got the second half. Should I go to my Thursday appointment and talk to her about leaving?

My friend is 20 years old, and she's been working as a manager in a place owned by her boss. Recently, she started hanging out with her boss, who is 40, single and very successful. Big money kind of guy.

Now this is why I need advice. She came to me with this. She trusts me more than anyone with this secret. Nobody else knows. I got mad, and dissapointed in her, because this is EXTREMELY out of character for her. She is very attractive but barely hooks up with anyone, let alone proceed in a relationship, and yet she hooked up and almost had sex with this guy within ~14 days after hanging out with him a couple of times.

She gave me the gist of it. Short version is the talked a few times and she started liking him, then he took her with him to show her his boat (and other things, like I said, big money kind of guy) and the next thing you know they hooked up.

Now she's not a person that does this. She doesn't normally like older men, or sexual activity yet she progressed extremely fast with this guy. This is so out of character for her. In all my years knowing her she never acted like this.

She told me she likes that he has ""power"" even though I believe she meant money, and we argued over this. She was saying that she liked other things too, like his character, but I refuted this by saying she had every opportunity with other guys her age and that she shouldn't sugarcoat the fact that she likes that this guy has money (her ex and some other guy she liked also had money)

Now she's telling me that she might be in love with this guy, and that they made plans about going on a cruise together with his boat and even moving in together.

I told her this is all a very bad idea in my oppinion but if that's what made her happy, I'd try and support her.

P.S - I am dissapointed in her and I told her. When she mentioned this to me she said she knows I would be dissapointed and that she needed to hear what I had to say because nobody else would lay it on her like me, because I am very honest.",29May2019,1

126,"DISCLAIMER: This will be very long, but I'm super desperate for some advice. Sorry about the dramatic title... but it sounds cool so I'm leaving it.   


So I had this girlfriend 3 years ago (we broke up about 2 1/2 yrs ago). She was my first girlfriend, and to be totally honest, the love of my life. When I met her, I seriously had that cliche moment where it seemed time stood still and heaven's light fell upon this girl. I was absolutely starstruck with her, and she felt the same way. It got to a point where we considered ourselves soulmates, like a match made by God. We were never apart; Went everywhere together and helped each other through absolutely everything. Sure, we had our fair share of fights, but neither of us ever stayed mad longer than an hour or two for the most part. But EXTREMELY long story short: After I left for college (she didn't want me to go because I was going to a school 7-8 hours and 2 states away), things just didn't work. I did my best to see her 1-2 weekends per month, but it barely helped because neither of us could stand being apart at all considering we had spent the past 6 months together and physically there for each other almost every single day (and we were banging a couple times a day too haha). She changed, and I mean she became a totally different person. She had a bad attitude, was ignoring me, hanging out with really bad people behind my back, went to a school dance with another guy behind my back, all that good stuff. Eventually, she dumped me over text after a couple rather... shitty and explosive... days. Right before I was gonna move back home because I quit wrestling (on a small D3 ""scholorship"" that was the reason I went to the school to begin with) to transfer to a local community college near home so I could go to school and still be with her. The life I would've led forced me to choose between college wrestling and her. I picked her because I wanted to be with her for the rest of my life- more than anything.  


I was so unbelievably depressed- and still am- with everything that had happened. I secretly tried to kill myself by swallowing large amounts of migraine pills (downed a whole bottle once). Probably didn't help that at the same time all this was happening, my alcoholic mother helped my discover my abusive father was cheating on her- with other men- and I saw some photos that scarred me for life. She led me on and was off and on about getting back together for a couple months post breakup, then eventually after enough other bad things continued to happen with us, she eventually just cut off all communication with me and we haven't talked or seen each other (other than from a distance in passing). I have a new girlfriend now, been with her 2 months shy of 2 years. She's got some serious mood swing issues, doesn't listen to anybody, that sort of stuff- but she's still a really kind, sweet girl with her eyes seemingly set on a future with me, and her family is all really great people (my ex's family was not like this). I'm definitely better than I was post breakup, but I still haven't learned to be happy. Another very long story short, I know she hasn't been happy since we were together because that's what she told my current girlfriend when they got drunk at a college party (despite that my ex has dated and slept with MANY people since I was with her).   


But, anyway, the point is that despite the time away from her, how I've been working out and getting stronger than ever, how I've started a job in my dream career, how terrible of a person my ex has become, how I have a new girlfriend now, I just can't shake it. The things that happened haunt me in dreams, I can't sleep well at night (haven't had a good night's rest since before my ex left me 2 1/2 years ago), I can't seem to be happy or even really feel any positive emotions, my girlfriend get upset because I apparently show no emotion whatsoever (she says my lack of emotion and robotic-ness is intimidating to her and other people). I should be moved on and happily living life, but I'm not, no matter what I try.   


So, that all said, anybody got any advice for me?",29May2019,2

He hangs out with the classic people, you know, the hoes and the fuckboys and maintains a solid 3.25 GPA, what you would expect. But his parents are recently divorced, and he and his half brother live with his mom, who is constantly switching from abusive boyfriend to alcoholic boyfriend to junkie boyfriend and back again, and it’s really stressing him out.
On our bus, there’s somewhat of a hierarchy, with the middle schoolers and loner kids sitting randomly near the front and middle, and in the back is the big group, me, Imogen, Kaden, and some of our other friends sit there. A healthy mix of jocks, hoes, fuckboys, emos, artsy kids, and geeks all sharing food and smoking cigarettes and pot and juuls and vaping and playing truth or dare or whatnot (pretty classic high/middle school bus group). Anyways, it is within one day that we all decided to trade Snaps and phone numbers. A few weeks later, Imogen announced to me and our friend Izabel that she had a crush on Kaden and that they had been snapping back and forth often.
She let us scroll through their messages, and he had admitted to liking her too. Izabel was absolutely disgusted with the whole things, saying that he’s a pedophile and that he’s manipulating her and shit. So, I dug around, talking to Kaden and his friends, and he really, sincerely liked her back.

Now Kaden is very experienced, had sex like thirty-ish times since he was 15, but Im’s a complete and total virgin. Kaden was to embarrassed to talk to me about it, but Im was very open. She said that they almost did it, but he said he couldn’t because he didn’t want to hurt her physically and push her mentally. Now, Im is very mature for her age, and personally I don’t think them having sex is that big of a deal. But what I’m asking is, how do I help them push past this and be able to comfortably and safely have sex? What do I tell her? Should I talk to him? Should I tell her it’s none of my business?

I really need advice about a situation at work. I'm not sure what to do. The situation has me frustrated and tilted today. So I pretty much described the entire situation trying to alleviate the stress from my mind. So, I have a TLDR at the beginning and the end in case you don't want to read my entire post.

 

**TLDR:**

I was given an Hackintosh at work that the owner didn't approve of. The owner does not know that he can face serious fines for running unlicensed, pirated software from their business computers.

**Should I tell my boss the consequences and fines they can face if they are found to be using unlicensed, pirated software from their business computers (in other words that they can possible face some serious fines for having a Hackintosh at work)?** Yes, the co-worker said he would install Windows 10 for me tonight, but there is still going to be a version of OS X running off the hard drive of that Hackintosh. And I'm pretty sure if my boss knows that he can face some hefty fines for using a Hackintosh at their place of business, that they would delete OS X from it very quickly. Right now, the boss does not know about the possible fines; and the co-worker has used company funds that my boss paid for so that the co-worker could build himself a Hackintosh toy himself. A PC that the co-worker will not work from daily for 8 hours a day. He works from a MacBook instead. And I've been given no choice but to work from a HP desktop that is running an unauthorized version of OS X.  
 

I was given a Hackintosh to work from today. My boss didn't approve of the Hackintosh. It is a co-worker's ""toy"" I've been given so that my co-worker can ""play around"" on a version of OS X that has better hardware than his current MacBook. 

&amp;#x200B;

My original work PC that I was using at work on died 2-4 weeks; so they temporarily gave me an even older PC so that I could continue doing my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get to work today to find that I have been given a used HP that my co-worker talked the owner into buying for less than $150 off of the internet.  My co-worker said that he had installed Windows on it, so I shutdown OS X so that I could boot into Windows 10 instead. But apparently my co-worker did something to the original hard drive and the original Windows installation. So the HP factory OEM version of Windows was nowhere to be found anymore. So, now there was only OS X running on this HP desktop sitting at my desk. There was no version of Windows running natively off of the HP hardware.

 

My coworker told me to log back in to OS X, because he installed a Virtual Machine inside of OS X, and then installed Windows 10 inside of the VM.

  

But, the Hackintosh and OS X was broken, and OS X would freeze at the start screen. Apparently, the Hackintosh OS X installation went wrong somewhere. He wasn't able to fix the Hackintosh, so he decided to take one of the hard drives out of the Hackintosh and put it back into the working PC that I was using just last week. He took apart a working PC and  stuck the hard drive inside the Hackintosh. When he tried to put the hard drive back into the original PC, the screen was just a blank, black screen whenever we turned it on. So now, he had broken my 2nd, original PC trying to build his Hackintosh. And on top of that, I lost all of my files that I had stored on my old PC. So, this is the 2nd time I have to start over without all my notes, files, and bookmarks that I needed just to do my job. The 1st time, the motherboard died on my PC. The 2nd time, it was because he decided to build a Hackintosh.

  

This is the point where my boss finds out that I had no PC to work on, and he proceeded to reprimand my co-worker/supervisor for the mess he had put me in. My boss said multiple times ""I could have bought him a $300 new laptop for him to work on. But no, you bought this used PC off the internet from a stranger instead that now doesn't even work. And you're causing your co-worker to sit here with no PC to work from."" **I literally had no PC to work from the 1st 2 or 3 hours of my day today.** My boss was very angry at my co-worker today. Used PC, no warranty, no refunds, and my boss was willing to spend money for a better, newer PC or laptop (the original budget for my new PC was just under $1000, I don't know why a used PC for under $150 was even bought instead). My co-worker would only recommend  computers that were known to be Hackintosh build friendly to my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

After my co-worker reinstalled OS X (or he did a repair of OS X from the USB drive) I could finally do my work. Or at least I thought I could.

  

Well, Windows 10 was installed inside of the VM and it was running terribly. It was a free VM, so I couldn't even work with Windows 10 full screen. Instead Windows 10 was 1/4 the size of my monitor, and the display settings and the VM settings didn't have a larger size option. Also, the accuracy of the mouse inside Windows was terrible. There was incredible lag and other problems. He didn't even bother to test Windows inside the VM beforehand to make sure it functioned properly because he was an OS X user. So, he shut down the VM, and he told me to just work from OS X instead. And he told me that he would install Windows 10 that would run natively off the hardware and not inside a VM environment after work for me.

  

Now, I had no software to do my job. So, I'm trying to find Windows software equivalents on OS X that were free. And that took another hour of my time at work because 90% of the software available was $50 to $100. The first couple of software programs that I tried didn't even have all the features and functions that I needed to do my job, while the free software that I was using on Windows had all of those functions included in it already. The software that I finally found is not even compatible with the version of OS X that I have on my Hackintosh. Warnings are always popping up telling me to upgrade to the newest version. **And the newest version is $50. It is no longer free. So it may work today and then after the next OS X update it will no longer work.**

  

OK, now I can finally work. Then my co-worker told me that he could never get audio or bluetooth to work from the Hackintosh. I didn't need bluetooth from work, but audio is a big deal to me. I've been given a used PC that has hardware and software problems. The mouse I was given at work was broken, the left click button double clicks every time you click once. I and almost deleted very important settings from a client's account because the software registered 2 clicks instead of one. So, I bring my own mouse to work now. But my mouse inside of OS X has problems too. The scroll wheel and the pointer speed was very off. Sometimes it works fine, and at others times it was not very responsive at all. I brought 2 mice with me today (one wired and one wireless) and both of them had the same exact issue. When I complained to the co-worker who built the Hackintosh, he tried using my mouse and he replied back ""they work perfectly"". **He then proceeded to say ""You are just an Apple and OS X Hater.""** These were my own personal mice. They worked fine from my home PC, they worked fine from my work PC inside Windows 10. And I can tell when they are not working properly inside a Hackintosh.

  

I'm very familiar with OS X. I've used an iMac at work for close to 2 years. I've taken classes in college where we work from iMacs and Mac Pros (the old grey ones) for the entire semester. OS X is fine. But when I'm given a Hackintosh at work, and I have to deal with all of the problems and bugs that come along with a Hackintosh; I might get a little tilted, frustrated, and salty, because the co-worker wanted a toy to play with after work hours.  


**TLDR:**

I was given an Hackintosh at work that the owner didn't approve of. The owner does not know that he can face serious fines for running unlicensed, pirated software from their business computers.

**Should I tell my boss the consequences and fines they can face if they are found to be using unlicensed, pirated software from their business computers (in other words that they can possible face some serious fines for having a Hackintosh at work)?** Yes, the co-worker said he would install Windows 10 for me tonight, but there is still going to be a version of OS X running off the hard drive of that Hackintosh. And I'm pretty sure if my boss knows that he can face some hefty fines for using a Hackintosh at their place of business, that they would delete OS X from it very quickly. Right now, the boss does not know about the possible fines; and the co-worker has used company funds that my boss paid for so that the co-worker could build himself a Hackintosh toy himself. A PC that the co-worker will not work from daily for 8 hours a day. He works from a MacBook instead. And I've been given no choice but to work from a HP desktop that is running an unauthorized version of OS X.",29May2019,2
130,"A little bit of background: my mother was verbally and physically abusive to me growing up which led to my dad divorcing her and having custody of me until I became an adult. She has been alone and jobless ever since. Now, this was very long ago and I have forgiven her but we dont see eachother as often, I feel so sorry for her. She grew up in a violent home where she went through the same thing. My grandmother also has cancer, she is her only daughter and only caretaker she has, so her life is entirely consumed by her

So she had breakdown and called me on the phone very recently, I drove over to her place as we don't live together and she was a mess, she told me about how her father had sexually assaulted her multiple times growing up. She told me all about how she forgives him and he loves him and that he was just sick. Telling her that she should not love him is not my place, she has told me thinking that way helps her deal with the trauma. I am the first and only person she has ever told this to. I never met him as he died before I was born and I feel pure hatred towards this dead man now. I love my mother so much and this has completely shaken me, I feel like crying every hour she crosses my mind. I forgive her completely, I cannot imagine what she has been through... except I can and it makes me so angry I shake. I really need help in learning how to help her. All I want to do is be beside her and comfort her through all the things she Is dealing with right now but I dont live very close. Im sorry if this sounds silly but I genuinely dont know what things to say to her, or what to do to make her feel loved and supported. I am really afraid she might kill herself, I have physically stopped her twice in the past 4 years. I dont know what I would do if anything happened to her. Also if anyone knows how I could help support her in finding a job/hobby/activity that would keep her mentally occupied from the situation with my grandmother (my grandmother is her whole world, she does not have many friends. Please, please help me. I am terrified.

132,"I have been living withy dad for 4 years now and it has been hell. My dad is unfit to be a parent. He doesn't have a stable job and cannot support 3 kids alone. He is extremely unpredictable when it comes to emotionally dealing with things. He will scream at the top of his lungs over a wrong burrito and act very unnecessarily verbally abusive to me and my siblings. I am not into alot of sports things as a kid and he could never relate to me. He still can't relate to me now and has no idea how to support me mentally and educationally. He can't relate to me in anyway and only likes because he has to because I'm his son. I still love him because he is my dad but I can't stay with him.

I want, or need, or have to move to my mom's house to ensure a good education and safe life.

Today my parents had to work late, so I stayed late at school and watched the first 3 episodes of Assassination classroom. It was so fun! Sadly, my parent threw out all my Lush soaps, a gift my parent got me from California, and all my bath bombs. My bratty little sister stole all of the money out of my purse (over $100!) What can I do??? I am not allowed to have an etsy or a lemonade stand or get paid for chores and I certainly will not steal. Meanwhile, my sister gets everything she wants. I had hid over $200 of high end makeup like mac, urban decay, etc. She stole it and took it all for herself. My dog is spoiled rotten too. I had an expensive Persian rug in my room and my mom took it and used it as a pee pad for the dog! I just bought some eyeshadow from dollar tree and she stole that too. Once a friend gave me this gorgeous duochrome black-green nail polish (Mineral Fusion blue nile) and it got thrown out because my mom was afraid it would make me start worshiping the devil. My dad also said horns, antlers, etc, are demonic. I was also forbidden from buying anything even remotely related to assassination classroom and from drawing any of  the characters by my grandparents, but I do anyway. My grandparents, who live at my house, say if I do there will be demons in the home, although I know that is not true. They even went so far to burn my dress they deemed immodest and invite some church members around to blow shofars and speak in tongues. They wake up every morning at 5 to blow shofars! They also took my beautiful Gabriela American Girl doll and donated her. I cried for an hour. What can I do??? Please be nice.",29May2019,0
136,"Now this might sound egoist, or simply be egoist, judge as you wish but please tell me your thought about it.

Hi, I'm 22 yo since march and I'm currently living with  my mother in the family house and finished just not long ago my  formation and got my diploma just this monday. In this house I live with  my mother, my older sister (25) and her boyfriend (23). Now, at the  beginning I was okay with it, there were perticular circonstances to why  he lives here (his ""friend"" who live with him in his appartment for  free was horrible with him behind his back, my sister discovered it,  told her BF, said he needed to go, but didn't stay as he was taking his  stuff back. So he destroy the place and eventually harass my sister by  digging the tires and making drawing-dick session on her car when she  came to see her BF at his place.) So she invite him home so they could  raise money and get a place together.

But it's been a year now. Now bear with me as I ""sum up"" why this is complicate.

BF  work at McDonald and manage to get a good pay but dream of an office  job but looks like a viking so business are not really taking him  seriously because of his apperance. But he also didn't have the chance  to do studies as her mother kick him out of her house years ago because  her new husband and her kids didn't like each other. So with his older  sister, they rented a place and work early before she got married and  bought a house and live happily from what I know. Also little sister of  BF can't also bear the father and live with her uncle as she's minor, so  yeah apparently the father-in-law is  impossible to live with for  them. 

So he got his appartment, support himself  with work and he's okay with his life, have hobbies and enough money to  spare in things he likes.

Then he comes here  because my sister can't bare the harassment and asked to live with him  at the family house just the time to find a new place. 

Why they didn't move from this place is also a sum up story (please bear with me we're almost there!)

So as BF work McDonald, sister search for work for months.

Find  one in a brand car business as accountary secretary as CDD possibility  of CDI. But leave the work because of some problem with some jealous co  worker. But my mother is worried because she never do something  completely as she abandons easily, same for work where she take part  time like in education where you are paid in holidays and then quit.

So   she got stressed also because her BF and her wanted to buy a house with  a loan. My mother and I learned this 6 months after. We talk about this  with her that there no need to take a job you don't like for a loan you  don't even you will able to pay. So she quit that job and take a break  of 1 month since today. Apparently she want her BF to quit also his job  for finding a one better elsewhere (since he got bad hours and can't  grade up in his place because the management is weirdly handled + always  got 0/5 on a apperance note because of his long hair and beard. 

Which  also worried my mother. And me. Because the guy is indecisive. Very  nice, polite but so indecisive. Litteraly every conversation which  involves a choice is like :

Sister : what should we  do ? BF : idk, what do you think ? - I'm asking you. - I'm also asking  you 'Silence' - What should we do? 'Doesn't repond' Do even listen to me  ?

Then they just basically repeat themself for 30 minutes before my mother or me just ""press them"" to choose. 

So, for important choice conversation must be (from what I imagine) even more efficient.

Now  the problem is not the fact that I have to be cautious around the house  about the BF, not the fact that he doesn't shower much but sweat easily  and fast and just rubbed his armpits on all the sofas. No, I can bear  it. But. The cost of living of these two are incredibly stupid.

My  sister used to take a bath every day after work. Without employment,  takes hourly shower, day by day. Now my family is aware of this, we know  that she takes a lot of water. But BF too. It doesn't take that much  showers. But when he do, hours are counted. Also taking baths together  because why not.

Then water bill come and sister is  astonished. Can't believe the bills have gone up just as BF and her  lives here. Think it's my mother and I before thinking back that we're  the quick type in shower 5min-15min if hair needs to get clean.

Also  come food. We used to get food every month. Now it's every week : BF is  an ogre. Might be his height, might be his weight, but he eats for 3,  litteraly our 3 portions of food for diner (mother, sister, me) are  equal to his portion.

And  it's still my mother who pays the bills, alone. She barely got the  month ends with her pay. So when I see BF or sister buying expensive DVD  collections or thinking of getting of buying IKEA stuff which is not  cheap when you ask what my sister have in mind, before even building up  money, I'm just fulming. My mother is too kind, when she's alone with me  she's angry she have to find the dirty clothes of BF on the couch or  table, when he stays too long in the shower or when they can't decide  whatever they want to do in the future ( mostly because my sister think  she can't decide of her future because it's useless and drop psycho and  other stuff easily.) But when she speaks with them about the problems,  she's either way too kind, don't even show she's not happy, says it  lovingly and finally says ""it's okay it's not that bad"". But she shows  her discomfort, my sister got all worked up and just served the ""you  just don't like him! You're such a vicious witch!"". Now I can speak up  but ultimatley got shut up by her by just being 3 years younger than  her, because apparently this means I'm more stupid than her.

Now  I'm just sitting in the living room, sitting on the couch with the  armpits smell of the BF after I just offer humidifier with floral scent  for mother's day. He can be nice, I can love my sister too but now I  just wish they just rented a place and get away from here. 

I'm  very much anxious about money and cry every time my mother break down  in front of her monthly bills. So I would very much like this situation  to end. 

Do you think a year is enough or that I press too much on the matter ?",29May2019,1

138,"I just need some guidance from an unbiased third party.

3 years ago my SO’s family was struggling to pay rent and keep afloat. When his father asked for a few hundreds here and there I obliged. He said he would pay me back as soon as he got back on his feet. He seemed like an honest man at the time. Eventually those few hundred dollars racked up to be a $1000. After a short brief family meeting they asked me $4000 to pay off large amount of credit card debt and again I obliged. Not too long after SO’s Father’s rapid me back the $4000. That was about a year ago. 

Fast forward today, not once has the mention of the $1000 been brought up or even a cent paid back from it. I’m no longer receiving financial aid and I need money for tuition. Would it be appropriate for me to bring this up? 

My SO suspects his father will deny owing my that money and wants to pay me himself but he already owes me money himself so I don’t want to stress him out more with another $1000.

142,"I'm in the midst of the college search and I'm very conflicted. For awhile now, I've wanted to major in Political Science or something else similar, however recently I've been seriously considering majoring in Graphic Design.

I would say I am more passionate about Graphic Design, but there's some things stopping me from doing majoring it. 

1.) Portfolio
If I want to do Graphic Design, I would have to a portfolio with about 10-20 pieces, which I do not have right now. I would have to get on it because I only have more or less this summer to do it.

2.) Self-Doubt
I don't think I'm particularly artistically-gifted. I can draw very mediocrely and I don't consider myself too creative, which is why I don't think I could make a decent portfolio (or even stand a chance in this field). I think this point is really stopping me the most.

3.) Future Regret
If I were to major in Graphic Design, I would probably go to an art school or something like that, which makes me worried because what if I realize that this not for me? Then I would have to either stick with it or transfer (which is a hassle I don't really want to go through). Also, the college I'm looking at that I really like for Political Science doesn't offer any Graphic Design related majors.

I talked to someone I'm really close to about my dilemma and she said that it would be risky to major in Graphic Design because I'm not completely 100% sure on it. For the last month or so, I was just thinking of going to a school that had both Political Science and Graphic Design, and go into Political Science first and switch to Graphic Design if I really feel like it. But, I still come back to the same issue because if I want to switch into Graphic Design major, I'll still need a portfolio.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or just has any wisdom to offer me, it would be much appreciated!",29May2019,1
143,"I'm not sure how to put this, but I'm trying to have a better relationship with my father. Here are the details

 Background on my father:

 \- Great dude, veteran, had some bouts with anger outburst (Breaking things, fights with my mother, kicking us out of the car to walk home when I was younger) until I was about 13 yrs old, than he switched over a new leaf and been pretty solid since. I'm in my early 30's, and he calls every month to say he loves me, ask if he was a good father or says he knows he wasn't the best father at times. FYI - I see the man all the time, he lives 15-20mins away. So these types of calls I find weird being that we have regular interactions. 

\- Religious guy, he is a pastor of a local church. (FYI - I'm agnostic/humanist which causes a good amount of friction in my religious family)

\- Diagnosed with depression.

I have a very hard time having conversations that are above small talk with him. My issue is that he exaggerates/lies a lot, even on small things. He also jumps to conclusions really quickly. He has in the past said he had prostate cancer only because the doctor said he needs to have a biopsy on a possible cancerous growth. He once told me he had another son after he found out the day before from an old acquaintance that his girlfriend from decades ago had a kid that kind of looked like him. That, plus the blatant lies that I've witnessed him tell other people growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the above makes me not be able to take him serious as well as his lack of planning which causes him to get into unnecessary situations - he retired without realizing he didn't have enough in retirement to support his family. As I got older I stopped reacting to what he says and began to be extremely skeptical in what he says.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love just to talk to him without feeling frustrated or annoyed or have the feeling that I'm being emotionally manipulated. He recently called me cold to him, which is not what I want. I love the man, which I'm not sure he actually believes at this point.

Any advice on how to (re)build this relationship?",29May2019,1
144,"I'm having difficulty sorting out and expressing my feelings, and I don't know if my behaviour is appropriate or if I'm being walked on, or maybe I'm just insecure. I could really use the help. :( I know this is long but I made it as short as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched a movie with my mom, and I liked it, but she didn't. I remarked that one of her favourite movies did the same thing that she \*didn't\* like about this movie (I wasn't try to argue by saying this, just making a lighthearted remark). She says that she thinks that people born after the baby boomers (her generation) must be ""brain damaged"" to think it was a good movie. I was startled and she told me that she was apparently talking about the movie critics I had mentioned earlier, who said it was a very good movie. She explained that she felt I was trying to convince her of my viewpoint with my remark, so I explained that I wasn't, and apologized.

&amp;#x200B;

However, she kept insisting that I was trying to change her opinion (I wasn't. At all. Which I kept telling her.) and I eventually left the room. I came back later and explain how it was a big misunderstanding between us, and I apologized again. She insisted on trying to convince me that I was in fact trying to change her opinion and that this was a symptom of my OCD (I do have OCD, but it absolutely does not interfere with interactions like this, and has little presence in my day-to-day life in general). I told her that it wasn't, and that it was a misunderstanding between us, and she still would not accept that.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I told her that I wished she'd show me some respect by accepting my apology and letting this end here, to which she became extremely upset. ""YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T RESPECT YOU?! I DON'T RESPECT YOU?!"" and that sort of thing. I explained at least half a dozen times what I meant, but she kept generalizing the word ""respect"", going as far as showing me a definition of the word respect and insisting that I read it. I apologized again profusely, complimented her, told her I love her and how much I appreciate what she does for me, and think that things should (mostly) be ok, before I go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

When I wake up the next morning, I get a text from her that's too long to post here, but to condense it: ""Since you think you have been treated badly, I am letting you know I will not be having the same relationship with you since it is too painful for me. Since you said your piece to me last night, I have been unable to sleep."" The message goes on to talk about me moving out (I'm not sure where this came from??), and things like ""I'm sorry you don't appreciate the sacrifices I make for you"", and closes with ""I am sick now and going to sleep"".

&amp;#x200B;

I message her and apologize, tell her I love her, clarify that I didn't say anything like what she's saying. For most of this time she says things like ""You have pointed a finger of blame on me"", ""You told me that I do not treat you with respect. A very painful cruel comment."", and a lot of self put-downs: ""I have failed"", ""I'm a deprived old woman"", ""I won't waste my worthless efforts anymore"". I attempted to lift her spirits at every available chance, but it didn't seem to help.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went to her in person and told her that ""I made a mistake. I'm very sorry. I should have been more careful."" and things like this, several times, and hugged her, before she finally seemed to accept my apology.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to hear an unbiased, outsider's view on this. The thing is, I feel like I am \*always\* put into the wrong. She can say whatever she likes about me and I just have to take it, whereas even if I say something like ""I think you don't respect me"". Also, if she misunderstands me, I have to apologize, but if I misunderstand her, I'm still in the wrong. The problem is that it's almost impossible to discuss any of these things, because she becomes so upset that if it got much worse I feel like I might have to call an ambulance (I can't stress this enough). I want to discuss these things with her calmly, and respectfully, but no matter how delicately I put it, no matter how many hours I spend reading about negotiation and body language and practicing with other people, am I able to convince her that I am not trying to attack her with these subjects.",29May2019,1
145,"I've known this friend, who I will call Alex, for over 2 years. They have always been extremely kind and supportive, and they're currently working hard to graduate. We text frequently about various topics. I recently looked up their Facebook account, and what came up were old posts with racist and homophobic text as well as tons of hate. There was other shocking content as well and they had pictures with concerning people. 

It hurts further because I am a minority and gay (I haven't come out to them yet) in our prodominanetly white area. Seeing them post what they did seems to contradict everything they have shown me about themselves. To see that they have supported the racist and homophobic behavior of other people in my area is scary.

I don't know how I can interact with this friend when I meet up with them again soon. Did they change from their racist and homophobic ways? Are they painting me a facade?

Should I bring up these findings to them?

Help would be appreciated, thank you.",29May2019,0
146,"Sorry in advance for the long post:
I've spent the last 2.5 years living with my best friend of more than 10 years now. And overall, it's been great. About 6 months ago, we both agreed that we would move our own separate ways when the lease was up, both to live with our (respective) boyfriends. They both do live with us now, but I'm ready to have a place just him and I. In a month, the lease is up, and my boyfriend and i have already found a place to live, we're 100% locked down. However, Best Friend and her boyfriend haven't made any plans, and it's making me nervous.
From what I understand, they finally found a place they like, but don't have money for the initial fees. TLDR on finances, they do make less combined than boyfriend and i, but not substantially worse. They just like spending money. I've been covering various amounts of Best Friend's expenses over the last two years, just because it was either pay her share, or we lose our apartment/electricity/etc. They're not asking us to give them the money for the apartment, but rather to just extend the current lease (which is under my name) for another three months while they sort things out.
I love my best friend, so much, but I'm not sure thats a good idea-like I said, they almost never have the money to pay their share of bills, let alone all the bills for this apartment. If they fail to do so, then that falls back on me. Boyfriend and I dont have the money to pay their down payments right now, because we just paid our own. But the only backup option they have is to move in with Best Friend's Boyfriend's mom, and it seems mean to tell them to do that instead of trusting them to make payments. Am I in the right, or am I just being selfish?

TLDR: I'm moving out and my roommate wants me to extend the lease in just my name, even though she has a history of being financially irresponsible. Do I potentially ruin my credit, or do I basically force her to move back home?",29May2019,1
147,"I am a 16, almost 17 year old guy. In a few days I will finish up my junior year, ready to be a senior. I play sports, have a lot of friends, and I’m fairly well known around my school. I get along well with everyone and I’m not involved in a whole lot of drama.

Here’s the problem: I’m a pussy. There’s no sugarcoating it, I’m just a soft bitch. My friends constantly give me shit and I’m the butt of what seems like 99% of the jokes, but I can never really defend myself. I just take abuse from everyone, and it bothers me that I am clearly not okay with it, yet continue to let people walk all over me. I don’t hate my life, and I’ve got some things going for me. It just seems like I never have the courage to stick up for myself or do the things I want. I just kind of let life pass me by, telling myself I’m “going with the flow”. That’s bullshit though. In reality, I’m just too soft to change anything and I’m a coward. I’m essentially always at the bottom in any sort of group and people generally just seem to treat me like shit. I don’t understand why I can’t defend myself. I struggle talking to girls because I assume they’re too good for me, and I know that most people sort of consider me a joke.

151,"So my dad and I started a small business that makes different telecom devices that fill a variety of gaps in the market. We’re facing real success and for the first time I might be able to thrive just a little bit financially after years of struggle and working my ass off. 

But last week I just found out my mom makes twice what I do from the business and lives life like she’s retired. The way my dad put it is she is technically president of the company that they started years prior that fell flat and since our new company falls under that banner, she makes a president’s salary. I’m calling bullshit. 

Now my dad makes over double my salary and he deserves it. He works day and night, and in ways that I couldn’t keep up with because I’m still not even close to his skill set. To me, he deserves every penny of it and has earned his more than comfortable, upper middle class life. But I have been living under the poverty line until just a couple of years ago. I’ve fallen on some pretty dramatic situations where they had to pay a medical bill that I couldn’t afford. I haven’t even been to a dentist in 10 years because I couldn’t afford it. I spent years living top ramen and food hand outs from friends, some nights I had to skip meals. 

And now I’m just left thinking was this all to teach me a lesson? Do they just want me to learn to thrive on my own? Did the think it was going to build character? Did they think I didn’t work hard enough? Do they resent me for having a paycheck all together? Did they just want all the money for themselves?",29May2019,1

156,"Long-time reddit lurker, first post ever

TL;DR at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

My\[16M\] entire life just broke down today and I had to make an account cuz I really need advice. A few days ago,  my mom's bank account was hacked and she collected my whole families internet information and went and got all of our search history to see what site got us the virus. Long story short, she found that I had been on some porn sites. This

happened before, years ago, and my parents reacted really badly. Honestly, I see where they come from, they are Indian immigrants, and no one ever mentions sex, or gave me the talk, or even basic health things related to sex. I was ashamed and kind of closed myself off from my parents. Though they didn't do anything wrong, since then, I never really trusted or confided in my parents, or anyone, about my issues. I also began developing severe self-esteem and anxiety issues. In the Ninth grade, I started having anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. Now back to today, my mom found that I have watched porn and she confronted me about it. She was really disappointed and disgusted and told me that she doesn't trust me anymore. I sort of broke down inside and told her how I was really ashamed too, and how I thought it was normal because I saw some other teens talking about it on the internet. I told her about how I felt extremely guilty and how that and other things made me feel suicidal. She kind of froze and seemed worried. She wants me to open up and she wants to delegate some time every week for me to ""open up"". This is my problem. I don't want to tell her anything and I have never honestly opened up to my parents since elementary school. They never understand and always overexaggerate. Also, my dad will be coming home in a few hours and he also got the search history report and probably knows that I watched porn. He gets really angry and I don't know how to deal with him. I don't know what to do and I want to just run away. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mom and dad found out that I watch porn. I told my mom that I was feeling guilty and suicidal. She is pressuring me to open up, but I don't want to. Also, my dad is coming home in a few hours and will confront me. I don't know what to do.",29May2019,0
157,"My cousin M17 has been staying up all night talking to his gf and then not getting up in the morning for school. He's missed the bus almost every day this year and driving to school is hard when every dollar counts for us. He has been falling asleep in classes and is falling behind. It's his senior year and he only has a week or so left. Our grandmother (his guardian) said he has to get off the phone at 10 but he regularly stays up way past that, sometimes until 3 when he gets up at 5. The whole time he gets ready in the morning he is on the phone, and takes breaks just to talk to her. Then he gets in the car and yells at whoever is driving him to hurry up. I'm only 18 but he won't listen to my mom or our grandparents. He either blatantly ignores them or they give up. I've been having to 'bad parent' him and I don't know if it's my place or not. He doesn't listen to anyone besides me because I bug him. His gf recently told him he does too much around the house ( he cleans out two litter boxes, that's it). He literally can't even tie his own shoes or make his own bed. She has also started telling him that he's 17 and doesn't have to listen to adults anymore, and he is *extremely* impressionable and gullible. He refuses to go to bed on time and gets pissed at everyone else when it's his fault. He says it is his own choice to stay up but he keeps my mom up all night and she has to wake up around 3 every morning to get ready.

158,"Growing up, I wasn't equipped with knowing how to do deal with things emotionally. My parents divorced at a young age and constantly sued each other for custody of my brother and me. My dad would try to touch me sexually, engaging in inappropriate comments and my mom emotionally shut down after she lost her second husband to cancer. Given that my parents weren't the best emotional role models, it was really hard for me to navigate life in high school. I was really suicidal and attracted the most negative people in my life. I let people use me frequently. Now, I'm learning to make boundaries and to not be run over but this is still difficult as some of my old friends are still in my life. I have a particular ""friend"" who happens to be my coworker. She makes comments like, ""I think people would look at us and think we are a couple"" in public settings, even when she knows I have a boyfriend. She puts me down and talks about my personal life at work without my permission. She is fixated on what I wear, always happy if we are wearing similar things and gets upset if I hang out with anyone but her. She set me up with a man who she knew raped people in the past. I talked to my therapist about the problem today and she was concerned for my safety. What should I do? I just got a big promotion at work and that puts me in a different room and next to my boss (who stands up for me). Besides work, I don't see the need to be around her. Whenever I've tried to leave the friendship in the past, she gets upset and makes efforts to make me feel guilty and shameful for not spending time with her. I've considered slowly drifting apart from her, especially because she has followed me to this workplace and moved across the street from me in the past.

164,"I apologize for this being so long in advance.... 

TLDR; Had a big falling out with a good friend, almost a year later she wants to meet to talk about it.

Where do I even begin, honestly. 

Let’s call my friend Natalie. She and I met in college, we grew really close because of mutual interests and we went through a lot together. 
Last year we started hanging around more people, we kind of expanded our group of friends and hung out with them together more consistently. Everything seemed to be going great until it wasn’t, all of a sudden one day I got a message from her, essentially saying how she couldn’t be hanging out with me all the time anymore because she was just dealing with stuff and hanging out with everyone just exhausted her i guess. I don’t know, i didn’t even realize she was having a hard time. Well, I got really defensive, which was probably the wrong choice, and she fired back with just insults and attacks. In hindsight it was probably a manic episode and I just made it worse. While this was really hurtful, I forgive her because I recognize a lot of signs of my own mental illness and I just couldn’t give up on her. 

A couple months later in November she did message me apologizing, explaining her mental diagnosis and how she felt like the world was really crashing in on her and as a result she ended up treating her family and friends (including me) really poorly. She explained she started therapy, started medication to help out with her issues. She mentioned wanting to meet up to talk about it in person but any time I asked she was busy or she wouldn’t reply. After the second time I got a denial, I just stopped even trying. I figured why keep reaching out to someone who just didn’t care.

So that was that, we haven’t spoken since. I assumed that was just the end of it, I had to realize that nothing I said could change her mind and make her my friend again. I expected that I’d never hear from her again, and I blamed myself for everything... until today. 

Today I woke up to a message from Natalie, this was unprovoked, like I said I haven’t even spoken to her since November. She said her reasoning for never meeting up was that she was still in a bad place but she’s been working on her mental health more this year and was finally ready to talk if that was something I still wanted. This completely blindsided me, I agreed to meet up and now I’m nervous... was this the right idea? I’ve wanted to hear from her for so long so I’m glad but at the same time my gut tells me I should be wary. 

I just don’t know but I don’t really have anyone to talk to in my life and this is just consuming all my thoughts. I started summer classes again today and I just haven’t been able to pay attention, does anyone have any words of wisdom or any advice? Am i making a big mistake by trying?

I tried posting this in another sub but it wasn't interacted with but I am hoping for some advice",29May2019,1
165,"(TL,DR at the end)

Hey Reddit, I've been crying myself to sleep for some time now about this same issue, so I figured it's about time I stop putting myself and try to pick myself back up. I just need to figure out how.

I've suffered from low self-worth issues and incredibly low self-esteem my entire life. I've tried to hide it from both others and myself, but it shows up in the worst of ways like when I make a mistake or when someone hangs up a call sooner than I hoped they would. I've tried building myself up, succeeding a few times only to feel narcissistic and knock myself down again. Growing up (to get to the psychology behind this), I was always held to the highest degree and even when I felt like I did a good job it just seemed to never be enough for my Mom. Even now, my parents always say they expect great things from me and the mess I'm becoming is nothing like me. To be completely honest, I've never felt like they've known the real me. 

I got a job at McDonald's a few months ago. I had to beg for this job and endure days of arguing about my schedule with my parents just to keep it. I have a job, I keep my straight-A's (except for one B in the final semester... It was an 89), I make time for the things that are important to me, and yet it never seems to be enough. I was at graduation and had the most cords and medals out of everyone there and yet I felt like I didn't do enough. I broke myself down to try and run my dying orchestra this year and yet I had to fight for some recognition for it, and even then I wish I did more and fought harder. 

This mentality has been getting in the way of my happiness with my relationship. Unless my partner is spending every second of his free time with me I feel terrified that he's talking to someone better or that he's not talking to me because I'm not worth his time. He's his own person with his own agenda, and I recognize that. He spent most of the day with me and yet I'm still here crying that I'm never going to be good enough.

At one point in my life I got past most of these issues and I was pretty close to being happy. But nowadays it feels like there's this weight on my back and my memory is foggy as to how I built myself back up from the ground. Every mental-help effort I tried in the past seems to not be working anymore. I've lost touch with my inner self and that's what I prided myself on for the longest time. I'm lost, and I don't know what to do. Please, help me.

168,"I’m F17. I’ve been 17 for the last few months. I have never once been on a date in my entire life and I’m not an unattractive girl. Like at all. I have had my fair share of one month relationships throughout middle school and high school but none that were ever serious. My younger sister whose 15 has been on numerous dates with boys because she would do anything to see them by my mom’s availability. See, the difference between my sister and I is that I have a car. 
I recently started seeing this guy who I met at school and we’ve hung out after school numerous times but I’d have to get home before my mom got home or I’d be in big trouble. I eventually came clean to my mom back in March that I wanted to go on a date w the boy I’m seeing and she said I wasn’t allowed to unless she was to meet him and he had to have a car, like his mom couldn’t even pick us up. I couldn’t pick him up. 
The guy I’m seeing has a car just not his licenses and we’ve been together for months now and I haven’t even told my mom about him again since then because she is so picky on how everything is. See, I couldn’t “go on a date” when it’s convenient for him and me. No, it has to be convenient for my mom. It has to follow my mom’s rules. I’d have to be 100% angel golden child for a week before I could go on that “date” or she would yell at me and completely do everything in her power for me not to see this boy. She has done it to my sister. Multiple times. My mom would make us clean everything while insulting us. Once my sister told me she stayed after school with her boyfriend and my mom overheard and started calling my sister all these awful names like whore etc. My sister can barely even ask if she can hang out w a friend of hers unless she has known them for years. 
I had never asked her to hang out with a friend of mine because she thinks I’m friends with all these 18-20 year olds because I work in a store with college aged kids. She even talks about how the only time I would ever get a boyfriend is if a 20 year old took an interest in me as in easy target. 
The guy I am with is 17 years old, he is in my grade. We are both seniors next fall. 
She treats my sister and I as if we are 8 years old still. If I were to ask if I could go on a date it would be a bombardment of “have u been seeing him recently” 
She would eventually put two and two together and realize I had been seeing a guy after school the last few months and I would be grounded.
I freaking adore the kid I’m with and he adores me. We are so freaking great together, every day I’ve spent after school with him has never been a let down. We are seriously best friends. I don’t want to lose him because my fucking mother thinks that she controls everything. She would say “are you telling what I’m suppose to do” if I told her what i wanted to do. She controls every aspect of my goddamn life. My older brother isn’t even allowed to date and he’s 21 YEARS OLD. it’s her house, her rules. 
My dad said I’m allowed to date. He even got my mom in agreement that my sister could date. My parents are divorced btw. 
But it sucks.
Even when I’m 18, it’s gonna be “my house my rules” and she would probably slut shame me like she slut shames my sister.
It’s so disgusting.

169,"I’m a female in high school so I haven’t had much experience with stuff like this, and any advice given would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been friends with one girl for many years and I consider our friendship very close. However, lately she has been very touchy, such as squeezing my thigh, lightly/jokingly “choking” me, and also biting me. The biting part is only on my shoulder, and there’s always clothing separating her from actual skin, but every time she does it I just scoot away or switch seats. She always giggles after so she may just see it as a joke, but it just makes me super uncomfortable. I’m not a very physically affectionate person in general so I don’t know if I’m just out of the loop, but I don’t want to put strain on our friendship if I’m just being defensive. 

My second friend, I’ve only gotten close to her for about a year, and she is EXTREMELY affectionate. Both of these friends are bisexual, so it may just be me who isn’t used to this affection. This second friend does the same things as my first friend, only 10x more intense. She hugs me every day and doesn’t let go for long periods of time (i’ve mentioned that i wasn’t raised with a ton of physical affection so i’m not comfortable with it yet), and she has tried to bite me around every other day. I’ve become better at spotting when she’s about to so I can move away, but she always looks sad when I do. Last week during a presentation she was holding my hand and while I was writing notes with my other hand, she LICKED MY FINGER and just giggled. On reflex I kind of jerked my hand away and wiped it and she made a really displeased face while I felt really uncomfortable for the rest of the time. 

I don’t know how to approach either of them on these things because it might be completely normal to them to be openly affectionate. I’m not homophobic and I DO support lgbt+, but i feel like they are just crossing the line between friends and “more”, but it’s just one sided because I’m straight. 

How should I approach them on stopping so I don’t ruin our friendship?",29May2019,1

172,"I put too much pressure on myself and it's a problem. The way I talk to myself in my head is quite nasty. I have been trying to make strides to be more compassionate to myself and tone down the whip-cracking drill sergeant inside of my head. But I guess I worry that having that personality of being hard on myself is what allows me to get shit done, work out regularly, and eat clean. 

How do I ease up on myself without turning into a lazy piece of shit who eats trash?

174,"Okay, so I wouldn’t necessarily call what I experience “bullying” I just don’t know what to call it. 
I went to a small, home-schoolish, private academy until the second semester of freshman year (where I am now) so needless to say I’ve never experienced this public high-school atmosphere before.
For some background, I don’t have the best social skills. I’m aware of it, and trying to get better. It’s mostly due to the fact I was isolated with other odd kids almost all my life, and was never really exposed to “normal” behavior. I have odd interests as well. I know an absurd amount of animal facts that people find odd, and I’m interested in true crime (no, I’m not a psychopath I just find it interesting) so people think I’m weird. I don’t have any friends really because of my crippling anxiety (I know, I sound like every teen) but really, I don’t have any people I hang out with. I usually spend lunch in the library reading and/or doing schoolwork. I also have Tourettes, my ticks are moving my neck and sneezing. Having Tourette’s makes people assume I’m mentally decrepit or autistic (not that it’s a bad thing) 

Anyways, a girl in my class realized I was the odd and started doing this thing that wouldn’t necessarily be bullying, but is still meant to make fun of me. She started calling me “babygurllllll” for some reason. I know it seems harmless but the way she says it and then whispers to her friends when I respond, it is obvious it’s an inside joke with her friends. She also pretends to be my friend. She starts conversations obviously set up to make me embarrass myself. Long story short, she laughs AT me, while pretending she’s laughing WITH me. For a bit I thought it was my imagination, but I realized she was doing almost only to me. I assume she thinks I’m socially retarded and won’t realize, but I do.

I don’t know what to do, I’ve been trying to brush it off, but it really does hurt me. I’ve been trying to brush it off but after every class with her I feel entirely belittled and self conscious. Should I forget about it? Confront her? Ignore her? Please, I feel so self conscious when around her. If you can help please do.",29May2019,1

176,"I'm not afraid to admit I'm a bit of a late bloomer in terms of relationships. I was ugly and very insecure for the first 18 years of my life, and have only just recently started to turn that around. I started talking to this girl I knew from school after she hit me up from seeing one of my Instagram posts. We hung out once, things went well, and then we hung out again.

&amp;#x200B;

The second time we hung out, unfortunately, I caught some hard feelings. I was trying to repress them to the best of my ability, but stupidly, I made the decision to act on those feelings and I sent her a long-winded text, something along the lines of ""are you really interested in me for me?"". Even more pathetically, I sent her another text the following day, after getting no reply, saying ""sorry, that last text was stupid, let me show you a good time this weekend"".

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, she didn't take well to these texts, and didn't reciprocate the same interest. Can't really blame her for that, I mean, that was pretty sad on my part. I was in the process of moving on from the whole experience, when she hit me back up a couple weeks later. I asked her ""So are you interested in hanging out again or nah?""

&amp;#x200B;

She replied saying she wasn't sure, saying that the soonest she could hang out again would be in July (we live a bit of a distance away from each other, so I can only visit her on weekends, and she is supposedly playing a sport right now, so weekends don't work).

&amp;#x200B;

This is all fine and good I guess, but then I noticed that she had posted something on her Instagram saying something along the lines of ""needing love"".

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm afraid of is that someone else will snatch her up before July comes and I won't have the opportunity to explain myself in person for my past behaviors or have the opportunity to potentially start something with her. The ""flame"" in my eyes is already dying, but I don't want it to completely die out, I don't want her to forget about me entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a lot of mixed signals I'm dealing with here, with her hitting me up first, to posting that needy shit on Instagram. **My question is, should I hit her up, try and chat with her to remind her of my existence, or should I play it cool, pretend like I'm indifferent and wait until July comes to try and do something?** I really do like her, and I know she likes me too based on the things she's said in the past and the multiple chances she's given me before. I've learned a lot from this experience and I want her to know that I won't ever make those same stupid mistakes again, that I will be the type of guy that she really needs, not some loser piece of shit that asks for her approval. I want to show her that I can be that person, but I don't want to miss the opportunity to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated. I know that this post in its entirety probably looks stupid to anyone older than me, or anyone with more experience than I have, but give me a break, I'm 18, and this is my first real experience with a girl. I'm sure you've all been in a similar situation before.",29May2019,2
177,"I (24M) am engaged to a wonderful girl (25F) and we’re getting married September 7th of this year. 

As our relationship got more serious, obviously I had the pleasure of getting to know her family more and more over the past few years. While I can’t say that I’ve spent enough, or maybe just don’t have enough in common to be “close” with them, I know them well at this point and they know me.

I was raised poor, and therefor extremely financially conscious. In high school I realized that I could train myself not only to be frugal, but to be wise with money. I majored in Finance and have started several small businesses. I devour personal finance books, read from the experts like Dave Ramsey, Peter Lynch, Robert Kyosaki, Tony Robbins (judge me), etc. I listen to financial podcasts almost daily and quite literally make personal expense/income spreadsheets for fun. I’m currently working in investment sales at an F500 Co. Bottom line, I like learning about money and am a huge nerd.

My fiancé is the opposite. Free spirited, spend if it brings you joy, “if I have it I’ll spend it” type of personality. She has made tremendous strides since we’ve been together in learning to be more financially responsible - as I have learned to be less of a penny pincher and enjoy life more as it comes. (Obviously that’s a recipe for friction but we’ll save that for another post).

Since getting to know my fiancé’s mom, I’ve begun to recognize toxic financial habits in her life. She’s a former CEO of a tech company and used to rake in the cash in the 90’s. It’s clear that her lifestyle, circles of friends, and habits developed during this time and haven’t deviated much since. (We’re talking limo to the airport, first class traveling once a month often out of the country type spending). In ‘08 she lost that job and has been bouncing around doing odd and end corporate coaching type roles - making less money but keeping a similar lifestyle. 

Adapting to less money has been hard for her. I’ve heard numerous stories about her awkwardly asking to borrow money from friends, selling some of their property without her husbands permission, and taking out loans when she found herself underwater. She attributes digging her way out of each of these scenarios as a testament to her financial savvy despite not having a clear cut budget.

As a former boyfriend and now fiancé of her daughter I have steered waaaayyyyy clear of voicing my opinion on this - as much as I really want to with my fiancé. Instead, I’ve tried to focus with her on how she and I can be wise with our own money for ourselves and our future family. 

A few months ago, my future mother-in-law got her role reduced at the company she had been working at the past year. This came with roughly a 2/3 pay cut. Since then, I have cringed watching her take her youngest son on vacation to California, go to Alabama for a long weekend with her old sorority sisters, and Atlanta for a day trip and a few other odd/end trips/purchases. My fiancé and I have scratched our heads trying to figure out where this money has come from. 

It’s also important to note that in January she insisted on throwing us a very nice wedding in Sept. My fiancé and I insisted on not wanting to accept such a generous gesture, but it is somewhat tradition for brides family to cover the wedding and who are we kidding, it was a free wedding to us. When she lost the pay check and I saw the spending patterns fail to change, I had this weird gut feeling and began getting very nervous. I thought if things got dire she might try and come to me to foot a portion of the bill or for a loan. Either way, not a position I wanted to be in. I’ve been out of school and working for two years and haven’t made a ton of money, but I have a nice little savings heaped up. Money that I’ve dog eared to purchase us a house this fall.

Today my fears were confirmed.
She called me while I was at the gym and gave me the spiel about the lost job, tough times, stresses of wedding planning- the whole 9 yards. She’s worried that she won’t be able to afford what’s left of the wedding expenses. We’re talking several thousands of dollars. I left the interaction at me needing time to think about the request. I want to be angry at her for being so irresponsible but I realize it’s no use as she literally has no understanding that her spending patterns are to blame, but she believes she’s a victim of circumstance.

Do I have the money? Yes. I could foot the bill but it would deplete my savings and hinder our house buying process. I can’t help feeling guilty about not wanting to help out when I have been tremendously frugal for two years and she’s been irresponsible. I feel like since it’s my wedding and if I say no out of principal, even for a portion of the costs, I will look greedy and potentially harm a relationship with my future mother in law and prevent a portion of this wedding that my fiancé is excited about from happening.

My options as I see them are pay a portion of the expenses. Escape the situation without being a bad guy but further encourage bad behavior and open myself up as the family bank. Or, option 2, stick to my principals. Explain the money is already allocated toward a house, and risk tarnishing relations with my fiancé, her mom and potentially have to cause the wedding to be trimmed back substantially.

I’d sincerely appreciate any and all constructive advice.

182,"25 F. One semester of college left and have the opportunity to move in with a girl that I'm close with for 8 months. Have lived with parents entire life. Have suffered from depression for a few years, mainly due to isolating myself completely and just going to work and school and having no social life. Parents are decently easy going, but can't have guys over unless we sit in the living room lol. Usually this just ends up with me spending most of the time at the guy's house, but this has gotten hard especially since the guy I'm seeing now lives with his parents. They allow me to be home late, but don't like it if I'm home at like 3. I feel like I could use the experience since I'm planning on moving to a new city when I'm out of school and maybe it would be better to see what it's like living by myself while I still have a close support system but also have a dream of traveling when I graduate so I really don't want to have to dip into my savings at all.

Pros: New experience, change of pace, possibly expanding my social life since the girl has a decent sized group of friends that I've meshed with well, Experience for living on my own in a new place later, more freedom in relationships

Cons: Money. Would like to have savings for traveling after college and security blanket, have $6,000.00 saved up now, but would likely have to dip into that some. Wouldn't have a lot of extra cash like I do now. Also, I suffer depression and anxiety and I'm not sure if that could be improved or get worse.

I ended up losing my virginity to this man and from there we dated for about a year and one month. I had invited him to come to my home and visit my parents and extended family and he, with no hesitation, agreed. We had a super great trip, had a fun car ride back, and then when we got back to his home(he lived at home still) we had loving sex. We said “I love you” as we always did.

Since then I've been laying low, for 2+ years now. I've focused on school and a social life and been rewarded handsomely yet I still crave the closeness and affection of an actual relationship. I'm not ""bad"" with girls, but I rarely get involved romantically with them because I guess I'm picky (and not ""oh too fat"" or ""big nose"" picky). Regardless I've always felt that the one thing holding me back is my virginity and I got trapped in a paradox of sorts. Can't lose my virginity unless I'm I'm a relationship, can't get into a relationship unless I lose my virginity. You see how dumb this seems, but to a confused kid it makes perfect sense. Recently I've downloaded some dating apps and have had fun flirting and such. Now I've encountered an impass. I have the opportunity to sleep with a girl I met on the app. She's 7 miles away and totally into it. She even sent nudes and I'm attracted to her. There's just one thing....

I don't want to just toss my v card like a coin in a well. I'm too old and too realistic to think like this but I want it to be special (ughh i know). Not fireworks on the beach, but like with someone special. I want it to be someone I love and who loves me. Someone I trust and someone I feel like will be around in my life a good amount of time. Some may say that it's okay to feel this way. But I've heard others says it's never really special the first time and the sooner you start, the better. I feel like I'm holding my self back from experiencing a whole spectrum of life and social interactions just because of this.

Basically I have until the end of this week to decide. I don't have anyone special in my life. I don't foresee anyone special arriving either. Am I torturing myself for no reason or is this a reasonable and even justified stance?

TL;DR: I'm a 20 yo male that missed his shot in HS. Now I have a shot again and I'm hesitant because I feel like I want someone special to take my v card. Should I say screw it of stick to my guns?

This guy just started about a month back and from the beginning I could tell he had some interest in me. He showed many of the signs that he is crushing on me including asking about where I am when I’m not around. He comes to my desk often to say hi. He smiles a lot at me and we laugh together frequently. He has confided in my coworker that he has a crush in the office with whom he is both attracted to and intimidated by.

He never replied to the group text so at one point I tried to get some insight by asking him via text if my friend was trying to set us up. He said right away he enjoys the single life and responded by outlining his side of the story. A day or so after my friend/coworker said he told her he had a crush on a specific person this time. She didn’t see him as genuine though and wondered if he was trying to feel out our friendship. The signs that were there before have since dwindled a bit.

So, my mother and I have always had a rocky relationship. She had me when she was 16 (I am female, now 29.) She hasn’t always been the best mother to be, but swears she hung the moon for my childhood. My “father” abused me, her and my brother my entire childhood and really emotionally scarred me. He busted my lip several times to the point that I have permanent scars inside of my cheeks. He also made me temporarily deaf in one ear for a few days, and left bruises on my wrists, arms and legs, requiring me to miss school. If I ever threatened to call CPS or report him, he threaten to “knock my teeth down my throat and make me choke on them.” Needless to say my biological father is a very abusive person, both mentally and physically. I recall a few times of him coming into my room when i was very young and rubbing his erection onto my leg. 

After my mother was tired of having the shit knocked out of her weekly, she got a divorce (only to date some scummy pervert she was working with.) He was a full blown alcoholic BUT he didn’t touch me or abuse me. As I grew older her husband started to try to control me (trying to take away a car I bought with my own money) so I withdrew from him, and moved out. I feel as if my mother has always picked men before her children. I also hold a very strong resentment towards my entire family for allowing this abuse to happen to me during my entire childhood. It really took a toll on my mental health and now I have to see a therapist bi weekly for the childhood trauma that I lived. 

I texted my mom and asked her if she would be interested in attending a joint therapy session (Id pay for it) in hopes that we could repatch our relationship. Her response was that she was a “fantastic mother!” And she doesn’t understand why she needs to sit in a room with a “quack” (??) to tell her she was a bad mother when she knows “she was a damn good mom.” I opened up about the sexual abuse I had and she said there is “no way that happened.” 

I blocked her. She disgusts me and I am done with her narcissist mentality. Since that happened I got engaged/she got evicted since she solely relies on her husband and had to move in with my narcissistic grandmother who taught her everything she knows (also the woman who raised me and claims to loves me but complains when I never call) and my 2 aunts and 2 uncles and little brother. 

Yes, my whole family lives in 3 houses on a huge property.  (My family is like a weird religious cult) I want to go out for a family dinner for my engagement but I don’t want my mother to attend. If i invite everyone but her my family will be snarky about it. What should I do?",29May2019,1

So every year the men in my family (cousins, grandpas, brothers, dads etc.) have a guys fishing trip that lasts for around 5 days. I have never been old enough to go to the guys fishing trip due to it being sort of an 18+ event. Now that I’m old enough, I’ve been invited finally. The problem is, to go on this trip, I’d have to miss 3 full days of work, which would mean that I’m losing around 350$ because of missed days.

210,"Hi guys, so I need some advice. Interested to get a male and female perspective on this and what first thoughts may be. I can't give away too many details here because I can't reveal who this is. However, my ex boyfriend has become legitimately famous. He is also on the path to becoming very famous. When I say ""legitimately"" and ""very"", it is absolutely the case. Our relationship wasn't healthy to say the least and I do have some residual baggage as we all do from relationships that aren't good for us. I bear no ill will because I want my life to be about moving forward in all aspects - challenging myself to live better, be better, achieve more, do more. I was also young and stayed in it for far too long, and there is no one to blame but myself for that. I also made my own mistakes. I knew he would become massively successful when I broke up with him, but I did not imagine to this scale. Aside from being beyond surreal, it's honestly a bit scary. I've lost sleep over this feeling literally scared. I never bring him up with people in conversation, or speak ill of him, because I just want to MOVE FORWARD. But people who know I dated him bring him up to me. I just politely redirect the conversation to another topic when someone brings it up. I recently had someone remark to me essentially saying ""can you imagine how different {better} your life would be"" if you were still with him today? (we were together for awhile). I didn't respond to the comment, I just politely changed the topic. I feel like I can't get away from this, because he is in the media, literally I have had to excuse myself to ""use the restroom"" because he happens to come on television and I don't care to watch it. Normal people can forget about their ex because they don't have constant reminders everywhere. I want to focus on myself and my own achievement and my own success, without being constantly reminded of all that ex has become and is going to be. I'm feeling real, true blockage from it. It IS true that I don't have ill will, I just want to move forward and live my own life and my own path and find my own success. **Any advice aside from speaking to a professional? What can I do to focus on myself and my own growth?**",29May2019,1
211,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

There is this person who is on a different team but I work with them very closely. She has been with the company for 8 months now but she still has no idea on how to do her job. I can't speak for her but literally, she has one thing to do and that is to gather digital assets based on the campaign details. In the very beginning, someone on my team spent an hour training her and answering her questions afterward. She was still making a lot of mistakes, the same one over and over. 6 months in and she is still asking the same questions and making the same errors. I decided to do another training with examples. Worked hard on the training and the presentation for her. She had no question and was so happy that I did that. I had hope. She was doing well for a month. NOW, she has gotten worse. I continue to double check her work and answers all of her questions. (She can find all the answers to all of her questions in my presentation. ) To be honest, I don't know what else to do. A lot of people on my team had trained her as well. We shouldn't be the ones since she is on a different team. If you are wondering what about her manager, let's not go there. That is another problem!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem I have with her is her attitude. She gets super defensive and fights back. I try to tell her in a nice way that the assets she handed off is incorrect and she yelled ""Well I don't know what you want me to do?"" She would not do her job properly and just tell me that I should go and ask so and so. Basically, she wants me to do her job for her, double check her work, and tell her she is doing a GOOD JOB. When you ask her anything about anything, she has no clue about it.  I've talked to my manager and my manager is more frustrated than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't want it to show that she is getting to me or sounds unprofessional. I have to work with this person every day so I don't want to have a bad relationship with this person. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with her or get her to understand her responsibility? Or books on how to deal with this kind of co-worker?

But I can’t help that notice that all the girls on there look nothing like me. They are perfectly skinny, huge tits and what not and now has me feeling extremely down.

213,"So I'm 19[m] and recently got broken up with after 3 extremely loyal/committed years. Long story short she got a job long distance without asking me my opinion, almost ensuring we would never see each other all summer. Then she breaks the news and I panic, shitting bricks I do what I always do in a break up and spasm my keyboard with pity pleas and apologies. Then I text her DAD and apologize for ""my behavior"" and just utterly humiliate my self to a 60yo man. We discussed marriage and having kids, we took each others virginity. We also promised not to ever lie to each other and I like to think we both took that seriously, except how would you know? Day after the breakup she posts on her snapchat laying on some guy peck kissing him on the lips. 
Now I'm assuming she was fed up with my temper and, after a long fight I uttered the words ""I don't love you anymore"", and before I could take the words back my fate was sealed. 
I know I'm not being cheated on, I made a mistake and I'm living the consequences but how can someone throw away 3 years in one day? 

And on that note, how sickeningly, depressingly unfair is it to line up a back up relationship without giving the other end any warning? 

Now I'm sprinting through tinder desperately trying to find someone to release my oxytocin that ive been building up a tolerance to for 3 years of cuddling and adoration. 
My question, finally (apologies) is: 
How do I get over such a long and meaningful relationship quickly and/or how do I find someone who wants to settle down right away? I'm not the type to date for fun but that seems to be the purpose of dating apps/sites like tinder.

219,"I'm 25 years old. For the past few years, I've been a bartender. I don't hate my job, but I don't love it, and I understand the lack of upward mobility that comes with it.

I have plans for my future, but I often find myself apathetic while trying to reach for my goals. I justify bad habits (being nocturnal and minor drug use comes to mind) by deferring my problems to the future.

I moved down to Florida mostly to spend time with my best friend of 11 years. She lives down here with her boyfriend, she's down here because we both attempted to move to Florida from NY 3 years ago. I have family down here, and that was how we both came to be here. At the time, I was very low on money, so I moved back to NY to stay with my dad. I came back, I've been in Florida for a year. She stayed here and rode it out. She ended up fairly successful financially but devoid of much happiness in her own life. She has a boyfriend who we both think is a great guy, and 2 dogs, and basically that's her family. She has the skill I wish I had, putting yourself through hard times in order to make the best of the future..... I've always been more of a ""instant gratification and hedonism"" type of person. 

I fucking hate that about myself. And I'm about 99% sure she hates me, but is just too nice to tell me, she's sparing my feelings. Why do I feel that way? Well, your best friend is supposed to be a part of your life, and I feel very much like an option. I'm very upset about this, quite often. She doesn't confide in me at all like she used to. This feeling hurts so fucking bad. Why have I not grown up in the ways of self discipline the same way she has? This leads to a feedback loop of self resentment in me. Back in NY, I wasn't progressing much in life, but at least I could do things. Life was interesting.

I moved down into my grandparents house with my mother who was taking care of them. Then a month ago, my grandpa died, leaving my mother to take care of her mother, who is essentially a 4 year old mentally, after terrible health problems and strokes. My mom has put her life on hold for this woman, and my mom's health sucks too. She's had multiple heart attacks, and living a lifestyle where you care for somebody in that way doesn't look too bright for her future health. I want to help more but I work full time and when I'm not at work, I'm either sleeping, or wasting time on the internet learning about tech related shit. I want to be a filmmaker, but I feel like a fucking zombie, all technical skills and no creativity.

When I lived a more hedonistic lifestyle, I was funny and interesting, I had life experiences that fucking related to cool stories to tell people. 

I don't know what to do next. My best friend is distancing herself from me, my mom's health worries me, I'm a procrastinator. My friends back in NY encourage me to come back,but I view that as taking a step backwards in life. I make good money, I guess that's a positive. As someone whose had a full pocket and someone whose been so broke they couldn't pay bills, I can say, money doesn't buy happiness. I know, boo fucking hoo, first world problems. But I would trade every fucking penny I have just to be happy. 

My aunt comes and goes to my house here in Florida. She's a seriously awful fucking person, she hates most of her own family, and she's only interested in money. Once my grandpa died she swooped down like a vulture to try and get everything she could. She read my grandpa's will before he even died, and asked him to change it. It got so bad that me and my mom would only drink bottled water, because we were afraid she was trying to kill us. We put a padlock on our little refrigerator, out of fear of being poisoned. This is no way to live, it's unnecessary stress, and it's aged me and my mother greatly.

I don't know. I just do not know what to do and where to go. If you've read all this, thank you. I appreciate you. even if you don't have any advice for me, I hope somebody reads this and understands. I'm crying out for help to an endless void that is the world, and the world seems like a cold and dark place to me.",29May2019,1

Hey guys, this is a very delicate subject and a bit intense, so I have to put a TW/CW for: R\*pe, kidnapping, and assault.

My young adult bible study meets every Monday night in the home of my ""home church""'s youth pastor and his wife. We've become a very tight knit group over the last year or so, and most of us are young women. We usually get out around 10-11 pm. There's no street lamps in this area.

Recently, one of our girls has brought her new beau and his friend. Unfortunately, there is a pending case against the friend. He allegedly raped a woman on a local college campus, and beat her so severely, she couldn't hear, and he possibly broke her jaw. He was found fleeing the scene within five minutes and identified. She did not even know his name, only that he assaulted her on campus grounds outside. The scene was quite brutal. He is out on $75,000 bond and must wear an ankle monitor at all times. He is facing 5 counts of sexual assault, including felony rape and felonious assault, and 2 counts of kidnapping.

I and another gal are quite uncomfortable with his presence at our study, as he continues to lie about it to his friend and his friend's girlfriend. He is not remorseful of his actions. Not to mention the violent brutality of the situation. With young children in the home and many young women who live alone, we are unsettled with the thought of him being there. The Pastor and his wife are unaware of the situation, and we'd like to bring it to them tomorrow. How do we broach/word this conversation? I know God commands us to love everyone, but surely we aren't meant to let wolves roam the herd of sheep??",29May2019,1

Anytime I try to open up or he asks me how I am, he just walks away/is doing a million other things, and then acts like he isnt even listening. He also sometimes argues with me if I start venting, so really this is not a good person to be around.

I'm not sure whether I should just ask for space, or try to explain that how he acts hurts me. I dont know how it will be received, and I dont know if I can currently take a bad reaction.

231,"So, about seven years ago I had this best friend/crush, we were super close until for some reason (one which I can’t remember) we stopped talking.
For the six following years I knew nothing about him, didn’t have his number or any social media account of his but I thought about him from time to time...
A month ago he reached out to me via Instagram, we got to talking, we hit it off and exchanged numbers once again after years.
We talked via text message and we began flirting and even made plans to go out that weekend, a couple of days after I lost all my contacts in my phone, I thought about asking him for his number again, but I assumed I could save it when he texted me again, but it’s been a month and I haven’t heard from him and I don’t understand why won’t he text me.
I don’t need advice per say, but I’d like for someone to help me understand what I could have done wrong.

Disclaimer: I’m not one of those girls that thinks only the guy should text the girl first, i have texted him to initiate conversations before, but after a couple of weeks of not hearing from him right after he said things about wanting a serious relationship with me made me wonder why say those thing if you don’t mean them or what did I do that made him all of the sudden disinterested in me.

232,"Okay so my family and I moved to California in hopes of a better life but we hit some bumps in the road like not enough money and my parents are most likely getting separated. Now my mom is gonna take my sister and I and move back to where we had lived originally, don’t get me wrong it’s great there. It’s my hometown, I was raised there and lived there for 12 years. But thinking about going back just has me thinking about everything that would happen; I kind of “ghosted” everyone from over there including my childhood friends so I have no idea how I’ll adjust. Granted I still have friends from there I play video games with, but I just have no idea how Ill adjust. Everything seems so hard right now and I don’t know if I can make it through this and still be emotionally stable. People will probably ask a ton of questions, I’ll probably feel really lonely, I just don’t know if I can handle this. What can I do to stop this overwhelming stress?

238,"Okay reddit community, I need your advice! So I've been friends with my ""bestfriend"" for about 12 years now. She doesn't bring much to our friendship and probably only keeps me around because I'm beneficial. Over the last two years I've attempted to drop her to no avail; we have a lot of mutual friends.
I'm 23, she's 24, absolutely clueless in life, and has been with her boyfriend for 6 years now. So she's been cheating on him for about a year or two. One of the guys she's cheated on him with was a former coworker of ours (guy 2) and his girlfriend (girl 2) is an acquaintance of ours. This time she caught chlamydia from guy 2, before we went on our trip to DR. Her boyfriend isn't the smartest apple so he didn't question why he would need to take antibiotics. She couldn't take the antibiotics before the trip because you're supposed to abstain from sex for 7 days, and that would've raised red flags (talk about knowingly putting chlamydia in your mouth). Anyways, when she first told me. I told her she needs to stay away from guy 2 and she agreed. Well she ended up hanging out with all of them afterwards and I got pissed. Girl 2 is such a sweetheart and so smart, she doesn't deserve this. My ""bestfriend"" still decides to go to his house for a bbq with everybody. She still plans on marrying her boyfriend btw. So I sent her a text about how disgusted I am by this. I know I'm not her boyfriend, but it's her lack of morals that makes me not want to be her friend (along with some other things). How can she take her boyfriend to the guys house she's cheating on him with? That gave you an STD, then gave your boyfriend an STD. How can you hangout with girl 2 damn well knowing you're sleeping with her man's, and she probably has an STD that God knows how long until she finds out. How can you be that trifling? There's really no justifiable reason. She also never intended to stop hanging out with them because she enjoys their company, and she was by her man's side all night. I know it's not my relationship, but I am appalled. Seriously, I am so disgusted at that. I don't want to keep people like that around me. Am I wrong? Do I really need to give her a chance to justify herself?",29May2019,1

241,"hi guys, throwaway account since i dont really want ppl to know whats going on with my family

anyways, like the title says, i have currently been at wits end with my dad. as i get older, my dad and i have been arguing and not talking for each other quite often. i'll put a tldr where you can just skip to the part where i need actual advice, but i'm just gonna warn you that this post is pretty long.

BACKGROUND:

to give some background into my family, my dad was actually a stroke survivor. he had his first stroke at around july 2014, and i was only maybe 13-14 at the time when it paralyzed his left side of his body. he ended up working really hard to get back on his feet and start working again since my brother (3 years younger) and i were still so young, he was our main source of income, and the fact he was so young when he had his stroke (he was about 50ish). he was so scared he wouldnt be able to take care of the family and wouldnt be able to see us grow up, so he did his best to turn his lifestyle around. take into account that he doesn't drink or smoke; he was a responsible father figure but just refused to visit the doctor to check up on his body. he has been in accidents and has had to undergo a lot of major surgery, but he always thought he didnt need to go to the doctor or anything:/

i'd say 1 month after he was first admitted into the hospital, he ended up going to rehab to help recuperate the left side of his body, and only stayed 1 month before going straight back to work (only starting with 3 hours and slowly getting back to 8 hours, which is full time) i am very proud of him, and i did my very best to support my mom, dad, and my brother during this time by helping them around the house, watching my dad to make sure he didnt fall while he was still getting used to walking by himself, and just listening to my mom and brother vent when they were frustrated about the situation we were in. i found that telling other people about my thoughts and issues were kinda pointless, as i found that a lot of people could only offer pity, which i grew to dislike as it didnt change the situation at all.

i grew up and learned to accept that he will not go back to the way he was, as his left arm and hand can't really move. he can still walk, drive, and has everything sorta set in place mental. i say sorta because i noticed after a while how his thoughts and attitude changed. he began to become quite paranoid and insecure about himself. if anyone were to mention things that triggered his insecurities and paranoia, he ends up making us feel as though we are ungrateful for everything he has done. one big event that likely triggered his second stroke was when my mom became friends with my brother's friend's dad. there was seriously nothing going on between the two of them, they just had a good friendship because both my brother and his friend were in the same basketball club. i think my dad was unhappy to see my mom in a friendship with a man who is physically (in comparison to my dad), mentally (very confident in himself), financially (this guy was loaded as he had a lot of businesses) better than him. i get it, he feels insecure after having the stroke and feels like this guy could seriously threaten their marriage and family balance, but his jealousy and anger just tortured the entire family as we kept persisting that NOTHING was going on. he tends to think a lot, so i guess his thoughts kept warping innocent interactions between the two of them to be possibly cheating?

i think the first major confrontation i had against my dad was around that time. him and my mom were in a room yelling and arguing about the guy, and i had had enough. i came in and told him nothing would going on and asked him to stop firmly. he looked me in the eye and told me to get on my knees and apologize as i was being disrespectful for going against him. i refused to kneel and apologize since i felt he was disrespecting my mom. i kept staring in his eyes angrily, while my mom was on her knees, crying and begging me to do what he wants. i will never forget that moment as he looked at me with no remorse, looking at me as though i did him wrong. i kneeled since my mom was begging so hard, but i was seriously prepared to take a hit from him. he angrily talked about how he took care of me for so many years, to have been disrespect him. he talked about how he didnt want me as a child, and how he would rather die at that moment than to look at me. i freaked out, because i didnt expect him to say that kind of thing to me, and just kneeled with my head on the ground, apologizing. this occurred around two years after his first stroke.

after that, within the same month, my dad had his second stroke. my mom caught it on time when she started to see some signs and prevented the right side of his body from being paralyzed. he cooled down after that, but it didnt really help the relationship between the two of us. he still brings it up here and now when he wants to really get his point across. i still feel wronged, but i havent even gotten to where we are now. the guy moved away so we dont have to deal with seeing him again.

fast forward to this year, i'm in university now (first year baby woooo). over the years, i just learned to forgive him and move on, for the sake of a healthy family dynamic. i just swallow the feelings of frustration and anger when he acts up, and act as though nothing happened. it has worked for the most part, as he also just moves on. i know, it isnt really healthy as we arent addressing problems between the two of us, but he is so goddamn stubborn. i love him, but he NEVER admits to being wrong or ever apologizes for anything. i'd rather just let it go and not think about it, and it seems he prefers that too. our relationship was slowly healing, as i tend to interact with him as a positive and happy daughter. i never really tell him my feelings as i found he doesnt really care/doesnt validate them. my family doesnt really know that i have these thoughts, and this is the first time i could vent so sorry it is a long read haha.

anyways, getting to where we are atm, i find that that persona of being so happy and positive has been what my family expects of me. i am expected to be happy, and when im not, it is probably me being dramatic and ruining the family mood. like i said before, swallowing all my thoughts and feelings has been something i have been doing for a while, so i have gotten used to it. but there are times when i feel so alone with my thoughts and emotions. i cant tell my family for obvious reasons. i cant tell my friends as i hate getting other people involved, and i really dont want others to look down on my family. the situation is so complicated as there are so many other factors involved that make explaining things on here so hard. 

holy shit this is long. i havent even gotten to the main problem lololol

**tldr atm; dad had a stroke and now his thoughts are eating at him as he is paranoid about his security within and outside of the family. i have no where to vent my anonymously online. our relationship has never really been great, but i just try to glue back our relationship one bit at a time.** 

**!!!!!!!SKIP HERE TO READ WHAT THE SITUATION I NEED ADVICE FOR IS!!!!!!! thanks hehe**

if you are still reading, thanks, i really appreciate it. i'll try to make this part concise. so part of the reason why im venting is because of the expectations around me by my family. having always portrayed to be happy, go-lucky, and clumsy, im pretty much subjected to teasing. yeah they dont really think much about me, always saying how useless i am in the family. despite their teasing, they still hold high expectations for me to reach. despite not being perfect in the family, you are expected to be perfect in public. they hate it when i cant do 'simple things', telling me a lot of things are 'common sense'. i mean yes, it is common sense to you but it isnt to me since this is my first time dealing with those situations?? yeah im pretty stupid but like can you give me some credit for the things i figured out on my own or through my mistakes... 

so this all relates because i am job hunting. yeah i cant believe we got here. i am working on being more independent and pushing myself to discover and grab all the opportunities i can get, such as jobs. for a while, yes my parents were pushing me to find a job after my fall and winter terms were over. i listened and found a retail job towards the end of my winter term. i wasnt planning on taking any courses over spring or summer since i wanted to focus on finding a job and volunteering. i'm having fun at my one job, and volunteering has been pretty chill, but now they are asking me to find another job. i mean okay, more experience and yes more money but i'm feel comfortable with the one job i have at the moment. yes, i know some people work two or three jobs to be able to take care of their families and such, but i still want to enjoy my break too:/ i was still applying yes, but not as crazily as i was for the first job. 

well, my dad wasnt entirely happy since he doesnt want me to work in a retail setting, but rather in an entry level bank setting. i get why, but like i said... i'm pretty happy with what i'm doing at the moment since it is temporary until school starts again. i feel like an ungrateful piece of shit because i know he wants the best for me, but he took this as an opportunity to act upon me again. this time, i just fucking gave up. i seriously dont want to give in to him anymore, since his personality is like that of a spoiled teenager who has always gotten things his way. he doesnt even acknowledge how i got the job through applying to a shit ton of places myself.  he just says that all those accomplishments were because he pushed me to get a job. he isnt wrong but can i just get some praise for achieving something by myself. even when i told him how my manager praised me for being hard working, he made it seem like no big deal when it kinda is for me? i'm used to it since i'm the stupid one in the family but even stupid people have feelings too. 

the incident got to a point where we dont even talk to each other anymore. i dont really harbor any hate towards him atm, but idk if he still is mad at me? we dont even interact with each other (we avoid having to do anything for each other), as if the one who reaches out first will be the loser. yeah i'm being childish but for so many years, i have had to yield for him to 'win' just for the sake of the family. 

what should i do? should i just apologize for being an ungrateful piece of shit and move on again? i mean, i'm still applying even though i dont want to, so i dont really see why i should be apologizing:/ arguing with him is not an option, unless i want to start a war that tortures the other members of the family as well. i could be the bigger man, but i have been for years and he literally abuses that fact so often. i'm tired of it. my mom and brother have been sucking it up in a lot of unfair situations too, and also end up complaining to me about it. but when i point out why he acts that way, they basically tell me that i will have to continue sucking it up to him for the rest of our lives together if i want to keep family peace. he clearly loves them a lot better than me since he doesnt get into major conflicts with them that often so idk what to do. 

thank you so much for reading, i seriously feel like a big weight has been lifted off my chest. man i shouldve vented and asked for advice earlier.",29May2019,1

245,"So there’s this guy. I don’t know how old he is but I assume he is 23-25 years old. All I know is that he’s one of the younger guys in my bible group! I am fairly young 19! It is common with most of our communities for this age gap even when we’re this young so I’m not asking if he’s too old! 

I’m going to name him Yenril (after my cat since he’s laying on me lol) so Yenril and I have known each other for about two months! He did peak my interest when I first met him because he is cute in a low key way! He’s not the type I would typically go for. Recently Yenril and I exchanged numbers and we chat briefly through text! Especially on the weekends since we’re able to stay up later! I tend to send memes since I do that with everyone but he actually likes to talk so it’s a weird balance. The one text that comes back to my mind every time is: 

Sweet. You should go back to Okinawa. I could try to get a job there someday with my work. 

I keep thinking about this and I’m wondering if he has a crush on me. Every sign says he does. But I just want the reassurance. 


Some bonus info:

- we make a lot of eye contact and it seems we can read each other minds, last week a guy pissed me off and Yenril was able to tell very quickly that I need a distraction or I was going to go ballistic. Our mutual friend had a sit down with the guy who pissed me off while Yenril told me the right stories to make me happy

- He sends me every spider he sees because I really like them. He shows me other animals that I’m interested in! 

- We have the same ideals and thoughts and goals in life. We want to settle down but go on mission trips. We have the same passions for a lot of things

- he does single me out of all the other girls in group (I didn’t even consider that he may have a crush on me until a friend pointed out she didn’t have Yenrils number) he is very quick to say hi to me first. 

- He’s also very quick to reassure me that I did nothing wrong and that he was just tired therefore he didn’t respond.


My only concerns are that I am young. I do not want to ruin something that can be great. I also would like to get my career going first (real estate agent) I do like him and he is a very Godly man. He seems like a perfect match for me since he is very serious whilst being a goof ball. 

To make it clear: I’m just wondering if this guy has a crush on me (pretty sure he does) and I guess I’m also curious on how to proceed on with him!

246,"Hello Reddit not sure if this is the right place to post this. 

Not sure where to begin but I am being pulled apart.

I am going to give point form and hopefully I can get an advice. 

1. Thee problem is about my parents.
2. I am 22 years old male with 4 sisters and a brother. 
4. Problems between parent been happening since I can recall. 
5. I never knew how bad this can affect me and my siblings until I left for university. 

6. During university time met a female madly fell in love with her but lost her due to fact I miss treated her. Nothing bad just never appreciated her feelings but honest to god I never knew I was doing things the wrong way till she said “hey I don’t feel anything for you anymore” this destroyed me and coming from a harsh culture where  as a man you must be a “solid rock with zero emotion” so I stayed away and lived my life daily, day dreaming daily to talk to her again even tho I see her everyday in every class she just left me with no closure didn’t let me say a single word. 

It took me two years of crying, severe depression,
failed every class in university which led to receive a letter of withdrawal from university but blessing from god and help from my department I was given one last chance. I took it to heart and worked my ass off fixing my academic standing as well educated my self to better understand life and how to treat others. I barely made it back into university which was my life! 

 I sacrificed family, my previous friends, moved to a new province and  went into dept of 50000 $ right now and I still have 2 more years. 

7. I have decided to re-evaluate my character as well my perspective on life sat there day and night reading and asking around and found out I was just like my father don’t get me wrong he was a great father but he never knew how to express his feeling or communicate with anyone-he lost everyone around him slowly just cause of his words and they way he talked to people. 
So I started to change my own bad habits and became more careful of what I’d say and how I express it.  I still have a lot of flaws but I am working on it. 

8.   Just as I finally fixed my life and the only problem left is that I owe school 3000$ forwarded balance from last year because some reason this year OSAP didn’t pay the full amount.
-This amount has to be payed by  August- or else not allowed to register for next year. 

9. I was forced to beg my parents to help me with the outstanding fees and I got nothing from them to the point I had to leave my apartment because I can’t afford rent anymore even tho I found a minimum wage job I would still be short of money to pay my outstanding fees. 

So I was forced to go back to my parent house which is the most toxic environment ever, put everything from abuse to verbal harassment between my parent, you would have seen it in our house. This environment forced my younger deaf brother to rage and leave the house and not to come back not even for a visit. 

anyway so I’ve returned in hope to at least live with my  parent till I make enough money to pay my fees and leave them to there problems; we tried everything to fix it. They are  stubborn
father lives in a past and is always suspicious about everything and mother is delusional who is manipulative and selfish. 

I am not trying to say they did nothing for us or degrade them, they are my parent and I still love them but since we grew they suddenly forgot the responsibility they have as parents we got zero support!!  nothing!! wether it was  financially or emotionally or anything like not even my younger sisters they never had a single birthday party not a single gift, nothing not even make up! In the same time they expect us to do live up to there expectations. And to support them. 

10. So that being said I found a job near the house just yesterday. My first day 2 hours into my shift I get a call that  cops are at our house and father is arrested and mother is going crazy so I had to
Leave my job and now I have to cancel this week which is my first week of work to stay home by mother and wait to see what’s going to happen to my dad. 

Now I am completely shattered  not knowing how to pay that 3000 after forced to quit so I can deal with court and the cops.

 To choosing which side I’ll support between my selfish manipulative mother or by my old school father who is not willing to adapt to the new life and environment around him. 

I don’t want to hurt any of them by picking a side 
But same time my father scarified way to much for me before this mental breakdown. And my mother well she’s still my mother I can not just throw her in the street she has no one! her own siblings and parents rejected her. 
 
Same time I can’t support my self financially my only hope is my degree I have nothing else it’s all I got. 



As you can tell idk how to even type this or express it I’m just lost I hope you can connect the dots. I am sorry for my English it is not my first language.",29May2019,1
247,"Both my best friend and my sister know about my other account so this is a throwaway. 

I'm an 18 year old guy and I have a twin sister. I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life

Anyway, my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna stop being friends with him over it. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? I'm closer to him than I am my sister anyway, and we're going to the same college in the fall (a different college than my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna matter when we're living in different places

B is an absolute piece of shit that has cheated on most, if not ALL his girlfriends with N. N really wants to make it work and settle down with him but B doesn't want to love her and basically uses her for sex and stuff since she's always there for him.

251,"Alright so I know this is gonna be a long post. My mother has been an alcoholic and a compulsive pathological liar for as long as I can remember. As a child this was extremely damaging and as a young adult this influenced me to make a lot of rash decisions that ended with my step father (who took custody after my mother had reached a new level of horrible) kicking me out of his house after constant behavioral issues and dropping out of highschool. Now I've always had a similar issue as my mother. (Never been an alcoholic) I've been a severe pathological liar for a long time. My high school memories are full of stupid stories about being anything from a hitman to a drug lord. Keeping friends wasn't easy and around that time I hadn't really come to terms with lying being a bad thing. It was almost like an outlet. I also didn't realize that my mother was lying to any extent because it just was easier to believe her that she was getting sober/better and that some day I would be able to move back in with her. Back to my post drop out low points. My step dad kicked me out due to the lies and being an all around brat. I got a job at best buy and discovered that sales was particularly easy for me and I thrived in the environment mainly due to my ability to smile at a customer while feeding them as much BS as I could. Soon after getting hired I realized I'd make a lot more money in a commission based structure. So I called a friend who was a manager at Verizon and he not only got me a job, he also let me move in with him and off the streets and for the first time in my life. I stopped lying to friends and family I even finally built a relationship with a girl I've never lied too. My customers however... Really get the bad end of it all. Every customer hears about how much I love my tablets, smart watches, and other gizmos. I don't just talk to talk tho for them as I have a financial incentive to sell them these products. But it gets worse. I fall into the typical ""oh that can't be fixed, just upgrade your phone"" on almost every tech question. My customers actually love me and I get a lot of referalls from them, but sadly I feel like I'm just taking advantage of older people who don't understand technology at all. I've smiled at so many customers while raising their bills astronomical amounts and ""disclosing"" everything and by that I mean just using big words and talking really fast so they don't realize EXACTLY how much their monthly will be raised. This started to bleed into other parts of my life and the lying returned to my friends and family. Even the man who took me off the streets. I began to become very very very bad with my money, purchasing things that I just never needed because I wanted them. Telling my roommate that I didn't have rent because some reason or another. Inevitably he had to throw me out and it felt terrible. I crashed my new car not long after while texting and driving and now endure a 5 mile walk too and from my Verizon store, not long after I got kicked out I started to see how wrong what I am doing is. After bouncing from a few houses and seeing some really bad things from roommates. I finally found myself back on my mother's doorstep. My mom told me I could stay with her while she was living with her best friend. Not 2 days after this she got kicked out for drinking. And it was finally then that her best friend explained to me the extent of my mother's lies. I was under the impression that my mom was sober, doing good, etc. It hurt and it shocked me more than anything to learn just how deep her lies went. And more then anything it hurt to realize that I am just like her... now I'm living in a strange place with my mom's friend I've never really known, working at a job that makes me feel like I'm a bad person, and have burned almost every connection I had through friends and family due to a heavy past of lying and all around not being a nice guy. I have my goals (Get into the movie making industry, stop lying, give my girlfriend the white picket fence lifestyle she deserves, and be a better person) but have absolutely no way to get there in this seemingly bottomless pit. What should I do next? I have almost no money, I'm starting from scratch. Walking too and from work, my girlfriend now lives over 2000 miles away most of the year for school and I feel that I'm nothing more than a lying highschool drop out who got exactly what he deserved... What do I do next???",29May2019,1
252,"Hey Reddit, possible long post alert. So i'm a 20-year-old (F) college student, if that makes any difference. I'm currently on financial aid where I work 15 hours a week to help pay off my tuition. I'm stationed at an office in the school's library where I used to work with another student and a school employee. This semester, the old school employee was fired and another brought in so it's been about a month of us working together.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I am quite certain the school employee, let's call her Marge, stole my wallet out of my backpack. Before coming in to work, I'd stopped by the clinic with a friend to buy a painkiller so I had my wallet with me. Entered the office. Worked about 30 minutes before leaving to follow up an issue in the finance office. I was gone for about 20 minutes with Marge being the only person alone with my backpack in the office. Came back, finished up, and left campus with my boyfriend who paid my fare for the first half of the commute which means I didn't notice my purse was gone until I was on a bus leaving the city center, stranded with no money.

&amp;#x200B;

I already ruled out the possibility that I was pick-pocketed as our city center is notorious for that and everyone walks with their valuables clutched tightly to their fronts. I also called my boss, who is the first one in, to check if i left it around my work station and he confirmed that I didn't.  It's quite a blow losing my wallet, as it contained my government issued national ID. It also had about 20 bucks which is a lot of money to me, personally. 

Should I confront Marge? Attempt to intimidate her into giving it back? Report it to my boss/the school? I've never been in such a situation and it would mean a lot to get my wallet back.   


Any advice would be much appreciated.",29May2019,1
253,"they’re going off to college in the fall and i’m staying in our hometown to go to community and be close to my parents. they have a lot of emotional issues they repress. we’re both mentally ill but i take continuous steps to better myself. i seek out therapy, i exercise, watch what i eat, journal, try new things, and improve myself. they tend to self destruct and drink or take pills to medicate when their brain upsets them. we’ve only really dated a month but we’ve started saying “i love you.” 

i do love them. but i feel responsible in some way for how they choose to conduct themselves and it makes me frustrated and sad for them, and with myself for not being better for them. for the last 5 days i’ve stayed up late agonizing over how they treat themselves and how sad it makes me feel. i don’t know if i want to be intimate with them at any point in the near future. 

how long should i feel this way before i break things off? how should i say anything? should i just stick it out till august and break up with them? have i explained enough or would specifics be helpful?

any advice is appreciated, this is one of my first times having to actually break up with someone. i want to be as nice and respectful and considerate as possible to them. i love them, but we’re on two different paths and i don’t like how i feel around them when i see them repress trauma or self destruct or say negative things about themselves.

254,"My husband and I have until tomorrow morning to make one of the biggest decisions of our lives.

My husband has been applying to positions in his field closer to where his parents live (his field pays more than mine). We have a 6-month-old daughter and we have discussed how it would be nice to be near family. We reside in Northern VA right now. I went to college in DC, and he ended up in the area after getting his first job after college. We met in 2010, and married in 2016. I suppose we both really stayed in the area because of each other and our jobs. Neither of us has family close by, and my parents actually live overseas. We don’t have many friends left out here either.

Originally we thought we would like to move to FL because his parents just bought a second house there, but he has also been applying to positions in the Midwest since his parents live in IA for part of the year. We had no real time line for the move. We thought if something comes up we will evaluate our options at that time.  Honestly, I thought we would have 3-4 more years before we got a serious offer. However, he just got an amazing offer in the Minneapolis-St.Paul area, and after some negotiations, we have to decide by tomorrow if we will take it.

Now we just bought our first house here back in June of last year, and our daughter is only 6 months old. I would have to quit my job and look for another one. We are comfortable here. 

The pros of the move long term would be that we have his parents within a four hour drive. I never had the opportunity to grow up with extended family, and I want that for my daughter. My husband also has close friends in MSP that would help us get familiar with the area. We could also have more of a social life there (we don’t really have one in VA). The public schools are also exceptional there and there is a relatively lower cost of living compared to Northern VA. It is so expensive out here and it feels like we are always living paycheck to paycheck. Did I mention the traffic would be so much better (traffic is horrible in the DMV region).

I don’t know what to do. I’m not worried that our house will sell - it will. Im nervous we may not get as much as we paid for it. I’m worried about finding another job myself (I work in higher education administration). I don’t know how long it will take me to find something. I’ve never even been to MSP! The winters will be brutal. Although, I know I can deal with them because I’ve lived in Maine before. We would also have to find a new veterinarian, pediatrician, dentist, etc. Lastly, we would have to live in an apartment for 1-2 years to get to know the area and bounce back financially from relocating and the months I may not be working. I hate the thought of leaving the comfort of our first home to go back to a rental unit - it makes me feel like we are going backwards. 

It feels like my concerns are all short-term, and the pros would be long-term, but I honestly can not make up my mind. I’m conflicted. Any advice?",29May2019,2
255,"So me (f/29/bi) and my friends are all very open with each other. Our group is an even mix of men and women, all been friends since college age - about 15/20 of us. Many of us are couples too, and we all love to talk shit and party and play drinking games when we need to blow off steam.

Me and my partner (m/31/straight) are both part of the same group, and many times friends (some of whom have also been roommates at different stages) have commented on our ‘kinkiness’. To them, this just means that we’re loud/ often sneak off at parties to have sex/have no problem talking about sexy stuff. All pretty standard.

But a couple years ago some friends got it into their heads that were in an open relationship, or that were swingers. We both laughed it off, denying it (cause it wasn’t true).

But the thing is, recently we HAVE started experimenting with other people, alone and together. 

And now I’m wondering if it’s my responsibility to tell them the truth if they ask about it again? Some of them are a bit prudish and have fixed ideas about monogamy, so I feel like if they knew the truth their minds might be a bit more open to what’s out there. Also I hate lies.

My bf isn’t thrilled about people in our circle finding out. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t think it’s fair to keep a part of me secret from them, but I’m also worried it will further impact our ‘kinky’ status, and not in a good way. 

TLDR: my friend group already thinks me and my bf are a bit on the kinky side, but we denied being open/swingers. This has changed now, should I tell them the truth?",29May2019,1

So for background, my parents divorced and my dad remarried a long time ago, then he died. Before he died, he had a life insurance policy for me, but he let it lapse and then put one in my stepmom’s name instead. She got quite a bit of money and didn’t give me any of it, and actually used some to pay for my stepsister’s education, I had to take out loans. My bio mom was mad because she thinks I should have gotten some of the money because it was my dad that died.

Now, before dad died, he and my stepmom purchased some land. Because he died, my name got put on the title/deed. My stepmom recently decided to sell the land because they weren’t doing anything with it and could use the money. She asked me to sign some paperwork saying I give permission to sell the property, and I did it, because I don’t care too much and I never spent money on the land, so I shouldn’t claim ownership, right? Now my bio mom is furious and saying that my stepmom is just fucking me over again and being greedy when I apparently have claim to some of the money from the sale of the property.

Am I being used/fucked over? Should I risk hurting my relationship with my stepmom/stepsister for the sake of getting some money?

265,"Hi everyone, 

This may be a really long-winded story so I apologize in advance.

So a couple months ago, I was laid off at work. Something I put and focused my entire life on was basically gone within weeks for me. In college, I was pursuing a major in early childhood development, but when I started my job in retail I started to shift focus. Stupid, I know.

What I thought was a little part-time job, became a career path for me and sooner than later I was moving up in the company. I graduated with my degree, and to my parents dismay, I did not pursue a career in it because I felt comfortable... Two promotions later, I was making a significant amount of money as an assistant in retail and I thought that life was going smoothly. But a few months ago, because of some budget cuts, the company had to make some cuts.

Those cuts happened to be in the management and because I was still “new” in my role at that current store, they did not offer me a position to stay. I left, and I’ve been job searching. And I put all my eggs in a basket for one company, but ended up not getting the job as I did not have enough experience...


I’m feeling really low? For someone who was doing really in her career path, suddenly I feel like a failure. I am so used to things going my way, I convinced my parents that my career was promising but it ended up not being as promising as I initially thought. I’m supposed to be the one my siblings look up to, but now I’m just stuck in a rut.. My parents would like me to go back to school, but I’m not sure what I want to do.. I initially wanted to work with kids, but I did not want to become a teacher (no offense, I love teachers but it was not the career path I wanted for myself). I feel zero passion, motivation, and just full on feel so pressured to make something of myself and to make my family proud. But as the days go on it feels harder and harder. I feel it taking a toll on my mental health and as the days go on, the more I just want to just stay in bed and cry.


TLDR: “Gave up” education and pursuing degree to focus on career path in retail, laid off after years of work and growth, now I’m stuck with zero motivation, passion, and no job.



Any redditors have any words of motivation or advice? Not specifically career search, but moreso just how you found your passion and how you found something you loved and made a career out of it? Or how I could talk to my traditional, strict, Asian parents?

He packed what he could in his car and moved in with his ex that he supposed is ""engaged"" to I don't know and I don't care.

But it's been so much drama, he took $500 from me, getting my power shut off behind my back. I'm done with him.


Anyway Sunday night I found out he went up to my work place asking the person I had sold the Xbox 360 to about the games we bought for it. Well I haven't gotten rid of the games yet and they've been sitting in the bottom of my closet. Well tonight I was pondering why he came up asking about games for a system he doesn't have.

So I open the bag sure enough there is Halo Reach, Gears of War 1,2,3, etc. I dig to the bottom and there is a little black box.....the ring he was going to prepose to me with....

Well the ring has been getting passed down for quite a few generations, it either goes to the oldest child or the first son. Well my bf got the ring from his parents when he was sure he wanted to be with me for life. There was also a real silver and diamond bracelet he got from his grandma for ""The girl he chose to spend the rest of his life with."" Side note: the ring is also real gold not sure of the diamond size, but its real I know that much...


Like Im freaking out because that's important stuff you know, but he hasn't asked me about it or anything, but Im sure that's the reason he wanted to know about the games. It hurts just looking at this stuff. Its beautiful and I know its important to the family. I don't know how to approach the family to give them back. I certainly don't want to see him or his gf.

Hi everyone,

So from the title you can see I'm a 21M virgin. I think this happened due to me being shy and not trying to find a girlfriend actively. Anyway, now I got through a change in my personality/mentality and started to approach and talk to new girls and even got on a date yesterday after some months. 

However, I have there is this fear inside me that at one point in a relationship we'll reach the moment where we have to have sex and I am so afraid of embarassing myself. 

Why's that? I had some unpleasant incidents in the past. Firstly with my ex, some years ago where I couldn't get an erection although everything was okay and I liked her a lot, also no emotions or stress involved that could cause this. Then with another girl last summer, the same thing. I tend to think it is because of years of jerking off which maybe changed the way my brain perceives sexual impulses or sort of. 

At this point I just think that the only options would be either to find a girl that would be ready to accept my problem and have patience with me and I hope that this way it would give me more confidence and the problem will get fixed by itself. But the probability for that is very low. 

Another thing to mention is also that I live on a campus and the majority of the girls I would meet are from the same university, so if I do some embarassing stuff with one of them in bed, most surely this thing will spread for other people to find out, which would not be pleasant for sure. 

So the way I thought to have my first sexual experience to just see how it goes and not be exposed if I fuck up somehow, is to maybe try to look for a girlfriend that has no common acquaintances and lives in another part of town. On Tinder I had little success. And going to a hooker is the last thing I want to do due to the health-related risk. 

Any advice for what to do in such situation will be appreciated, thanks in advance!

277,"4 years ago my then boyfriend and I broke up. We broke up because of lack of communication so there was no real blowout. Since then, my ex and I have both dated other people and he’s the only one of my exes I have remained friends with. We were actually good friends for 3 years before we started dating officially. Nowadays, we’re not as close as we once were but we’re still friends. 

My ex and I share a mutual friend who has stayed close friends with both of us. [Friend] recently told me that she was concerned for my ex and wanted to inform me as well. 

According to [friend] (who is very trustworthy), my ex has been acting very destructive with no end in sight. He’s been binge drinking alcohol for days in a row and gets blacked out almost daily. Goes to bars or parties, gets blacked out, and ends up hooking up with as many random strangers as he can and doesn’t remember it later. Besides the alcohol consumption, he’s also been taking illegal and prescription drugs frequently as well. He becomes so intoxicated he’ll start sobbing or get extremely angry and reportedly even fainted twice in his class. I was told he does have friends but was also told they’re mostly just friends to party with and not real solid friendships. 

I’m concerned for his behavior because these actions are not normal for him. I understand being in college and enjoying a fun night of partying but this isn’t just one night. This is almost daily for a few months now. His actions are destructive and can be dangerous if he keeps it up at the high rate he is at. As soon as [friend] told me this I immediately texted him to ask if he was doing ok and if things were alright in his life. He told me that yes, everything was great and proceeded to ask about me instead. I didn’t want to push it and drill him about his behavior but I am worried about him. 

How do I express my concern for him but not overstep his boundaries? Am I overreacting? Should I even bother doing anything at all? I also don’t want to come across that I’m trying to rekindle our relationship when I’m just plainly worried about my friend’s well being.",29May2019,1

The texts were meaningless in all truthfulness, it just felt good to have a positive interaction with a guy that wasn't negitive (most times I would see my partner he would be so angry or sad, and deep into depression and high on weed I didn't know what to do). More backstory this was also the time we tried to make the relationship more interesting by dating a girl together who ended up moving in. They got along well cus I was away alot at school and work. And when I was home I felt ignored and I couldn't say anything about it without sounding like a prude. I've spoken to a therapist about my interactions with one of the guys who was my cousin's 40yr boyfriend (double my age) and she thinks I was emotionally manipulated by him. After alot of emotional days we decided to stay together and work on us and fix where this went wrong intitially. This was going well for a month or so until we went on vacation and he had to detox from THC. He became so hurtful and mean about everything on our vacation. Bringing up the disgusting texts I sent every chance he got riled up and angry. he told me that he is so hurt and upset that he feels the urge to get payback while I'm studying abroad next month of he can't be high the whole time. The trip was mostly fun and awesome and healing until my friend messaged me she cheated and broke up w her bf. It triggered him into all this and now I'm laying in the hotel bed and he's locked in bathroom with some bedding. We have to drive home tmr 6 hours. I'm bawling, I'm hurt by what he keeps saying but I feel as if I deserve this treatment for hurting him like I did",29May2019,3
280,"My birthday is coming up pretty soon now, which is all fine and dandy, but I dont really want my friends to acknowledge it. I have been friends with them all my life, and we are all a tight group. And I'm afraid that they might throw a surprise party

It's just that recently as of this year, I have been feeling really guilty. Just thinking about all my friends putting all that effort towards me, and especially buying a gift for me puts me over the edge with guilt and it makes me feel like shit. I know I just cant handle their love right now, I just dont feel deserving of it. (Boo fuckin hoo I know)

282,"Hello, hope you’re doing well. 

I applied to and got accepted to a grad school program for mental health counseling that starts in August 2019. It seems to be a decent affordable program that would get me the credentials I need to become a counselor, which is one of the things I want to do eventually. I would be living in an expensive city though, and would need to have an internship (required for the program) and a part-time job simultaneously. The tuition and housing are covered for the first year, though.

I realized that I also want to put more time into hobbies (dancing, kayaking, writing) and working on my own mental health. I keep dreaming of writing a book. I’m unsure how I would handle all the grad school responsibilities and take care of myself at the same time though, which makes me nervous.

A bit of background info: I was placed in a psychiatric hospital three times last year and went to rehab. The individuals working in this field saved my life and are the main inspiration for why I want to work in the field myself. However I’m not sure if it’s too soon in my own healing process to jump into this kind of work, if I’m ready or ever will be ready. I’m having some doubts basically. Also the grad school program is currently waiting for accreditation, which makes me a little more iffy on it.

Right now I’m traveling in SE Asia. My initial plan was to travel from May-July then come back to the states and start school/internship/work. I met some fellow travelers who asked if I’d ever thought of teaching abroad (my undergraduate degree is in English). It was something that I’d wanted to do when I was younger but perpetually put off for later. They showed me some Facebook groups with job contacts, so I sent some emails and have already heard back from four places with a start date in the next couple weeks. I’m seriously considering booking a plane ticket so I can go interview in person for these jobs. My budget is pretty tight for this trip, so I’m currently weighing my options before I buy the ticket. 

My thinking right now is: if I don’t do this now, then when? Maybe I can defer the grad school admission? Is it irresponsible to delay grad school for another year or two? Am I going to be a good fit for the teacher job or the counselor job, and how can I know? How can I maintain my mental health while living and teaching abroad? Which situation would be more conducive to my growth as a person, or more stressful? Also, can I get a refund on my flight back home or nah? 

Lots of questions. 

I kind of just want to see if this comes across as an impulsive decision or one worth doing (or maybe both). Thank you for taking the time to read this.",29May2019,2

285,"Hey redditors, so recently my lady determined we should ""take a break"". This break was determined because she said she isnt emotionally ready to date. The conversation shattered my heart just as it would or most but that's not the hard part. After the first day apart I recieved a text from her asking how I was doing and that she was worried about me. Now when I think of a break it means separation from the person. 

However, just as random as the text was things didnt change really, we would exchange texts and send eachother memes and other funny pictures. Some tending to he ok the sexual side. Now a few days later everything just flipped. Now theres complete silence. 

Now the conversation about a break came with alot of maybes like we might get back together, we might hang out etx. I'm sure some of you have gone through similar situations so what do you think I should do? Theres been so many mixed signals and I cant decide if I should just let things play through or just forget about it because theirs no chance anything will come of it. 

Could this just be her getting over it and having the random flushing feels of missing what her had and slowly getting over it or might she regret her choice and be taking it out on herself/me?",29May2019,1

288,I’m 21 I’m a lesbian and I just lost my girlfriend of over a year because she wanted to become a deciple. She grew up in the church and all of her friends are a part of it and I can understand wanting to be around her friends and I never want to keep her from going to church still but I just can’t wrap my head around giving up someone you love for it. I almost wish she would’ve said she didn’t love me anymore or something that I can at least feel like makes more sense. Another problem I have is that a lot of the people she was friends with and were family friends of her stopped talking to her and said they’d pray for her when she came out so I really can’t grasp wanting to be around people like that.

I (18 M) have a problem with how small the opening on my foreskin is. Luckily, I haven’t engaged in intercourse yet, but just in case I ever do, I don’t want to embarrass myself. So I bought a box of condoms to make sure I know how to use it and such. It said that I had to pull back my foreskin until the head of my penis is fully exposed. However, I realized that I can’t do that, it hurts too damn much and I literally don’t think it can fit through the hole. So I started panicking and searched up options on how to deal with this. It (the internet) said that I can simply constantly and gently pull back my foreskin to stretch the hole. On the other hand, I can get it circumcised.

291,"Gonna make this as short as possible but any advice would be really appreciated! 

So I was in a relationship from 16-20 and it ended on good terms, we are still friends to this day.  After that relationship ended I did what any 20 year old girl would do after 4 years only sleeping with one person and go on a bit of a mad one.  I had so much fun, had so much confidence and was a really sex positive person, also came out as bi,generally having a good time. I was like sex advice guru to my close friends, was super open about everything and I was living a really positive single life. 

Then I had a really bad experience one night at a festival and got raped. It was awful but I somehow managed to suppress it for a few months and try to carry on as normal, I had a few hookups but I was super drunk and out of it and overall did not enjoy them.  I took a break from even going out for a while and then met a guy who became one of my best friends.  We got really drunk one night and kissed, went to my bedroom and started doing other things but I ended up having a huge panic attack and telling him everything (I hadn’t told anyone before) and he was so amazing about the whole thing, we are still really great friends (nothing more). 

Anyway, that was almost six months ago and I haven’t even tried to go out and meet anyone since.  I feel like that night with my friend actually brought everything to light and that I maybe do have some things to work through and I can’t just ‘get over’ what happened at the festival like I’ve been telling myself I can because I just want to go back to being the sex positive confident person I was before.  The thought of sleeping with or even kissing someone now makes me feel extremely anxious and honestly I’m really sad about it because I feel like I’ve lost myself.  I can also feel my confidence fading from other parts of my life and I’m just generally being a lot colder and guarded towards people.  Any advice on what I can do to keep moving forward and ideas on how to deal with this would be super appreciated :) I know that people are going to say go to therapy but honestly the wait for mental health here is super long and I’m also quite broke. So anything I can do to help myself would be the best, thanks guys :)

295,"Hi Reddit,

So i met a girl one week ago and after spending the night with her and other friends i decided to ask her out for a drink because i wanted to know her more but she said she has a boyfriend and i said OK.
I met the same group of friend Yesterday and she was there with some guy I know from school. He was close to her like really close and allways touching her. So I asked her if she was really single ande she said that the dude wouldn't leave her alone even if she pushed him away several times.
So she spend the rest of the night dancing with me because as soon as she left me he would stuck on her.
Just before continuing the story, you have to know that at last week night out, the girl lost her glasses ans she was really sad about that and had no hope in finding it. But the dude said it was ok, things are never lost even after one week.
So back to Yesterday when the dude wanted to walk her home and she said no until the guy had shown her that he had the glasses and said he would give it back to her only if he can walk her home. 
She asked him to go back to his home and I promised her I'd go with her tonight to take back her glasses. How can I handle this guys ?

Tldr : Some dude blackmail a girl I know in order to go to her place even if she pushed him away several time because he was creepy with her

296,"This is a throwaway account and I've been pondering about posting this for a while... I don't know where to really start, so I'm sorry if this is all jumbled up and also a bit of a rant.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been online schooled since the 4th grade (private Christian schools beforehand) and my parents only had me socialize once or twice a week at church since. I graduated (online) high school in two years with a 4.04 GPA with honors.

Originally, my plan was to attend JC for two years and then transfer to a university. I didn't do any extracurricular activities during high school because it was online (I couldn't really get Debate Club to work in a chat room) and my parents would not drive me to any activities or events. I figured that I could do those things during JC and then go to a reputable university with a jacked application! Right?

My parents, however, told me to go online seminary. I instantly refused but they clarified they would not pay for my tuition or help me in any way financially unless I went to online seminary. I was 16 years old. I had no credit/debit card, a car, or anything at all, other than my dog and some clothes. It was too late for me to even register for a university to go that very fall.

I decided to try online seminary for a year. I tried it in the hopes that I would like it. My parents paid for it and as much as I tried to love it, I hated it. I got a 3.0 GPA in the fall semester and I could only do one class because of (confidential) family issues in the spring.

My freshman year has ended. I'm 17 now. I'll be 18 at the end of the year. I live across the state from a really great public university that has great dorms with a high enough admission rate I'd get in. Or maybe I'll just go with my original plan of community college and then transfer out to a university, but I need a car for that.

Anyways.

It seemed like a no-brainer to leave for college. I hated online college. I hate being so lonely. The people at my church are racist, old, or both. I hang out with them anyway because I want to be with people my age. Even if the people at church were great -- I don't know how great I should feel about only meeting people from one place.

My mother, however, told me what would happen if I stayed and did online college versus leave for college. (Btw, the company they started two years ago makes over $500k a year and it's only expected to grow exponentially in the next few years both domestically and internationally.)

|Stay|Leave|
|:-|:-|
|Brand new car (of my choosing) for free|No financial support at all|
|Allowed to get a part-time job to socialize|Make friends|
|Also allowed to socialize by attending JC to transfer credits|Cost of in-state tuition at nearest university with dorm: $170k (30k a year, 4% interest while I am in school because parents make too much, I do not qualify for any financial aid)|
|Right out of college, they are going to give me a job with a starting pay of $5k|Have a college experience|
|Be the sole inheritor of the company|Get kicked out of the family forever|

I feel suicidal about this and it's so stupid because I'm not starving or poor. My parents are stupidly well-off and even though I barely spend any money, they could get me anything I want. I just hate being so alone. The only friend I have is my dog who I don't even want to leave behind if I were to go to university because I don't trust that they would take care of him properly. I love my dog so much. I would have killed myself out of loneliness when they wouldn't let me go to high school in the 8th grade.

They tell me not to worry about being alone because of JC and the part-time job, but still. I'm still worried that I'll be missing out ON SO MUCH by not attending college fully.

297,"My \[23f\] roommate \[31f\] came back home at 2:30am, waking me up whilst she was rattling her charger into every socket really loudly. When I told her that the electricity wasn't working she proceeded to argue with me over why the emergency lights were switched on. I wasn't in the mood to sit down and explain the logistics to her, so I got up to open the balcony door for a few minutes since the room was stuffy. She asked me why I had the door open, and that it was cold. I said that I'd shut it in a bit. She insisted on understanding why and I replied saying that I just needed some air. She mocked my \[English\] accent, asking me what I meant by ''air''. She's Spanish and the language barrier is quite evident. I couldn't sleep all night and, to make matters worse, she was snoring.

I asked her what the hell happened last night, wanting to understand why she was being aggressive. I asked her if she'd had a lot to drink that night and she denied any of that, telling me she doesn't drink alcohol. I suggested that it might've been a misunderstanding on my part, given the language barrier, and she proceeded to ask me if i had deliberately opened the balcony door; that she was ill, that it's none of my business whether she comes home late at night, that I was accusing her of being in the wrong - basically straw-manning my arguments. I got frustrated, raised my voice, and asked her to leave me alone since I wasn't interested in arguing, whilst she kept banging on and on. I eventually walked out of the house.

Apparently, my other flatmate had been listening in to all of this, making it all the messier.

My roommate texted me right after I walked out, wanting to resolve the issue but not explicitly apologising. She suggested we do brunch together. I thanked her for messaging me and told her how much of an admirable character she is, bla bla, and apologised for getting heated up, since I'm sleep-deprived. I bought her a bar of her fav chocolate and we hugged it out, but...

298,"I know most people have it worse than I do. This may seem like I’m complaining over nothing when you compare it to those who don’t even have functional families, but I’m desperate for help. 

Growing up in an Asian immigrant household, I (25F) struggled with being recognized with positive reinforcement. I remember so little of my childhood and I can’t tell if it’s by choice or that I truly don’t remember anything worth treasuring. I was not allowed to hangout after school, go to sleepovers or even have ‘friends’ come over. I was not allowed to have friends that weren’t family (cousins I’d see a couple times a month), and I feel like I’m socially impaired at this point. It was pretty common for my parents to make fun of me for crying, show vulnerability, or have anything to complain about. I’d be criticized about my weight and laziness even though I wasn’t allowed out of the house after school. 

I now constantly look for validation in all things I do from the few peers I have and can’t keep myself from worrying about what absolutely everyone thinks of me. I am obligated to be grateful for how much my parents raised me, at least putting me through college, but I was socially isolated. I feel like I grew up in a bubble and now I can’t function properly from day to day. 

I can’t help but somewhat blame them for my incapability of interacting with people face to face. I feel resentment towards their parenting and now that I’m older, I want to avoid hating them for something they likely didn’t do intentionally. What can I do to keep from damaging my perception of them further?

TL;DR - I grew up with strict, loveless parents. How do I keep from blaming them for my deprived childhood and social awkwardness?",29May2019,7
299,"28M here. I moved out of the house when I was 21. I’ve been married for almost 3 years. I am an only child and the last decade has been a struggle trying to “grow up.” When I first moved out of the house my parents used to call me multiple times a day, everyday, to talk about the same things. I wrote this off as empty nest syndrome and tried to slowly wean them off of this calling schedule. It took about 2 years and multiple conversations about boundaries to stop the multiple daily.

My wife and I have been focusing on trying to build our lives. We have been trying to figure out who we want to be, what we want to do, and how we want to do it. We got married young so we’re still starting our careers and discovering how to adult properly. However my parents seem to enjoy to make comments about our life. Especially when we are in the middle of a big decision or event in our life. This has been a huge issue between my wife and I because I have been afraid of hurting my parents feelings. 

Two years ago I was diagnosed with a genetic condition that affects my lungs. Last year I had really bad case of bronchitis for two months. After bring sick for the first couple weeks and not knowing what was going on, I naturally spoke to my parents to give them an update. My mother followed up with over ten minutes of yelling at me on the phone telling me my wife and I need to take better care of our bodies. That I need to do a bunch of things to my body that she saw on Dr. Oz. It was frustrating to be so sick and to feel so put down by my own mother, blaming me for being sick. This was the tipping point in my relationship with my parents that the unsolicited advice became condescending.

Since that moment last year my mother mainly takes it upon herself to interject her opinions into pretty much everything. She calls me randomly just to tell me things my wife and I are doing wrong, but we don’t even do those things. She tells me that I’m pulling away and makes her sad and angry. I think my parents are calling to say hi, but it just turns to an argument.

Last month we had lunch with my parents and let them know we’ve been looking to purchase a larger house. My mother spent over 5 minutes telling us both we don’t want to move. We don’t want a larger home. My wife and I stood our ground and said we’d prefer to live in a place we’re comfortable in. Then weeks after that conversation I started getting home selling/purchasing lectures. I’ve asked for them to stop but I’m told we don’t know better. 

Yesterday my wife and I listed our home. We were very excited and shared the news with our parents. I let my mother know that we are selling our home and she flipped out on me. She told me that I keep secrets from her and that I should listen to her advice on how to sell my home, even though we have a real estate agent... The entire evening was consumed with her calling and texting me telling me how awful of a person I’ve become.

I feel so confused because I feel like my mother is upset at me for growing up. My wife is upset because my mother causes me so much stress. My wife has also lost respect for my parents and how they have treated us the last couple years. I feel like this is my fault because I haven’t handled the situation properly, but I don’t know where it went wrong. I have no idea what to do.",29May2019,1

My mom is an alcoholic. And an extreme one at that.
She's drunk almost 24/7 and to a certain extent has ruined my childhood (I'm 16 BTW)
She's constantly abusing me, my brother and most of all my father. She's been an alcoholic ever since I was just a baby and she'll probly be one till she dies. We don't have the money to get her treatment or send her to rehab and even if we did she wouldn't go as she is in complete denial about it. She's just a person who likes a drink every now and then in her mind. I've never encountered a more evil vile and sick person than my mother when she's drunk. Here's some of the things she's done over years but not limited to just these things.
Throwing a knife into my arm

Breaking and throwing my toys in the fire

Almost getting the family dog out down just because she felt like it (only didn't cozbmy dad stopped her at the last second)

Breaking countless furniture and cutlery

Driving with kids in the car while being absolutely wasted

And countless humiliating things in public

Sometimes she gets completely out of control
And I have to defend my self or stand up to her
Which has led to me having to punch /kick /slap /subdue her
I'm even broken her ribs more than once in sled defense
I don't like being violent or having to that to my own mom but it's the only way to get her to stop sometimes
Then she goes to my aunties and uncles telling them me and my brother are women beaters /mom beaters and they all believe her. No one outside of my family knows she's an alcoholic and some just don't believe us.
The messed up part is she's genuinely one of the most kind hearted people in the world when she's sober but when she drinks even the tiniest bit..... My god its like two face from batman or someone with schizophrenia. Its just two completely different people all together.
When ever she's sober we just never speak of it because she's such a nice person it makes it hard to say anything and also because I don't wanna make her upset which will cause her to drink
We've had social services round multiple times and she always makea us lie and pretend everything is fine. The last time was a long time ago now and I've matured a lot since. I no longer fear her and the next time they come knocking I'm not lying I'm gonna let it all loose. Its just no matter how horrible and evil she is when she drinks I still love her so much because I know thats not the real her. Its just an addiction like any other

It makes me really depressed sometimes and occasionally I think of suicide but tbh even if I did I don't even think that would make her stop.

What do I do guys?
How do I save my mother before she drinks herself to death?",29May2019,3
305,"Hi, briefly describing myself, I would say I'm curious and good at noticing things. I have recently started working at a new job, which requires me to travel by train. My stop has a low traffic density and not a lot of people get off there. However, this one person (F) gets off at that spot and I am guessing she works close by. It started off as simply noticing her, that grew into curiosity or an interest. She seems to have some mystery being her which intrigued me.

A part of me is telling me to leave it alone and go on with my life, another part is saying I should introduce myself and see if it is her or my created mystery about them. I just don't know how to go about introducing myself and I don't want to put her in a weird situation or make her feel uncomfortable. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!",29May2019,1
306,"so i’m in a bit of a dilemma, i just got into an argument with my stepdad at dinner and he was the angriest i’ve ever seen him, he slammed the table several times (note, he never slams things, he’s very protective of his house) and yelled at me for a couple minutes. i thought he was going to hit me but he just barely controlled himself and left the room. i subsequently left the house and am now in the land behind my house (or his house) as i type this. i am strangely calm, i want to be angry but i’m not really, i’m sort of just worried that he might assault my mum or my brothers (he does have anger issues as would seem to be evident) 


i’m gonna try and keep this short.  my stepdad yelled at me about how he does so much and i never respect him, he started with about how he went out of his way to take me to my school today and about how he makes my lunch and dinner and all that stuff. but then he went on about how my bio dad doesn’t do any of that and that he’s just a cunt that refuses to take responsibility for me. usually when he brings up my dad (who admittedly, was absent for time in my life) i get really angry myself and often start yelling back at him. but this time i was calm. anyway,  he does do a lot for me but he also demands respect every ten seconds it feels like. i’ve always seen the stuff he does as the standard role of a parent and that is what he signed up for when he married my mum. am i being entitled or am i justified in thinking that what he does is standard and not really above an average parents paygrade.",29May2019,1
307,"im 19, I live at home, I have never worked a real job in my life and I dont go to college. I hated normal high school, switched to an independent study thing and cut off all of my friends, almost dropped out but I pulled through and finished. Dont have a license and I have never touched any drugs or alcohol in my life. I only have 2 friends, both of which are online and I rarely talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially my day is just me sitting in my room browsing social media and watching videos and I have been doing this since as long as I can remember. I've never had a friend offer to make plans with me. The only time I hang out with people irl is when my sister is finished with her school work some nights. I was traumatized when I was 12 and was in therapy for years. It kinda feels like ive gone through a mini time machine and im developmentally 12. Occasionally I'll get the motivation to do something and set a whole plan around a dream that I have but that never lasts longer than a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been offered help to take classes at the CC close to me, which sometimes I have the motivation to do, but there isn't anything at a college that makes me go ""wow I really want to do that its my dream"", it just feels like I would be taking classes to make my parent happy, not because im working toward my own goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've purposely turned off my computer for 7 days in a row to figure things out, that didn't help. I thought maybe if I try not to masturbate for a long period of time I would use that energy to be hungry to achieve something for a long period of time, that didn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I see people with a drive that looks like it's a given for them, a sole purpose. And then there is me that tests the water in a million things and never commits to anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suprisingly I'm actually really happy right now, but when I picture myself at 25, with the path im coasting on right now, im going to be a loser for the rest of my life.

308,"So this may come off weird, I literally don’t know where else to go, but I think there’s something wrong with me? Or is it in my head??
So I’ve noticed for the past year, that every night, no matter what, a light will flicker where I’m at. EVERY NIGHT. I know this sounds crazy, most of time I don’t think about it until it happens, and I thought it was weird and maybe in my head. Until my boyfriend told me he noticed lights flickering when I’m around...we have only been dating like 6 months. I told my friend because idk. It sounds weird, like “oh lights flick every night, anywhere, once but idk why.” Like ugh just typing this I feel weird. Idk, does anyone have any theories, or your free to say it’s in my head haha I honestly just wanted to vent and get some theories and advice out there. 
Let me clarify so you guys don’t have to ask a lot. 
1) IT HAPPENS EVERY NIGHT
2) if it’s been longer than a year I wouldn’t know I didn’t start paying attention until about a year ago
3) my boyfriend and I point it out now that it happens
4) it only happens once, a light, any kind, a light bulb, flash light, street lights, light in the isle I’m walking through will flicker and that’s it
5) it hasn’t changed or progressed and we don’t notice a pattern
6) we don’t actively pay attention anymore we just point it out when it happens",29May2019,1

My school has an almost fair day coming up as an anniversary, they are hosting a talent show as one of the events and I am competing, my performance will be in front of well over 400 school children from 12-18 years of age.

I am doing a beatboxing routine as I am very good at it and I am extremely passionate about it. I want my performance to be great, so at the end of it, you know considering it is infront of 400+ school children, should I do a default dance while beatboxing it, from the popular game Fortnite, it seems dumb but I just really would like some advice on whether I should just yolo it like it’s my light day on earth, or play it cool.

311,"My partner has children with his ex and we also have two children. He pays maintenance every single month and that’s fine. 

However, my partner gets his children every holiday, and this summer holiday he will have them for two whole months. Should we pay those two months maintenance to his ex, even though the children will be with us? We even pay her the full amount even when the children are with us for two weeks holiday. 

My reasoning is no, we shouldn’t because the money we would be sending her would be needed for the children while they’re here. However she’s being a bit awkward, saying that he needs to pay her every month, no exceptions.",29May2019,1
312,"I've been using marijuana regularly for the last year and at least daily for the past 8 months. I'm just 18 and I started smoking when I was 16. 

I was driving to Macca's with a joint in my centre console, ready to smoke on my way home once I got my nuggets to satisfy the inevitable munchies. I came around the corner and found myself in the middle of a Random Drug Test (RDT). 

I was fucked and I knew it. The people they had pulled over had just finished being tested and they were ushering the next lot of cars into the side lane to be tested. I would fail the drug test and they'd find the joint in my car which could only make things worse. 

I'm 18 and I had had my licence for about a month at this stage, it would be immensely embarrassing to tell my friends and family not only that I'd lost it, but why. 

My body was coursing with dread and frankly, I was terrified, I'd never been in trouble with the law before and even at school I was reserved and well behaved. 

I got to the front of the line, ready to accept my fate. The police man who had ushered ALL of the cars infront of  me in to be drug tested, put his hand up gesturing for me to stop, then he moved to the side, picked up the cone and ushered me through. 

I couldn't believe my luck, a few seconds earlier, just one car up, I would have been 100% fucked. 
By the time I got to McDonalds, my body was shaking. Sounds lame, I know, but it scared the shit out of me, if I'd been charged I would have lost my licence and had to quit my job.

I knew this was a wake up call, I'd been given a second chance. If I couldn't quit drugs now, next time, I wouldn't be so lucky, and nor did I deserve to be.

The next day I applied to join the Navy for a gap year program. It starts in 6 months if I can get in. I have a interview/testing session in 3 weeks time.

I knew that I should quit weed then, but I didn't. Even though I had the shit scared out of me, I still couldn't give it up. 

 Now, 2-3 weeks later, I'm trying to quit. It's not because I want to, trust me, all I want to do is roll a fat joint and pass out in bed. But, if I want to get in to the Navy, I have to pass a drug test which (because I'm a regular long term user) can detect marijuana from up to 2 months prior. 

I couldn't deal with the embarrassment and shame if I failed. So, I need to quit. 

I never thought of myself as addicted. I tried to quit once before momentarily. I tried to convince myself that I was trying to quit because I wanted to, but I quickly realised, I didn't want to at all and threw it all out the window. That was over 2 months ago.

I've been clean 4 days now, which doesn't sound like a lot to you probably, but it's the longest I've been clean in over a year. 

The first 3 days were ok, I thought about marijuana a lot but i was able to stay positive and motivated, thinking of joining the army and being a better person without drugs - fitter and healthier etc. 

Today though, it wasn't so easy. I've been getting emotional mood swings, I keep crying for no reason, it's partly frustration and partly craving marijuana, not physically so much as I can't stop thinking about it. It's all I want.

I hate being sober, my mind moves too fast and I can't relax. I've tried meditating but that doesn't help me, my brain still feels all over the place.

I don't want to quit marijuana, but I know if I don't do it now, it won't be any easier later. 

I don't even know if I want to join the navy, I've never been one for conformity, but I feel like I should. And part of me really wants to give it a try. I'm so close to just doing the interview and going no further, so that I can just put down my phone, stop writing this stupid post and go smoke a joint.",29May2019,0

317,"Hi there!   
As the title suggests, I've been struggling with my anxiety recently. In 15 days, I'll be solo-travelling to the US for a total of 4 months (working for 3 and travelling for 1).   
I've been planning the trip for quite a while and was proud that I'd managed to keep my anxiety under control, but I must have gotten too cocky or jinxed it.  
I can't stop myself visualising worst case scenarios and obsessing over tiny details. I've also started having nightmares about bad things happening while I'm alone out there which means that I'm still tired by the time I wake up but still feel the need to be constantly busy/doing stuff because of my anxiety.

331,"Backstory: My step-father (who came into my life when I was about 3) is a pedophile. He used to very discreetly brush up against me, look at me inappropriately, and once touched me through my clothes and then told me not to tell anyone. I also caught him looking at child pornography when I was maybe 8 or so.

I have recently confronted my mom about the whole thing, thinking she would divorce him, but the short of it is that she admits that she knows he is a pedophile (she even caught him with child porn when I was a child too) but doesn't believe that he ever intentionally molested me. My mother has decided not to leave him so I've essentially cut off contact with my mom. I was in therapy for a while and will probably have to go back to continue to deal with this.

At any rate, what I am concerned about is what kind of obligation I have to tell others (like my cousins) who have young girls about what he has done. I don't think he visits them, but that's not to say he never will in the future. I worry that they post pictures of their kids on Facebook and that he sees those. I feel like I should tell them, but honestly the whole thing is hard for me to deal with as it is, and I'm not sure I want to drag anyone else into the emotional hell of finding something like this out. I don't think he is a threat to anyone. I am not close with my cousins at all (they are actually my step-cousins; his blood nephews and nieces).

So, what do I do? Do I tell them, drag them into the pain and confusion and anger of knowing this about him? What kind of riff might that start in that family? Is it my moral obligation? Is it OK to just stay quiet? With summer coming, what about pictures of kids at the pool in swimsuits?

338,"I started a new job recently at a new restaurant opening, and this girl, 1 month younger than me (both 21), started as well. We have been becoming really good friends in the past week of training, as we are both part of the management team and are staying behind every day doing extra hours. 

I am not very good in situations like this. I've never been with anyone before, I'm bi, and I have a lot of insecurities, and I have trouble talking to new people I meet. 

It started as me liking her, but not knowing if she likes me back, or if she thinks I'm just another gay friend (I work with quite a few gay people on the management team that she is good friends with as well).

I added her on Snapchat and started messaging her in the mornings before work and before bed after work. She seems to be messaging back really quickly and she is keeping the conversation going a lot. She was sending me selfies and videos of her singing and stuff. I'm almost 100% sure she likes me now as I've found her giving me looks at work and she picks up on some of my signs as well. I've been saying some flirty stuff over text but I'm not being disgusting or anything, just a little cheeky I guess. 

So last night, we worked about 12 hours until 10:30 and the whole management  team went out for a drink. We have the next 2 days off, and I'm awful at telling people how I feel unless I drink a lot, which I unfortunately didn't. I take the train home, so I say bye and went to the station. All the trains were cancelled or delayed for another 40 mins so I messaged her just to start a conversation. She offered to pick me up but she was already almost home so I didn't want to inconvenience her.

We started texting and I may have told her that I want to take her out for dinner. I told her earlier that I owe her lunch, since she paid for mine during work. So I said that I still owe her and want to take her out for dinner. She never said no, but she didn't say yes either. She said that we'll all (management) probably go out for drinks so I can get her a drink. I told her that I like her answer and that it was the nicest rejection ever. She never actually rejected me but said that whatever social things I'm struggling with she'll help me, and never answered my question if the offer is still on the table or not. 

It ended in a really good way, and she kind of left it open ended. What my friend and I gathered from it, was that she likes me, but wants to wait. I will never pressure anyone, and I always give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe her ex was a shithead or something I don't know. 

I'm trying to keep optimistic but not obsessive about it. I'll just take my time now, and whatever happens happens, but I just wanted to post this here to see what you less socially inept people think about the situation. 

Sorry it's long I just wanted to give as much as possible so maybe someone can pick up on something.

343,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if the right place to post but I couldn't face going in today, my job is actually making me sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

For background I have been with this company for 13 months, am the youngest of my team by 10 years and also the only person who is a different nationality - this will be relevant later. 

&amp;#x200B;

My place of work is very much male orientated, with only 1 other female on my team. There are 6 of us in total including the manager. The culture is very ""laddish"", lots of ""banter"" and taking the mick out of one another. Now this isn't the first time I have worked in an environment like this, which makes me believe that the things that go on are strange and out of order. 

&amp;#x200B;

From day one I was singled out for jokes due to my nationality, the jokes began in good humour and I went along with the banter as I am not a shy person. 13 months in this has become a daily occurrence and the other team members are being more offensive and using offensive language and slurs. This upsets me but I try not to react. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other things that have happened over particularly the last 3 months are; 

&amp;#x200B;

* An altercation with a member of another team, this man was shouting in my face, swearing and pointing aggressively, I lost my temper and stuck up for myself. He has not even acknowledged me since but makes an obvious effort to speak to everyone else around me. A supervisor on my team witnessed this and did nothing.
* A staff member on my team constantly mocks my appearance and compares me to film characters that you wold associate with halloween.
* The same staff member was the only person not to congratulate me on my recent engagement and even stated ""no one, is EVER going to Marry you because you are from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Your wedding is going to be s\*\*t"".
* The same staff member will also make statements to other people loudly such as ""no point training her on this, she is f\*\*\*ing useless, she cant even read because she is from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.
* The whole team in general will make comments on my personal life and always try to belittle and humiliate me, these topics range from my upcoming driving test, my upcoming wedding, my holidays, the car my partner drives, our apartment that we own. I have even been called a Gold Digger because my partner is very successful.

Now all of this generally happens in ""jest"", but its been daily for over a year and I have had enough, its strange and over my 10 years of working for various companies I have never known an environment to be so toxic. I am unable to eat my lunch, because i am so anxious at work, I frequently have headaches and have developed stress related IBS, acne and hair loss. I am lucky in having one close friend at work from a different team, who is fully supporting my decision to leave, and he is also leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to add that all of these people have been with the company for over 10 years, my manager has said that he is ""HR"", so I feel there is no point raising this formally if i want a reference in the future. He also takes part in the above behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

I am actively looking for a new job and have a meeting with a recruiter tomorrow. My partner has said I can leave now and he will financially support me until I get another job, he is disgusted with them. Will I just hand in my notice? I called sick today because I am on the verge of a break down. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you read all this, thank you! I just want to hear other people's thoughts on the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*TL;DR\*\*\* I think I am being covertly bullied at work, it has gradually got worse over the 13 months I have been there and has now made me sick. Do I walk away now or am I over sensitive?",29May2019,2

345,"I'm in a very complicated relationship. It's also my first one, so it's even more difficult because I lack experience. We're together for nearly 1,5 years now. 

My SO has been with me 24/7 for over a week until this monday. We did a lot of stuff together, that was great. Normally we both live in our own appartments and mostly see each other on the weekends. Though I feel as if I tend to get more clingy over the time. :( 

Now he's far away in another city because I wanted him to have some time for himself and to have some fun. I know he loves to travel so that's what I wanted him to do. I just miss him terribly. We said we actually want to see each other on the weekend again but I'm sitting here and I can't really cope with being away from him. :( I know this is not healthy... 

I was just wondering if I should meet him at the station tomorrow or if that's too clingy... and if I should wait until I see him friday evening? 

I just wanna talk to him, hug him, see him smile and feel safe around him. I miss him so much.",29May2019,3
346,"For as long as I can remember, I have always been scared of rain and wind. When I was little, it terrified me and I could never get to sleep or calm down if it was raining. I always use to freak out and jump about, crying or waking my mum up to sleep with me because I was too scared. Sometimes I would even wake myself up in a panic because it scared me that much. Thunder and lightening are probably the worst of it all. There was even a time my aunty left me in the car to go down quickly to get groceries and I ended up screaming my lungs out because it started raining and I thought it was going to start flooding. Strangers came to the car to try help me.

I never grew out of this, to this day I still fear it. It’s never controlled my life but I have never liked it and I still get scared and stressed as soon as it comes about.

Recently, I had a panic attack over the rain whilst I was sitting in my car. It started getting really loud and I completely lost it. My boyfriend was with me and was able to calm me down. I have fairly severe anxiety but it’s never been over rain. 

Since then, whenever it starts raining I have started to become more anxious and stressed than usual.

Does anyone have any idea what the hell is going on? What does this mean? What can I do?

350,"I've been unemployed for a while now but I have recently landed myself a decent job. (yay me) I haven't started yet but will be soon. No one knows this yet.

I have **very basic** skills with website building and logo design but in the eyes of many of my friends I'm an expert, but not expert enough to be paid.

It takes me ages to put together sites and logos and I usually have to do so with tutorials running in the background, it takes up so much time and also they usually expect me to cover things like hosting and the urls and stuff. 

I have avoided it the entire time I've been unemployed by saying I sold my PC so I can't help at the moment and prior to this, when I was working I would say I can't right now because of work etc. 

Problem is now, I've been asked again, and they have offered to loan me a computer to work on their project. And the job I'm starting doesn't take up as much time as my last job did. (I used to work 13hours a day) 


Hopefully I don't sound like an asshole but these guys always ask under the pretence that I'll be involved in whatever it is they're doing but the reality is they just want me to build for them in silence and once completed not get involved anymore even though I'm always hearing WE.

They also belive I'm delusional (their words) in assuming I'd ever be paid for the work as I told them I'm interested in studying web &amp; graphic design and they told me I'm intellectually incapable of doing so. To be fair they also said the same about themselves.

351,"I’m 23/M, almost done a semester of a business degree but I’m very confused if I should continue it. It seems easy enough, but I have no commitment to finish it through. I got nothing driving inside of me to do my homework and do the best I can. I don’t know if it’s a result of my depression or anxiety. 

My family has a business which allows them to live a luxurious life, and in my culture (Southern European) I’m kind of expected to take over one day, or at least I feel like it’s my responsibility/duty. I’m proud to work with the business but my issues are it’s really early mornings ( 2am - 5am starting times) and long days (10-12hr), which is making me struggling already after 5 years. 

So the reason I took the degree was to: 
- have some sort of skills If decide to take over as I don’t want to fail
-have an option if I decide to leave
-not look like a failure/bum if I don’t have a degree

352,"Here is my story: 
In high school, everything was pretty good. I have a bunch of close friends who hanged out with. I was very confident at that time. It was like I was not scare of mistakes. If I was wrong, I would do it again. About my friends, we shared happiness as well as sadness together. I really enjoyed being around with them. 
However, things have changed since we went to university and so on. Now I feel very inferiority when I talk to them. They are now very successful in their career. Have a well-paid job, stable lifestyles. For me, I’m still at school struggling with all knowledge which I don’t even know I like it or not. It’s too late for me to change (cause I study abroad). 
It affects my life in so many aspects. Sometimes, when I’m trying to make decision, my brain alway imagines the scenario which all my friends will give a negative comments regarding things I do. 
How can I change my mindset again? What should I do since I’m not talent as they are? 
I’m open to all advices. Don’t hesitate to do so cause I need perspectives.

353,"Hi all,

Recently, I've been dwelling on my future and thus, tried to avoid talking about it with my family regarding what I'm doing after high school.

The plan was that I was gonna study law in the city that I currently live in.

I have came up with something else where I would study law but in a different city in the same country (about 2 hours by train).

My dad's side of the family lives in this place and so does my best friend and boyfriend. So basically, everyone I care about lives there and that place is like a home to me... more than where I currently live (where I have a few friends that are moving away). And because I love it so much there, when I'm here I don't feel good.

I think it'd be the best for me right now. 

I'm going to present my plan to my parents this Friday. And I made a presentation and need some help with key points as to why I want to move there at least for the first year.

They aren't aware that I have a boyfriend living there and I don't plan to tell them until everything with the university is set. 

So please, any advice on the reasons I want to leave that would help me?

Thank you so much.",29May2019,1

My close friends have already said they would help me, however, they don't really know her either. In turn, I know two of her friends, but not that well, so I don't want to ask them to do it because they might not help me.

355,"She says she only loves me all that shit. Shes never slept with another guy as far as I know. But I've came over to her with other guys before behind my back multiple times but they were never there long. 

I get this feeling everytime something really ain't right, I get that with trust issues. But then I get this other feeling when something is really going on even before I find out, I just know some how. Everytime I get this specific feeling something always turns out that I was right, even if it wasn't cheating but just sketchy as hell. And the last 2 days my girlfriend and i were not talking after a brief fight and i called her yesterday and she was all over the place barely even texting me, kept dipping out the call to call somebody else saying it was her mom and stuff. Didnt say a word to me after for like 2 hours but she wasn't doing anything and she was at home claiming she was helping her family members(she lives with her mother). Something just doesnt feel right with her at all I know something's off. But if confront her about it all shes gonna say is nothing happened because it's as easy as deleting a few conversations and all that so theres no evidence. 


Man I could say I love this girl to death part of me does. Shes done everything for me, but idk why she sticks around with me and decides to text other guys and stuff behind my back.

So, I'm 16 years old, I'm a Sophomore, and I live in Canada. I recently have been misplacing things. I don't mean the;
""Oh crap, I lost this thing..."" once in awhile. I lose things every day. Multiple times per thing. Yesterday alone? I misplaced my Exam Exemption sheet two times, one time with it signed by all of my P1 - P5 (P = Period) teachers, My phone exactly four times, my large oversized sweater twice, my jacket once,  a notes sheet for Human Physiology, my coffee mug in my English class, A wrap in a french class desk. (I felt bad for that one.)

Today, right now, it is 9:26AM. Im sitting in my homeroom.

358,"I started a new job recently at a new restaurant opening, and this girl, 1 month younger than me (both 21), started as well. We have been becoming really good friends in the past week of training, as we are both part of the management team and are staying behind every day doing extra hours. 

I am not very good in situations like this. I've never been with anyone before, I'm bi, and I have a lot of insecurities, and I have trouble talking to new people I meet. 

It started as me liking her, but not knowing if she likes me back, or if she thinks I'm just another gay friend (I work with quite a few gay people on the management team that she is good friends with as well). I really enjoy the time I spend with her. I have tried to convince myself to not like her outside of work, because I find it awkward to like someone at work. Either way, everytime I see her and talk to her I become so happy. 

I added her on Snapchat and started messaging her in the mornings before work and before bed after work. She seems to be messaging back really quickly and she is keeping the conversation going a lot. She was sending me selfies and videos of her singing and stuff. I'm almost 100% sure she likes me now as I've found her giving me looks at work and she picks up on some of my signs as well. I've been saying some flirty stuff over text but I'm not being disgusting or anything, just a little cheeky I guess. 

So last night, we worked about 12 hours until 10:30 and the whole management  team went out for a drink. We have the next 2 days off, and I'm awful at telling people how I feel unless I drink a lot, which I unfortunately didn't. I take the train home, so I say bye and went to the station. All the trains were cancelled or delayed for another 40 mins so I messaged her just to start a conversation. She offered to pick me up but she was already almost home so I didn't want to inconvenience her.

We started texting and I may have told her that I want to take her out for dinner. I told her earlier that I owe her lunch, since she paid for mine during work. So I said that I still owe her and want to take her out for dinner. She never said no, but she didn't say yes either. She said that we'll all (management) probably go out for drinks so I can get her a drink. I told her that I like her answer and that it was the nicest rejection ever.

365,"*sorry if the formatting sucks, im on mobile*

I've known this girl (Let's call her B) since we were in about 1st grade, we were basically best friends but then we both grew up and kinda distanced ourselves from each other. Then last year we started talking again, but mostly small talk. But this year everything changed.

Basically, B talks behind my back a lot, acting like some sort of expert just because we were friends in elementary school. B told my girlfriend and one of our very close friends that I'm not ""mentally stable enough for a relationship"". I thought she was just being petty about this so I let it slide.

Recently however, I found out some more things she's said behind my back. B has gone so far to claim she's an ""empath"" (people with common fucking sense would know empaths are not real things) just to say that I faked a panic attack.

My anxiety is pretty serious and it got really bad one night and she was there to witness it. I literally could not breathe or stop crying but she still claimed I faked it. I have no idea why she thinks this because faking a panic attack would have no benefit towards me.

Then when my girlfriend told B we were dating, B told her that she had to break up with me and her reasoning was that I was not ""mentally stable enough for a relationship"", something she had already said.

I'm not even just mad about the things she's said about me. She has literally threatened to ""beat the shit out of"" one of my friends, let's call him T, and even went so far to wish DEATH upon him. I don't understand how SICK you have to be to wish death upon someone. There was a point in time where I hated T, but I know right from wrong and didn't want him to die.

Usually I have no problem with getting rid of negative people in my life, but I'm afraid it will just make my situation worse. Plus, my girlfriend is friends with her, so I probably wouldn't be able to talk with my girlfriend a lot and I already cannot spend time with her after school because of how possessive B is over her.

All I'm really asking for is tips on how to get rid of B, I don't want anything to do with her because of all the shit she's said. I don't really need tips about how to talk to my girlfriend about the situation if you were going to give any tips about that as well, she already knows I want to completely drop her from my life.

367,"So I hired a mover to move a Vending machine and he quoted me $260. So he picks up the vending machine then says it will be $260 + 1 hour ($80) + tax. So $395 in total. (I wasn't there for the pickup I had a lady show him and his crew where the vending machine was)

When I was shopping quotes I could've easily found multiple people to do it for $280.

I refused to pay because that's $135 more than the initial quote and I only prepared $260 in cash for him. (I was going to leave work to meet with him).

He now demands that I etransfer him $395 or he's not giving me my vending machine. Or that I pay him $180 and come pick it up. (Which I have a friend who will go pick it up for $150).

So should I go there and pick it up (With some friends) and refuse to pay him because he didn't deliver the vending machine? Or should I pay the $180 and suck it up?

Yesterday morning, now, brother ‘s wallet which has fucking 50 dollars ( the money was shared by the both of them )was stolen and my parents blamed my sisted for it to an extent where they searched at her bag and belongings, in which they found nothing . She started crying and kept saying “Why are they blaming me?”. My brother started to cry as well, cus he was getting blamed for being irresponsible ( I was not home at that time)

I don’t want to blame anyone but who else could possibly steal it? I became suspicious of our housemaid. I dont want ti point fingers since we have no proof..... but me and my brother both agreed that my sister couldn’t do that ( might be a little bias, but ) since she could’ve just get her part in the $50 , and wouldn’t get the wallet.

When I arrived home, our parents “talked” to us about the situation. The whole time it was all about my brother being irresponsible, that he could’ve put it somewhere else, etc. and it fucking maddened me. Why are we the only ones getting blamed for? Why Is It Only Our Fucking Fault? 

It badly maddens me that I was shaking, and I want to defend my siblings so I spoke up. I told them that we weren’t the only ones they should be mad at. Why is is only our fault etc. That we were not the only ones at home. Why not blame the culprit? And what hurts more is the moment i spoke both of my siblings start to cry. 

And what was their response? They told me why was I affected that much. That I wasn’t there when the situation happened and that I was overreacting. Maybe I was but I just want to defend them because they don’t deserve the blame.

Tmi, but when i started speaking , the maid slightly peeked at us. Idk if this counts but yeah.

End of story, I left them. And now I am exhausted af that Idek what to do. Idk if I did the right thing; that i just want to know who fucking culprit is and i hope they got caught.",29May2019,1

371,"Hello, 22 male here seeking life advice. 

So basically I'm working a job that's okay, pays well and whatnot but there's no excitement in it and is definitely not what I wanna end up doing when I'm older. It has growth opportunities that are a little more interesting and requires a skill I already have but its still not ideal.
I had a dream growing up about what I wanted to do but that has since changed and now I'm left not knowing what to do and it's killing me.

I have a few hobbies but nothing that really drives me enough to make a living out of it.
And because of my situation I can't really enjoy them anymore cause constantly at the back of my mind is just rumination about what the hell am i going to do. 

But every single day I just have constant anxiety about how I wanna work for myself, doing something artistic/designer related but I just don't know what. I'm trying to live happy and act just as I would as if I had my dream life but damn it's hard.

I've spiralled into a pit of depression and I don't know what to do. I guess I just wanna know how to be happy even though I'm not. 
I can't change careers again for awhile because I've done it too much over the last few years.

372,"I’m a girl and I have a crush on my best friend who’s a guy. I’d suck it up and tell him how I felt if he didn’t have a girlfriend. I started getting these feelings a week before I broke up with my then boyfriend (that wasn’t why we broke up). It’s been about a month now and these feelings have only gotten stronger. 

The thing is we’re really open about everything and I did confess back then that I had a small crush on him but that I knew we were just friends etc. he told me that at one stage he had had a crush on me but he sorta made the decision not to act on those feelings, sorta suppress them I guess. 

I’ve only known him for like 4 months but we’re so close. I also don’t have many other friends. Part of me hoped I could just sit it out until he broke up with his girlfriend but it’s too painful. I do honestly think he likes me, maybe a little bit more than a friend. We just have this connection. But I don’t think he’ll act on it. He certainly wouldn’t cheat (not that I’d want him to)

It makes me feel kinda guilty. Whenever we’ve been hanging out and he leaves I just feel like shit. I think it’s actually affecting my mental health. I know I should get over him but it’s so hard, I just don’t know how to. Maybe I could tell him how I feel? I don’t think it would affect his relationship but it might allow me to get some space from him and move on. But at the same time I’m so used to seeing him like every second day so that would be really hard.",29May2019,2
374,"I live an apartment style condo.  Picture an apartment complex, but we all own the apartments.  Everything inside my walls is mine, the outside of the building is the responsibility of my HOA.  My apartment is on the 3rd floor, which is also the top floor.  

I’ve lived there for 5 years now and during the first year I was sitting on the couch one night and heard what I thought was a cricket which I thought was odd since I’m on the 3rd floor, until I saw my cat go crazy and realized very quickly it was a bat she was smacking around as it scuttled across my living room floor trying to take flight.

In the last year I’ve had 4 more bats enter my home.  I have no idea how they’re getting in.  I do not open my windows ever, A/C is running 24/7.  I’ve left several messages with my HOA about the issue and they never answer when I call, and do not reply to my voicemails.  I’ve even had my realtor call on my behalf and the same thing just silence.  I spoke to my neighbor the other day right after I had to capture bat #5 in front of my new girlfriend who will not sleep over at my house anymore as she has a crazy fear of bats.  He informed he has also had bats get into his place as well as a bird once.  

I hear them scratching and moving around in the walls and ceiling every single night when I lay down for bed and that is not an exaggeration.  It’s disgusting and unnerving after so many have managed to get into my place.  I *believe* they’re getting into the walls/ceiling and then somehow entering through my air vents.  It’s driving me insane and now I’m to the point where every creek or noise I hear in the middle of the night I assume it’s a bat flying around and jump out of bed to investigate.  To me this is a safety issue.  Bat #2 I actually was asleep when it got in and woke up to it flying around my bedroom which resulted in me having to get a rabies shot just to be safe because that’s what I was told to do.

What are my options here?  My brother suggested I hire someone to handle it and then send the bill to my HOA but I’m not sure if that’s exactly legal.  I wouldn’t even know who to call though.  An exterminator?  Someone to patch up all the holes around the building where I believe they’re entering from?  An HVAC guy to check if my vents are properly sealed?  

Please help I’m running on like 3 hours of sleep every night since the last one got in.  Thanks for reading and sorry this was long winded.",29May2019,1
375,"A little background...

I've been unemployed for 10 years, there's a lot that has contributed to that but currently I'm having trouble even job hunting, my options for jobs are very limited due to autism but then my qualifications and experience for the jobs I can apply for is limited too, and although I get good feedback when I do get interviews I'm turned down because of that big gap in employment. 

As a result of this I've lost 10 years of my life, years in my twenties and thirties which means I've missed out on the normal fun of my twenties, I'm not where I 'should' be in life in terms of a career, home, partner, and kids. This is killing me, I always wanted kids but at 36 that doesn't look like it's going to happen now, and I don't know what the point of my life will be without kids. 

I have no friends and I've no idea how to make friends when in this position, I have no hobbies as I simply can't afford hobbies so I have a lot of time and nothing to do. This has lead to severe depression, I'm lonely and starved for even the most minimum social interaction. It's killing me.

I can't seem to get any help from anywhere. Employment support can't help as I'm already doing things right re. I have a good CV, I volunteer, I get good feedback when I do have interviews, etc. I've been to therapy multiple times but they agree they can't help me as my depression is understandable in the situation, I don't spend all day in bed and I try to get out, there's no mental barriers when it comes to work.

The current situation...

Any job I go into has to be a good fit, if I go into a job and it doesn't work out then I will end up back on welfare but at lower rate and worse situation. 

I've been volunteering at a charity for over a year and I think I do a good job, I've been desperate to do more so when a job came up I decided to apply. The job was a trainee position, it was the lowest job in the office and one I could do with my eyes closed. This job was great because I knew I could do it, I had experience working there already so I thought I'd be a shoe in, and it can lead into multiple other roles in the office. The interview wasn't great, but also wasn't bad.

It looks like I don't have the job. 

Now I'm not sure what to do because...

A. I'm still a volunteer. It's almost as difficult to get voluntary jobs as paid jobs, and volunteeribg for this charity looks great on a CV, so it's not like I can just easily go into a new volunteer role elsewhere. I need a volunteer job to stop myself going insane but also as it's my only work experience and way to get references. I'm going to feel like a joke going into volunteer when people know I was turned down for the job, seeing the two managers who interviewed me. 

B. If I can't even get this job then what's the point in trying? I've been unemployed for so long, I just can't get back into work, if I couldn't get into this...what should have been a breeze for me to get...then I'm struggling to see any point in even trying any more. This has been my attitude for some time, for obvious reasons, but this is worse. 

With no point in looking for work that also translates to no point in living...I've no chance of friends, a partner, anything. I literally have nothing in life and it looks like there's no way of changing that, every attempt I make to get anywhere, the smallest attempt to improve my life just falls flat. I don't see any point in living.",29May2019,2

378,"My sweet girl Ashley was sexually assaulted two nights ago. We are home from university and her parents were away on holiday while it happened. She was at home alone with her highschool aged sister. Ashely was invited to her close friends house (in their neighborhood) for some wine and dinner. Sadly she drank a little too much so she decided to head back home early. It should be noted that she is in a cast from a recent surgery so she has to scooter around. One of her long time family friends, Mr.Asshole (21M) offered to help her home. Ashely has been sleeping on the couch downstairs since her surgery prevents her from walking to her room on the second floor. Being quite drunk, the last thing she remembers is getting home and setting herself down on the couch to fall asleep. She woke up the next morning in their guest bedroom without shirt on. Mr.Asshole had texted her the night before asking her “to not tell your mom that I took advantage of you”. Ashley cannot remember what happened past falling asleep on the couch.

Mr.Asshole later told Ashley on the phone the  morning  after that he carried her to the guest room and took her shirt off because “you kinda woke up so I took that as a yes” past that he was vague with the details. Not giving up much. 

Her highschool aged sister got home right as  Mr.Asshole was coming BACK AGAIN to “check” on her AGAIN.. Ashely’s sister didn’t let him in again thankfully. 

Ashely is hesitant to file a report because she just wants to be done with it.* I am 100% on her side no matter what.* However I want to push her to file a report. I think that even though Mr.Asshole and the Asshole family are long time family friends, this **should not exempt** them from justice. Ashely just doesn’t want to cause more pain/ drama than there already is. Her mother somewhat agrees. 

So reddit, 

a) what should I do? Should I keep voicing my opinion to Ashley? Or should I back off and let her make a choice?

b) what should Ashely do? Is it worth ruining deep friendships over this?",29May2019,7
379,"For my older Brother’s 16th Birthday, he got a $10,000 car from a family member, who also promised he’d do the same for me and my younger brother when we turned 16.

 My 16th Bday was yesterday, and I did not get a car or even any money towards one. I didn’t tell the member I was bothered, but i can’t help but feel angry that my brother got multiple nice cars (he wrecked 3 cars, including the birthday one) and I didn’t get anything. I’m so tired of being dependent on my parents to take me to and from work/school when I know how much they hate it. 

I wish I could say I knew why this is, but the family member did not give any indication of why he made this obviously angry choice. We are moving out of state this summer, though, and this particular person (and others on this side of the family) have resented the fact, and this wouldn’t have been the first time the person withheld gifts or something because he is angry and wants to manipulate us. 

Idk how to handle the situation. I really wanted a car so I could hang out with my friends here before I leave this summer, which I can’t do now since my parents work all the time and can’t take me to places they go. My parents say when they sell our house they’ll buy me a car, but I know that won’t happen since they don’t trust me to drive after my brother had his problems.",29May2019,0

383,"I’m in grad school, once I graduate I will move and need to decide where to live. I have two places in mind and have been thinking about this for the past year, but I still don’t know. I would appreciate any input.

City A: I’ve visited this city many times as I have several friends that live there. Myself and most of these friends are LGBT, and I feel like ideologically we are very similar. This city is a hub for music, art, food, and has a lot of parks and natural beauty. Unfortunately, it has a lot of traffic and a large percentage of young college students. I would not live in the city but a little bit outside to have lower rent and also because my job is home health and it would be better to be closer more in the suburbs.

City B: I lived here for a year and a half before going to grad school. I also have some friends here, as well as family that lives about an hour away. Most of the people I know are from a job that I had while I was there, with a company that I loved. It is the kind of place that I could see myself growing a lot professionally, and there is a good chance I would be able to work there if I move back. I really like the people I know but I haven’t known them as long and we don’t ‘gel’ as much as with my friends in City A. However the LGBT “scene” is not very prevalent here, it is much more conservative that City A. I feel like this is important because I’ve been in the closet or half in half out my entire life and I would like to be able to date and live my life openly in a more accepting place. This city is smaller than City A, and I would probably pay a little extra to have an apartment in the city within walking distance of museums, restaurants, and shops. I enjoyed my time living there previously but it was hard for me to meet people then. I would probably make more of an effort if I moved there again.

I keep thinking about this and thinking I will probably move to City B. But then I start thinking how I would regret not moving to City A. And vice versa. I think that no matter which city I choose I’ll feel regret for not choosing the other city.

I’ve made a pros and cons list, I’ve talked to some friends, but they are understandably biased due to which of the two cities they live in. I could move to City A for a few years with the intention of moving to City B later but that seems like a lot of work and isn’t very compatible with how my job functions. I would be doing the same work in either city, I would be paid about the same. The different is that I would probably be self-employed in City A without other employees, and in City B I would be an employee with day to day working alone but with opportunities to participate in employee events in person.

Does anyone have any advice? I still have another year to think about it and make a decision but this has been on my mind for at least a year already with no decision.

Thanks.",29May2019,1

Just the other day, she started telling me about how her entire family abuses her, both physically and emotionally (I suspect sexual abuse too).

My boyfriend has a 6 month of french bulldog who he got 2 months ago from his cousin who used to leave the dog alone all day.

The older dog is showing food aggression when the puppy goes to eat. He’s usually an extremely calm dog but since this puppy came into the picture he’s been very good aggressive.

These dogs always have dog food laid around so they eat when they feel like it. I really do agree with this because 1. dogs sometimes eat when they’re bored and they don’t really know how to stop themselves overeating 2. it’s hard for us to potty train the pup correctly bc if he eats when he wants to, there’s no proper toilet training in place 3. the pup is going to become overweight like the older dog if this continues 

The puppy is my boyfriends but my boyfriend lives with his family still

What do i do ? I know the dogs really wouldn’t benefit from being free fed anymore but i’m not sure how to go about this. The vets told my boyfriend and i that the older dog has under a year left to live if he doesn’t lose weight

388,(18 years old) Hi so last summer I had a girl who liked me who I decided not to date for multiple reasons. She was dating a new guy every month and I didn’t want to just be another guy. I also was so focused on my business that I was to distracted to realize this. Sadly at the beginning She got in a relationship that sadly lasted all school year and is still lasting to this day. They don’t have a great relationship and they have broke up 4 times since they started dating. So high school is ending and she is leaving her sophomore boyfriend behind. We are both going to a community college that is 20 minutes away.

405,"TLDR: How did you, or how does one, determine which field to go back to school for? 

Looking for advice with “soul searching” in determining what to potentially go back to school for. I’m a 31 year old female currently working 2 part time jobs within the social services field. I have a degree in the arts, which really doesn’t qualify me for a lot despite adding a lot of transferable skills for my resume.

For the last few years I’ve been thinking very heavily on returning back to school to try and acquire a more stable career path. A big roadblock for me is that I really have no idea what sort of career I’d like to delve in to. I’ve applied in the past, unsuccessfully, to masters programs in social work. I’ve also volunteered at a few different places to see if certain fields might be suitable for me. I don’t think I’ve found it yet. I’m at a loss of what to do or how to proceed. I know my jobs right now are not viable long term and I feel limited in what I can apply for. Just looking for some help, or advice on fields I haven’t even thought of.",29May2019,1
406,"I just finished my second year of university, so technically I'm no longer in his class. His class was an introduction to AI module, and honestly, I didn't do the best. One of my assignments I left until last minute and only passed because he gave me pity points.

I just fully finished exams, so I wanted to go back and try to redo the assignment, not the exact same thing, but the similar methods and algorithms to solve a different problem (his was navigating around a graph, mine was those 3x3 and 4x4 square puzzles).

409,"Okay I need some advice. Sunday was my son's 6th birthday. I am married 10 years with 1 kid btw. We had a birthday party with 10 kids all about 6 or under and most of their parents left them in our care at a busy giant play place. I take this seriously and was running around like a mad woman serving pizza, getting drinks for the kids, chatting with the moms/dads who were there, refereeing disputes and cutting birthday cake on top of keeping an eye on these kids. Anyway my mom was at the party and she was nattering away to me about something and I said...""why don't you come for breakfast tomorrow and we can chat"". She agreed. That night my son had a friend sleep over, they stayed up late and by the time everyone was in bed I was done and crashed. We all slept late the next morning (Sunday). When we got up the boys were immediately cranky and were scrapping a bit (which I am not used to being a mom of 1) and one of them knocked over the water cooler on my hardwood floor and it was crazy. I started to make breakfast and by the time we finished I got a text from my mom (who lives down the block) asking when she should come for breakfast. Immediately I remembered my invite and felt horrible. I apologized profusely and repeatedly, and I was/am genuine in my remorse but she lost it on me. Said I was the most inconsiderate person, said I never think of her ever which is not true you will just have to take my word for it. And is now freezing me out. She told me that while I am a good daughter that doesn't make up for this and if this is how I wanted to conduct my life I could go to hell she was going to treat me the exact same way and see how I like it. She also did not come to wish my son a happy birthday, which cut me deep since I had to explain to my son that she didn't come because she was mad at me. My cousin is a psychologist and while she had made clear she cannot diagnose my mom with anything she said based on past behavior she has witnessed and interactions she has had with my mom she thinks my mom has some BPD. My sister cut off contact about 8 years ago going so far as to cut her from her wedding. My dad and her are divorced and she cannot work for other people or maintain friendships or romantic relationships. All that being said I do actually love my mom. I also know she loves me. The problem is nothing for her is ever enough and I walk on egg shells worried about the next time I make a mistake or screw up even only a small slip or misstep. Okay so here is where I need advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I know I screwed up and I am so very sorry about it...but she won't accept my current apology as is. I think she wants me to beg and grovel for forgiveness. Do I do this? 
2. She was supposed to help us with childcare this summer 3 days a week. Even if we patch things up do you think I should reconsider this? For what it is worth she is not dangerous or anything. But  with me, and only me, she can be mean and vindictive. It wouldn't be a hardship financially to find other care but she was going to do it for free so it would have been a huge help.",29May2019,1

412,"So I've worked at my job for about a year and a half now. Recently, for the past couple of months, the company I work for has been trying to improve the business through a certain training program for their leadership. Something they've recently implemented at my job was a huge whiteboard in each section of the shop with all sorts of useful information for all employees. One section of the board is dedicated to ideas. Anyone can present any idea if they'd like to voice it out.

Yesterday I had thought of an idea and wrote it down. I'm not going to explain my idea here on reddit, just to ensure my anonymity. But, the results of my idea was mainly focused on helping to improve employee retention and also to build a good connection with the customer.

I presented my idea to my supervisor, someone who I've grown to admire a lot more recently and even find a bit attractive (I try to keep this as professional as I can out of respect for him and his fiance). And his reaction really crushed me, he didnt even get past 1/3rd of what I had written down before laughing about it and reacting in a way that came off as extremely ridiculous. 

I took my idea and threw it in the trash, I couldn't even really face him afterwards throughout the rest of my shift. It was extremely humiliating for me because he was the one who encouraged me to think of ideas and yet crushed me before I could even get a chance to explain the whole thing. 

Moving forward from the humiliation, I don't know how to continue to approach him when required. What can I do to move past this professionally?

TlDR; I presented an idea to my supervisor (whom I admired) after his encouragement, and he laughed at it as if it was extremely ridiculous before getting through 1/3rd of it. It really crushed me and I can't look at him the same way anymore. How can I get past this?

Hey r/Advice, hope all of you are well. So a little background, I've been working with a company every summer for the past 4 years doing IT, and going to university in the fall and winter. 

I went to school for sociology and psychology and graduated just after Christmas and had been looking for work for a few months. I ran into my old IT boss when i was visiting home and he offered me a job until i find something in my field. So ive been back working IT since March. So fast forwrd to today, my boss calls me into his office and offers me a full time IT position and offers to pay for some certification to improve my knowledge in the area. But its a 2 year minimum contract. And i will make about $45k a year with full benefits.

So heres where it gets tricky i got offered a job in my field about two weeks ago, but it will only be a part time position where i make $15/hr and it starts in October. Its in the city in which my girlfriend lives in so i would have a place to stay 

I put 4 years of my life into this degree and i really want a job in my field. But at the same time i do like IT but im not sure if thats what i want to do with the rest of my life. I would honestly love some unbiased advice if you don't mind.

425,"Mostly close ones, at times when I express my opinion. It started pretty early when I was 8-9, usually during times when my mother and my sister were pissed off with me for some reason. They would call me a bore for nagging too much. I even remember a phrase ""a decent girl/woman wouldn't wanna be with you"". Luckily I was smart enough not to buy that shit, but I never really understood why. I was just a kid who wanted video games, toys, pets, etc. I don't remember myself being a pain in the ass for anyone. 

Now, after 20+ years, I keep getting the same stuff. Now from my wife as well. I just express my opinion during conversations, I don't force it on anyone. I don't say I'm right and they're wrong. This blaming happened so many times that I started to speak differently with them. I started saying introductory explanations sometimes, ""I would personally do... /I don't think I'm right/etc"". I don't understand why they value my opinion so much that it affects them like that. I've lost count how many times I had to say that I'm not trying to judge, it's just words... if you believe you're right why would you care. I cannot lie to them, I cannot say typical bullshit phrases just to keep a serious conversation going.

With some of my colleagues (mostly women as well). ""Oh, you're such a bore"". Dammit, whats wrong with me? Now with them, it happens when they think I have to accept what they say without saying anything in response, i.e. you're a man you should suck it up. WTF? I still don't know how to deal with this sexist bullshit.

Is it just a psychological counter attack for self-defence? If so, why do they feel attacked by my opinion? I try to be diplomatic with how I speak, I don't raise my voice, I remain calm, etc. When I don't say anything, when I try to remain neutral - they don't like that either.

Is there some problem with me? There's definitely a pattern here. Yes, I like to go deep into things, I give a lot of thought to things sometimes, I usually try to look at things from different perspectives, I have certain morals, maybe I talk too much, but I'm a person, it's not such bad of a character to go hysterical about, no?

426,"This sounds so ridiculous and I’m so embarrassed even posting this but I’m sick of it. 

I’m a female in my mid 20’s. I have pooping anxiety!! I can’t poop at work, or at my boyfriends house. We move in together on Saturday and I’m actually terrified for this reason. 

A bit of backstory: 

I dated my first boyfriend in high school. We both lived with our parents so we never really got to the gross habits stage with each other. He was super uncomfortable about bodily functions. He never even farted in front of me once and we dated for 4 years. I feel like because he was so uncomfortable about it it made me feel like I shouldn’t be doing it in front of him either. 

After that into my early twenties I dated a really mentally abusive and manipulative guy. We also lived together. At the beginning of our relationship he would “joke” about how “girls don’t poop”. It wasn’t a joke. He told me he never wants to know or have any idea that I actually have bowel movements (wtf I know). I never told him I was going to the bathroom, never farted around him, nothing! It got to the point where we were living together and I couldn’t poop if he was home. 

I now come home from work to go to the bathroom, and can only poop in public bathrooms if I am the only one in the bathroom. Sometimes I’ll wait for other women to leave just so I can feel “okay” to do my business. It’s gotten so annoying. I can’t believe I actually waste gas almost daily to drive home and POOP. 

Now I’ve been kind of living with my boyfriend at his parents place for a while but I still go back home to my parents almost daily. If he’s home I can’t poop. I’ll go back to my parents to poop. If his family is home I can’t poop either. I get this absolutely dreadful anxious feeling. I know it’s irrational, but I can’t bring my body to do it. It’s like my bowels will not physically let me poop unless I feel comfortable. 

He is very open and I know it sounds silly but we’re totally cool with farting in front of each other and all that. That took me a long time to be comfortable with.  He is open with going to the bathroom too. He knows all of this. He tells me “just go to the bathroom here!!” And doesn’t understand why I can’t and assures me there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I can’t help it. 

I don’t want to move into our place and have to schedule my bowel movements for when he’s not there, or to go somewhere else just so I can poop! I never thought that this would be something that affected my life so much that I actually change my routine for it. It’s crazy and frustrating. 

So I guess my question is: has his ever happened to anyone else as an adult?? Is there anything I can do to try and get over it or do I just have to suck it up and do it??

Thanks in advance!",29May2019,1

This led to me being very self destructive and I had one year that was awful. I didn't ever sleep with anyone else, but I was weird and flirty and, I feel, desperate. It was a very sad period and nearly led to us breaking up. However, it actually led to me seeking help and I've had therapy and I'm on antidepressants and anti anxiety medication. I feel like a different person now. Like everything that happened was someone else. 
Things have been like a dream since then. At the moment, I work in my dream job, live with my boyfriend and our two cats and everything is perfect. I am so happy with how things have turned out, but I feel like I don't deserve any of it. I don't deserve to smile, or be loved, or be wanted. 
I just can't forgive myself for how awful and emotionally abusive I was. It's like I'm just waiting for my partner to leave because I was so cruel to him. And I can't even feel like I blame him.
I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but sometimes I feel like the only way I can stop feeling like this is to kill myself. It's not even a sad thought, it feels inevitable.
We have spoken about it, and he is so forgiving and it's like he's forgotten about it.

So, here it goes. I'm turning 30 next month, been unemployed for the past year due to being epileptic (employers ask for a medical certificate and get scared when they see it). I'm stuck with cleaning toilets (not complaining, a job is a job and not being ashamed to how I'm earning my money, as long as it's an honest work). The only problem is that it's a part part time job, only working around 5-6 hours per week, basically making just enough to pay for food.

TL;DR I got a job abroad and I can't afford the relocation costs. I have started a GoFundMe campaign in hopes of being able to raise up the necessary sum so I can get a normal job. I have a deadline of 1 month to communicate to my employer when exactly I can start working.

I work a shitty dead-end job where people spend 10 hours a day getting yelled at for not moving cardboard boxes onto pallets fast enough, and the whole time all I can think about is how short and fragile life is and how much I want to spend what time I have on this Earth enjoying it. I want to write and perform music, read books, visit museums, explore nature. I can't convince myself to care about this job, or bills, or petty personal relationship issues when ultimately it doesn't matter at the end.

I would prefer this not to happen but I’m not sure how to stop them because there is 6 of them and they have done things like this before to me and I could not stop it. Currently I see my options as

1. Try to call the police when they come to the car, but that would require me to catch them in the act (they plan on coming one night this week so I would have to stay up), and they would most likely run.
2. Put my car in the garage so they can’t get to it, but I can see them just destroying something else of my property or waiting for when I can’t put my car in the garage and then doing it.
3. Buy a security camera and try to catch them in the act, but the footage might not even pick up their faces and I would have spent money on a camera and had my car destroyed for nothing.

451,My brother failed his first year at college. He had always struggled with school but then somehow got into the school he really wanted to go to. I thought that he would mature and take school seriously in college but I think the freedom got to him and he just failed. He failed first semester and came home and lied to everyone and sent a screenshot of fixed grades. I didn’t believe it so I snuck onto his laptop and found out he failed every single class. I confronted him and he just said it’s my life I got it. So only my brother and I know that he failed. He begged me not to tell our parents. So he goes back to school for second semester and I constantly checked up him and ask how he’s doing and I guess he was lying but he said he’s got it he’s doing fine. So he comes home again and sends out grades and I don’t believe it again Bc I know he lied the first time. So I look and I see he failed every single class except one the second semester. So now his gpa is .24 or something like that. I said I was gonna tell our parents and he flipped out. He wouldnt even admit to me he failed even though I know. He just kept saying it’s my life it’s my life. I just don’t know what to do. If I tell my parents it will break their hearts and rip our family apart.

Right now she is trying to get rid of stuff because she has a inspection in her home coming up, but her idea of doing that is just to move stuff into rooms that she doesn't use and the reason she doesn't use those rooms is because you can't get inside them due to hoarding. She buys everything cheap saying she will sell it for profit but those days never come.

She told me to help her get rid of some stuff and I said yes but she said leave it to tomorrow, I said why not now it will take just a few minutes which it literally would have done and she replies with don't stress me out you will give me a heart attack.

These kinds of things have been repeating for around 15 years with no change and I can't take it anymore. This is not a healthy way to live. She needs help but won't accept it so everyone has given up even though she says no one will help her.

When I was 9 years old, I was assaulted by a 15 year old neighbor/friend of the family who was babysitting me. I suffered a traumatic brain injury due to being beaten repeatedly with a broken chair leg. I was tough and healed after many surgeries and 4 months in the hospital. The assailant was sent to a youth correctional facility until he turned 20. 

Fast forward 35 years later. I am a grown woman with a beautiful young daughter of my own. I thought I had dealt with this trauma as a child, but I find myself growing incredibly bitter, angry and seeking revenge on this person for what he did to me. From what I have learned, he re-entered society and has not been in trouble with the law since. He has a family and I found them on Facebook. I don't even know why I looked him up. His page made me sick with all the happy selfies and his children praising what a great father and person he is. I want to know if he has even told them about his past. If they even have a clue that I am out here - still hurting, still in pain from his actions?

Now, I work in Tech and I'll be kidding myself if I didn't acknowledge U.S. is the place to be for a techie who wants to work on the most cutting edge stuff. Since I still have a chance to use my approved green card, I am having massive REGRET and want to go back to the U.S. This would mean either my wife leaving her job that she likes yet again or move to U.S. without a job. Once my terror of moving to U.S. subsided and I did an analysis and found out that we will be making around half of our earning potential in the U.S., here in Canada. Moreover, we are both Canadian PRs, so there is the mental stress of having to apply for citizenship later (which in some cases such as ours, since I applied for U.S. green card) can take years. So, I find myself in a situation where I live severely underpaid and full of stress for next several years of my life or move to the U.S. now even if it means throwing all of my wife's sacrifice of moving back for me in the trash can. May be I am just a paranoid person. I don't know what to do? How do I save my marriage, our careers and my mental health? Have I lost it all already by not going to the U.S. when I had the chance?",29May2019,1
475,"So a bit of background. My boyfriend and I have been together like 2 months. It's going pretty well. He *loves* concerts. Loves them. He likes to go to the indie bands that play for like $15-25. He doesn't fw the $250 concerts too much although he would. That's not important.

&amp;#x200B;

The important thing is I have only been to a music festival...years ago. It was Carolina Rebellion. I hate metal music and I was sneezing out black goop for a week. I didn't want to go at all but my family dragged me along and I guess my only ""concert experience"" was just awful and I don't know what to do at an indoor concert. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go and be supportive of him. I want to be interested in the things he is interested in but I have really bad anxiety when it comes to doing things I have never done before and know nothing about. Like I'm sure I'm overthinking this so much and as soon as I go to one concert I'll be like ""hell yeah let's go to 100 more!"" but I'm so nervous! It's totally silly I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what do people do? Do they just stand there and watch music and clap and listen or do they dance and jam out or do half the people stand around and half the people jam out or does everyone just chill and vibe and get drunk? What should I wear? Do I dress like I'm going to a frat party or like I'm just chilling on the couch or in street clothes or does it not matter?

I just want to be able to enjoy the same things my boyfriend does and not let my anxiety turn me into a debbie downer. Any advice on how to do the concert thing?",29May2019,1

479," 

I didn’t want to write this post but i really had enough.

My mother left me when I was seven or eight. She just left one night, with no explanations. Prior to that my parents had fought badly. My whole early life had been filled with violence, both directly and indirectly. I was secretly abused by my maid from the age of 4 till she left. My parents’ families would fight. Divorce was ugly--I remember being visited by police often. 

My mother...I used to love her. She would come to see us once or twice a year and not bother to check on us. My parents hate each other till this day. They both have faults.

She lies constantly. She never cared. I just had a call with her and expressed how her actions affected me--she had no remorse. No...nothing. Just “I gave you complete freedom and trust.”, “Do what you want to do. It’s your life.” 

Not a single apology.

Not a single worry.

Nothing.

I questioned if she was a psychopath. She treated it as nonsense.

“If you want to do anything, I’ll pay for you.”

“What, oh okay fine fine fine, you want dinner?”

After I ranted at how she didn’t care. I just wanted her to….love me affectionately. I didn’t care about gifts...just be human...maternal….

The most flippant...uncaring attitude to anything I said. 

My father’s family HATED her stinking attitude. Her stinking response?

“Don’t care about what others say.”

She remarried and had another daughter who is now 10. She threw her to her now-split husband to raise. Only to visit sometimes. Just like what she did to me and my sister.

Till now I’m so horrified. How can a mother, a mother be that….apthetic? How is it humanely possible to not have any maternal insticts or urge to love the child you BIRTHED? I sometimes doubt if she was my mother.

She’s said cruel things to me before and didn’t care. She would be perfectly fine not contacting me for months, yet demand me to unblock her if I got angry.

Because of both my parents, I literally do not know what it’s like to be truly selfless. I’m seen as bratty, a princess. It could not me further from the truth. I just don’t know what its like to sacrifice. 

My father’s wife, my stepmother--hated me. HATED me. For wanting attention from my father who took care of us but wasn’t able to be emotionally there. She could call me an actress, faker.

My father would side with her. 

The only people in my life who I should have trusted. Loved. Broken. Leaving me alone. Telling me to get lost. My father raised me but he calls my problems bullshit. 

I’m terrified of the world. 

If my own mother can not care about me like that, I frighten to even see what the world is like. At work, I smile at only a select few I trust, but to others I constantly think they are thinking bad of me and I am very defensive and withdrawn. 

Most people have their mum or dad’s love to tide them through.

I have nobody.

I just want to die.

I’m a young adult, and I’m finding it increasingly hard to live in this cruel world without any love from anyone.",29May2019,1
480,"I [f21] haven’t had a boyfriend in well over 2 and a half years, verging on three... I had a terrible break up with someone I had dated for 4 years of my life, all through high school and then first year of college. We may have been young but he was a major part of my life until he wasn’t. 

I went on two dates with one person since then and that ended with him not picturing me as anyone other then a friend with benefits when I wanted more. 

So after nearly 3 years I’ve developed a sort of mistrust of guys that’s made it hard for me to relax and let my guard down. I’ve had a lot of stressors these past 3 years none of which are relevant to title of this post, but in light of these stressors one of them is that I’ve gained and lost a lot of weight.

After nearly 3 years I’ve met someone, someone online that I never thought I’d actually like. But damn I do, which surprises me more then any of you could ever know. We’ve been talking for a few weeks and have been planning a date to meet. 

What I’m worried about is when things progress as they normally do in a relationship is that eventually we’ll have sex, which I am looking forward too, but I’m also nervous and insecure. I’ve lost and gained so much weight from the last time I had sex, that stretch marks cover my belly and hips, and there’s still some pudge under it that I’m still working to get rid of. 

My question to you, is, do guys mind stretch marks when they’re looking for sex? And do guys really adhere to the “third date” rule? I really like this guy but I don’t know if I want to have sex so soon?",29May2019,2

484,"Hey reddit, I've been stuck in a pretty unique situation for quite a while now. I've talked to friends and family and I haven't yet received any solid advice on how to proceed.

I'm working as a software engineer for a pretty well known company somewhere near the west coast. It's a great job with good pay and benefits. There's a lot of flexibility as well. I get to work from home and rarely need to go in.

The problem? There's nothing to do. All I do is sit at home and see if anything comes up. Sometimes, some work comes along and I do actual work. However, most of the time, I do nothing the entire day. I am getting paid good money to sit at home and basically browse reddit.

I know, I know... it is something that many dream of, but trust me, it gets old after a while. I like to think that I am pretty good at what I do. I work on side projects at home when there's no work (almost everyday). But that's not enough to give me purpose in life.

However, now I've reached a point where it's seriously starting to affect my life. I am losing purpose. I feel worthless. I do not discuss about my job with others since I feel I'm useless and don't do anything productive. Friends and family do not understand my predicament. If I ever share my story with someone, they fail to understand and instead feel like I've struck gold.

I've spoken to my manager regarding lack of work, though not openly. I have hinted that I want/need more work and that there's some downtime every now and then. However, I stop short of actually saying that I've spent 2 weeks doing nothing since I don't want to lose my job.

From what I've seen, I'm in this unique situation. My colleagues seem to be busy and do not have as much free time as me.

When there's work for me to do, I absolutely ADORE this job. My colleagues are great and there's lot of potential to grow here.

I started searching for a new job immediately and found a job at a jewelry store, long story short they were really awful employees and after one day I knew they were trying to take advantage of young kids in need of a summer job so I quit after my first day.

486,"The one thing that can pull you through whatever you're trying to move on from is momentum and motion. 

Find yourself an activity that you can truly indulge in. Find yourself something that allows you to work alone, and do it all just for yourself. This will lead you to new opportunities, new places and new things. 

I think the reason ""staying busy"" works, is because it consistently triggers new thought cycles that require undivided thought and attention. Not only does it take your attention off of the given subject, but it will allow you to internalize what you need to think about later on (i.e what you're struggling with) from a less emotional and more well rounded state.

490,"I'm a 20 year old male and have been a pretty big loner my whole life. Growing up I never really had a drive to do good in school, it never really interested me in the topics they were teaching. Not in the way where I didn't pay attention because it was all to easy. I would understand the concept of what was being taught faster than others, and I was put at a distance from everyone else and couldn't connect. Skip to highschool and during the 4 years I didn't have any friends, played sports but again I never really connected with anyone, and I haven't had a close/best friend since elementary. 

Nowadays, I'm trying to improve my mental health, and push to talk to more people in the hopes that it would help me find something to do with my life. However, Everytime I talk to someone new it still feels like I never connect with anyone. I always feel like I'm trying to solve this great big puzzle but there are pieces missing. Honestly, I am starting to believe that something IS actually wrong with me. Which I accept, I understand that everyone has flaws and this is just mine. 

I have a past childhood trauma that resulted I'm PTSD and extreme anxiety attacks if I was in a new environment. I wouldn't say I have control over my panic attacks but I'm much better at recognizing and calming myself when one appears.

493,"So some background: I'm not close with a lot of my family because of an abusive history with my father. It severed my relationship with his side of the family because, growing up, I thought they ""hated"" me too.  In 5th grade he told my brother and I we had a second brother. Then he only took us to see his side once and I remember being scared the entire time. 

Fast forward a bunch of years. I'm with my boyfriend and he really likes old cities and traveling. I mention I have family in one of the cities he obsesses over and now he really wants to go. We plan this trip out over several months, just researching historic spots, looking up cool restaurants and bars, cool buildings etc. But we have so much to do and only two days to accomplish. 

Now the issue &gt; Even though we're strapped for time, I message my half brother and say we should grab breakfast while I'm out there. Then he says ""who needs raggity ass buildings when you have your family to see"" and then hes also trying to get me to go to a graduation bbq. I told him we're all on a pretty strict schedule because were only in for a couple of days (did not mention my boyfriend, he thinks I'm with friends from an architectural class. We dont want to meet eachothers family because we both have complicated backgrounds). Then he says ""my family needs at least 2-3 hours of my time"" so I said ""I like long breakfasts :) but if I'm not too tired at the end of the day, we can grab drinks"". Just now he invited himself on our tours of the city ""just lmk, then I can meet up with you guys where ever"". 

I understand he wants to spend time with me, but this was supposed to be a weekend as just us, away from *everying*. I dont have the same views of family as he does and honestly I'm already feeling overwhelmed by having to meet everyone for what feels like the first time.

496,"This is probably super selfish.

I love my mother, but she lives overseas. She normally comes back to the States once, sometimes twice a year to visit my sister and I, but because we're all getting spread out, it's been much more difficult to manage.

Because the flight overseas is absolutely *abysmal*, it doesn't really make sense to come over to less than two weeks. I'd been hoarding as much PTO (paid time-off) at work, *hoping* to coordinate with family so that I could see *everyone* during that two weeks, and hopefully have some time left over to take a trip *I* want to take at some point.

Thing is, I'm 31, and the last time I visited her, I was just turning 19. Granted, I *lived* with them for about three months (was going through a rough time), but still. I could tell she was getting hurt feelings about it, so I caved, scheduled the time off from work, and she's even paying for the flights there and back.

But... I *really* don't want to go.

I don't even have a particular reason. I just didn't care for England that much (sorry!), I don't feel like I'm in any sort of mood to enjoy *any* sort of travel. To be perfectly frank, I kind of just want to have a week completely to myself, where I don't have to interact with *anyone*. Not have to think about work, not have to ""put on a happy face"" or go along with plans I don't really care about.

At the same time, though, I feel like it would be *super* shitty to back out. For one, I don't even know if she *could* get the flight refunded. And even more than that, I feel like it would put kind of a dark cloud over everything, basically coming across like ""Nah, I don't really care anything about coming to see you, I'd rather you continue revolving around *me*"".

Still, it sucks knowing that I'm now also going to be in this position where I'd be lucky to get a week off to see my dad *or* my sister, and that would still leave me unable to take any real, *personal* time off (I love my family, but there's almost always *some* kind of argument or drama, even over short visits; I usually feel more exhausted than *before* the trip).

I dunno. I probably just need to bite the bullet and keep up with the plan to go visit. It just sucks, using up damn-near a full *year's* worth of PTO, going somewhere I don't *really* want to be, being stuck with my mom and stepdad for the *entire* duration.",29May2019,1

I just wanted to ask for advice on if I should quit or not, or steps I could take to maybe communicate my frustrations with my teammates, because I’m not the best at wording my thoughts. I even had a friend suggest I look for another team to join, and I’m considering it because I just don’t feel accepted in my own team which sucks 

TLDR: some members of my bike teams are being meanies and idk if I want to keep biking for this team or not",29May2019,1
505,"Okay, long story kinda:
My close friend’s (the one in the title - calling her Maddie) mum was diagnosed with cancer about a month or two ago. Obviously she’s going through some bad shit, and every now and then I’d message her/speak to her and ask her if she was doing okay or wanted to talk about anything. This was around once or twice a week because I didn’t really know what to say and didn’t want to seem like I was overstepping and/or being nosey. This was met with yeah I’m okay or no I’m fine.

Ffwd to today Maddie’s bf (calling him John) messaged our friend groups group chat. There’s 10 of us (including maddie and John), and he sent a huge paragraph about how we all claim she’s one of our best mates and she’s always there for us yet we’re never there for her.

I think this is a bit unfair, especially since most of us message Maddie fairly often to check up on her and such, and some of the girls in the group go to meet her sometimes to give her company (I thought just going to her house with just me n her there would be a bit weird since she has a bf). Also due to the fact that none of us know what she’s going through and that we really do care about her but just don’t know how to show it.

What I need advice with comes now. Maddie left our group’s group chat multiple times and someone added her back each time. I messaged her asking why she kept leaving, and after a small conversation about her not wanting to be our mates anymore she said we were all fake and that she was ignoring her phone for a bit.

What can I say or do to try to make up for this? Did I do anything wrong? What can me and the rest of my friends do to help her/stay friends?

Anything is appreciated since I’m kinda freaking out right now.",29May2019,1

So far the only hobbies I don't think requires motor skills is Origami, reading, meditation (if you consider it a hobby), video games which I could get an accessibility control for eventually like that xbox accessibility controller and chess or maybe DND.

514,"In the Summer of 2016 I got an 8 week old golden retriever puppy. In January of 2019 I broke my back. I can walk, but I have pain, and I am unable to sit or stand for longer periods than 30-60 minutes and then must lay down. I could not look after him so immediately had a friend take him as a temporary solution. 

It's now nearly June, and my back injury / pain persists. I've noticed some improvement, but think it will be a slow road to recovery (many more months or years) and I may have chronic pain / disability the rest of my life. He is a great dog, but golden's (at least him) need a good amount of exercise. This will not be a possibility for me. My dog is also a bit clumsy, and has bumped into me in the past (which was fine, but now it puts me at a fall risk / injury risk). Realistically, at this moment I am not strong enough to handle him and have hesitations even having him in the house and getting walkers for him.

My friend watching him is very active, runs him everyday, and from all reports is taking great care of him. I've been paying for any expenses like food since it's still my dog. He seems very attached to the dog now, and has politely asked about adopting him. I told him I would think about it. 

I think adopting him to my friend would be best for my dog long-term if my condition does not improve soon, but the thought of giving him away is devastating as I love him. If I recover in a a few months / a year I know I will regret giving him away. My friend has not asked for any money the 4 months or so he has been watching him, I've just been paying for food.

I'm already not in a great place emotionally due to my injury and the prospect of long term disability. But giving away my dog, my best friend, just seems crushing. I really don't have anyone else I know that would be willing or able to watch him, so cycling him through friends until I'm maybe better isn't an option (and I think cycling him would maybe be unfair to him) - and who knows how long I'll be recovering it could take months or years. My dog is only 3 and has many more years ahead of him. I could reach out to some other people about watching him, but maybe it's best to just adopt him to my friend who has been taking great care of him. 

So, should I give him to my friend? Or try to find a solution where I can keep him.",29May2019,1

Tldr My(23F) partner (29M) was diagnosed with cancer, because of this he takes a lot of his aggression out on me and doesn't appreciate me like i think he should. I want to ask for change but am afraid because he is going through a lot with is diagnosis

To keep it mildly vague, since I know a lot of friends and family troll reddit. For about 3 years I’ve been ‘seeing’ in the millennial fashion a man I am pretty much head over heels for. We sleep together, are very very close best friends, pretty much dating just without the words and pda. He is what keeps us from ‘officially’ dating. It's always been vague the reasoning, he's not very good at expressing himself and I truly don't believe he knows how too. He comes from a troubled family, a dead beat never there religious crazy father and a off her nut mother. Raised by his grandparents in a not so great place and with a long history of long term abusive in one way or another girlfriends, expect for his last. He admits that he thinks I could do much better then him, that he's not a good partner and is too confused for a relationship whether he wants to be or not. I've always respected that, honestly I don't care too much about a title and I am cool with doing my own thing every now and then when he hermits himself from the world. It only really annoys me when he pretends to our shared friends that we aren't super close and sleeping together despite every one of them knowing full well. Up until a few months ago I was fine with the arrangement. Of course I wanted to actually be dating but he’s worth waiting for and if we never officially date I love him and dont mind just enjoying the time I get ot have with him because truly he is my other half. 

However 6 or so months ago he was diagnosed with cancer, I wont say what kind because it will really out me to any of his friends as its rare but he has a high survival chance. This obviously turned our lives all upside down, he was brought to the emergency room after having a long set of seizures, I got a call from his roomate, also my friend, as soon as it happened. I was called even before his own mother and grandma. I dropped everything, rushed to the hospital and basically didn't leave until 2 months later after several life threatening surgeries. It was super fucking hard, he couldn't do much for himself so I pretty much had to take care of his every need since he was too embarrassed and proud to have the nurses do it for him. I really didn't mind, I spent a lot of time in the hospital when I was much younger myself and the dignity it takes from you is sometimes more crushing then the pain of whatever your going through, so if I could help relieve some of that I really didn't mind. That doesn't take away how hard it was to basically sleep an hour a day if I was lucky, barely shower, barely see the outside world, spend every day and night in a place that gave me sever flashbacks and anxiety, have to see someone I love in pain and calm them every hour of the day, miss out on holidays and free time, get fired from my job, put graduating college on hold, having to spend any free time I did have updating everyone who deemed themselves so important in his life to need up to the second personal updates (and there was a lot of people who were so full of themselves to think they needed that despite me organizing a mass email that gave exact updates weekly) and basically just adding a shit ton of fear, heartache, and stress on my life. 

When he was discharged from the hospital the first time I stayed with him for two months organizing all his doctors appointments, buying and making all his food, cleaning, doing laundry, basically living his entire life for him while he recovered as well as continuing take my last two classes to graduate and dealing with a nightmare of a roommate who plagued me none stop at my own apartment while I stayed at his. To make it worse when he was in the hospital he was super kind, thoughtful and reassuring to me. He couldn't stop showering me with love, was always so excited to see me and even towards the end proudly started calling me his girlfriend to all his doctors, friends and family. But as soon as we got out of the hospital he 180 flipped basically over night. Because of the nature of his surgeries he was super senitive to light, sound, had his apperance changed against his will, lost some memory and was in a lot of pain all the time and he ended up taking a lot of this out on me. He would randomly flare up like I had never seen, calling me names, picking apart my appearance and yelling at me for not taking care of myself even though I barely got the time to, finding any reason to start an argument with me and I never argued back. I just took it because I knew he wasn't in his right mind because of his pain, surgeries and medication but it really took an emotional toll on me. Even worse he took back calling me his girlfriend, when I brought it up he said he doesn't even remember saying anything like that and that it wasn't good to make such a drastic decision after such a traumatic event. It was my first breaking point. The word had never been important to me but to finally, after 3 years, hear the thing I wanted and then having it taken away like it was no big deal after all I had done was a lot. I cried and he made fun of me for being so sensitive. 

A few months after that things were back to normal for a while. It felt like before he got his diagnosis. We hung out all the time, he was super loving and flirty and seemed to care more than ever about me, wanted to spend time with me and was excited to do so. I didn't have to be his caretaker but I still helped here and there with what he needed or with filing all his paperwork. We felt like our ‘couple just without the title’ groove again and I was so happy. I wasn't in a good way in my personal life but it didn't seem to matter as he was doing much better, getting his cancer treatment and I finally graduated college. 

That seemed to be where things got weird again. I graduated and no one wanted to celebrate with me. I couldn't get a single one of my ‘friends’ to agree to any time to just come out and have a few drinks with me. No one even congratulated me other then my therapist which is really sad. I come from a very affluent neighborhood despite my family being lower middle class so I am riddled with stupid jealousy seeing my old high school mates getting to go on insane vacations, getting huge presents or having extravagant parties with all their friends. For my graduation I got a crumb cake that I bought for myself and ate the whole thing alone at home watching tv. My life at home is a misery as my current roommates are filthy messy and the whole place is rife with roaches whole the other manipulates others, has ruined half my wardrobe, bad mouths me to the other roommates and guilted me into getting to stay for another month at a lower price in her room by telling me she will kill herself if she can't. The people I was supposed to move in with basically used me to do all the apartment research on my own and then when they found a place through me cut me out of the equation and expected me to be okay with it. The only time people other than my partner talk to me is just to ask how he is doing. My abusive father is trying to ‘mend’ our broken relationship and calls me every day to berate my life choices then guilt me into going back to my hometown and living with him for 2 months. I have no money, no job, will be homeless in a few months and really have no friends. I have nightmares every night about my partner dying, every person I know and even strangers tell me to live him and never look back without knowing the whole story and think they get a say in my life.

And then my partner had another emergency and was admitted to the hospital again. This time for only a week and no surgeries but I really thought this was it. I thought he would die this time for sure. And again I never left his side not once. Again he was attentive and loving in the hospital then cruel and not wanting to see me when he got out. I got shit on by all his friends and family for not updating on his situation enough like I had the first time, got shit on by nurses for babying him, get bullied by my roommate and basically have nowhere to be treated like even a person. 

Today I stumbled across his ex girlfriends instagram. She's super nice and we are pretty much exactly alike in every way. Her most recent post was her gushing about all that her current boyfriend does for her. How he tells her how much he loves and appreciates her, all that he does for her, how they share their joy and support their failures and I kind of had a moment thinking ‘wow thats what I deserve’. Since I met my partner it has been all about him, with good reason I'll admit, but never once have I really been able to lean on him for anything, even complaining about normal things in life. I've only heard how much he appreciates me from him when he tells others how great I am then turns to me and says ‘you didn't hear that’ His communication is spotty at best and I infrequently get to see him even though we live super close because he ‘doesn't feel well’ but then I see him hanging out with his other male friends. Sometimes he talks a lot about how he thinks the tumor that caused his cancer fucked with his brain and made him break up with his ex as they were perfect for each other but one day he just decided to break up with her. One of the hardest things I had to do was sit in the hospital with him, have him start lamenting how much better he would have treated her without his tumor and crying because ‘she didn't deserve to be treated how I treated her’ Now I don't doubt that at all but I had to literally bit my tongue to tell him he's doing the same exact thing right now and lamenting breaking up with his ex when I have been here for him through everything cut my heart in pieces.

I feel stupid, like I've put myself in this dumb situation to manipulated and used when he is in pain or needs help and just didn't know when to say no. Everything I did was out of pure love for him and not wanting to see him suffer but truly I don't know when to say enough is enough. I feel like everyone is going to tell me to leave him and never look back but really think about how he must be feeling. His life already pretty shit before this all happened, no money, bad childhood, recent death in the family, works a dead end job then gets cancer, can't take care of himself, does not have the money to pay for it and has to endure several surgeries and years of chemo in the future. He always made it clear we weren't together despite the fact that we pretty much acted like it. I don't feel like he’s using me, truly. I feel like he really is confused and fucked up from his past and having a diagnosis like this fucks with you but I don't know what to do here. I don't feel like I have a right to complain or demand any of his time or for him to change but I just don't know how much longer I can keep going being treated like dirt then returning to my shitty life away from him. I love him more than anything and the good times are much more often and happier then the bad times and we have only ever had real problems during his illness but his treatment is 2 more years at this point and I dont know if his mood will ever improve. Logistically I don't want to waste my early 20s on someone who doesn't actually deserve or treat me well or will ever change even after he is cured and on the other hand I dont want to leave someone I love alone and to flounder when he's going through one of the worst times in his life. I feel stuck and hopeless and don't know if I am an ahole for even getting myself in this situation, if I can ask him to give a little despite what he's going through or if really I should actually just leave and have us be clearly only friends.",29May2019,1

518,"There's this guy I've been occasionally talking to online because he's extremely lonely, has no friends irl and sounds borderline suicidal. I've been messaging with him like once a week for around 6 months now, and he now sees me as his only friend and the only person who cares about him (might just he him being melodramatic, idk).

The thing that seems to make him the saddest is the fact that he doesn't have a gf and that girls don't seem interested in him. He told me that he hasn't interacted with a girl since middle school. 

Now, the thing is that he said that a girl came to talk to him, and that he gave her his phone number. The girl also apparently gave him her phone number back, but she got some guy to give it to him.

He was extremely excited, and told me the entire conversation he and this girl had. After reading the conversation, I'm like 99% sure the girl just gave him a fake phone number to fuck with him. His social skills are, admittedly, really bad and he seems to he completely incapable of distinguishing a joke or sarcasm from a serious statement. He often gets extremely upset over weird, seemingly insignificant things online, and if someone online does something that slightly annoys him, it's not unusual for him to type a multiple page essay in which he argues against people who were just joking around. He's still usually a good guy, although a bit strange, but he just seems to be utterly oblivious in social situations. 

Instead of realising that this girl gave him a fake phone number, he now thinks that there's something wrong with all the phones in his house because nothing happens when he calls the number the girl gave him. It's already been like 3 weeks since this happened and the girl hasn't called him either, but he's too oblivious to recognise this sign as well. 

Now he keeps sending me almost daily messages about how he's depressed because he's unable to contact this girl, and it's starting to get out of hand. I thought he would realise it himself with time, but now I realise that he never will unless someone tells him. I'm afraid to tell him because I'm afraid he'd commit suicide or lose all his confidence when talking to girls in the future, but on the other hand I feel like I should tell him so that he can move on and stop obsessing over this girl who I'm 99% sure was just fucking with him. 

Seriously , it's getting out of hand. He just sent me a message saying that he's thinking of ""using the dark powers of 4chan to identify and find this girl"". I don't really know what that means but it sounds really bad! No offense to this guy but sometimes he can be a little out of touch with reality. 

So should I tell him or not? I don't want to be responsible for anyone's suicide, but I feel like it's necessary to tell him so that he can get over it.",29May2019,1
519,"I found out today that my friend’s dad died (we’ll call him Friend A). Friend A and I played basketball together and were generally pretty close in high school. His parents knew my parents on a cordial level. The father battled with cancer.

Friend A and I have been not on great terms lately, but not necessarily because of each other, it’s because of our Friend B (my ex-best friend now). 

Friend B and I are no longer friends after I found out about some things that happened between B and my girlfriend. I found out that while I was out of the country for the first time on a trip, he was hanging out with my girlfriend and locked her in a car with him and raped her. She technically said yes after hours of trying to convince her, but only because at that point she thought physical harm might be done to her if she didnt oblige. 

My girlfriend didn’t tell me about this for months out of fear, but when she did I questioned everything I knew about both of them, listened to both sides and could tell that Friend B was lying about the situation and what happened before/during/after. So I stopped speaking to him obviously. We can’t press charges because there is literally no evidence and wouldn’t have the money to go through that process anyways. 

Friend A believes Friend B and not myself about the whole situation. I understand why that happened though, because they were friends long before I was friends with either of them. Friend A thinks Friend B and my girlfriend were consensual and a repeating occurence, but I know that it’s false.

The problem arose again today when Friend A’s dad died. My parents don’t know exactly what happened between Friend B and I, they just know we fell out, but they don’t know exactly what happened. My girlfriend doesn’t want anyone to know what happened, which I have respected.

I’m going to have to tell my parents what happened with Friend A’s dad, and they will get an invitation to the funeral more than likely. I still live at home with my parents, and they will want me to go to the funeral obviously. My parents are also very conservative, they haven’t heard officially from my mouth that me and my girlfriend are having sex. I don’t know how they will react. They are loving parents, but going to this funeral and seeing Friend B is going to cause a lot of emotional damage. I don’t want to see B ever again, and certainly not interact with him. But if I go to the funeral that will likely happen because of parents. I don’t know how I’m going to get out of this.

I do want to mention I do feel terrible for Friend A and want to support him. But it’s going to be difficult in that environment. 

Me and my friends are all 20, myself in college, Friend A not, Friend B is at a different college. My girlfriend is 19 and at my college (been together almost five years).

I have very little drive to learn more and improve due to severe lack of interest.  I feel I haven't really used my brain the last couple years.

I applied to work in financial aid for a local university.  The pay is 35k compared to my current 55k.  You can take free classes and my plan would be to take programming classes, with a bunch of credits for general ed transferring.  I'm interested in this field and did about 30 hours of independent study online and had fun with it.

This nets me less than staying at my job and just paying for the classes, but not by a ton.  It would also be like a 5 min commute compared to 30 and overall less stressful and I'd be less miserable, hopefully allowing me to focus more on classes.

I didn't have to be his caretaker but I still helped here and there with what he needed or with filing all his paperwork. We felt like our ‘couple just without the title’ groove again and I was so happy. I wasn't in a good way in my personal life but it didn't seem to matter as he was doing much better, getting his cancer treatment and I finally graduated college. 

&amp;#x200B;

That seemed to be where things got weird again. I graduated and no one wanted to celebrate with me. I couldn't get a single one of my ‘friends’ to agree to any time to just come out and have a few drinks with me. No one even congratulated me other then my therapist which is really sad. I come from a very affluent neighborhood despite my family being lower middle class so I am riddled with stupid jealousy seeing my old high school mates getting to go on insane vacations, getting huge presents or having extravagant parties with all their friends. For my graduation I got a crumb cake that I bought for myself and ate the whole thing alone at home watching tv. My life at home is a misery as my current roommates are filthy messy and the whole place is rife with roaches whole the other manipulates others, has ruined half my wardrobe, bad mouths me to the other roommates and guilted me into getting to stay for another month at a lower price in her room by telling me she will kill herself if she can't. The people I was supposed to move in with basically used me to do all the apartment research on my own and then when they found a place through me cut me out of the equation and expected me to be okay with it. The only time people other than my partner talk to me is just to ask how he is doing. My abusive father is trying to ‘mend’ our broken relationship and calls me every day to berate my life choices then guilt me into going back to my hometown and living with him for 2 months. I have no money, no job, will be homeless in a few months and really have no friends. I have nightmares every night about my partner dying, every person I know and even strangers tell me to live him and never look back without knowing the whole story and think they get a say in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

And then my partner had another emergency and was admitted to the hospital again. This time for only a week and no surgeries but I really thought this was it. I thought he would die this time for sure. And again I never left his side not once. Again he was attentive and loving in the hospital then cruel and not wanting to see me when he got out. I got shit on by all his friends and family for not updating on his situation enough like I had the first time, got shit on by nurses for babying him, get bullied by my roommate and basically have nowhere to be treated like even a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I stumbled across his ex girlfriends instagram. She's super nice and we are pretty much exactly alike in every way. Her most recent post was her gushing about all that her current boyfriend does for her. How he tells her how much he loves and appreciates her, all that he does for her, how they share their joy and support their failures and I kind of had a moment thinking ‘wow thats what I deserve’. Since I met my partner it has been all about him, with good reason I'll admit, but never once have I really been able to lean on him for anything, even complaining about normal things in life. I've only heard how much he appreciates me from him when he tells others how great I am then turns to me and says ‘you didn't hear that’ His communication is spotty at best and I infrequently get to see him even though we live super close because he ‘doesn't feel well’ but then I see him hanging out with his other male friends. Sometimes he talks a lot about how he thinks the tumor that caused his cancer fucked with his brain and made him break up with his ex as they were perfect for each other but one day he just decided to break up with her. One of the hardest things I had to do was sit in the hospital with him, have him start lamenting how much better he would have treated her without his tumor and crying because ‘she didn't deserve to be treated how I treated her’ Now I don't doubt that at all but I had to literally bit my tongue to tell him he's doing the same exact thing right now and lamenting breaking up with his ex when I have been here for him through everything cut my heart in pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stupid, like I've put myself in this dumb situation to manipulated and used when he is in pain or needs help and just didn't know when to say no. Everything I did was out of pure love for him and not wanting to see him suffer but truly I don't know when to say enough is enough. I feel like everyone is going to tell me to leave him and never look back but really think about how he must be feeling. His life already pretty shit before this all happened, no money, bad childhood, recent death in the family, works a dead end job then gets cancer, can't take care of himself, does not have the money to pay for it and has to endure several surgeries and years of chemo in the future. He always made it clear we weren't together despite the fact that we pretty much acted like it. I don't feel like he’s using me, truly. I feel like he really is confused and fucked up from his past and having a diagnosis like this fucks with you but I don't know what to do here. I don't feel like I have a right to complain or demand any of his time or for him to change but I just don't know how much longer I can keep going being treated like dirt then returning to my shitty life away from him. I love him more than anything and the good times are much more often and happier then the bad times and we have only ever had real problems during his illness but his treatment is 2 more years at this point and I dont know if his mood will ever improve. Logistically I don't want to waste my early 20s on someone who doesn't actually deserve or treat me well or will ever change even after he is cured and on the other hand I dont want to leave someone I love alone and to flounder when he's going through one of the worst times in his life. I feel stuck and hopeless and don't know if I am an ahole for even getting myself in this situation, if I can ask him to give a little despite what he's going through or if really I should actually just leave and have us be clearly only friends.",29May2019,1

528,"Hello all,

I have never had any issues with sleepwalking, up until this past year. It's possible it is because I am on a new medication for insomnia, but I have been on it for months without too many problems.

It all came to a head last night when I went into the living room and peed directly onto the carpet. I was lucid during this, I was aware I was doing it and have full memory of it, but it was almost like it was a dream. I can't remember what on earth was going through my head that possessed me to do this or why I didn't stop myself. 

It really freaked me out, because the carpet is likely ruined. I am also terrified of what else I may do while in a similar state, or having a similar nocturnal accident that is even worse (for instance, what if i wet the bed with my girlfriend in it?)

Also due to my baggage I took childish actions 2 years ago and broke up with my true love because I couldn’t deal with our problems on top of my feelings of worthlessness. She comes from an oppressive society which made it difficult for her to be with me because they don’t allow sex till marriage there, and we were having sex but she was never able to truly feel comfortable. I made her feel like shit because I was childish and stupid and impulsive. I broke up with her, while we both knew neither of us wanted it it seemed like the only option. We remained best friends. Our connection is deep. About 6 months after that, someone asked her out and we were still a maybe, but I tried to be selfless for her when we asked if she should go out with him. They broke up a few weeks later because of more of my childish actions and it hurt everybody. Because of me. I moved to a different city and we started to lose closeness, even though we still love each other. But I recently found out after a year she has been dating the person from before and I feel like shit, like I lost her. I am an imperfect person, I have done shitty selfish things at the cost of peoples feelings, because of immaturity. If I lost her for real, i might give up. Our love is the purest most blissful kind of love.
I miss her and I have to fix things but she has a boyfriend and I don’t want to keep causing pain for her by intruding because of my own feelings.
I am out of energy and feeling more deflated.

2 days ago I have told her everything in one letter. If she says it’s too late, I need to leave this whole part of the world and start a fresh life, away from my family and anything that reminds me of the past and who I am there.

534,"Hey there - I posted a post awhile back asking for advice on buying a home on this thread, and I’m back again with some updated info and new questions. Hope y’all don’t mind. If there’s anywhere better to post this, please don’t be afraid to let me know! I’d appreciate the info.

Anyway, here’s some background/reference info:

He works as a machine operator at a company making $14.50 per hour, I work as a nanny making $11-$16 per hour (depending on the family I’m working for) and minimum wage here is $9.45 per hour, so we both make a decent amount above it. We make roughly $3,500 a month in combined income after taxes.

The only debt that we have is $7,800 remaining on a car loan in my name. He has no debt of his own and we have no other debts or student loans at this time.

My credit score is 732, his is nonexistent (he just recently started establishing credit). The home would ideally me in my name if we decided to buy.

By the end of this year (we plan to move at the beginning of 2020), we have projected savings of close to $10K if we continue to save as much as we have been. We also have all of our savings in CD/interest earning accounts, so that’s a nice little bonus too.

The average cost of a home in our city (and the cities surrounding it) is roughly $112K-$130K at this current time. Since my boyfriend is a bit of a handy man and I have a large family that consists of electricians, plumbers, heating/cooling workers, construction workers, etc. and are all willing to help with manual labor, we plan to invest in a reasonable fixer upper ($85K or below) and use our own and our families manual labor to help make repairs. We’re also big on DIY-ing things ourself and repurposing, so cosmetic repairs aren’t as much of a worry for us as long as we have a solid foundation.

The average cost of rent of an apartment in our city (and surrounding cities) is approximately $750-$1,100 per month (depending on if we get a 1 or 2 bedroom, and we’d rather have a 2 bedroom). I personally think that that’s ridiculous since we can get a mortgage for that price, but I’ve been getting so many mixed opinions from friends and family members and just haven’t really decided on what might be the wisest decision for us to make. My boyfriend is working on pursuing a welding degree and because of this, he needs a garage/basement space for his welding equipment which an apartment would not allow. We also would just rather have a home because of freedom and privacy purposes. Plus, if it’s less financially, why not?

I am aware that repairs on the home, closing costs, etc. will probably wipe out a majority of our accounts and trust me, we are saving and preparing for that. I’ve been wanting to purchase a home since I was 15 (my father has always taught me “buy, don’t rent”) and have dreamed of owning my own home. I’ve worked my ass off to make that happen and still am; so is my partner.

Now, my primary concerns for buying rather than renting would be:

• There aren’t many homes listed within our price range in the area and we’ve been pricing them since the beginning of the year.

• We will obviously be responsible for a lot of things that a house entails; and all of the repairs. Obviously this might prove to be more expensive in the long run with a home rather than renting since we’ll inevitably run into *something* expensive and unexpected.

• There are many more local apartments available versus homes. And we have to stay within the city due to work and school opportunities (the commute otherwise would be ridiculous).

• Everyone thinks we’re crazy for wanting to buy so young. I understand that it’s not realistic for everyone, but we’re working hard to make it a reality for us.

We’re aiming to move at the beginning of 2020, or during that Summer if absolutely necessary.

I’d love to hear about your experiences with home buying/renting and any advice that you may have for either. We want to make this happen.",29May2019,1

537,"I've been in a long distance relationship with this man for 3 years, it started when he was 17 and I was 13. We started dating after being ""online fuck buddies"" for half a year. In the first 3 months of our relationship we were in the ""honeymoon phase""; we were in love and happy, everything was perfect. But then a switch seemed to have flipped. He would constantly want nudes even when I told him no. He has in the past broken up with me many times because I didn't and only got back so we could ""make up"". He once shared a nude to ""punish"" me for breaking a promise. This fucked me up as I had been used by men before for nudes. The man I loved and trusted was using me like the men who caused me such hurt. I stayed with him and he did change, even if it didn't last. I stayed with him because I loved him, because he was the only one who ever loved me. I developed an eating disorder last summer, dieting got out of hand and suddenly I wasn't eating at all. This caused him to develop acute anxiety and he made sure I was reminded every day. He would blame me for having an eating disorder, asking me why I did it and asking me to stop talking about it. I understood that he needed time to heal, so I gave him it. We broke up around this time, it might have been the best thing for him. We got back together soon after and again ""made up"". From that period on he got distant, only showing love after having phone sex. Last time he visited he was constantly aggravated, we'd constantly be having sex and honestly I just felt like some toy. It wasn't enjoyable anymore after having been pushed and forced to do what he wanted.

Yesterday I figured out it was all because his ""parents never taught him no"". It showed me yet again that he never takes the blame. That he won't change no matter what he promises.

I need to end it. But I just... can't.

540,"I’ve been traveling with a friend for about a month now (both 22F). She is much more emotionally unpredictable than I am (I’m really not bothered by anything besides the occasional anxiety), so every day feels like a new journey - especially when this happened. 

We had a fun night out where she ended up making out with a stranger. We joked about it (and have in the past when this has happened to us) and it was all in good fun - I just saw it as a super casual thing that happened. She got a cold the next day and we joked about it being from him plus our lack of sleeping. 

The next day I was texting my boyfriend about how my friend and I’s night out had gone and explained how my friend was sick now and I was really hoping I didn’t catch it. He made a funny joke about our night so I screenshot it and sent it to her but then things took a TURN. 

She said that what I had told him was her business and not my story to tell. And that that’s why she has a problem with having friends with boyfriends. Apparently it’s messed up that girls tell their boyfriends things like that. Now she doesn’t trust me anymore and says she wont be telling me any important feelings. I apologized profusely and said I’d never talk to him about what happens with her anymore even though it made no sense to me - but she’s stubborn and I’m easily walked over so I went to bed and didn’t fight her opinion. 

She randomly went off on me the next day too when I just chuckled at a funny sound she made (because that’s what friends do???). She said “why don’t you go laugh about it with *insert boyfriend’s name*” and then got up and left.

Within couples I just have always assumed they all tell each other things like that??? Besides personal/deeply emotional things about their friends of course. I was in a 4 year relationship previously and we always talked about dramas or things that happened with friends because they’re interesting or funny stories. But who knows maybe I’m wrong! I also just hoped apologizing and talking it out would fix things - but I guess there’s absolutely nothing I can do.

We both agreed we’re looking for something serious, so we planned a date, which she canceled with a very long text that said she has a lot going on in her life right now and wants to bring me into her life when it’s less stress free and not as hectic. I completely understood and reacted well and asked if I could help. She told me what’s going on and I gave advice which helped her. She still said she wants to wait to go out on our first date until things calm down in her life, but still wants to message me like we have been. I can see a relationship with this girl, but I need to know some tips or anyone with experience with something like this. Do I continue to talk to her over
text until she’s ready to see me ? (We have good conversations and mostly its get to know you stuff). I’d appreciate any advice on this. Thanks guys!",29May2019,1
551,"My gf doesn't use reddit so here I am. My gf (henceforth referred to as L) and her mother have a strained relationship and have had one for many years. They are helicopter parents in the classic sense of the term. They read her texts, log into her social media, etc. While I don't approve of parents doing this for their kids under the age of 18, that's their right and ultimately their choice. However, L is 20 years old. She's an upperclassmen in college. She'd old enough to make her own decisions, run her own social media, ad nauseam. Any time L brings up the fact that she doesn't not like her mother logging into her social media, they play the ""well we pay for everything"" card, as if it's not their responsibility as a parent to support their child. 

&amp;#x200B;

In recent years, L's mother has been extremely hostile towards L. Granted, L was a typical college freshman. Talked to a lot of boys, drank on the weekends. Typical college kids things. I have never been concerned that L's behavior is genuinely dangerous to her well being or school performance. L's mother has called her a ""whore,"" a ""disappointment,"" said things like, ""I thought we raised you better than this."" L's mother has mentioned that she wished L would disappear so she wouldn't have to pay for things anymore. Sometimes, L's stays up all night crying at the things her mother has said. L has told me that before we started dating she kept wishing something terrible would happen to her so that she could just get away. She considered speaking to a counselor at the university but never followed through with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

 L's mother is destroying her relationship with her daughter and I can see it. L loathes her mother and any time she has to spend around her. The problem is, she can't get away from her. Her parents do pay for things. Her tuition, her summer apartment rent, her phone, etc. They're threatened multiple times to withdrawal that funding, although admittedly they've never followed through. L has no choice but to offer a dishonest apology for her ""behavior"" out of fear of repercussions. Recently L replied to some creep in her Instagram DMs because her friends egged her on. Stupid I admit, and I didn't approve but whatever, we all do dumb things for fun. Well lo and behold L's mother logged into the account, went through her messages, saw them, and went absolutely berzerk on her. She's sent all sorts of virulent messages and I can tell that L can hardly breathe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this is L's mother, not mine. What the hell do I do? How do I even go about comforting her? Do I even offer advice or just be a shoulder to cry on? I know guys typically try to offer unsolicited advice and every fiber of my being wants L to tell her mom to shove it. That's obviously not an option. Any advice is appreciated.",29May2019,1
552,"By the title you know I’m faced with a tough decision... 

Right now I work at a Credit Union as a fraud specialist. I’ve been here for 2yrs 3mos.

 Pros: I make a great salary for my age, the benefits are awesome, there’s a gym/massage therapist/doctors office all on campus. Everyone tells me this is a great job and to not take it for granted. 

The Cons: High volume call center &amp; being the youngest on my team, not a lot of leadership (ie it can vary depending on person- some a great some are meh), MOSTLY my mental health is suffering. For the first time in my life I’m taking anti depressant/anxiety meds. I’m missing a lot of work because of this (protected leave under FMLA) this isn’t like me. I feel so unmotivated and hate my job more and more. I feel guilty because from the outside it looks so great. Am I taking this for granted? 

I’ve been offered another job &amp; while the pay is a decrease-the benefits are all still there with incentives. I had my interview yesterday and a call back today. The vibe overall was less stressful and I felt good while I was there. Should I take this job? I feel so nervous. At this age I feel like all of my choices matter so much and can change everything.

She has physical problems too, she was ina  coma and her muscles weakened and couldnt walk for months.  

in a recent entry she talks about going to the doctor and them asking her if shes planning to hurt herself, she told them no. and in the diary she says shes unsure.  

she also writes, ""i am blessed, i wake up, i breathe air without a machines help (she couldnt breathe when she was in a coma). i walk with my legs, i can run, not far, but i can run. i can use my hands. i wake up every day with pain but its alright, i can still breathe. my back hurts but its okay, i can still walk. i cry but its alright, i can still feel the wind blow through my hair. i cant see that far but its alright, at least i can still see and my brain can still understand. i came back from knocking on deaths door. i feel alone and very confused but i dont understand why they dont see that.""  

  

and then after that, older entries, earlier this month and last month, she talks about how she is gong to kill herself in june. how she doesn care about how others might feel if she does. there are multiple entries talking about it.

554,So basically I’ve been dating this boy for a year now and I just decided to tell my dad last night. I was expecting to be in trouble or yelled at (which is the most usual thing for him) and he just didn’t. He was calm and was just like okay. But I’m scared of him maybe using it against me in the future or someone saying the wrong thing because with him it’s like always having to be careful with words you use because the smallest things set him off. I’m just worried. Everyone seems like it was stupid to do and then when I seem disappointed by that they change and say they are proud. But I really felt like it was the right thing because it would have probably been worse if he just found out on his own. Anyways did I do the right thing?

My brother is friends with the guys brother. I just don’t want people to see me differently or to think I’m lying or making it up. I swear to you I’m not.

556,"I hadn't been this conflicted about something for a while. Firstly, I flew back home after finishing College. It was the time I can finally spend with family I hadn't seen for more than a year. I haven't even had the chance to visit through the majority of college. I'm suppose to fly out not so long from now so I can attend my grad ceremony which I've been looking forward to after what I put into my program. I also need to start applying for a job. Not to mention a friend of mine has been telling me that his company is currently looking for a couple of people for his team and other positions are available as well, this is of course a potential job I can aim to get. If not, I still have the chance to apply to other companies and start working as soon as I can. Worth noting that I do have internship experience so I'm not completely hopeless about landing something in my high demand field. However I've been obsessing over whether or not I should extend my trip by a month or so. Why extend? When I went back home, I was still anxiety and depression riddled from my vitamin d deficiency. I feel as if I couldn't spend proper time with family with this anxiety. But now that I've supplemented with vitamin d for a while I feel like I can relax again but my return trip is almost here. My grandmother is old and ill and my other grandma is old as well and I just don't know if I'll ever get the chance to see them again.

559,"This was posted in r/exjw. An Elder is similar to a priest - a well respected man in a position of spiritual authority. JWs go out in the door-to-door ministry in car groups of 2+ ppl. 


There is an Elder in my area. He's mentioned in car groups in the ministry about how one of his sons needed extra punishment because of his lack of discipline. He said he used to 'wail' on his son when he didnt behave properly. He clearly used similar forms of punishment on his other kids, as theyve disclosed similar treatment. I think they believed it was normal because they always laugh about it. He's mentioned using corporal punishment on the platform in talks as well.


At one time, a boy in my hall disclosed to me that his father was physucally abusive. I told this Elder about it (as I was required to if i heard of wrongdoing) and his response was ""sometimes children lie about abuse to get attention.' I found this disturbing, but being a ypung, believing witness, I yielded to the brother. The abuse, as far as I know, was never dealt with.


I heard recently that one of his daughters has narcolepsy and created ""false memories"" of her dad abusing her sexually. This morning, my heart started sinking when I thought of all this.

Lose yourself in a sea of no self worth or esteem. You would hate yourself and lose faith in youtself. you would look in the mirror and wish you could escape everything. Their body. Their life. You would be depressed and tend to any sort of escape like drugs sex alcahol you name it.

Or you would be like ""I might have to live with that person but who cares how they treat me. I'll just do what I can do and try to live somewhere else even if it doesnt seem attainable now""

We broke up almost 4yrs ago. I cut off complete contact 2yrs ago because of threats and eventually took off ""ignore messages"" to outright block. I thought that blocking him would make him angry and he knew where I lived.

He STILL messages. 120 unanswered messages.
Cycle of: sweet and nostalgic ""I understand you never want to speak to me again"", annoyed that I didn't respond, angry to the point of making serious threats, apology. Repeat.

I recently moved across the world with my dogs, he contacted my brother saying how much he missed and loved me and was I dating someone? My brother felt sorry for him and told him that I moved with the dogs.
He is pissed! Has been since I moved, I recently found out. I checked my alt Facebook account and there were so many messages.

567,"Strap in. TL;DR at the bottom.

I need advice on how to reach what's left of my family.

My ""father"" is a career on/off alcoholic now currently in his early fifties. My mother is in her early sixties and ontop of being the most persistent manual laborer you'll ever see, is also a career victim even though you'd never know it from the outside because she has always presented herself as a very 'hard' working class lady. I (late 20's male) am one of five children, three boys (one late 20's a few years older than me, the other early 30's) and two girls (42 RIP, and my baby sister late teens). 

Atleast once a year give or take since before any of us were born, during a heated argument our mother would get beat. Never one to initiate, always retaliatory, she would deal her fair share of damage back. He has a quarter inch divet in his forehead from a granite ashtray. Not being a fan of anything even close to a fair brawl, ALL of us boys were subjected multiple times to our ""fathers"" alcohol fueled aggression.

 The older we got and started entering the 'backtalk' phase, the less he needed alcohol as an excuse to push us into walls and pop us in the ribs, mouth, etc. Mom would pull him off, scream for him to stop, treat us to McDonald's or something we wanted within reason- all the while pushing us that family has flaws and this isn't anyone's business. Once we got large enough to fight back, it only took him losing one fight to switch to verbal abuse and destroying our stuff, as well as switching victims.

 My mother was protected, at least, and what she endured drastically slowed. We all reacted differently to this as we aged. The oldest brother cut ties with everyone and doesn't even cash birthday checks, middle brother is serving fifteen years for violent felonies, and I carried on the families janitorial business for nearly 9 years and became a half decent boxer. All the while keeping close to my sister's and mother. ""Father"" slowed his drinking for nearly 4 years, switching from screwdrivers and vodka in a cup to a joint and a few cold Budweisers. Things were looking up.

That brings me to now. Last month, my mother was diagnosed with Emphysema and is permanently strapped to an oxygen tank. Last week, an unexpected blood clot stole my oldest sisters life. It was extremely upsetting and unpredicted, stirring the emotions on an already taxing few months. Since we were all pretty much doing it, no one really payed attention to fathers drinking habits increasing. 

Last night, I received a call from younger sister who still lives at the house. Hysterical, she told me how an argument over laundry taking too long resulted in father beating her with the laundry basket, and when she got her fingers in the loops to stop it, he punched her in the face hard enough to cause short memory loss. All this was secretly audio recorded by her and was harrowing to listen to, to say the least. You could hear her stuttering that she's going to call 911 while you hear mother in the background shouting ""Don't you dare! No! No!"". 

This is the first time he's struck her, and by the time I got on the phone with her to insist he needed to leave in handcuffs, my mother's influence had already convinced her that it would not only be detrimental to the family, but would somehow affect mom's health. The more I protested, the more it was insinuated I was making it all about me and worsening the situation. 

I drove over to try and convince in person, only to be met with my mother downplaying everything and acting like NOTHING happened. Blood still on the floor. Sister in denial, father sleeping it off. I wanted badly to hurt him, but reacting violently to him would of done no good, considering each of us boys has handed it to him atleast once without behavior changing. It would also tank my chances of going golden gloves should I of ended up arrested.

So I took my birth certificate, told my mother I was sorry she lost her first born but until that beast was out of her life, they've lost me too. Even the youngest. Other than a text from father calling me a traitor, I've yet to hear from anyone and intend to keep 100% no contact. 

I feel so shitty about it though, and I intend to reach out to little sister after a cool down period to try to reach her again. That's why I need your advice. I've got no idea what to say or how to communicate this isn't normal to her.

•Stabbed my mom with a knife

•Spam calls relatives at 2am

575,"So we broke up about three weeks ago. Long term relationship. It was abrupt as hell, she dumped me over the phone.

And this relationship was meaningful to me. I really was never as in love as I was with this woman. It was really intense the entire time, my affection for her was through the roof. She used to be my favorite person I'd ever met.


I was emotionally a wreck for the first two weeks. I was recovering rather quickly, however, probably the fastest I have for a relationship.

Then I was told some information, combined with my own knowledge.

Essentially, during the last month of our relationship, she had cheated with one of her ""friends"" at least three times, and those are just the ones I have direct knowledge of. 

I also discovered that she had been disloyal the entire time, texting her ex extensively, getting into deep emotional conversations with guys who like her, soliciting nudes from other men.

So after knowing that, my self confidence is ruined. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel worthless and shitty, like I've done something wrong. I feel like no one will ever love me again, that everything I thought was love in that relationship was her deceiving me.

She doesn't know I know this. We work together. For at least another year. She told me she wants to be friends, she tries to be all friendly with me and smiling and shit. It kills me because I just can't believe she's continuing her deception.

The two later guys are fairly close friends when compared to the other 3 of us (just known each other longer, more in common etc etc)

The one that kind of steps on my toes a bit I feel can be quite rude or blunt with me. Like they can get annoyed at small things. For instance a friend of ours went away and I asked them where they’d gone/when they were back etc so I could catch up with them but was greeted with “why so many questions”, or when I asked them when abouts we could move was just greated with bits like “o k?”. It’s just small things and kind of his attitude. 

What’s more is all of them are younger than me and students whereas I’m working full time so kinda different lifestyles I suppose. 

I also feel like bar one of them they hold kinda TERFy views or support an socialist organisation (which I used to be a part of but left when it got TERFy) which has TERF views but don’t mention them to me since I am trans (but still living as male) or they will often forget I am trans when I bring it up (asides one of them who is more switched on to such things).

She can spend three days straight baking but as soon as she is done, she doesn't want to clean and basically the rest of our suffers for it.  I do the laundry, I take care of the cats, I help with the baby so it's not like I'm not doing anything.  She has multiple physical issues that we are trying to work on too, like foot pain, headaches and others.  It's just everyday is some new complaint, when we have free time, that's all we talk about are our problems.  I fear I'm not helping my daughter's skills because I've never really been around kids and don't know how to act around them or interact.  Sorry if this is confusing and all over the place, I'm just typing things as they come to mind, but some helpful advice or someone to talk to would be very welcomed.

580,"So I just became a part of this friend group this year (September) and I noticed something yesterday that made me so sad. I genuinely thought the group just didn’t hang out a lot outside of class only to find out they do all the time. And the only people they don’t invite are me and a friend. At lunch we sit in a circle on the floor and recently they started closing off the circle so my and a friend can’t get into it. I talked to my bff about this and she told me I was being dramatic and that doesn’t happen. When it very clearly does. So I did an experiment during lunch today and I ate with other friends. They never noticed I was gone. Impartiality the thought I was still there. A friend  has been part of the group for nine years and they just started doing this to her. My bff calmed its because the group is to big and not everyone can be included all the time. But if I was never included from the beginning is that really fair? Btw the group consists of 8 people. My bff has been hinting at me to leave the group all day. And was really pissed off when I came to her about this. She told me to do one of two things to really be close to everyone else 1) read this dumb book series they all like (it’s actually reallllly boring) or 2)  to just deal with it and let it continue. 
I really want to know what to do. Please does anyone have any advice for a person in my place?",29May2019,1

582,"I am almost 19, living with my dad on the east coast. I just finished my first year of college and I am home from the summer. I decided to take a gap year next year due to expenses (my family is not very well off). Since my parents split and my mom moved to the west coast last fall, my dad has been depressed and down on his luck with his job. In addition to neither my mom or I being home for awhile, this resulted in him leaving our house a complete mess; I don’t mean cluttered here or there either, it’s dirty, borderline hoarding and frankly disgusting. He is taking care of four pets and trying to work some days of the week. A lot of the mess was brought up to my room which makes me feel overwhelmed constantly. I am too embarrassed to have friends over, I feel stuck mentally, and I’m noticing myself falling into a lot of the same patterns of depression that I have before. I would love for the house to be clean because I feel like that would help both of us mentally and emotionally, but it seems so far beyond anything that I could do, and he doesn’t want to do anything himself. My mom offers no advice but to help him clean and try not to get depressed. This is the same situation she escaped last year after a long marriage and I feel like as much as my dad loves me, he’s pushing me away by keeping me in an environment he knows is unsuitable for anyone to live in. It’s the same reason my mom moved, and although I have the option to move to the west coast with her, I would really, really rather not. He cannot afford wifi, bills, can barely afford groceries, and is at the same time dealing with other family issues. He’s been isolated by almost all of our relatives and I am an only child. I feel guilty at some points because he is keeping a roof over my head, and I am afraid of what could happen if I left him alone. He is difficult to talk to and very stubborn, howevever I still love him and hate to see him struggle. It seems like there’s no way to get out of this until I can finish college or afford to move out, but the time being, this hurts my relationships, stability, and overrall health. I’ve never really felt so isolated before and my friends can’t offer me much help. Any advice from others who have been in a similar situation?",29May2019,1
584,"Ok so here's the situation. I did an internship back in December 2018 till January 2019. It was 4 guys, three 1st year college students including me and a 2nd year college student. The senior (2nd year guy) had worked with that company earlier also and knew the CEO (it's a rather small smartup but growing fast) and we were to do all the reporting to him. So the internship got over in January. Our college started again and we were still to collect the stipend for the internship. Some small tasks were left and we completed them by mid February. We had a call with the CEO and he said that we all can come anytime and collect the cheques for our stipend. Now we had our exams in March so I got busy and didn't ask when to go to collect the money, then in April I was busy in some extra curicullar work and had my finals in May, and to be honest, I kinda forgot that I still had to collect the cheque. So day before yesterday, I messaged my senior about the cheque, he took 36 hours to reply and he was active the whole time on other social media. He said go to the office and collect the cheque yourself and that all the others had already taken their cheques. Now I was surprised as they all went together without informing me. So I asked the CEO of the company where I interned about the cheque and he said he had already given it to the senior. I messaged him again and he said sorry he had it and forgot to give it to me but it might be expired by now. But it hasn't been 3 months so the cheque wasn't expired. So then he said alright you can take the cheque from me. Now we both live around 30 kms apart. So I messaged him where to meet and when to meet but again he is not responding for the last 24 hours. I called him too and he didn't pick up. I'm afraid he has either lost my cheque or there is some other complication he isn't telling me about. Also the part where he forgot to even message me asking me to take my cheque from him is very suspicious. Its been more than 2.5months since he had my cheque. I am a little afraid now. The cheque wasnt of a very large amount but it was quite a bit and my first ever earning. What should i do now?",29May2019,3

She said to stay home, which I figured she would. Then she texts me a few hours later and tells me I shouldn’t come in for the rest of the week and come back next week once I’m sure I’m better. I don’t know if this is genuine or some kind of punishment, because what employer asks employees not to come due to illness.

587,"My ex (19m) and I (19f) remained friends after our relationship ended, about 2 months ago. He was over here yesterday and we were talking about an anonymous app we both use to make friends to play online games with, he showed me one of his posts so I saw his username. I didn’t think much of it until later that night when I was on the app and saw a sexual post from him.

I made the mistake of being curious what he was saying to these girls... so I responded. The convo was pretty normal, some sexual questions traded but nothing major, overall a good conversation.... until ex’s came up. He had no idea it was me but, he told me that I sucked at blow jobs and we only had sex once in a year so it was a bad relationship. I was extremely hurt (I know I asked for it by going along with the convo and messaging him in the first place) but, it hurts mostly because he lied to my face. He always said he enjoyed the stuff we did, we also had sex very often until the end of our relationship when we weren’t getting along.

I know this is my fault but I don’t know what I should do because we still are friends. Should I tell him what I did? Even though, that would most likely end our friendship. Or, should I just act like I have no idea even though I’m hurt?",29May2019,0

So the day after that I came to the hospital again to visit . The next day was Memorial Day i couldn’t show up due to my mom saying no and her being my only ride (I’m 16) also with my depression I don’t like going to hospitals a lot . So this blew up into a whole thing about me not being there for her and all this other bullshit and I apologized 22 fucking times and tried explaining I had no ride there .

Then my bestfriend whos also friends with the friend in the hospital comes back to my state after moving far away . She goes and visits the friend in the hospital which is okay , and then I go and ask oh hey are you gonna see me today and she openly admits that she forgot .

But now there’s this other girl that has sort of come into the forefront of the picture. I’ve always thought that she was cute and liked her. And I’ve known her for much longer. But I always thought that she only saw me as a friend. However now, she says that she actually does like me. I don’t know how good of an actual girlfriend she would make though. And we do get along very very well and feel the same way and think the same way about things.

And now I feel like it’s thrown my relationship into some turmoil with my current girlfriend.

592,"My mom has been extremely protective of me for multiple reasons from when I was younger- mostly bullying and health issues. Basically there is ALWAYS something going on in my life,but of course that’s with everyone.
Ive had to stay back from going to college due to health reasons so I’m at home. I’ve gotten myself a car, met my SO, and have a career. I’d say I’m doing okish for my age. 

I didn’t start noticing anything until I had to get my car checked... MY car.  Due to my condition, I couldn’t drive for a period of time so I let my mom drive... MY car since hers has issues. With that being said, she drove me to my own appointment, and when I went to the counter to check in and tell them what I was there for... she cuts right in. I don’t even get a chance to speak. Now the man at the counter is directing the conversation at her, about MY car. She even goes to sign too, which I didn’t let her do. 

Another time we were at the mall and I apparently had a stain on the back of my pants. Without any notice, she grabs me and starts wiping off my crotch area. I pull back and she starts giving me attitude- because who wouldn’t want there mother doing that in a PUBLIC PARKING LOT. She storms off into the shopping center telling me off and pouts essentially, ignores me, and within a few minutes goes back to being fine. 

Right now, I’ve finally decided to drive, of course she’s with me. With my luck, my tire starts to deflate on the highway- I got a signal on my dashboard so we went to a mechanic. At the counter, she’s talking as if it’s her vehicle AGAIN. (Reminded: she did not pay for the car at all. It’s in my name) She got the year wrong so I corrected her, and she tells the guy it’s my car... BUT KEEPS TALKING. Last time I checked... I was born with a mouth and brain. The guy at the counter looked confused as well.


Granted, she does help me out with a lot as I am only 20. But I need my fucking space. Not being in college has been isolating but that doesn’t mean I want to be coddled by my mother. Buying my first car was huge for me, and she’s still suffocated me with it. I can’t seem to nave my space.

I’ve been getting increasingly anxious and depressed from lack of romance and it’s hard for me to leave my bed.

I tried going to the health center but I was afraid they were going to call 911 or something. Second semester I thought to my self that I was going to get my gpa up since I was in academic probation. I think it got worse. My gpa is now at a 1.3. I’m most likely going to get kicked out. I thought coming back home would sort of stop me from being sad and numb since I missed my family but it didn’t?

I don’t even have a summer job since we live a few mins outside the city and I can’t drive.i hate going out because my mom will have to pay for me.

My second and only thought process, if I still get kicked out, would be to get into the dorms, away from my family and apply to the online(?) college near there. I’d still have a meal plan too.

598,"19 months ago I started working at a successful e-commerce startup. The company had just launched a secondary site geared towards women and I was hired to run their blog. I was hired onto a team of three other people (my boss and two coworkers). The company overall was around 30 people at the time—everyone else worked on the men’s site. We weren’t given much direction, in fact we pretty much had total freedom to do whatever we wanted branding wise, and since the company was/is profitable and we had/have investors, there was budget for us to spend on different projects etc. Money was never a problem.

I quickly realized that, although the men’s and women’s sites were intended to be like sibling sites, no one in the company was actually concerned with the women’s site other than the three other women on my team. This was fine at the time since I felt we had a strong team and were making the most of having no management or guidance. The site was slowly growing on its own (we never paid for marketing) and our numbers went up each month.

4 months into the job, my boss and one of my coworkers were fired for “going in the wrong direction” with the site. Apparently they trusted me and my remaining worker to move the site in the right direction, although I’m not sure they even knew what that was at the time. I was handed my boss + coworker’s responsibilities with no pay bump or title change.

After running the site with my remaming coworker for 9 months, I finally got a raise (2.5k) and title change. But then they fired my last remaining coworker. Over the last 4 months I’ve been running the site alone—running the blog, social media, email marketing, and managing relationships with stylists/influencers/etc. The site is still growing steadily, but since its nowhere as “big” as the men’s site, it’s deprioritized in the larger picture at the company. No one other than me thinks about the women’s site on a daily basis. I’ve since asked for a more significant raise considering im the only person running the site AND since I make less than the person (male) on the men’s site whose only job is to run the men’s blog. I was told that I shouldn’t make the same salary as the men’s editor since that site is larger and the company’s primary source of income. The men’s blog publishes more, but their editor has a full-time editor/assistant below him.

Last week our CEO shared a 12 month plan where the last sentence at the 12 month mark says “we are starting to pay attention to the women’s site.” I haven’t spoken to him about what that entails—if that literally means im going to be here doing everything alone for the next 12+ months, which I would assume it would—but it doesn’t seem good. Is it worth riding this out in hopes that things will improve in 12 months?

So I turned 16 recently and for the past few months (it started, I wanna say, a year ago) I started eating constantly. Like a lot. Like I could eat a massive dinner with desert and still have a craving for something in the freezer at midnight, and what I just described barely scratches the surface of what happens.

This is becoming a huge problem for me for a couple reasons. Main one being that I'm very self conscious about my weight. I'm not morbidly obese but pretty big to the point where I am conscious and have man boobs and rolls. Also I constantly eat everything in the fridge and my family has yelled at me for it and keep telling me it's for everyone else and my mum has called me a pig a few different occasions (which I regretfully lashed out on her on). I'm also constantly asking my parents for a couple of quid to go down to the shop and get something.

This is becoming the point where I think it's a massive problem that I need to deal with because I'm scared its affecting my self esteem (I was unofficially diagnosed with body dysmorphia so that doesn't help things) and I'm constantly putting myself down for it. I even think about starving myself sometimes, which I can't even do because I'm so addicted to food

We’ve both taken vacations and tried to avoid each other, but that’s tough in an apartment with similar work schedules.

All in all I’ve got 2 months left on the lease. Is there any way I could explain some of the situation to where breaking the lease won’t jeopardize my credit or backlash into a hailstorm of fees and whatnot?

611,"Hey all,

Long time lurker, first time poster using a throwaway account.

I’m an late 20 something yr old in a medium sized city in the southeast portion of the US. I have a bachelor’s and master’s degree and 5 years of experience in sales, customer service, real estate and account management.

I have been unemployed since the end of January (4 months as of today) since being let go from my previous small firm due to cash flow issues.

Here’s the issue:

As of 2/4/2016, I am a convicted felon.

Long story short, I met a girl on a popular online dating app, and we slept together several times. I find out much later after I have stopped seeing her, that she is underage and had explicitly lied to me about it multiple times. 

I was convicted of “indecent liberties with a minor” and forced to register as a sex offender for 30 years (with the theoretical possible of coming off after 10 years, due to my state’s laws). 

As you can imagine, this has put a huge dent in my life.

Thankfully, I have a very supportive family that have stuck with me through it all. 

My house is paid off free and clear, I don’t have a car payment, and my girlfriend (who knows everything and has been incredibly supportive) splits bills with me 50/50.

Coming back to the main point of my post: any advice for someone in my situation?

I have had some interest in my background to the tune of roughly 20 phone interviews, and 6 in person interviews, but I have not been able to land anything yet.

Any advice, thoughts, research or information anyone is willing to share would be helpful and would mean a lot.

Thanks so much!",29May2019,1

My friend, Chloe*, started dating a friend in our group, Harry*, and they dated for a month but she broke things off because she didn’t feel comfortable in a relationship. She told him that she can’t handle being in a relationship because she didn’t love herself and she had personal issues, (Her parents are separating) and he started acting crazy. He kept spamming her with long paragraphs saying how ungrateful she was and how he still loved her and how he would change everything for her. And he’s been doing this for a few weeks every single day and she was really sick of it. She put up with him because she didn’t want to be mean. He keeps trying to manipulate her and make her feel like he’s the only one that cares about her. She didn’t fall for it but she felt really bad. And he keeps talking about how he wants to die.  Because everyone hates him apparently. I stopped being friends with him because he would constantly insult me and be very rude to me and I didn’t want to be bullied by him anymore. He keeps acting like the victim. But today Chloe finally blocked him. And I’m scared he will try to either hurt himself really bad, or hurt someone. I know that people can be held liable for causing others suicide but what if he was the crazy one? What would happen?

My parents forced me to get on Medicaid because they didn’t want to pay for my health insurance and also didn’t help me with tuition at all and sold a house left to me by my grandparents for college money to buy themselves a condo down south. With that said, I think they sometimes take advantage me with the amount of things they have me do for them - such as watching their pets for 3 consecutive months while they went on vacation (even though my apartment doesn’t allow pets) several times and having me come back home during my personal vacations (spring break etc) to watch my elderly grandfather so that they can leave to go on vacation. I’m kind’ve  fed up with it in that I can never have a vacation for myself especially since these past 8 years haven’t been easy. I’m really afraid they are going to continue to do this during the course of my residency during which I’ll have even less time than normal to help them with things.

617,"I always thought of myself as someone with a lot of friends, but recently I’ve been left out. What started with a small group of our larger friend circle splitting off and doing their own thing has grown to a point where most of the group is involved but me and a few others have been left out. I’ve talked to one of the original small group, the guy I would say I was closest to, and he seemed to understand, but I’m now continually being left out. I didn’t try to be pushy or seem to desperate but I can’t help but feel like I’m totally dislikable. Others who were previously left out are now being included and carry on like nothing happened, and this pisses me off the most as there is now this air of superiority, and once you become included you must also leave those who are not behind. This is not the first time this has happened, and I’m often left feeling lonely from friendships.  Generally I simply fill this hole by having flings with girls, but as I’ve gotten older I realise how unhealthy that is.

624,"Hi, Reddit!

I'm 36, and I'm quitting my job in two months to go back to school for a year, after I recently received a full-ride scholarship to attend film school. The scholarship covers tuition, books, labs, etc, but not rent, food, and other living expenses. I have enough in my savings to cover the cost of frugal living for a year, without having to take out a loan, barring any emergencies or unforeseen expenses. I'd rather not take out a loan, as I already have three of them out right now from my graduate and undergraduate studies, and I will have to take out another one after school to shoot my movie.

However, I recently found a month long program in South Africa that will help you shoot your own nature documentaries that I would like to sign up for before I leave for school in October. I would love to do this because 1) I may never get a chance to ever quit my job and do something like this again 2) while it would of course be fun, I think this program would look good on my resume and in my reel, so it's practical as well 3) I've been told time and time again that you can always get more money, but what you can't get back is time. 

The nature documentary program plus flight in total would be a little over $5000. But that's also roughly how much my groceries would cost for a whole year while attending school, again eating frugally. If I went to South Africa, I would probably have to take out a loan. I might be able to work while I'm school, but I'm told they don't want me to, plus I'm not sure I can as the film school is in another country.

I know this answer is dependent on what I want to do, and whats important to me, but, I need to make sure I'm not looking at this South Africa program with rose colored glasses and that I'm looking at this logically. I would like to know what other people would do if they were me. 

I wouldn't regret going to South Africa, but I would regret taking out another loan.

629,"Throwaway account to protect identities. 

Hey guys, like the title says, I'm having difficulties with my friend because of his recurring dishonesty based issues. I would appreciate any advice in how to approach this situation! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I've known him for a couple of years now. We had a lot of fun going out together and indulging in alcohol and other drugs. Looking back on it, I think using substances has been the only real common ground we have: I'm engaged more in school, in clubs, and multiple sober hobbies but his motto is, ""my hobby *is* drugs"". So now that I've recently come more to terms with healing and self improvement *without* drugs, I've been able to see the dishonesty issues more clearly than before. There are a few consistent problems that I've observed over our friendship that have steadily gotten worse: 

&amp;#x200B;

* The number one issue/most recurring: **He avoids his problems** through lying, avoiding all contact, or repressing them with alcohol and drugs. Even the times I've caught him in lies he stills tries to keep it going. His girlfriend and I have also directly told him multiple times that he can't drink or smoke to avoid his problems--which upset him that ""we would even say that to him""--which caused him to drink then too. 
* **He's not dependable**. He promises me that he will pick me up, help me with something, or just agrees to hang out. He then ignores my follow up texts about said promise, doesn't show up, and then texts me three days later with an unconvincing apology about how it wont happen again. Ive seen him do this to multiple of our mutual friends as well, to which he laughed when he showed me their texts he ignored.
* **He steals.** I've found multiple items of mine in him room, I've seen him steal from our friends home, he's taken from my/friend's drug stash, etc..
* **He takes advantage of others**, including friends and family. He's sold people fake drugs, he's fronted drugs and blocked the dealer's number so they couldn't contact his for payment, I've paid for his meals/groceries/paraphernalia to which he said he would pay me back (he probably owes me in the hundreds worth of money and avoids me when I ask for reimbursement) or he claims that he did pay me or did something for me that makes us ""even"". 
* **He doesn't take accountability.** Whenever something bad happens to him (usually caused by the problems listed above) he always says something like ""I can't believe this is happening to me"" or ""I don't deserve this"" or ""wow, only this would happen to *me*"" (making himself the victim).
* **He bottles up his emotions** until he explodes into a meltdown. Whenever something is bothering him he stays completely silent until someone ""annoys him"" one time too many--causing him to explode into a crying fit. When this happens, he is so consumed in his own emotions that he ignores what me or his girlfriend try to say to him and he just repeats ""you're being so mean"" or ""I don't know why this always happens to me"" and shuts himself away somewhere i.e. a locked bathroom. 
* **He ignores others/only talks about himself.** and its always the same damn stories or problems too. 
* Over time, he has started picking up my personality traits and started using them as his own (this *really* angers me because it took me a lot of self reflection and gradual building of self confidence to come to terms with who I am and finally be true to myself with others). I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but this really fucking irks me. For example, **he started mimicking my mannerisms and phrases** that I never heard him use before these past few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that saddens me the most is that for the majority of these issues, I've tried talking to him about them multiple times throughout the years, in a gentle, understanding manner, to which he reverts to bullet #1 EVERY TIME. I really want to continue to be honest with him and try to offer him advice to help him with his problems (most of which he creates for himself because of the issues listed above) but he ALWAYS just avoids my input or ignores me entirely-- sometimes by completely changing the subject or by leaving/not talking to me. I truly love this friend for his positive aspects but its getting harder to ignore the bad ones. 

This is really starting to frustrate me... its the same thing over and over and it seems like all my attempts to help him are futile. If I hadn't just signed a year long lease with him, I'd say it'd be time for me to let him figure this out on his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR :** My friend avoids all of his problems and is overly sensitive to any helpful advice I try to offer him to help him become more honest with himself and others. Help?",29May2019,1

631,"So..... I’ve liked this guy for going on four years now. I’m a senior in high school now too. I met him freshman year, and things never really took off it was merely he thought I was cute and I did too but I was fairly timid and not ballet whatsoever. Sophomore year we would text all the time, BUT hardly ever talked at school, considering we had a class together. If we ever did talk it was a little comment or joke. Well I soon found out he was dating this girl and felt it right to back off and not text anymore, which I did and hadn’t talked until the end of junior year. I had joined swim and he was on varsity, so we had little conversations here and there but nothing others than that. However at Prom junior year we both hadn’t had dates and ended dancing together, and that was fun, but it wasn’t relationship-y, it was more of a friendly thing.  But the following week he had messaged a friend of mine saying that he was seriously interested in me and lots of other nice compliments, but “the teenage boy” proved to be sort of an issue. This was a huge turn off for me, he was either into me or he wasn’t, so I pretty much hadn’t talked to him at all. BUT......... this year, we have several classes together, and the beginning of the year we didn’t even acknowledge each other, he did have a girlfriend. But recently we kinda rekindled as he had messaged me about something he’d seen on reddit and starting there we messaged constantly, but again barely talked in school. I have a hard time approaching him because he is always with his friends and I really tend to keep to myself. We had messaged and make lots of plans like to hang out and watch our fav show or go to the beach, but never really made any definitive plans. So I just thought what the hell, I am completely wasting my time, I might as well just ask if he wants to hang this week and he happily agreed, and then made all the plans for us, he asked did I wanted to see a movie and go out to eat after. So we went to the movies and had a ready fun time. We talked a lot and it was just really comfortable. But since then I haven’t really pushed any other plans or conversations. So.... I’m sorry for rambling, but I need opinions. My dilemma is going after him and him not being interested and me looking stupid.",29May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So this morning I woke up and was sorta going through daily stuff; checking emails, messages, making coffee etc. And about 10 minutes after waking up my phone started to go nuts, I was receiving a mass amount of picture messages from a number I do not recognize (NJ area code), from a state I have not been to in years (New Jersey) nor believe to know any body from really. 

&amp;#x200B;

The messages were about 30 photos of dead bodies, all cartel style violence, severed limbs, slit throat, tied up, etc, etc. As my phone was getting bombarded and I didn't care to really look to closely into the collection of fucked up photos I deleted the thread from my iMessage as they are still coming in. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I delete the thread of probably 20-30 photos, three more came in, two more dead body photos and a photo of one of my parents house's (they live on opposite side of the country and not near New Jersey). Its 6am my time, and I have been up for about 10 minutes without drinking the coffee yet, so I am still half asleep and have no idea initially if the photo is a live shot. Well this obviously wakes me the fuck up and I pretty instantly check the weather where that house is located as well as if my parents are at that house even. The weather report doesn't match up with the photos weather and parent I reached out to was not at that house anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some investigation the photo is definitely the google street view of the house. I notice some other things in the photo that doesn't quite match up as well, dating the photo, so immediate fear is now gone. I never texted the number back and honestly only thing I could really think of to send back was a bunch of other inappropriate photos to spam their phone, figured hassle wasn't worth it nor was giving them the satisfaction of knowing I even received any of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont believe any text was sent with any of these photos and if it was I deleted it before seeing that as pictures were just streaming in without me opening the thread. I figured it was some sort of scam trying to make me think someone was outside ready to ""attack"" whoever was in the house if I didn't send money right away type of thing, however bc I did not respond or see any text in the messages I have no idea. I could not find any similar text message attack or scam on the internet in the brief time I looked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason why I believe it is some sort of scam is bc I'm 99% sure that anyone with my full name could get that address off the internet as well as most likely my phone number. However neither parent received any weird messages this morning nor my siblings,  I believe all of their contact info would also be available via the internet in the same place mine might be found. So for some reason I was singled out. I have not had any ""falling out"" with anyone I can think of recently, any type of fight, or done anything to anyone that would really piss someone off in any recent memory. I wouldn't call myself a saint, however for the last 4-6 or so months since moving across the country, my head has kinda been down grinding minding my own business, so this feels super out of left field. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did not call the police or any type of law enforcement yet at least or responded to the messages, whats kinda tripping me out the most is why I got singled out if it was truly someone that scraped my info off the web or if its something I should put any stock into, actually be worried, and do something about it. **No Idea what the best course of action is?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** 30+ photos of dead bodies were sent to phone by number I do not recognize accompanied by a photo of my parents house. I have not responded or taken any action other than make sure my parents were safe and a bit of research on the photo of my house. Not sure what to do.",29May2019,2

**My life story, a series of unfortunate events and an epic saga.**

**Me: F (27) SO: M (31)**

First off, this post does not require pity of any kind, in case people feel the need to provide it. I typically do not seek help from others, though I have received a tremendous amount of help from people in my life. I do not feel great about writing this. My life is relatively fine, despite some of my ailments. I would like to keep this short and sweet, but am afraid I will have to preface the actual issue with various information pertaining to my childhood and life experiences in hopes that you can formulate your own opinion about what kind of person I am or whatever.

I will include a summarization at the bottom and I'm really sorry for this lengthy saga.

Long story short:

   
 

In 2013 I quit a job at a wrecking yard, (which was a male dominated workplace, as well as customer base), to live with my dad who I never really knew \[due to my parent's divorce when I was seven, (dad was in the military)\]. \*I apologize if my grammar offends you\*. This was a big deal to me because I had just departed from an unhealthy relationship, which involved physical and verbal abuse. The person I was with during that time spanned from 2011-2012, in which I left after he had humiliated me in the shower in front of his father, turning off the hot water and stealing my clothing after shutting off the light. After proceeding into the living room and telling his dad to shut his eyes, he had started shoving me. He had taken my phone, as well. I begged his father to call my mom, in which the ex started waving a gun at me. Fast forward: I'm leaving a job where I'm harassed by men daily to pursue an education in another part of the state, and hoping that by meeting my dad I can reconcile with him, and try to further understand why my mother spoke so poorly of him all my life, basically turning me against him out of bitterness (I hate to form opinions on behalf of others psyche, but I have known her very well my whole life, and love her dearly). During this period of my life I smoked regularly, drank coffee a lot and started experimenting with smoking weed as I was not having an easy time coping with anxiety or finding a job. Fast forward: After four-five months I decided to move back to my home city. Mind you, during this time I had been presented with trying ""Molly"", what is a street drug version of ""MDMA"". I like the affect that it had, giving me lots of energy to continue pursuing working out and being social. I understand that this is a highly taboo subject amongst people so I don't expect everyone to be able to relate. I started doing this regularly, mind you for about a year on the weekends. This will come into play later. I moved back to home city, where I moved back in with my (**M**) mother, and eventually my grandmother (whom my mother despised due to my grandmother's second husband allegedly molesting her when she was around nine, and the fact that my grandmother (**G**) disrespected all of her wishes pertaining to raising her children\[my brother and I\]). The family is extremely dysfunctional, despite them being civil. 

So, I'm living back in the home city, where I obtain a job and start attending college in which my father offered to pay for everything, which I assume was an attempt to also reconcile with me for not being in my life. I was very grateful and looking forward to this new life experience.

In September 2013 I started going to school for Aviation Maintenance, due to the fact that I had mechanical aptitude and enjoyed working on and studying vehicles, and wanted to further develop my mechanical skills and try to pursue a lifestyle that would inherently make a decent living. Also, my father works in the field of aviation, and makes six figures a year. He was very helpful in giving the advice that he could, and providing financial support. Before school started, he said, ""Maybe you'll meet a boy."" Cute, right? This piece of information is probably unnecessary, but I would like to state that I have had two serious relationships where I was very sexually attracted to, and pursued intimacy nonstop. When I love things, I love them too much. For example, playing dance dance revolution until five am on a school night. Next. 

In November of the first quarter I started talking to one of the guys in the class, (this was also a male dominated environment). Throughout the day I was always willing to engage in conversation with people there, and would make small talk outside during smoke breaks. I have never been in relationships based on *physical* attraction, but this one particular person started to grow on me after realizing he was the only person around my age, attractive, outgoing, and EXTREMELY talented and knowledgeable. For example, he was very artistic and knowledgeable about bands I knew. (I really thought highly of him, obviously). Though, I had not decided that I was attracted or interested in him, (even though he is gorgeous, tall, dark hair, strong jawline, nice physique, etc, etc.), I did started to look forward to seeing him, and it was dramatic the way my curiousity towards him affected everyone in the class (50 students). Long story short: We started hanging out. He called me one day after running out of gas for help. We started buying redbulls at the gas station, and smoking weed at his apartment. Him and I were this weird dynamic duo everywhere we went, people staring wide eyed, incapable of speaking. The affect of his presence in my life was dramatic, and I was addicted to it without realizing it. We hung out for several months, doing this same routine. At this point, there was nothing else to think of due to the fact that he identified as gay. Eventually, after this perpetual routine I blurted out that I wanted to have sex with him. *I have never initiated sex in my entire life.* I hadn't even realized it, but I was in love with this person more than anything I had ever experienced. He was the childhood friend I never had, as I was raised by an ex bible-thumping family who home schooled me until third grade. Okay, so he agreed to it. This part is unfortunate, because the experience wasn't what I had hoped for. There was no intimacy, foreplay or anything of that nature. Big deal, but it was hard for me to understand what he was thinking, if he was enjoying it, just doing it to please me, etc. I was really confused the entire duration of what was over an hour. Fast forward: The experience didn't stop me from being insanely crazy over him, though. I loved how he talked to me nonstop. Okay, so he broke up with his ""bf"", we ended up moving in together, or him with me, and we both quit school at the same time without talking to each other about it, a bunch of things happened really fast all at once. Things were fine. I had a job. This may come off as off-putting, but he also partook in steroid use, is prescribed various prescription drugs, drank a lot, did body-building, etc. These things did not bother me because of his character, the way he spoke and his confidence. He was a very nice and charming person with a lot of potential and talents, and still is. For some reason I wanted to change, and wasn't really interested in focusing on the drugs anymore. Eventually, we move again into an apartment. Still, I'm feeling unfulfilled sexually and he doesn't express any kind of affection like most people? would expect in a relationship. At that point, I felt the relationship was serious, and I think he did, too. 

He was working long hours making 15$ an hour, which is a lot in my opinion. After moving in to the apartment, I couldn't maintain a job after this, which I was struggling with. I was still buying food somehow. My car had been stolen two times that year. At some point him and I got into a huge, violent fight after I hadn't slept for 24 hours, and he had proceeded to pester the cats which whom hadn't slept either. I asked him politely several times to leave them and I alone, as we hadn't slept. He was very upbeat and abnoxiously disobeying; and now that I'm thinking back this may have been his attempt at trying to lighten the mood but I wasn't having it. I was dead inside, and had been for months. I'm assuming that the combination of his and I physical attempts at intercourse and my drug use had negatively impacted my body; as I was no longer running six miles a day and couldn't find any kind of hobbies or social outlets. Anyways, he is around 6'2"" and 200 lbs. compared to my 5'4"" and 130 lbs (at the time). I got in his face after he disobeyed me and repeated myself, asking him to leave us alone. He pushed me, I pushed him and from there we got into a full-blown brawl, pushing each other into the walls, throwing things, breaking these. He swung at me several times and successfully gave me a black eye. He also managed to beat the back of my head with an aluminum bat, and waved a butane canister in my face after igniting it. This was a nightmare in the making, something you'd hear about on the news or in a movie. My adrenaline was running so high I was shaking and couldn't speak. He eventually left the house to go to the cops, whom showed up after I had called my grandma explaining the situation. When they entered the house, I sat on the floor rocking back and forth and hyperventilating for around twenty minutes unable to speak. They took photos. He got a night in jail. 

After this outbreak we both went our separate ways, I went back home to my mom's apartment with my mother and younger brother. This made me feel incredibly worthless at around 23/24 years old.

Eventually my mother had to intervene in my life, due to the fact that I wouldn't leave the house. I had no friends, was heart-broken and my self-esteem was in shambles. Not to mention, I still loved him despite the horrific affairs we'd been through. I realize it takes two to tango, and didn't blame him for everything, but really didn't understand why him and I couldn't communicate anything towards one another. 

My mom wanted me to see a therapist, which I did for six months. Part of the agreement was me taking medication, which I feared greatly because I had overdosed previously on some on accident a few months back. By accident, I mean I internalized all the bullshit from my living situation thinking that if I just take two more pills, I will be less depressed therefore more fun to interract with, etc. 

The therapy didn't help, I cried for hours at a time. Still couldn't find a direction in life that seemed fulfilling or interesting. Eventually, police showed up at my mom's after she called the therapist again, and they escorted me in an ambulance to be hospitalized. The reason they hospitalized me was because I was so depressed I wouldn't eat. I didn't eat for 28 days, and everyone thought I was trying to kill myself but in reality, after the depression set in I couldn't go to the bathroom; I couldn't run, I couldn't shit, I couldn't piss. So I chose to give my body a break from ""digesting"" and exerting physical energy, as I had always been extremely active. Being hospitalized was by far the most terrifying experience I ever had, due to the fact that the majority of the people I was around were actually very depressed and clinically ill, shitting their pants, screaming about arbitrary and insane things, kicking walls, etc. There were different levels of sick patients, including people who had actually killed people, etc. I was scared that they would never let me out, and that society actually thought I was deserving of living in this place. I called family and some people that I had previously hung out with in the years, seeking advice and support or just trying to distract myself from all the insanity in the hospital. It'd been about eight months since I had spoken to the SO, but decided to call him out of desperation as I really had no one else to talk to. There wasn't a man I could call that wouldn't expect me to sleep with him for some kind of ""friendship"". I had one friend being a girl come and visit me, and she really never was a great friend due to the fact that I always had to maintain positivity throughout the relationship for her and myself. She was rather depressed and had a lot of issues pertaining to self image, friends, men, family, existence in general. I loved her, but she was very mean to me. For example, she went to school for a degree in cosmetology and during the time that I was housing her, I asked her to trim my hair which she intentionally butchered in certain ways. Her excuse was that I was good looking so it didn't matter. 

That being said, I eventually got out of the hospital, but was deemed gravely disabled by the state. Throughout my stay there, the SO had been visiting me and talking on the phone to me regularly. He started to say that he loved me and was giving me the impression that he wanted to try to do this relationship again, being his first relationship with a woman. I was told that I had to continue going to the therapist for six months. I did so, and eventually got a job at Walmart... Which was miserable, working ten hour shifts on my feet until midnight and then coming in at six am to do it all over again. After getting sick from the stress of being there, I had an outfit of throwing up and actually threw up in front of my supervisor, (whom was younger than I), in which she told me wasn't a good reason to go home. Long story short I quit. Between my departure from the hospital in January 2016 and now, I have attended college with the help of the SO accomplishing a year of CAD Design. But the second year, in which we ended up taking the exact same classes, I noticed his behavior towards the only other girl in the class was extremely friendly. I developed a raging jealousy, because I was struggling in class, and the teacher was very disgusting towards me, making sexual remarks and saying things under his breath, etc. I never complained to the SO about this as I didn't want to come off as a drama queen. The teacher even hit me one time. I thought I was going crazy, because the world preaches so highly of itself and positivity, and body positivity, and mental health, and religion, and love, peace, etc. I thought I was just a very negative person. But things just kept getting worse. The teacher would change the assignment if I left the class to use the restroom ten feet away. And the class was starting to isolate me. I felt like there was something very wrong. The SO would leave frequently to go home and smoke weed, or masturbate, whichever. I started to realize that this person was extremely sexual in nature, overly sexual, and that's what drove me crazy; because he never displayed interest in me like that, but god forbid some other woman look at him and him getting a subtle erection and having to take care of it. I started to get furious at what I had gotten into. At some point during the first year of school I would start to go home and masturbate as well, which became a religious practice in attempting to keep my head clear so I could achieve good grades, (which I did, I made honor roll with a 3.8 or 3.9 GPA). If you can see the pattern, I tend to seek resolutions to my problems which I internalize, I don't talk about them or have any hobbies which bring me happiness or profit. I never liked the idea of masturbation or pornography, as I had fulfilling relationships that didn't include these things. I also feel it is rather degrading to both men and women alike, and don’t think that the whole world should have access to all of this, seeing how there are pedophiles and people who don’t respect women’s bodies, etc. I think it is very wrong, though I do not look down upon people who do it.  I was trying to change myself, because I had to. I had to appear happy and productive in society, though I wasn't. I had become a robot.

I start getting more and more angrier, as each attempt I made to fix something only lead to something else breaking. My life was out of control. Him and I separated again. I got another job, in which I was sexually harassed by several of the men there. I tried so hard to be a kind, compassionate and hard-working person (by hard-working; i.e. when working at FedEx Express at the airport, I managed to load an entire ULD canister with 7,000 lbs. of boxes, *neatly*)*.* I outworked every person there, including the men in an attempt to escape them and their conversations. I avoided everyone, I didn't tell on them because in my previous experiences of employment trying to reach out to people over sexual harassment always ended in me looking like an idiot and nothing being done about it. I recall my dad telling me once that aviation was a man's field and I should be careful. Well, I realized that maybe it was just a man's world in general. No matter how hard I worked, and did things better than them, I always got paid the same amount, and no recognition. On top of that, I'd get groped or rubbed up against innapropriately, despite my attempts at getting rid of them or avoiding them. I met some really cool women there, though, which I do not have a lot of women friends. I couldn't figure out if it was me, if it was drugs, if it was because I was in this relationship specifically.... 

I quit school, the SO and I broke up, after him telling me, ""go suck dicks and take it in the ass"". After crying to him about the fact that something was wrong at school, this was how he retaliated. I cried from Monday through Sunday, morning through night. I couldn't eat or sleep. I tried conveying this to him as well, in which he didn't care or couldn't empathize with. My grandma, whom I live with, didn't care either. Her response to me after explaining I was having a rough patch in school was, ""Do you ever just try and make yourself do something??"". 

Long story short, I don't have a great support system. My family is actually insane. I'd love to write a book about why I think this, as well, but it wouldn't take a lot more of this typing-crap.

I tried to tell him that some of his habits aren't great, and they affect other people including myself. Habits including spending all your money on drugs and food and watching porn, then going out into the world making claims that he's working his way up the ladder for a future job to earn more, etc. The possibility of him actually accomplishing this is still possible, but I felt like his version of life was very different than mine, only because I had been observing him all these years. I'm a very, very patient person, and tend to not speak until I have fully understood what it is I'm talking about. 

   
 

I personally have developed a number of neurosis over the years because of all the trauma, neglect, verbal abuse and insensitivity from him, my family, the health care system, random citizens, and what I thought were friends. Even though I tried to rebuild my life, go out and be social, it always boiled down to people looking for love. Looking for someone to love, or to fuck, I'm sure you all know what life can be like.

Because of his insensitivity and his claim for me to just go fuck people, I ended up talking to a guy I met at the smoking spot at school. He asked for my number, said why not, what do I have to lose. The SO wouldn't talk to me, and seemed to be moving on from my perspective. His priority was school he said, though all I could see was him trying to get his ""kicks"". The guy and I ended up hanging out, in which he kissed me and I let him, but pushed him off saying I couldn't because I wasn't ready. I had explained my situation to him and was hoping he wouldn't get mad at me for not wanting sex. Eventually I just let him have his way a few weeks later, but same thing happened when I told him I wasn't over the SO and I didn't understand why my life had changed. Though, the SO didn’t care for my whereabouts and told me to go fuck other people, I felt as if I were cheating on him, and also, hadn’t had sex in like over five years or so. This person actually was very kind and patient with me, and didn't freak out but I felt guilty about the situation. Even though I was desperately craving attention, and love, I still couldn't get over missing the SO's face. He was so deeply engrained in my brain that nothing seemed to fill the void. I was wreckless after this, crying, drinking, smoking cigars regularly, etc.

We eventually got back together, and I told him immediately after the guy and I slept together prior to us getting back together. I don’t believe that being dishonest or hiding things to obtain something is right. I told him what happened and my train of thought, but explained to him I NEEDED someone to talk to, to provide some kind of physical affection towards me in some capacity. 

Our relationship has gotten a lot better, and we have grown together. I realize that he has never kept a single person in his life, and I am the only person who has attempted to stick with him. On top of all this, after I got out of the hospital he confessed to me that he had injected a fairly large amount of silicone into his dick and balls. He claims that he likes the way it feels. I personally thought it was an attempt to prevent him from ever having sex again, seeing how our attempt was not enjoyable. He has further injected more and more over the last couple years. I was honestly dissappointed because I was hoping that we could grow together and maybe have a normal relationship at some point. I had to come to the realization that my attempt at being intimate with him was probably wrong, due to the fact that he identified as gay, and wasn’t ready for the responsibility of making a woman happy. Sexual chemistry is weird today with technology, pornography and that sort of stuff. I did not get mad at him for this and have been understanding. But we're closer than ever now, after all this circus-freak bullshit, and we still can't display affection towards each other in that capacity. He doesn't care. But doesn't understand how my life has been impacted since meeting him. How my life was derailed and I've been through some of the most horrific things because of our relationship. His lack of concern, empathy and consideration is still somewhat present, though he is starting to “speak” more like a normal significant other.

(I feel like I'm just complaining now, sorry).

   
 

Though, I find myself hating my life and wanting to kill myself, I move forward and know that each day provides a new opportunity for a new outlook or experience. Some days I love myself. But am living with a LOT of physical ailments due to this transitional phase in my life. My hormones are extremely out of control, since I've met him I started developing coarse, manly, facial hair at the tip of my chin, (nowhere else thank god). I would describe my existence as very primal, I am a female with a higher testosterone level, as doctors would describe it. I can't develop friendships, everyone I once knew has moved on and started families, or is working some high end job with no free time. I can barely stand to be around people in an enclosed environment, for I become overstimulated and start panicking, or need to smoke, or need to sleep, etc. I get extremely stressed out, and am very sensitive to other people's ""auras"".  I have a very weird relationship with food, though I am not anorexic and people (mainly my family) constantly are belittling me for my size and trying to force me to eat. I get terrified of them bringing up food due to them hospitalizing me because of it. I love having a drink, eating pizza, fried foods, coffee, whatever. I don’t have any diet restrictions for myself, because I know I can work it off later. I don’t sleep, typically five hours a day if I’m lucky. I wake up every night in a pool of sweat, which I need to change out and wash myself before reentering my bed. I have very vivid dreams, or nightmares, per se, when I do have them. The only dreams I ever had were of my father entering during a nightmare in which my family and I were being hurt, and him leaving. (I’m assuming a reflection of the abandonment I felt during these years). After I met the SO, I dreamt of him for a couple years very often, strangely. (Probably another reflection of feeling abandonment in a time of need). 

More recently, I have dreamt of things before they happen. Or I wake up swinging in a fit of rage.

I currently live in a state of disassociation, I do not lack empathy, but do not really love much of anything anymore.

I’ve continuously spoken about getting my own house, a career that pays enough to support mine and/or his lifestyle, but have broken every bridge I’ve ever made due to having to recover from everything from the past.. All my life?

I feel stuck. I need more help than anyone I know, yet I am the powerhouse behind everyone else’s dream.

Question: What is it like to be average, or normal, and have healthy relationships with people? In what cases involving extremely, broken people, have successful rebounds and manage to regain control of their life? 

I feel as if I need a babysitter, essentially, someone I can trust with my heart to not fuck me over anymore, and to actually listen to me, talk to me like a person. I am terrified of making any moves in my life whether relocating or finding a new job or spending money, because of the way that my family, SO and others have treated me. I feel like an alien everywhere I go, though people out in public do display kindness or respect towards me in some regards. For example, I did Uber for a year and it was a relatively okay experience. The concept of my doing something for someone and them thanking me has carried my spirit through these trying times. Though, I’ve managed to support myself “financially” I still manage to feel helpless. The last few years since I got back out of the hospital I have invested around $20k in the SO, in which he never really reciprocated. He has a large ego, and I guess expects everyone to worship the ground he walks on, including myself. I’ve come to the conclusion that he has decided that I’m doing him a favor, and I’m paying him for his time. At one point, he told me I “couldn’t afford him”.

I really want to keep him in my life, but don’t know how to practice living in a healthier fashion, maybe starting a friendship or taking part in a new social outlet, (this would be an attempt). I am considering trying to see other people, not necessarily for sex, but to have different perspectives on how a woman should or could be treated. I feel guilty saying this, but I’d imagine any long term relationship is based upon happiness, trust, compassion, sharing things, doing things, etc.

I’m interested in knowing if all “larger” men are just inconsiderate pricks because they are bigger. Also, do larger men have to sexually dominate everything, or are there successful relationships between smaller women and larger men?

Any insight, criticism, thoughts, opinions, etc, would be appreciated. Thank you for your time and have a great day.

Summary: 27 year old female drug through a life of emotional abuse, neglect, physical abuse from men and no father. Continually ends up with assholes, and has been in a relationship with a man for six years who injected two pounds of silicone into his dick and has no intention of being a normal couple, per se. Likes pornography and used to do A LOT of drugs. Put me in a mental hospital. We have a normal relationship now, or more respectful, but he has such a huge ego complex about himself it feels as if he can’t empathize or sympathize with anything. I’m struggling because I don’t know how to convey to him that he still is hurting me, and I have invested over $20k into him the last few years, with student loan money and my generic minimum wage jobs. Any job I’ve had I typically get sexually harassed. I have no friends, no body I can count on in times of need. I am a petit woman, who basically carries the entire world on her shoulders, and am continuously judged from my family and him. More than anything I think I just needed to vent this somewhere.",29May2019,0

641,"Hi, so I got accepted into a dance school in Copenhagen (International Dance Academy) and I currently live in Ireland where my education so far has been free. They teach exactly what I want and set me up with agencies after completion but its 12k for a year which I know in comparison to most schools isn't a lot but going from paying nothing as it's free in Ireland, its quite a jump for me.  I can risk the debt and do it but it's a big risk and I'm really not sure what to do. I'm currently in my final year of a Bachelors Degree in English in Anthropology that I don't want. My alternative is to do a ballet degree in Ireland over 3 years which would be a little cheaper but wouldn't give as much of varied education in dance and I'd be stuck in Ireland for another 3 years which would be my nightmare LOL. Could anyone with experience on any kind of situation that relates to this try and help me out and weigh my options? I'd really appreciate it

P.S if u couldn't tell, I didn't realise I had a passion for dance until around 18 and If I knew I would have pursued it a lot earlier.

Thanks!",29May2019,1
642,"Me and my wife been constantly fighting for the past couple of months. We had one argument before this major one. The first argument was because I went out with my friends instead of spending time with her.  She feels like I don’t give her enough attention through our marriage. We been together for 5 years and we have one daughter together. During that argument I ignored her for a couple of days.  But we made up. Fast forward 2 months later we get into a similar argument because I went out with a friend. I do agree with that I did not give her as much attention as I should. But this argument took it to the next level. Whenever she is mad at me she threatens to leave me and tell me she don’t love me and wants a to separate. So I wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine. I told her some stuff to get her mad and worked up. I said I didn’t care what she did, that I don’t love her, and she can find someone out. So that’s exactly what she did. The argument between me and her lasted 2 months with us not speaking to each other. But the main point is I found out she slept with another man. Knowing that she cheated  just put me through depression. To summarize things I pushed her away to the point where she cheated on me. The last couple of days I been trying to talk to her and work things out because I don’t want to throw away our relationship. I told her I’m willing to forgive and forget that she cheated and I will change and give her more attention and spend more time with her. I admitted my wrongs to her but I want her to admit she is also wrong for cheating. But she said she doesn’t feel guilty and that it’s not cheating because I pushed her away. I want to forgive and forget and work things out, but I feel like she doesn’t want the same. What should I do? Thanks for any advice",29May2019,1

He was always my big brother. He was my hero growing up, so whenever we fought, I saw it as an opportunity to be as good, strong, or smart as my hero.

I feel like I would have an edge, considering this person and I both did the same extracurriculars in college (Model UN, Volunteer Radio) and studied the same field (Digital Media).

But I have recently been feeling really uncomfortable at work because the head chef will often privately message me on Facebook, he seems to think we are really close friends but I don’t see him that way. 

The messages aren’t necessary creepy, he will usually just ask me why I haven’t been at work if I have been rostered off for a few days, or he’ll ask me if I miss him and often press me about when we are going to “hang out”. He tries to give me advice I didn’t ask for about my life / relationships. 

He either treats me like a best friend or a child. 
I don’t even consider him a friend, he’s just a coworker and I think it’s resly inapropriate that he messages me privately, considering he’s in a management position.  I don’t know what to do about it. I feel like I can’t say anything without getting fired or burning my bridges.

650,"I’m a salaried employee working at small but successful company with less than 100 employees. The whole office is quite tight with one another, like a family. When I started I had a boss who was very understanding and accepting that I wanted clear work-life boundaries- I arrive before 9 and leave at 5, save for crunch times when there’s a lot of work due. Recently though, my boss left the company for another and was replaced with a new one formerly from Silicon Valley. She’s kind of odd, she really wants to be everyone’s friend but can be aggressive about what time people are and aren’t at work. The other day at a meeting she asked the entire room when they left work at night. Most said 5:30 to 6, but I said 5 because I usually am first to arrive at work. She then asked me if I can start staying until at least 5:30 because “5 is kind of early”

Honestly, I’m fine with leaving at 5:30 and sometimes I leave that time anyway. But generally I leave when my work gets done, and I’ve never had complaints about not reaching my deadlines before (and I haven’t missed one yet). I feel a bit offended and embarrassed that she would bring this up in front of my coworkers. I will stay late to finish work, but I want to know I at least had the choice to leave at 5.

How do I tell her that this crossed a line with me? Is there a way to gently discourage this? I’m not sure how to handle this because 99% of this company is very tolerant of people making their own schedules (I have a coworker who leaves at 4:30 and works from home once a week) and generally being live and let live.",29May2019,1
651,"I don’t know if this is the right place to ask but a couple of months ago I was sexually assaulted about five minutes away from where I live. I didn’t go to the police at the time and I regret it more than anything now. But I’m trying to move forward with myself now and leave it behind me.  I’m not financially ready to move from this neighborhood yet so that’s not an option at the moment. 

It’s just that no matter how hard I try to move on, I always end up back in the same depressive state. I spent a long time forcing myself to do things that are better for me. It felt good getting things done at first but the enjoyment wears off pretty quick and I’m back to feeling terrible again.

I’m also really afraid of the future of all my relationships.  It’s like I completely forgot how to interact with my friends. My family made it pretty clear that they don’t fuck with me anymore so I’ve given up hope on that. I still have a few close friends that know what I’ve been through but everyday I feel like I’m drifting more and more from them.  I don’t know how to hold a conversation and I’m pretty sure whatever personality I had got flushed down the toilet sometime ago. 

I used to love modeling and doing art but these days I can barely get out of bed or eat. I’ve tried therapy several times and it only made me feel worse every time it didn’t work out.  I don’t know what I’m expecting to get from typing all of this out but I’m getting desperate.

654,"I am 23f and my best friend is 20f. I will call her Kim. Kim was one of my first few friends in a new state- 4 years ago. Last August she moved about 2 hours away for school and we don't talk as often and I wish but when we do talk, it is like we picked up right where we left off. 

&amp;#x200B;

She recently came into town for the weekend and met up with me at my go to bar ( She is underage so she brings her own alcohol in and does not buy from the bar ). She shows up at about midnight and I am already pretty white girl wasted so I slowed it down so I can actually hold a conversation with her. She caught up to my drunk level pretty quick and we started talking all that girl talk! 

&amp;#x200B;

We are talking about boys- how she is so happy that my boyfriend and I are going to strong still and that she misses us. I ask about her dating life and she is telling me all these fucking crazy tinder hook ups ( no judgement) and she slips in "" Yeah I have been seeing a lot of girls too. It was weird at first because I couldn't suck dick but I am getting used to it now. I was so scared to tell you. Which reminds me I had sex with this guy..."" I didn't know what to say for a few reasons. 

1: I always had a feeling she swung both ways. We never talked about it because I figured she would tell me when she is ready. 

2: It was so sudden and random and slipped into the conversation that I had to actually think about what she just said to be sure I heard it right. 

3: I was very drunk and did not want to say anything stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so happy she told me this update in her life, because she is my best friend and I just want her happy! But we have not spoke about it since and I can't tell if she wants me to initiate the conversation or if she slipped it in because she wanted to tell me without having a full blown conversation about her sexuality.

656,"Sorry for it being slightly long-winded, it's been a week dealing with this...

&amp;#x200B;

Moved out of California, about a week ago now to the Phoenix area of Arizona. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend, ten year old daughter and I booked a stay at Studio 6 Mesa.

&amp;#x200B;

EVERYTHING was wrong;

&amp;#x200B;

There was a ""kitchenette"" with a non-working ""stove"" (hotplate) and DISGUSTING dishes with rotten stinking water left for us to use with no soap anywhere in the room of any kind.

&amp;#x200B;

The bed had no blanket, with a DISGUSTING mattress under the single sheet/mattress cover. (Blood, urine, dirt... an alley mattress basically)

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was broken or missing, DIRTYYYY.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the move and restricted funds, we had no choice but to bite it and smile since we couldn't afford to have a refund tied up for however many business days. 

(They knew our situation, for the record.)

&amp;#x200B;

About 4 or so hours into our stay, my door is knocked on SUPER aggressively and I'm confronted by the girl at the front desk and some crazy tweaker looking lady who at first, wouldn't say anything, just stood shaking her head getting progressively more angry at my replies.

&amp;#x200B;

I was accused of having MULTIPLE strangers in and out of my room, BLATENTLY selling drugs to people coming on and off the property on bicycles.... 

I remained calm, explained they had cameras they needed to look at, because it was OBVIOUSLY not me or my ten year old, or my boyfriend...

&amp;#x200B;

I have the tweaker lady in my face at this point, screaming at me how she doesn't ""like people who don't belong here"" (again, CA &gt; AZ) and then physically threatened me, literally saying she'd ""beat my ass"".... ""just like the guy we had  beat last night.""

&amp;#x200B;

She explained while screaming at me that she doesn't believe me, over and over until she FINALLY hears me tell her to look at her own damn security footage. She then screams way more profanities at me by telling me she'll ""check them again"" LOL okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, I was right. (Didn't see that coming, did you?) I went into the office about half an hour afterwards, only for the daughter to explain that ""You were right, it was your neighbors......... two doors down, two rooms, two guys that are renting next to you, that's why you got in trouble."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I got in trouble?

Okaaaaaay then. 

&amp;#x200B;

NO apology from her, ABSOLUTELY no apology or even an appearance from the crazy tweaker who threatened me, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to 3AM.

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up with my arms and sides BURNING.

I look at my arm, and find TWO bedbugs on me, mid-bite.

&amp;#x200B;

I pack my stuff right then, load it up in my rental truck and call the emergency/after hours/lockout office number that they have posted on their office door. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two calls, both rejected. The third resulted in me finding out that whoever's number that is, actually just shut it off without knowing who or why anyone is calling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I send a text with a picture of the bug, and a question as to why the after hours number would be shut off before they even know why someone is calling. 

&amp;#x200B;

By this time, I had already counted twelve bites on my arms alone (hadn't seen my torso or legs yet) and more than ten on ONE of my daughter's arms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mine were welting up, BADLY.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up having to go to a motel down the road after sleeping three hours in the truck with everyone and everything in a city we didn't know, after being eaten alive.

&amp;#x200B;

When I show up in the office in-person to deliver one of the live bugs I kept in a bottle to show them, BEFORE EVEN OPENING MY MOUTH, the tweaker lady sees my boyfriend and I, and SCREACHES (hand to God, I am not exaggerating) ""OH MY GOD THE ROOF IS ON FIRE, IT'S A FUCKING EMERGENCYYYYYY CA THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!!!!! WE BROUGHT BED BUGS WITH US AND WANT TO STAY FOR FREEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! GET THE FUCK OUT!!!! YOU brought them!!!!!!! WE DON'T HAVE BUGS HERE!!!!""

.....

&amp;#x200B;

Well... then she walked away slamming doors and on the phone with Terminix, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So her daughter/front desk girl (found that out) is left MORTIFIED and shaking, obviously nervous. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're told they can't prove it wasn't us who brought the bugs, if they have any bugs at all. LOL

Fair enough. 

We're told that we won't get a refund until they can prove it wasn't us. 

Again, fair enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

But no sorry. No addressing us JUST getting screamed at.... (I have a recording of this, me even asking for an apology, or explanation or ANYTHING lol)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm told Terminix will come and check it out.

Whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I call Maricopa County, because at this point it's OBVIOUS the tweaker woman (who I was told by this time that she's the ""owner"") isn't ever going to own up to ANY mistakes, so why would I trust their 'outcome'?

&amp;#x200B;

The county sent one of their environmental health and safety agents out to inspect the property, to give me an unbiased finding.

&amp;#x200B;

Terminix made it first, and sprayed the infestations they found.

&amp;#x200B;

But see, I was called and told that the bug I gave them, was ""a baby cockroach"" which... it wasn't. It was currently feasting on my arm when I caught it. It has my blood in it's belly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever.

The desk girl calls me, downplays THE CRAP out of the infestation saying that it's still so new and isolated to our room that they still ""aren't sure"" or something about who brought them to that room but that yes, they'll refund me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the county calls me...

The property was infested in ""a BUNCH"" of the spots the county I spected, spanning the WHOLE motel. 

MULTIPLE rooms, MULTIPLE batches of bed bugs bodies that Terminix produced by spraying...

&amp;#x200B;

Basically it was, in NO WAY, us who brought the bugs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now our money is gone because it's ""been refunded"" but that was around Thursday and the whole 5-7 business day wait, PLUS the holiday... and my rental has been returned....

&amp;#x200B;

MY issue is that Motel 6/G6/Studio 6 corporate WON'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

They wouldn't comp that room I had to pay for, for the same day I already paid for...

&amp;#x200B;

They won't compensate for the clothing that cannot be thrown into a dryer, or the itch/swelling/pain relief we had to buy for everyone....

&amp;#x200B;

They won't even have someone reach out to me for an apology.

&amp;#x200B;

They left us with no place to stay after that last room for the weekend, our money (still) in limbo, and with having to figure out where to be/how to clean our stuff after having to shove it all together....

&amp;#x200B;

The COMPANY won't even apologize.

&amp;#x200B;

They told me that she told them she sent me an email apologizing; a BLATANT lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

I reported this to the BBB already, haven't heard back yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm asking for advice in hopes that SOMEONE with a random resource for how to get this resolved or ANY ideas or ANYTHING.

&amp;#x200B;

This has turned MISERABLE for us, and put us in a situation that is pretty crappy. 

&amp;#x200B;

They knew our money was tied in moving expenses and that we needed to carry over before our moving into an apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with this?

How do I bring more attention to this?

(I'm not the only one according to Yelp, this is her ""thing"" with people from outside of Arizona....)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to ask for, but I'm at a loss and it feels like she's been allowed to just act like this....

658,"hello reddit

i met my girlfriend nearly 2 years ago on instagram, we'll call her F. a blossoming friendship turned into love. we live 200 miles apart so yes we've been doing the long distance thing. we see each other maybe once a month on average.

F was living with a guy at the time called M, their relationship had died years ago (her words). she is still living with M now. technically her ex i might add.

she has told M about my existence and that we plan to be together. M did not take it too well. F hasn't worked for years as M makes lots of monies. a LOT more than me. 

M has done all he can to keep her financially trapped. So she got a job for herself and we've been saving up together for months. it is not enough to help yet. she's started to get her name taken off the contract for the house they rent, removed from bills etc...

which is where the need for any advice comes in.

i've never had any contact with M for these almost 2 years.
until today.
i had no missed call but a creepy fucking voicemail from M. basically saying he's gonna do everything in his power to keep her there. i should back off as he knows all about our 'escape plan' as he put it.
he offered me money to leave her alone. OBV i would never take money and run. if anything i'd take it and use it to help her.
except, it seems he's a rich psychopath. i was told not to tell F and that he's gonna call back tomo. he even said they're married! wtf. i'm 95% sure they're not married but what the actual fuck.

also F has a 12yr old daughter from a previous relationship. so i love the little girl as much as F and i'm scared for them being so far away. M will not hurt them but yanno he is mental.

what do i do guys? i'm pretty sure they're not married and they were done years ago. the kid is defo not his as the daughter visits her real dad on wkends. 

any help is appreciated.

met a woman online, fell in love. her rich psycho ex, who still lives with her and her daughter has left a voicemail and told me to back off, even offered money. he's gonna call back tomo. what i do?",29May2019,1
659,"So in the coming week I'm gonna be meeting one of my boyfriend's closest friends from home for the first time. He hasn't told me much about her but she seems like a really cool person and my boyfriend is really fond of her. I really want to make a good impression, and in the past when I've met his family/other close friends I've managed to not be too quiet but I still feel like I could do better. I just generally tend to become really introverted in group settings and feel like I'm interrupting if I talk or worry about saying the wrong thing. Especially when someone in that group is someone who I think is really cool or really care about impressing, the pressure is on even more and I get more anxious. 

What's happened with meeting his friends/relatives in the past is also being quiet until someone asks me something and then I can respond and a conversation starts but I feel like I'm really bad at holding conversations that are not sort of one-sided in that way and I can feel really awkward coming up with questions or things to talk about otherwise.

So with all that said I was wondering if anyone's got any advice on how to overcome my introversion and try to have fun when meeting someone who's so important to my boyfriend?

6 months later, I again get a bill. This time, they say I owe $150. Insurance paid $33. The rest was “adjustments.”

The hospital billing said that insurance opened the case back up and rescinded payment. The adjustments were the insurance company bargaining down the price of the total bill. 

I call my insurance company, and they tell me that I have a $220 co-pay. The $62 covered part of it, and the remaining balance is my copay.

682,"I generally get the same advice, when I seek it on this topic. Admittedly, it helps me to just get it out there. 

I've been married for 13 years to the same woman. We've never had a period where we considered divorce. Still to this day, I'm bound to save this family, despite feeling a separation would open her eyes a bit.
See, I'm literally the only one, in this four person family, that will contribute anything at all to our care. As in i work 60 hours on a midnight shift. Another 20 for my dad during the day (with very lousy pay, I might add). When I come home I make dinner, clean up the house, if I even feel like it, and any other daily responsibility that may arise. I pay the bills. I grocery shop. Just literally every responsibility. 
My wife's day consists of sleeping from 9 am, or so, til 3 pm when school is in. She may wake up periodically to smoke cigarettes and drink coffee, but ultimately she'll go back too sleep, til they're home. Once they've settled she'll catch a cat nap from 7-9. When she does finally get up, she'll spend the day watching cable TV, and chain smoking. Maybe drink a couple cups of coffee. Never leaving her bed but to use the bathroom or gather something she wants. 
Then around midnight she'll take me to work. Yes she'll drive me to work, cause we both agree she should have the car. In case an emergency with the kids were too arise, cause I'm gone for 9 hours. Before it was a chore to get her to just drive me there but I threatened to quit paying insurance and for her phone if she couldn't do that much for me. 
There's countless examples of that.
Let me go ahead and address the elephant in the room. Yes, she has depression. Hence the sleeping and lack of intrest in anything. She sees a therapist. She has for years. She's on antidepressants. She has been for years. Various ones, as a matter of fact.  
I've tried everything I can think of to get her to feel the love and care for her family, the same way I do. We've had long talks about how our relationship is especially one sided. She always has an excuse to try and justify her lack of support. Her mind is driven by nothing but her ego. Every time I've ever brought it up, she insists, I'm telling her what to do. And yes, I've used very compassionate and understanding speech, to try and help her, come to her own conclusions about this. It generally ends in one of us frustrated. 
I once made the observation, that she only cares about her bubble. What's happening in front of her, or should I say too her, at this very moment. I spoke up about this, and told her, this isn't a slight at you, this is just an observation (I have to speak like that to get anywhere). Her response was ""maybe so, but you think about too much"". I wanted her too understand if I didn't ""think too much"" then there would be none of what she has. No electricity or roof over her head. Blah blah blah.  I could go on forever. There's so much ridiculous rationalizations I could tell, but I'll spare you the details. 
One time I posted something similar to 4chan, and the best advice I got was that I (as in me) had a lot of problems but I need to get her to a doctor quickly. 
Well I've done that. Nothing is physically wrong with her. She just doesnt have the energy, gumption, or intrest to help with....well...anything.  
She's admitted on occasion ""she just doesnt know what's wrong with her, she just doesnt want to do anything"". That's as far as I've gotten, therapeutically wise. She had a rough...ROUGH...childhood. she's clinically depressed and has gotten zero help from the medical field. Hence why I'm trying to do it.
I've made threats. Tried being kind. Tried yelling, screaming, arguing, while the kids were away. I've tried being supportive. Talking and talking and talking, in all sorts of manners, every which way you can Imagine. 
But now, at this current time. I'm just broken. I don't wanna leave her. Only because I have no one else to watch the kids while I work. I've warned her that when they're old enough to take care of themselves , then I regrettably won't need her anymore. It makes me sad to even think that, much less say it. 
I loved her. I loved her so much I thought there was nothing she could do to make me stop. She had every piece of me, put into this relationship, to start this family and both of us work to make things as good as they could get. She agreed that's what she wanted too. Partners in the world, to boost each other, in any way we can. 
I wish there was some way to fix this. But she needs to want it too. I fear she just doesnt anymore.

693,"I'm a 37 year old guy with a pretty good life. I have a PhD, a job that pays me in the top 5% of Americans, athletic, great family, well traveled, community leadership (I lead a non-profit on the side), a home I own, and a great BF. (I know, these reflect MY values, but, other than pay, these are what matter to me). The thing is, I feel unfulfilled. My PhD focused on Public Policy related to helping vulnerable people. I'm not really doing that much at my current job. I also love global work, and again, not doing that much.

&amp;#x200B;

The BF is great, I'm in love with him but I'm not passionate about him. We've been together a year and a half and I'm still not interested in moving in. Of course, that might reflect that I know I'm not really happy with my job and I know I cannot commit any more to him until I am really ready to commit. Finding a BF has been a major problem, but I really do want to marry. I usually date guys who I am passionate and wild about and the candle burns way too fast. This guy is great through - he tries and explores new things, is stable, and super nice.

&amp;#x200B;

The job is an interesting asset. I started in January. I was hired to do state and local work in my region - so for at least a year or two I need to pay my dues. The company has a very global and if I play my cards right I might be able to do some global work in a year or two (or use this to jump to another firm). However, I do not live in one of the major global cities where this work is centered in the US, so it would be challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I feel like I have two options...

&amp;#x200B;

1). Stay put and let things grow for a bit. Just stop being so aggressive, enjoy the job, the pay, the boy, and the life, and re-assess in a year.

&amp;#x200B;

2). Go. Sell my house and put the money away to cover for a salary cut I'll take. Join the UN (I'm currently on their hiring roster) or whatever at a level or two below where I am now and work up quickly. Break up with the BF (long distance and moving are not an option - this was clear from Day 1 and in his case it's fair).

694,"A little backstory on this situation: 

Sometime last July or August I noticed damage on the front left side of my car. I had just gotten damage repaired in basically the same spot and was going through a stressful time in life so it was the last thing that I needed. Luckily there was a note on my windshield letting me know that someone had done it while trying to park (I have street parking). To the best of my knowledge the note said something along the lines of: 

"" Hi i am the one who hit your car while trying to park. I am very sorry I was visiting a friend and do not parallel park much. I would prefer to just pay cash for repairs you can contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx or my husband at xxx-xxx-xxx."" (More on this later).

Now, this was a relief because I could tell that the entire side bumper would need to be replaced and potentially something done to the side door as well. A little disclosure that I drive a 2-4 year old model of a car that retails for $80,000-$100,000 in the USA brand new. Repairs are not cheap. I had just been in an accident where I rear ended somebody and the price for similar repairs on my vehicle were in the $2000-$3000 range. That being said the damage was cosmetic and not extremely noticeable and i guess i had already gotten use to having damage there. I was going through a very tough time in life at the moment in time- Serious relationship drama, and the death of a family member combined so I set the note aside to reach out in a week or two. 

Well, when I got a little free time I could not find the note to save my life. It was stressful but once again the damage was cosmetic and didn't affect my daily life. I looked pretty hard but had no luck. It was to the point where i was chucking it up as a big fat ""L"". I did have suspicions on what house the ""friend"" who did the damage was probably staying so often times i would park in front of their house just to see if anyone would put anything on my car. Never much luck, and unfortunately a lot of my neighbors keep to themselves in have garages in the back alley so I rarely see them. I thought about posting notes on doors or knocking door to door to try to figure it out but life happens. 

Fast forward to about a week ago. I am relocating to a new city career wise and I am in the process of cleaning up my house so that I can rent it out, and what do you know the note turns up in a very obscure place. This was very surprising but what was even more surprising was that my memory of what the note says was Off! IT WAS ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS. Not only was it one of my neighbors but it was also one who lived on the other side of the street I never would have expected, but also somebody I would see out and about and always be very cordial with and make small talk. I had to have had almost a dozen small conversations with her or the husband since the damage was done to my vehicle. I have been wrestling back and forth since then on what to do. 

It has clearly been a long time since it happened, but I never have gotten the damage repaired yet. I have the note which clearly takes responsibility for hitting my car and gives contact info for both her and her husband. Beyond that they lived right across from me and saw me all the time and never once mentioned anything about it to me or found it necessary to reach out again because they hadn't heard from me about the wreck. Did they think I decided to go get it fixed myself and not want them to pay? My best guess is that they figured the note flew off the car and they were just gonna leave it at that if i never brought it up. Not exactly the best person! 

My question is what should I do? I know that I rightfully deserve to have them pay to get the damage fixed. Is the right thing to do to reach out to them directly about it now? Is it a legal issue at this point? Should I file an accident report? Would appreciate anybody's outlook on the situation because either way I feel the amount of time that has elapsed is going to make it tough. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;: Me neighbor backed in to my car while trying to park and did a decent amount of cosmetic damage ($2-3K worth for my car). Left note taking responsibility but I misplaced note before I could contact and incorrectly remembered the content and thought it was a neighbor's friend who did it. Found note while cleaning up to move and it was neighbor I am cordial with the whole time, has never mentioned it to me once. What are my options?",29May2019,1
696,"Background: Me and this girl (let's call her K) had a nice relationship, extremely good friends always there for each other.
One day she fell for a guy I honestly didn't like but sinse it was HER we are talking about I decided that I'd do everything to get them together. I had major success until a hoe got involved and made him fall for her instead (reason why I didn't like him beforehand)
That broke the K's heart and she was nearly committing suicide... That's where I step in and tell her if she doesn't have any reason to live then she should give her life to me therefore living for me. She told me she give herself sometime and then she'd give me an answer and in the meanwhile she'd live for me. This happened 4 months ago and I had to immigrate but we still talked all the time and I was ready for a relationship even if at a distance.
That's when she started posting pictures with others guys and flirty phrase, hell she was even on a bed with one guy. She never did such with me.


What happened:

So today, as I finally reached my breaking point, I told her I simply couldn't do it anymore because of the distance and because of the stuff that has been happening around me, if I stayed with her that way I'd just be snapping constantly and getting mad and probably make her sad.
That's where the sh*t began, she firstly called me retarded and told me she defo couldn't stop loving me, I told it was for the best and got called stupid for.
Then I told her off by saying: ""K, I simply cannot have you love me anymore because I can't be anymore of help to you. Find someone who can be way better than me and that you can live for. I'll always help you with your problems just not in the same way as I would before.""
Now knowing her past I'm scared she might commit suicide, these are her last words to me: ""Shut up"" - ""I don't want to talk to you again"" - ""Forget me"".

They have always been really messy and lazy, but when I lived at home I was pretty good at keeping the place together (doing the dishes, general cleaning and maintenance) but since I moved out the place has fallen to all hell.

Everyone keeps telling me that I got to let it go and that its not my problem anymore but this makes me feel very guilty. But I already spend so much energy maintaining my own life and pursuits on top of helping watch my Aunts son as much as I can. (I drive to their house every morning to take him to school and I watch him after school on the days I don’t have work. 

Now that its spring time their yard is starting to look like a jungle (another thing I took care of) which is kind of becoming a breaking point for me. 

I am so frustrated because they are grown adults and should know how to take care of basic living responsibilities, but they never change and always blame it on each other.

She's 20 now and doesn't do much outside of sitting on the computer or in her room. I'm not very fond of her due to inappropriate behavior that I became sick of. What behavior? She was constantly touching me sexually, making jokes about having a sexual relationship with me, and disrespecting my personal space and wishes to stop all this (I was 16 at the time, currently 22). My parents know about this behavior and don't seem to care much.
She and my youngest sister are really close which bothers me so much because my sister is 11, my cousin is 20, and she displays the same behavior towards my sister. She has made sexual jokes with/towards her, read inappropriate stuff online with her, encouraged her to act out, and so on. Both my parents know about this behavior and still do nothing. I have addressed it before numerous times and I've been told that I have no right to do anything about it and that I'll be forced to leave the house (I don't live there anymore, but have to stay currently due to work).

This wouldn’t be as upsetting if I had at least been able to meet new people and have fun, I’ve struggled to make friends for a few years now.

703,"TL;DR: Not sure if I should give up friends I just started hanging around with. Should I just walk away and try again or try to understand and connect with these people?

Back in high school I was friendly with a lot of people, but never tried to hang out with them outside of school. Most of my friend interactions were with my brother’s (2 years older) friend group. Most of my time alone was spent playing video games and I never really cared to hang out of school. My friends from Sophomore year of HS to now(5 years) have been my cousin and our mutual friend that we play video games with.

Now I’m in college and had recently started talking to people in one of my classes. After the semester ended and some time past, I started to have conflicting feelings about my “friends”. Maybe it’s just noticing the bad in people, but any of the things I don’t like about them make me wonder why I put in the effort to people I don’t really care about. When it comes to conversation I feel like I’m only myself half the time and the other half is trying to hard to be someone I’m not. They share similar interests, but they all have qualities I don’t like: one of them is never sober (a lot of alcohol + weed), one of them is overly negative, and is hard for me to want to open up too as she sometimes (unintentionally?) makes a face when I talk to her about personal topics (my future, my major, etc.). 

All I know is that I wanted to try having friends this semester and after just a few weeks I feel like I don’t really care about these people. Right now I want to stop talking to them altogether, but I don’t really mean in I’ll intention, I just don’t like them like I thought I did. But I’m also wondering if I’m being too harsh to them? Ive had a past of running away from things I’m scared of, so I’m was wondering if I should be trying to stick it out and actually get to know and interact with them?

Let's begin, i am turning 17 in couple of months and i have big problems with my bodyweigh, i currently weigh somewhere near 155kg, yes i am aware that this is alot.
Everyday when i start to think about my life, i get depressed and scared that i might not live longer than 18-20.

I have tried exercise and diet before but it didn't work out at all and it made me feel more depressed and worthless than i have ever felt before, so i quit my exercise and diet, i tried again and again once in a while but it's so hard to accomplish something when you have no motivation and depression messes your mind.
I feel like that only thing that can save me is stomach band or some kind of surgery, but they cost very much, around 4000€.
I have 1000€ but obviously it isn't enough.
I don't have a job and my family nearly makes ends meet each month, and asking them for such a big money is very embarrasing.

The other very big issue is my depression.
I can manage to keep myself happy and not depressed for week max but then it starts all over again.

My boyfriend, though, is notoriously messy. He told me not to worry about that so much as it was probably more for him than me.

She also has made mention that she doesn't like 'us' in PJs all day but she was made aware that I came to this house with little to no clothing. I have 3 pairs of pants and 2 of those are PJs. I also prefer to wear looser fitting clothing because.. pregnancy! So I do not understand what she wants me to wear...

But what really struck me was that his mother told him he needs to stand up for himself against me. I am still not even sure as to why or what. I am not bossy. I do not make or ask him to do things. He does often choose to randomly approach me with food/drink unasked because I am pregnant with his first child (their first grandchild) and everyone knows my history with high risk pregnancies and miscarriage. 

It really kind of bothered me. He told me that it was, again, meant more for him because his mother thinks him ""weak"" due to a previous relationship. A girl he had previously been engaged to 3 or so years ago that she did not like. However, I told him that if she wants him to stand up for himself then there is clearly something she thinks there is to stand up to... And I don't know what I've done. 

I've been very appreciative, helpful (cleaning the kitchen, helping with animals, dishwasher, etc..), cordial and overall just so very thankful. I engage in polite conversation. I stay to myself but am social. Everything I thought would be appropriate? His mother was super friendly and chatty the first few days. She asked about me and my girls (past relationships) and how her son had been when we were in the city. I talked very highly of my boyfriend - he is a wonderful man. 

She hasn't said anything to me. He tells me I shouldn't worry because even if something is wrong she likely won't approach me about it. This does not make me feel any better. I feel less welcome now. Like I am a burden. Like I am only welcome here because of him. Much less comfortable. My boyfriend doesn't get it. He keeps getting frustrated with me for ""being in my feelings"" and he says that am overthinking the situation. I don't think I am. I've never had a partner who's parents like me and this is how it always begins and it spirals down...

I do not want to confront her, as this is our only place to stay until we save up enough to be able to get our own place... And I am afraid if I somehow upset her that we will be asked to leave. 

How can I explain to my boyfriend how I feel without him saying that I'm over thinking? How can I feel more comfortable here without confronting anyone? What can I possibly do to be more ""accepted""? What could I possibly have done wrong?

Tl;Dr

Boyfriend's mom told him to stand up to me. I don't even know why. I am polite, social, and help with chores without being asked. No one has said anything to me, only to him. He gets mad and says I am over thinking that she has a problem with me directly. What do I do about this situation and how do I get my boyfriend to understand that it is more of a big deal and shouldn't he blown off?",29May2019,6
709,"A little background about me: I recently just got out of a 2 year relationship that completely destroyed my ability to communicate with other people. I didn’t realize how toxic and bad this relationship was until I had already lost most of my closest friends. Basically, I lost a lot of friends because my gf at the time just wouldn’t let me have any that I could spend time with. So after breaking up with her, I feel like I don’t really have any close friends anymore and my life, although feeling better, feels very distraught and I just don’t know how to talk to people anymore. Im at school far from home and other than my roommates/suitemates I hardly have any friends. I have a lot of social anxiety going outside my room and always have headphones in when walking through a crowded area. I stutter when I talk to people and avoid eye contact at all times when I’m outside. I dont know If I should wave or say hi to my classmates outside of class or ask to hangout with them or what. I just generally have a really hard time talking to people because I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. It seems like I have three personas I play off of since I feel like nobody would like who I really am let alone my fake personas (and its not like I know who I really even am).  Sorry for this long rant.

The actual problem: There are these two girls I met in class that invited me to go study with them on a specific day, but unfortunately couldn’t because they ended up being busy. I thought nothing of it, but eventually I texted one of them, lets call her Annie,  if they wanted to study that night. No response, but it seemed fine. Next thing I know they start to ignore me and not talk to me OR I felt as though they didn’t want to talk to me so I ignored them which lead them to think I don’t like them or something. I don’t know if you can tell but I second guess myself a lot and just am terrible in social situations. Anyways, one day annie asked if I wanted a drink she got from work and I start talking to her a little bit more that day but again I asked if they wanted to study again that night and again no response. I didn’t realize that this probably made them uncomfortable but I didn’t think anything of it. Because of this I just started to avoid them and now we just don’t talk anymore. And I always leave class before them so I don’t have to be in an awkward situation. It feels really awkward to since I can tell they are staring at me in class since I always sit right next to them. Anyways tomorrow I have class with annie and want to apologize/clear up any confusion but I have no idea how to reconcile or how to even start it off. I know this sounds like a middle school problem or whatever but I generally just don’t know how to socialize with people anymore. Also, no I’m not trying to romantically pursue any of them just want to try and make more friends. Again, sorry for this long rant and thanks for reading this",29May2019,1
710,"I [24F] was either in middle or early high school when my dad [59] came home from work one day, sobbing, telling myself, my sister [24F], and mom [65F] he had done something really wrong. After that, he was on the computer an awful lot, so I looked up the search history. It was largely related to statutory rape. He never went to jail but he did quit his job not long after all of this and has been retired since. 

I know someone who has a connection to a lawyer who can look up criminal backgrounds. He’ll look up his daughter’s boyfriend’s. I was thinking to ask him to look up my dad but I’m afraid to know the truth.

I’m also trying to move out ASAP now because my dad is depressed and was suicidal the other day, he gets angry and throws shit around, lies a lot, my mom doesn’t think he’s crazy, he claims he sees a doctor for help but I don’t foresee things getting better from here.

During this big blow up the other day, my mom mentioned he should have been in jail 3 times and I asked why and she wouldn’t tell me. I always assumed he probably cheated on her in the past when I was little but I don’t what this is about.

And I’m a full time grad student online, so I have to be home and work on school a lot. Hard to get that done in this environment.

I guess what I’m asking is should I go forward to find  out my dad’s history? And how do I break it to my parents that I can’t live with them anymore for my own sake? 

TLDR: Dad is possible rapist, should I move forward to finding out criminal background, also how do I break it to my parents I want to move out?",29May2019,1
711,"Hi everyone. I am absolutely gutted with my current life situation. I graduated college about a year ago and currently have 3 friends, 2 of which live far away and have different interests than me anyway. I am so isolated and lonely in my current city that I have no idea what to do. I used to have friends here but every time I tried to reach out to them they would ignore me or make up an excuse to the point where I just gave up. I dont go on vacations really and I miss out on a lot of local things as well just because I have no one to do them with. I do things alone sometimes but I still feel like it is extremely difficult to make friends with strangers. I am so miserably and unhappy as I feel like my life is passing me by. Even if I am only 23 I see my peers going on vacations to elaborate places, hanging out at restaurants, doing things that you can’t really do alone, etc. Most recently I have enough money to see the concert festival of my dreams as well as plane travel there yet I have no one to go with. My parents are uneasy about me going alone as I am a girl. I even asked my mom to go with me who said she couldn’t really physically handle it. I am so depressed and distraught over not being able to go to this and missing other things in my life that I have no idea what to do as my life just passes me by. Advice?",29May2019,1
712,"So to preface, I am in charge of a project in which I need to document all my fellow coworkers and their patrols (I am in security, and we work for a bank) so I randomly chose one time period he put down for a patrol to check out and I saw he was not at his desk. I was glad to see he did the patrol so I wanted to see how he did it vs how I do mine when I am at that location. Turns out he was missing for an hour and a half, and as I tracked him on the cameras he left to go downstairs into the break room for the rest of the staff. We are responsible for the bank and safety of the staff in the event of a robbery or an emergency. I know it's really shitty to nark and I don't want to be a shitty co-worker. However my boss and his boss are watching me closely as this project is a stepping stone to a promotion. So I am torn between marking down something outside of my scope vs letting be noted he was not doing his patrol and leave it at that.

713,"I keep screwing myself over and over again and it's driving me crazy. I'm irresponsible, I'm lazy, I'm a complete failure of a human being. I held off from choosing an advisor for my IB Extended Essay for a while. Then I arranged a meeting with her but didn't attend because I was depressed and feeling shitty about myself. It was AP exam season so I concentrated on that and I was also anxious about telling her that I missed it. So I postponed that as well. When I finally got around to telling her it's obvious that she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. It's been a week since then and I still haven't done anything because I feel ashamed of myself and because I assume everyone else has already started because everyone else actually cares about school. I will I cared. People say I'm smart. I want to be smart, I want to flutter my wings but I feel so suffocated by everything, especially by the possibility of looking bad. That's what my stupid fucking self cares about, looking bad.

I lie, I do anything. 

I feel like people will hate me. 

Maybe they already do? 

I feel so distant from my generation. I can't relate to anyone.

For some reason I seem to avoid help or advice until it's too late and shit is irreparable.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Why do I want to avoid responsibility? I've never tried a day in my life. I got 5's on AP Psychology and European History last year but was that trying? Any semblance of trying I can only do in small time frames when there's a clear goal in mind (like a test). My brain can't handle abstract things for some reason: well, things in the future. Planning. I can think about the meaning of meaning. The meaning of life, the topic of my endless vacuous meditations. Or maybe that's just a shadow on the cave. I haven't escaped the cave.

I want to meet with a potential adviser by tomorrow. I should have met with him or her three times by now. I haven't. He'll probably be disappointed. Nowhere else to turn. Why do I bother? I was never cut out to be one of them rich, smart Ivy League fucks no matter how much my peers seem to be dazzled by my illusory ""intelligence"". I'm not intelligent. I can use big words . What else do I have? Nothing. Teachers praised me when I was younger. They were only feeding into an incipient narcissism I need salvation from. 

I'm a bad person who avoids responsibility and the consequences of his actions. 

I'm the type of guy who can't think two hours beyond the present as his brain is transfixed on the computer screen (on which my entire life has been spent since the age of nine).

I escape into a fantasy land where everything is alright and hunky-dory instead of getting help.

I don't know what to do with myself. The more I attempt to break away, the more I am chained. The more I get the fleeting inspiration to turn things around, they more stay the same.

I'm almost a senior. I'm diving into oblivion. And the world's diving into oblivion. Why care about studying when climate change is going to kill most of us, if not all? Why care if most people acknowledge that we live in a hellworld but are powerless? Why does life have to be a competition when our resources are so abundant, yet a small percentage hold more than the vast majority of the world? I might be one of the lucky ones. Why can't I be happy then?

I just don't have motivation.",29May2019,0
714,"I have no idea what to even do with them anymore. 

My downstairs neighbors bang on my ceiling at least 4 times a day. Flush the toilet? Banging on the ceiling. Walk into my kitchen? More banging. Dropped my phone on the floor? More banging. 
I’m not nosy whatsoever, I’m a 100 pound female who lives alone, and mostly just slides on the floor trying to avoid being loud. No loud music, or even vacuuming since I have hardwood flooring. 

They’ve knocked on my door and I’ve answered once, the father of the family who lives under me. He yelled at my face saying I need to stop walking in my own apartment! 

I never once have I complained about their 2 year old son who screams in the breezeway of our apartment or on their patio. 

I said I was sorry, I was just walking but I’ll try to be quiet, but it is not my fault our apartment complex is 70 years old with low ceilings and thin flooring. 

That was a month ago. 

It has gotten so much worse, the father is constantly banging on my door 4 pm, 8pm, 11 pm and 2 am. Screaming for me to open the door. 

Last night my boyfriend came over, dropped a couple groceries on the floor at 10 pm. My neighbor started banging on the ceiling, my boyfriend, very fed up with them, stomped back.  The neighbor comes back up bangs on the door, nearly shaking the dining table and tv. 

He’s screaming for us to open the door, since we haven’t the first time I’ve answered, my mother who’s also answered the door one time, told me not to answer the door anymore because of how angry and scary the father was acting. So I haven’t. 

I tell my boyfriend not to answer it, and they’ll leave. We finish putting up the groceries, and once I start up the shower, the neighbor comes back banging on the door, screaming he’s calling the police. 

My boyfriend opens the door and sees the father run back into his apartment, watch my boyfriend from the bottom of the stairs, telling the dispatcher, “they are intentionally dropping things on the floor to make them angry.” My boyfriend tells him to leave us alone, we are just walking in my apartment, trying to get ready for bed. 

Closes the door, the neighbor comes back on, banging on the door saying the cops are coming. 

Fast forward to this morning, no cops arrived, and they’re back to banging on the ceiling for me walking to my fridge. 

What can I even do? I’m so tired of the constant shaking from the floor from them banging, them threatening and calling the cops for no reason. I’ve never had more than one person over in my apartment. I’m not loud whatsoever. 

My friend who’s an apartment manager says she has many tenants of her own that complain for the same reason, but all she can tell them is sorry, that’s just apartment life. 

TLDR: neighbors constantly bang on the ceiling for any reason, called the cops on me and my bf, tried being quieter, hasn’t changed at all. Don’t know what else to do.",29May2019,6

My family, friends and even myself have noticed that I've become depressed and frustrated about my job and have shown physical signs (hairfall, poor quality sleep, irritability, fits of anger, etc.).  I've been currently working at my (first) job for about 3 years and 5 months as of today. While I enjoy the job and the people I work with, there's just too many elephants in the room that cannot be ignored, like: 

\- According to our labor code, those that have finished a four year degree course should have a starting salary of salary grade 11 and I'm only getting Salary grade 8. In case you're wondering, I am living in the Philippines and work for a government office.

\- A lot of young people in the past have tried to raise this issue and in the very least, increase our allowances to match salary grade 11 but they higher ups said no. 

\-The new boss is a tightwad from hell. He nitpicks everything. He tallies those that come to work late and those that go home early despite the fact that there is a flexible working hours policy (which is also government mandated)

\-Work just becomes too much for me. Our office is currently understaffed and Im doing the work meant for 2 people to handle. It was tolerable before.

\-Promotion is out of the question. It's either I wait for someone to die, retire or quit their job before I get promoted.

There are more stuff that I haven't mentioned but these are some of the main reasons why I want to quit. I was planning to leave by the end my contract (last week of June) or extend it until mid-July. If there are anything you'd like to ask more about my situation, feel free.

[A lot of us have had job role changes at work, I’m one of them who’s role has changed. guy in my new department (will call him Tim) is meant to teach me how to work there but so far my new team leader has me snowed under with her work.

Got pulled into a meeting yesterday with a manager, myself, and Tim, regarding our department (of 5 people) dropping the ball with something and how we need to get it together. I said that’s fine but it was the first time hearing of it so they need to show me how to do their work too so I can stop feeling like such a spare part. Team have had a meeting without me saying I need to do more of their work. Very cloak and dagger.]

This morning the manager spoke very quietly from Tim asking if he’d done any training with me yet. I’d agreed to training today but have to wait for Tim to let me know when he’s ready due to the random times the workload comes in and I left my crystal ball at home. He sits a metre behind from me and says no, not yet. Manager says oh well, catch her on the next one so she can see from start to finish. Tim responds with “Sure thing, I’ll be able to crack the whip with her later.” Manager laughs and walks off. 

The guy has been in this department 7 months more than me and is a year younger. A black man who has recently come over from Zambia sits the other side of Tim and definitely within earshot. My dad is black but I take after my white mum and stay out the sun so you wouldn’t know looking at me at first. 
Am I thinking way too much into the fact that I feel he’s making me out to be some lazy fucker?

She was sitting on the bed typing on her old phone, however her current phone was right beside her. She kind of froze and then  promptly put the old phone in her draw when she saw me but otherwise acted normal. I thought it was weird but brushed it off. 

Fast forward to today, my charger is broken so I went to her room to borrow hers. This 2nd phone thing has been in the back of my mind since it happened, so (ashamed to say) I thought I’d just take a look at it to ease my mind. It was in the same draw, I pressed the home button not even expecting it to be on. However, it was on, near fully charged. It has a pin which her current phone does not and it had a bunch of notifications on the screen - all had their contents hidden, something she does not do on her current phone. They were all from Instagram as well, which makes it even stranger because she has always said that she’s not interested in Instagram because she thinks it’s a waste of time, stupid, and doesn’t understand the technology. It doesn’t have a SIM in it so must just be purely for internet use.

Not to paint her badly but I have a history of being lied to by mum, particularly with regards to her keeping close friendships up with my exes behind my back, long after we’ve split up (long as in years). Not sure if this could be of relevance here.

743,"I'm 20 years old and don't know what to do with myself.

I spend way too much time playing video games as it's become my only dependable way to escape my negative thoughts.

I have been incapable of getting myself out of bed for hours. I only recently have been able to get myself to work more.

I recently have lost a relationship, my shortest one. (4 months) I can't seem to let it go, I feel like I was emotionally neglected and the only one fighting to keep the relationship going.

I was lead on afterwards being told they'll always love me and miss everything, as well as being told I can always turn to them. But this was a self inflicted wound as I would continue to be there for them and seek their attention while either being ignored or having to wait until it was more convenient for her. I also work with her.

I have become more and more depressed. I tried an antidepressant that only made me feel like my suicide is inevitable. I've since stopped taking it and have been waiting for my first therapy appointment.

I stay up too late playing video games and I have been unsuccessful in holding any workout routine I've tried.

746,"Hi, several of my friends know my regular account so created an alt account just to post this.

Also, not sure if this is the right place to be posting, please let me know if I should be posting this somewhere else. Tldr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 rather alcoholic friends (23F and 21F). I (26M) have had several female friends who unfortunately had rather horrible experiences at parties after drinking waaaay too much alcohol. As a result I have become rather protective of any of my friends who drink too much at parties. (Basically I am the designated driver, or at the very least the guy who makes sure everyone gets home as safely as possible-i.e either walk people home or insure that they aren't left alone with anyone 'untrustworthy').

&amp;#x200B;

I have two friends (mentioned above) who I have lately realized are alcoholics, they repeatedly get wasted and then somehow always expect me to be there to take care of them. They both have recently joined me at my University (I'm almost finished masters, they are freshmen- my country starts higher education several years later then most Americans), and are rather extreme 'party girls' which (as you might expect) makes them quite popular among a certain type of guys.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, I am happy to be the kind of person who people can trust, but on the other hand, I cannot keep doing this. I have just spent the past 4 hours essentially fighting with two drunk girls about why they can't have ""just a few more shots"" or ""one more round of the dance floor"". It doesn't help that there are more then a dozen of the more predatory type of asshole who are happy to keep buying these attractive girls all sorts of drinks, and pander to their every spoiled need just to keep these girls happy enough to sleep with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever these girls are sober they express how happy they are that I look out for them, and before every night out they agree to listen to me when I say they might have had too much. Yet as soon as they start drinking (and getting to be the center of attention) they completely flip on me and it becomes ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I be doing here? On the one hand, they are completely free to live their lives and to make their own choices, on the other hand, how could I basically let my friends get date-raped and still live with myself afterwards). Before you assume I'm exaggerating there have been a few cases where suspicious drinks were handed to these clueless, sheltered girls. They also refuse to listen to me when I suggest they not go to some of these sketchier places. I have tried just not joining them, only to get drunk (or drugged) calls from these girls once they \*finally\* realize they've screwed up. I am not responsible for them (aside from my own morals) , and spending this time looking after them is starting to hurt my schoolwork (I am awake at 2 AM getting them home instead of sleeping) I know this sounds like some sort of abusive relationship, but I am at a loss as to what I should do. Sorry for the wall of text, thanks for reading this all the way thru.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Am friends with pretty, spoiled, and sheltered girls. No idea how to let them learn to deal with the consequences from their own actions (consequences are too much). Not helped by the amount of asshole ""nice guys"" who are happy to pander to these girls to get what they want",29May2019,8
750,"Hi everyone.

So I've been broken up with my SO for seven months now. We were long distance, and I did the breaking up because the long distance was becoming too difficult for my anxiety. We were together for almost two years. 

I was having an exceptionally difficult time with the breakup because I was incredibly attached to this person. It was my first love. A couple months after we broke up I basically begged them to get back together and was refused for whatever reasons they had for not wanting to be together. I do not blame this person, and whatever their reasons are I'm sure are valid and they are entitled to them.

It's just that since then, I've had an extremely difficult time getting over this person. I for sure am getting better every day and moving on, but it does seem that it's taking me an exceptionally long time to recover from this. I still think about them every day and still have that awful lingering feeling that something is missing. I also have not felt comfortable with the idea of starting any other relationship.

I would really like some advice on how I can make sure I am making progress to healthily move on from this person and improve my headspace surrounding it. I for sure was very unhealthily attached and know I need to work on that. 

If anyone has any advice for healing from a tough breakup I would really appreciate it. I can provide any detail as needed.  Thank you.",29May2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

This probably seems really stupid but I just started a graduate program yesterday and purchased an code for an online book from the campus bookstore. While there are no assignments due, there are pieces of pertinent information for tomorrow's first lab. The course is slated to move extremely quickly and I don't want to get left behind, so myself and many other students purchased access codes right after our first class today. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got home tonight and just tried to enter the code, but the message I received said that the code was ""already in use,"" and thus was unredeemable. I need to go back to the bookstore to solve the issue, but I won't be able to go until lab has already ended since we don't get a break after lecture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering e-mailing the professor about the issue with screenshots so I don't look unprepared during lab, but I also don't want to waste their time because they have no bearing over the codes; that's an issue with the bookstore. Should I e-mail the professor? Or should I just say something to them in person tomorrow?",29May2019,3
