0,"Directly out of school I took a job in a Midwest City which was amazing compared to where i grew up and went to school. I met a woman when I came to the area and have been dating for a 1.5 years making me think I should ask her to be my wife. Unfortunately 2 months ago I was laid off from my job and am struggling to find another in this area which may force me to relocate leaving my girlfriend in this area. 

If you had a great work opportunity 7 hours away in an area that isn't so great and risk losing your potential wife would you take it?

If you mattered enough to her would she follow you?",17Aug2019,1
1,"I‚Äôm sixteen and I‚Äôm an entertainer (music, acting, stand up, etc) Every time I have something to do in Manhattan pertaining towards my career.. my mom acts up the day before or the morning of. For an example, the day before she‚Äôll have a nasty attitude and bite my head off every time I say something. Like today we went out and before we left I told her I was ready but, was just throwing on a bandana.. she had an attitude and told me ‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt ready you shouldn‚Äôt have said so‚Äù. Then in Walmart she was upset with me because, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt helping her look for a t-shirt‚Äù I was, I just couldn‚Äôt find anything she‚Äôd like.

4,"(Hope this is the right place to post) This is from the point of view of my friend (f) and she really needs any advice you have to offer. 
Friend of mine can be a bit shy when you first meet her and a little bit anti-social, but once you get to know her she opens up a lot more and will become more friendly with you. The only problem about this is that people don‚Äôt seem to care what her personality is like because almost always the first thing they notice when they meet her is her cars. She does not own the cars, they are her parents cars, but they are very nice cars and she gets quite a bit of attention because of them. She is not one who enjoys the spot-light or the attention she gets, especially over something that she really has no say in. As soon as people see her getting out of one of the cars, she feels as though they instantly judge her based on that and they don‚Äôt take the time to get to know the ‚Äúreal her‚Äù, which is very frustrating to her seeing as when she first meets someone she comes off as anti-social or un-interested in them. Even when people do take the time to get to know her she still feels like they judge her because of these cars and she has no way to express or explain her feelings to anyone because she doesn‚Äôt want to seem like a b*tch complaining about how her nice cars make her life harder most of the time. Anyways, she feels at a loss of what to do and how to feel like she means something without the cars being a factor. Any advice on how to handle this or anything related would be much appreciated. Sorry about how long it is! 
(Ps): she lives in a place where it is quite common to have nice cars",17Aug2019,2

22,"So I just graduated undergrad in May with a degree in International relations and Diplomacy and another degree in Modern Languages. I was set to go to law school this fall, but throughout the summer I started to realize I probably wasn't doing it for the right reasons (prestige, money, impressing the people around me). Thus, I started to do more research (which I didn't do whilst applying and deciding very late in the application/LSAT season to go to law school). I found that the consensus is that unless you really feel in your gut that you want to be a lawyer, don't do it and commit to loans. I had a good deal but not a full ride. I had people believe in me and a good support system with me but I felt it wasn't the path for me. I withdrew before loans and tuition were actually owed (minus the 1,500 dollar down payment which isn't too big of a concern). Now, I feel relieved because I saved myself the money and time doing something I'd be miserable doing but I also feel lost. I am working as a mechanic (what I did part-time during college) and I do enjoy the job, but I know it isn't something I can rely on the rest of my life. I have two degrees and I want to start looking for jobs but I feel broken. I made a huge decision to make people proud of me then I backed out and probably disappointed all of them. Everyone has been supportive of my decision except some. I am considering grad school but I want to make a better informed decision doing it this time and not dedicating loan money on something my heart's not in. I am 22 but I feel my future is clouded. I guess I feel my bachelor degrees are useless but I know that it isn't totally true. Does anyone have any advice for me to find myself? Did I make the right decision? 

TL;DR: I backed out of law school, I feel relieved in one sense but lost in another.",17Aug2019,1

     i‚Äôve been drawing since i was little, and all i‚Äôve ever wanted to be was an artist. i‚Äôm very passionate about it and put a lot of feelings into them, if that makes sense. number 1 dream was becoming an artist. it still kind of is, but now i guess my sister has knocked me into reality ? she made me see that i won‚Äôt really make a career in art. basically, she told me that she doesn‚Äôt believe i can make a career out of this and when she thinks of someone drawing, she thinks of a child doodling for fun. she stepped on my dreams and kinda knocked me out of being hopeful for the future. i guess she knocked me into reality and made me realize that i can‚Äôt really make a career out of this. when she first told me this, i was really, really hurt and i still am. it affected me so much that i can‚Äôt draw around her or her husband anymore because it makes me nervous about what they‚Äôre thinking about it and if theyre judging me. i used to kind of flex aboht my art and tell people i was an artist and stuff, but now i don‚Äôt tell anyone anymore. i also can‚Äôt draw without seeing every flaw and getting frustrated trying to draw something when i can‚Äôt make it look how i want it to. i barely draw or paint anymore because she‚Äôs made me feel like i have no talent and like shit. i can‚Äôt draw without hearing them judge it in my head (like what they‚Äôd say about it and stuff) and i have limited options as to what i can draw because i draw whatever i want and whatever i feel and they don‚Äôt agree with most of them, as sometimes they‚Äôre gory and ‚Äòfreaky‚Äô i guess. i like that kinda stuff . sorry i kinda went off track there. 

     they‚Äôve made me realize that i can‚Äôt really make a career out of this. how is my art going to pay my bills? i‚Äôm a teenager now, but i mean for the future. i have to get a normal job and sell my art somehow. so, it kind of has to be a side job, which can be viewed as a hobby. i guess my sister has made me realize that i can‚Äôt do this full time and have a successful career in art. these are the thoughts in my head and i do not mean to discourage anyone else when i say that being a talented singer can pay someone‚Äôs bills and give them a good life, but what can drawing do? i have also seen artists in skin wars (a show about artists of different drawing styles learning how to use some air brushes, if that‚Äôs the correct word, to paint people‚Äôs bodies and compete against each other) say that they need the money that they win at the end to help them, and that it‚Äôs hard being an artist and selling their stuff. i can‚Äôt become the next picasso or van gogh and be very well known around the world and have my artwork appreciated. 

     i do have some support from some people in my family and my friends, but besides that nobody believes in me (especially my sister) or frowns upon it, or simply doesn‚Äôt care. i feel that she has discouraged me forever aboht my art and i can‚Äôt feel the same about my art as i did before she told me that.

My cousin, who is older and around my mom‚Äôs age, owns a roofing company with her husband. A few weeks ago, they redid my roof. 


My wife and I paid them fairly, in addition to them staying at our house and bringing along another cousin and his addict girlfriend who I eventually had to kick out. While they were here, they purchased some furniture and THEN asked to store it in our spare bedroom until they could come get it. 

I felt pressured and said yes, especially since they were in the midst of completing my roof and had already paid for the bed. I knew they would have to inevitably come get it, but I wasn‚Äôt anticipating such a short notice. 


I explained that my wife and I had plans, and that I was sorry, but we would be leaving town to go see our friends who live out of state. I offered to leave it outside with some tarps. 

My cousin said that she would just be there to get it when I get home from work.

35,"Hey everyone,

so I'm in a difficult situation with my family now and I don't know where to go from here.

To give you some context: I'm the only one in my family who has a university degree. Everyone in my family is happy for me to have a rather interesting job and living my own life. Well except my dad. He doesn't show any interest at all. Whenever I visit my parents he barely talks to me. I used to have no problems with that, as he didn't show much interest in my hobbies and interests for as long as I could think.

The problem that arose some time ago is that he starts to brag with my accomplishments. He keeps telling them what a cool job I have while never showing any interest or talking with me about my job. I really hate this behaviour, and told him about this. He reacted aggressively but the next time some of his friends showed he kept  going.

He was showing off my car while I wasn't there and the next time urged me to take one of his friends to a ride in my car or giving a friend a tour through my workplace although he never showed any interest and when invited didn't want to see it. When I declined, he was getting pissed at me.

At that point I wanted to cut him out and didn't tell or showed him pictures of what I'm doing. When he found out I blocked him from my last vacation, he is now actively behaving hostile towards me. I honestly don't know why he's mad, as he never said something about it or asked anything when I was kept him updated. 

He now keeps telling my mom I'm not talking to him anymore because he's never been to a university and I'm thinking he's to primitive to talk to. While the real reason for this is that he never asks me anything and if I tell something he shows no interest. Being told I'm stuck-up really hurts me.

I tried several times to build up conversations but it seems like he doesn't want to deal with me anymore. I don't really know where to go from here. I kinda wanna cut all ropes and don't visit my parents anymore as all of this drags me down, but I'm in good terms with my mom and that would really hurt her. On the other side I don't feel welcome at my parents anymore so I'd rather don't want to go there anymore.

40,"Before any of this happened I had finally restored my bad credit history, had a healthy credit card, Kohl's card, new phone service and a few thousand in savings. That might not seem like much to most people, but it took me years to dig myself out from the hole I dug for myself and I was finally seeing stability. 

To make a long story short I got put on medical leave the 19th of January this year. I ended up in the ER 6 times and ended up with bills totaling over $12,000 that have since been sold to collections. I had to max out my credit card and empty my savings just to survive the first few months. My pay was essentially cut in half and it was like pulling teeth to keep the insurance company and my doctor in communication. 

Towards the end I had to rely on my girlfriend more. She had to help out with bills and groceries while I fought through these health issues. 

The last few months things gradually got worse. I lost my pay, my girlfriend was taking in less because she'd become ill and we were late on rent and our electricity almost got shut off twice. 

At some point she'd become completely emotionally detached and I found out she'd been hiding the fact that she's basically been cheating on me with her ex from her home state. Devastated, I pack my shit and start moving things over to my mom's old house where my brother rents. 

In the middle of it I talked to friends and family and decided the best thing to do would be to stay, try and work through things and at least make it a logical break so that I don't lose the house - essentially everything I've worked for these past 4 years. 

That didn't work. We got into a huge, nasty fight that night. I drank way too much and I was an asshole, she was constantly picking fights all night and our relationship essentially died that night. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I can't stand being stuck in the same house as her while she's fucking around with her ex and I'm absolutely miserable so I tell her she needs to be out by the end of the month. That devolves into more fights and she ends up leaving a few days later. I packed all of her things, I laid everything outside for her and made it as easy as I could while she did basically nothing. 

That same week my truck threw a rod through the oil pan and I was left without transportation, without a job, without income and without the love of my life. Shit sucked. 

Onto now: She left me with about $1000 in bills that I had to spend every penny I had to cover. $500 in data charges on our phone bill, rent and electricity. By the time I had that paid it's already into the new month and I have all of the same bills again and have to borrow over $1000 to cover them and to be able to eat. 

Right now I'm trying desperately to get my doctor to backdate my return to work paperwork so that I can get into work this coming week. I'm pretty stable now. I quit drinking, cut out all of my crutches and have been doing everything I can to get my life back in order. 

I have $0 in my name. Bills are paid, have enough food to last maybe a week, but I already have an electricity bill for the 29th for $200 and rent is due on the 31st. 

My landlady has been working with me on this and has been extremely understanding. She's a family friend and has been insanely helpful, but I'm not going to drag her along if I can't afford to stay here. 

Oh, and my primary checking account is $600 in the negative. I had to work with the bank to have the account put on hold, the card shut off and I had to use my secondary account so that any money I brought into didn't disappear in the debt void. 

I can start packing now and prepare for the worst and lose everything I've worked for the past 4 years, or I can stay and try desperately to get back into work. I can afford to live here on my own, I've already gone over my finances and budgeted everything, but with all the debts lingering over my head I will be playing catchup forever. 

I'm heartbroken, I'm so fucking depressed and I feel like my life is being held together by fine threads right now and it's all slowly slipping away. I'm trying so hard to keep my shit together, but this is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through and I don't know what the fuck to do. 

I'm basically just venting at this point. I don't know what I'm looking for, I don't know what the best course of action is but all I know is I don't want to lose everything. 

**TL;DR: Health deteriorated, got put on medical leave, 6 months of hell, girlfriend cheated and left, left me with a ton of debt, paid it all off and now broke. Had to borrow over $1000 to pay for this month and I don't know if I can get back into work; I'm still working through that but have gotten nowhere.** 

**It's already mid-August and unless I can get back into work this coming week I'm fucked. I have the option of moving back into my mom's old house where my brother is renting, but that would be giving up everything I've worked for the past 4 years and I would have to completely start over AGAIN after struggling for 5 years to get afloat. What the fuck do I do?**

If you were even able to make it this far you're a fuckin' champ and thanks for at least listening.",17Aug2019,2
42,"Okay let me start out by say hi I hope your okay if not please feel free to message me and I‚Äôll help if I can. 

So my issue starts here I don‚Äôt quite understand my own emotions before you judge let me elaborate. I was brought up with a drug addicted mother, my dad was in rehab for drugs so I live with my mum and step dad let not get to deep into the stepdad situation but think he‚Äôs the reason I have so many emotional problems. 

He was abusive both physically and mentally the physical part I got used to as my pain tolerance rose, etc I‚Äôve grown past the and I‚Äôve gained confidence and control over all my anger from said physical abuse. The only part I haven‚Äôt got over is this, When I was younger and lived with my mum and step dad if I showed I was sad (eg crying) I was punished by my mum or step dad so I‚Äôve grown up not showing being sad, so basically I‚Äôve been a upbeat guy which I love about myself I‚Äôll do almost anything to make someone else happy.  

I spent so many years acting like I don‚Äôt get and can‚Äôt be sad but recently I moved in with my dad, and he works a lot but I‚Äôm s paint ball marshal so I have a lot of free time and my friends work so I‚Äôm often left alone, So as you can imagine I spend a lot of time thinking and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I actually felt sad, and about 4 hours ago I was sitting listing to music and even tho I felt good I just felt this overwhelming sadness I felt like I was about the have a mental breakdown. 

And I got mad at myself. I punished myself when I had done nothing but feel an emotion that‚Äôs normal. 

I would really appreciate some advice about how I should go about trying to make it so I don‚Äôt feel disgusted about myself for feeling sad.",17Aug2019,1

45,"I work in IT in education and was recently assigned another building in addition to my home building. My new principal is African-American. I was telling a coworker at my home building just how bad-ass this principal is. They had a student in their office giving them the business, which is sorely lacking in my home building. My coworker's response was, ""Well, she's a sassy black woman."" Even though this coworker feels the same in our building about discipline.   


Later, I was standing outside at car rider duty waiting to get to my car. The same coworker came to me and said an African-American parent was parking on the side of the building and then walking up to get her child, avoiding the line. ""Yeah, and they say I have white privilege, but she does whatever she wants because she's black.""   


I am so good about calling this shit out, but I just stood there like an asshole and said nothing.  I don't know what the hell to do. This person works as an advocate for all of our students. They constantly post on social media how much they hate their job, and wants to move to their home state. I feel if I go to my home principal, nothing will happen. If it does happen, everyone will absolutely hate me because they are loved by the staff. I don't know my new principal that well, and don't want to say, ""As a POC, can I get your help on this?"" and bring drama to a new building.

48,"So I told my best friend that I had feelings for him couple months ago. But he told me he used to have them for me but I was dating and sleeping with others. 

Then for a week he poked fun at me and was being a jerk 

Till 3 days after that he called me and said he wanted to talk. He said that he is in love with me and doesn‚Äôt know what to do cause our friendship means everything to him. He told me he loved me and wanted to see if the stars align. He also asked if I deal with any exes or past guys.

Well after that he found out that I was texting an ex fwb of mine. And I was sexting like 2 weeks prior. 

Now he is absolutely upset. 

He also bought up how I once slept with this fwb after my last guy and I had this huge fight about where we were in the relationship",17Aug2019,2
49,"I want an 8% pay raise but I feel like I‚Äôm being unreasonable. Am I? Here‚Äôs the story. I hope this makes sense. My brain is mush as it‚Äôs been a long week. Please ask questions to get the full picture...

TLDR: I work for my FIL, do a lot for the business, he‚Äôs helped us big time financially and I want an 8% raise after taking a pay cut because he didn‚Äôt want to pay taxes for putting me on payroll. I want that money back and a little more. Am I thinking rationally and am I out of line for wanting this?


I‚Äôve been with my FIL for what will be 4 years on 2/1/20.  He pays me well. I make $70,356 gross per year. He‚Äôs helped us financially through the years in ways I could never repay him back for. Examples would be paying off some credit card debt I had so we could buy a house and then giving us money for the down payment to buy the house. Never asked for a penny back, he just did it because he wanted to take care of his daughter.

When I first started working for him, he paid me cash money and then beginning of year 2, he put me on the payroll. However, when this happened he didn‚Äôt like that he was gonna have to pay me more to keep my take home pay the same because of taxes, so he wanted me to accept what was ‚Äúfair‚Äù, I settled for $80 less per week out of my net pay, because I wanted to be fair to my FIL, even if it meant taking a pay cut. This is over $4,000/yr. At the time we were renting a house and had our first son who was 2. We felt it financially but we got by... 

Fast forward another 2 years later...I‚Äôm still making the same every week on salary. We have our second child and want to buy a house, he helps us to get rid of all my credit card debt so a new house would be more affordable for us....around $7,000 if I‚Äôm remembering correctly. Fast forward a couple months, we find a house, he gives us the down payment/closing costs of around $10,000. Never asked for a penny back throughout all of this.

Fast forward to now, a family of 4, we barely get by month to month. My wife has not worked and we don‚Äôt have any plans for her to work as she stays home with the kids. My FIL and MIL live a life of luxury, they buy whatever they want when they want. They spend thousands of dollars for their oldest grandson to play travel ball every year, and spend an insane amount of money on incredibly unnecessary things. We‚Äôre obviously a little envious at times but it‚Äôs just the way it is...and we accept it. 

I have many responsibilities and wear many hats. I manage inventory min/max levels at our warehouse, am the buyer, receive the inventory, make the deliveries, am customer service, send invoices and am his IT guy. When my FIL retires I will be the one to take over the business and call the shots. It‚Äôs just me and him that run the business. I have no ownership in it. I‚Äôm just a w2 employee. We do over a million dollars in business year to year (1.6M in 17 and 18...on pace for 1M this year) so I know there‚Äôs plenty of money to go around. He‚Äôs never just come out and offered to pay me more money (because why would he?)....I made $80,000/yr at my previous job and he had been trying to recruit me to come work for him for years, even offering to pay me the same $80,000/yr. I end up getting laid off 3 months after our first son was born so I made the easy decision to come work for him. Next thing you know, $80k suddenly turned into $70k. I accept.

About 4 months ago they moved half way across the world to get treatment for their mother who had a tumor somewhere in her spine or something, they ended it up taking that one out only for servers more to appear throughout her body. The cancer is terminal, and her body can‚Äôt handle treatment.

This week it hit all of us hard that maybe her time has come to an end, all of the brothers are in different emotional states, one in denial, one in acceptance but I can clearly see he is terrified, and one acts as if he has accepted everything although I know deep down he hasn‚Äôt faced his emotions yet and hasn‚Äôt really accepted it.

Skip to current day, she signed a freaking DNR, and was moved to a pain treatment center where they help her with pain (obviously). All the brothers understand what this means. They also have an older sister who I believe is the most one in control of her emotions. Oddly enough I worry most about their father, who is like a father figure to me. He is under so much stress at the moment I don‚Äôt know if he can handle her death.

Currently, the only thing I‚Äôm doing (being 7hours ahead of their time zone) is sending them texts individually saying how they can talk to me any time, and how I‚Äôm always here for them. Aside from just hearing them out and giving my own crappy insight every now and then, how can I help their them? I can‚Äôt bear lose them all and have them all go into depression or turn to drugs or anything like that. I want to help them manage their emotions and be happier.

54,"My friend and I have become fairly close since two years ago, and I like her a bunch. While I'm pretty sure she isn't ready for a relationship, and I certainly am not, I still cherish our friendship greatly. I plan to make my move next year, but one step at a time. Due to new scheduling neither of us share a class, so I can only say ""Hey"" in the hallways. The way our school works is we have three separate parking lots; one for teachers, one for students, and one for the school buses. Each bus has a designated line the students wait in, but are free to roam the lines if they wish. We used to do most of our talking there, but this year I have to leave school especially early, so I can't talk to her there. For the past 3 weeks since school has started (our school ends way late in April, and starts way late in June) I have been messaging her everyday through Snapchat and/or text. Now everyday is an exaggeration, but you get the picture. Please don't get the wrong idea about me. I am 100% aware of a person's right to personal time and space, hence why I am making this post. I know how incredibly annoying I'm being, and if to her understanding I'm not being obnoxious yet I certainly will start to become obnoxious soon. The thing is though, I don't know what I should do. I'm definitely going to stop messaging her everyday. I really only did that because I was paranoid but now I really see what I'm doing. Should I try and message her once a week? Every two days? I want to invite her to some group events with my friends, but she doesn't know any of them! And she's pretty social awkward. So should I even do that? I really just need answers that would help my situation. I really don't want us to drift apart, because if that happens I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. I really do like her, and as I said before I was us to remain and grow as friends. I don't know what to do.",17Aug2019,1

This is a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt know if anyone apart of this story is on reddit, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be safe.

A few months ago, my husband flew out to visit my father in law, who was having surgery. The surgery was successful, my FIL did rehab and went back home a few weeks later. My FIL lives about 5 miles away from BIL1 (brother in law 1) and his family. He is always either at their house or they are over at FIL‚Äôs house (my MIL passed away years ago, so he lives alone).

Anyways, a few days ago my husband got a call from BIL2 (brother-in-law 2, lives in different state) saying that BIL1 was being controlling over FIL‚Äôs living conditions. BIL2 said that BIL1 was taking my FIL‚Äôs phone away saying its ‚Äúbetter for him not to have it‚Äù. BIL1 hasn‚Äôt gave a clear reason for taking it. This is very concerning to me, husband and BIL2 as FIL needs to be able to contact both 911 or the family. BIL2 and my husband sent a text in a group chat saying that BIL1 needs to give him the phone back and that its not his to control. So far, we have not been able to contact FIL. BIL1 has not gave the phone back.

As of this morning, we got a text from BIL1 saying we‚Äôre accusing him of elder abuse, despite the fact we weren‚Äôt. BIL2 hasn‚Äôt sent BIL1 any messages that would draw this conclusion. BIL1 claims he hired a lawyer

Should BIL2 and/or my husband hire a lawyer?

61,"[Throwaway account, tldr at the bottom] 

I do occasional banners and art for my friends and friends of friends. I only make them for people I know and I have never publically advertised that I am open for commissions. Person A, a stranger who wanted a commission, uses a close friend's (Person B) name in order to get me to agree to do a commission. Me, being gullible, accepts immediately and later on tells Person B about my new projet. Apparently, Person A and B have had conflicts in the past and Person B is furious that Person A used their name in order to get me to make then a commission. I politely decline Person A after due to me not wanting to have more work than necessary. Meanwhile, Person B proceeds to yell at Person A in an attempt to teach them a lesson. I'm not sure what Person A said, but they admitted they were scaring Person B quite a bit. I later on reccieve an apology from Person A, stating they are sorry for causing problems.

I feel guilty for having Person A deal with someone yelling at them when all of this could have been avoided if I just asked Person B in the first place. Person B tells me that Person A is known for taking advantage of others for their personal gain, but that could come from bias. I'm not sure what to do, if I should respond to Person A, or if I should just ignore the reply. Am I being overly sensitive/overthinking or does feeling guilt make sense. Any help is appreciated!

tldr: stranger uses a close friends name in order to get me to agree to a commission. After friend finds out, friend yells at the stranger, who happens to have past conflicts with my friend. Stranger apologized and I'm left feeling guilty because it could have been prevented. What do I do now?",17Aug2019,1

I used to have my own house, a nice paid off vehicle, a decent bank account....And it's all gone now. He has made me completely reliant on him. I've been reduced to a child. I to damn near beg for just chapstick and deodorant, while he is out partying and golfing everyday. He pawned half my diamond jewelry and hid the rest somewhere spite me. 

I have nothing to sell at this point, I've sold my nice clothes and parfumes, nothing to make myself presentable (No makeup left and my clothing that I kept is pretty much rags now). Nothing.

He informed me today, that last month, the landlord let him know we need to be gone so they can move someone else in and up the rent.

My dogs and I are screwed. I have zero friends and zero family to turn to. He is the only person I know. I don't know what to do.

I'm desperate and the only option I seem to have right now is to start selling myself. I am absolutely horrified at the idea of it, but I cannot lose my dogs and I cant have them homeless with me either. If I lose them, I'm just going to give up.

I even knew it while it was going on, tried to commit suicide once, the whole shabam! I think I've been through a bit of everything, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, bullying. The list really goes on more than that. I feel like I've just never had a break from terrible things happening to me or around me or committed by me. (I've definitely done a few truly terrible things). I can cold call list all the events that I would suppose are traumatic in nature. Really nothing about my childhood is happy aside from most of the friendships I made at school.

I'm not trying to hide anything from my SO. I know that while it may be okay to have his support, I shouldn't put him in the position to become my therapist. I don't know if I should pursue therapy again because all of the trauma is ""old"" if that makes sense. I don't know how to approach it or even bring it up in therapy because, although I have my moments, I don't feel particularly affected in my day-to-day life. But it does happen a few times where I wish I could just tell someone my story. A lot of the pain is that there were a lot of instances where people wouldn't believe me. Sometimes I feel like I want him to know (and I know he believes me too which is also what makes it easier to think of telling him), but I'm worried how that would turn out. I feel like I've given him an earful already without even trying. He's said before that he is okay with listening, and will never cut me off, but I don't wanna give him any undue stress. I'm not sure what advice to ask for or what advice I hope to get, but I feel in need of some sort of guidance towards this. If the past ever comes up in conversation, I really have nothing happy to relate to him aside from my childhood friendships, like I said earlier. And I get surprised when he just talks about his life. His family has their own problems like anyone else, but they raised him and his sister well. It's really different from how I grew up.",17Aug2019,1
81,"So me and my gf have been together for 10 years and I still can't decide what to do about rings. Neither of us is into diamonds or jewelry, to be honest, but I think the right ring might be an exception... I hope.

she wears a lot of black and dark color clothing so I was considering a ring made of wood and carbon fiber kind of rings. we both really like watching Patrick Adair Designs so it's why carbon fiber and wood are the materials I want.

I ask most of my friends and they think it's cheap and not worth getting a ring like that for the purpose. So I'm torn between going the traditional route so friends and family won't bash on it or go for something that will have more meaning between us.

I have a rough idea what type of box to use maybe a fake dinosaur skull, she's really into her dinosaurs too.

83,"My S.O. and I currently reside in the Seattle area. We love it here, but have been trying to get out of the area for a while (housing is so expensive compared to most of the country and the job market is very competitive). We have been seriously considering moving to the Twin Cities and have been researching extensively. My partner made a contact at a direct hire recruiting firm (Grant-Shannon, if anyone has worked with them). She was very enthusiastic about helping my partner and said that he was a great candidate but since we are so far away it makes things difficult. She reiterated some things we came across in our research about the unemployment rate being very low. Her firm is having difficulty filling jobs. She said specifically to give her a call a week before he/we headed out there, she would start setting up interviews, etc. 

So our question is, is it a good idea to just go? We both in our late-ish 20s, childless, and renters. Our savings are at the point where we could go awhile without being out of money. We agreed that if we don't have jobs within a couple months (at most) we would come back home. We both are fairly educated to where we aren't worried about being under qualified for most entry level office jobs. I have a decent enough job but it is not good enough that I'm having reservations about leaving if we decide to do this. In my opinion, if we are going to just pick up and move anywhere, we are in the best position to do it now. Has anyone done something like this before? Is it a reasonable idea?",17Aug2019,1
84,"so for extra context, we live in the bay area, which is very expensive, but he stays at a house his father owns for less than average. it was also a fairly cheap couch, only $900, but we split the cost and I think I deserve at least part of it back.

almost all other items of furniture in this house are leftover / collected from our families.

93,"I've(M22) been dating my girlfriend(F22) for 4 years.  She constantly mistreats me whether its her being jealous, or just trying to get a rise out of me.  When we fight and even when i get really mad I keep my cool, I don't yell, I dont call names, and I dont under any circumstances ignore her (I believe communication is extremely important because how else can the problem be solved).  And for some reason that seems to make her even more mad. She WANTS me to be mad, she WANTS to see some sort of crazy reaction from me so i know she purposely escalates (even to hitting me/pouring drinks all over me. Keep in mind this doesnt happen often but it does happen) to points of no return when we fight just to try to get that reaction from me.  

I know she loves me, but im not sure if I love her. We have a (unplanned) daughter together that has kind of brought us together recently but i know that will only last so long. I keep telling myself i love my girlfriend but right after that i can't help but think ""do i really love her though, do i even know what love feels like?"".

I genuinely don't understand why I can't let go of this one toxic friend. I have other friends so it's not like I'm desperate for friendship. I'm also comfortable being alone so that's not something that worries me. But I still can't manage to leave her. 

She's treated me like crap quite a few times. She blatantly disregards my feelings, thoughts, and emotions. She has no problems taking advantage of me (food, rides, showing up un-announced) but why do I keep giving into her demands? I know it's wrong, I know I shouldn't be doing this, but I can't say no. Even when she deliberately annoys me and I sometimes snap, I'm the one who ends up apologizing. Why do I do this?

99,"Currently pursuing my accounting degree online via USF. Living with family in the middle of nowhere. 4 semesters left. Decided to live with family in nowhere land to save money and avoid more debt. Basically living out here saves me 20-25k in student loans. I also get to save up money. There are zero distractions. 

However.... l feel like I'm ruining my life out here. I'm about to be working 40 hours a week and studying around 40-50 hours a week. If I move back and live at USF I can switch to Finance which I'd prefer. I'd also have friends that have known me since I was a kid. I'd have a real support system. My escape would be 15 minutes away. Here, there is no escape. 

I ask myself if the money saved is worth it in the long run. 

By moving to Tampa I'd net 25k in student debt. I'd have access to the career center, networking, local businesses (extremely few here, none finance or accounting related)... I'd have access to my friends instead of driving 4 hours to see them. I'd have access to a library where I can study in peace. I'd have access to new people. There are barely any women my age where I live let alone friends to be made. 

So, I can move to Tampa and do Finance and come out of school with barely any cash and about 25k more in debt or I can stay in nowhere land, get my degree in Accounting, and have about 20-30k cash saved. 

What to do? I want to be happy but I heard there might be a recession around when I graduate or later (Fall 2020) so Finance might be a stupid option.  Then again the internet makes me feel like every business major is worthless. Help. Really depressed and just want to be happy and have a secure home of my own.

104,"I used to be very social. I still am social and get along with plenty of people. But in terms of friend friends, I have just about one good friend that I‚Äôm distancing from.

Back in high school and college I had large groups of close friends. The kind of friends that you can really trust and have your back. But when I graduated from college and started getting my own business rolling, I slowly stopped hanging out with many of my friends. Not because I didn‚Äôt have time or anything. I still dated and continue to. I also have no problem meeting new people.

But my longest running group of friends are all stoners. All they do is smoke. So I stopped hanging out with them.

My longest running friend went through some weird changes and started talking trash about me behind my back, so I just stopped hanging out with him. I never had any beef with him, but he became weirdly obsessed with me afterwards and would try to dig up personal information about me from my other friends (even messaging my cousin multiple times asking about me). I never ghosted him or anything, just stopped hitting him up to hang out. And I was always (and still am) nice to him. But he was the only person I‚Äôve ever had any kind of ‚Äúdrama‚Äù with.

My other group of friends includes my best friend. But that group doesn‚Äôt really do anything. All they started to do was go downtown and drink. I don‚Äôt smoke or drink so it wasn‚Äôt for me. And aside from that, they‚Äôre just people with issues. Lives filled with drama. And just overall very irresponsible.

My best friend will always be my main man, but he‚Äôs the main one that likes going to the clubs. I am just not into that scene. He doesn‚Äôt really work for anything and just kinda bums around just like we did in high school. He just never grew out of that.

I just don‚Äôt feel like I vibe with anyone. I work my ass off to make something happen, but the scene I most associate with is the hipster-ish music scene. I‚Äôm in a band and I‚Äôm pretty close to those guys, but they all like going to bars. I work hard, but I‚Äôm also a night owl that likes to go driving around and exploring late at night, so the people that I tend to click with in terms of work ethics are much more uptight than I am.

I did date a girl that I vibed with and had amazing chemistry with, but she was into pageants. She won miss (state) one year even and had that stereotypical pageant insecurity. Her family was incredibly toxic as well (just one of many examples: her mother and brother Facebook stalked my ex, just because we dated at one point, and just criticized her in a pretty mean way)

So I try to distance myself from (or cut out) people who have an overall negative impact on my life and goals, but I‚Äôm left feeling incredibly alone.

106,"A bit of backstory first: My friend (19m) and his girlfriend (19f) have been dating for two and a half years. They got together in high school and have been going to college on opposite coasts of the US. They have been long distance for one year. 

Recently, some of the stories he's been telling me about his relationship has seriously concerned me and thrown up what I think are some red flags. 

Here are just a few of the things he's told us about his relationship that make me uneasy.

1. She goes through his phone and reads his Snapchat and text messages. In one notable instance, she accused him of flirting with a girl even though he honestly admitted to not knowing how to flirt anymore.

1. Along the same lines, she has to pre-approve his female friends. She doesn't like it when he interacts with girls she doesn't know and trust.
 
1. She doesn't let him go to parties because she is afraid he will get drunk and hook up with another girl. Just to add, my friend has never been drunk in his life and has no intention to get drunk.

1.  Six months ago, they broke up for a week. She promptly hooked up with another guy and then texted my friend that ""it wasn't the same"" and that she wanted him back. 

1. She's accused him of masturbating too frequently. My friend is not addicted to jacking off. 

1. During our senior class graduation party, my friend took a hit of some kid's dab pen. She was furious at him for doing so even though she had had eight or so drinks by that point. A year and a half later, she bought a dab pen for herself. 

1. In our conversation about fighting, he said he was lucky to get a day when they are not fighting about something. He told us his fights usually go like this: he makes a minor mistake and she will berate him over text or over the phone. He defends himself for about twenty minutes and then gives up and accepts all responsibility. 

1. My friend has also noted that lately, she has began cursing at him during the fights even though she did not in the past. 

1. During a week-long visit to my house with some of our other (guy) friends, he texted her saying that he was at the beach and his phone was broken so he would not have to talk to her very much.


He said he feels his relationship has been falling apart for the past year and I would like him to take matters into his own hands rather than waiting to be heartbroken by her - the pain would definitely be much worse that way.

His counterargument to all of this is that when they are together they are okay and happy. This happens for at most 2 weeks out of 52 in the year.

I really have my friend's best interests at heart here and wouldn't be making this post if I wasn't seriously concerned for his long-term happiness.

I would really appreciate some advice here, guys. How do I communicate to my friend that he is in an unhealthy relationship and that he would be better off without her? If that *is* the case of course--please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

I‚Äôm very new to all of that, so maybe he was just bored, as he isn‚Äôt a virgin. How can someone just move on so quickly like that? My brother did warn me that he is like that, and he seems unwilling to commit after having his heart broken in high school. Did I do something wrong? I just need some general advice",17Aug2019,1

I have hair down to my hips and I love having it loose. However, during raves it always gets super matted &amp; messed up and I end up looking like an Eldritch version of Cousin Itt from the Addams family.

How do I avoid that without braiding it or putting it up on a super tight pony tail?

114,"

I met Steven sophomore year of math class. I don't know how we have to start talking, but we would talk casually as friends. I'm not attracted to this guy. He also doesn't take the best care hygiene wise and is overweight.

. He dislikes most black people and stereotypes them as ghetto. He also said racist stuff against immigrants. Also anti LGBTQ. I don't hold these views.My senior year, he hinted about asking me to prom multiple time in our history class. I told him I'm not going (which was true), but he should ask this other nice girl. Decline because I was interested in a guy who had graduated and we had talked since I was 15 names, Tim. We have different views on a lot of things one time he said it's okay to beat your dog when they misbehavior.

I talked to him about some of my issues because I thought we were just friends. I always made it clear I would never date him but encouraged him to ask out other girls or try dating apps. He always acted like he was stubbornly in love with me like we were the perfect match. We graduated four years ago; I live i a different state.

I open up to my guy issues with him. It's only usually Tim because besides one other guy when I was 18, he's the only guy I've seen on and off. He was and still is terrible to me. Used me for sex, used me to cheat (I didn't know about the girlfriend ).

I cried to Steven a lot about it which his response is ‚Äùwell of course when you go after douche bag pretty boys you get treated that way‚Äù he's also tried to say why won't I date a kind guy like him because he listens to all my problems and we joke. I've wanted to say we're not compatible, and I will never feel that type of way.

He‚Äôll also say things to me about starting a family, and that will make me truly happy. I NEVER want to be a housewife I don't want kids besides maybe fostering kids I just had issues growing up as a kid and teen. I don't feel I could ever be a parent, even working on these issues. It hurts when he says that to me because sometimes think about having a kid but know I could never be fit and cry.

One day He was going at me again about how we are a perfect match, and we make each other so happy. I told him back no, that's not what I want. He kept asking why I said we're not compatible. He kept pushing why and the reason. I just flat out said I don't find him physically attractive. He again asked why I said ‚ÄùI don't know what I find beautiful‚Äù I don't want to point out flaws to people.

He kept pushing for how and why I don't find him physically attractive. He started calling me a coward because I wouldn't answer his question. I just said weight and facial features like the nose. He left me on reading. He texted me two months later I told him to stop contacting me he asked why I said I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him anymore and I said I‚Äôm blocking him and stop contacting me 


He said, ‚Äúhit me up when you‚Äôre sane again.‚Äù

I blocked him, am I the asshole?

116,I've only ever kissed 2 guys in my life. I am 21 years old. The thing is I feel nervous around guys and in my two kissing experiences I didn't feel anything. I did care for both guys but I didn't feel anything. I mean like sexually. Ans sometimes when i see girls I fantasize about them. I fantasize about guys too but also about girls. I haven't really had any feelings for one but when I see them I fantasize about kissing them. Does that mean that I like girls or guys?,17Aug2019,0
117,I live in Chicago and we got a new apartment.

118,"This post is gonna be a long one. 

So I recently went through a breakup around two and a half months ago. The thought of being intimate with anyone else physically made me sick for around two months after. But once it slowly went away, I had to reevaluate what I was looking for if I wanted sexual intimacy. 

I met a girl a week ago and we really hit it off. We were very similar and while she had what she called a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù she made it clear that she and he were exploring their sexual preferences. 

So I‚Äôm in her dorm two days after meeting her and she starts asking me all these personal questions about sex. I‚Äôm totally fine with it, as I had mentioned being in a breakup and physical intimacy before. 

But this time the questions were super specific. Like if I had any fetishes, if I was non monogamous, etc. One question went like this; 
Girl: ‚ÄúSo do you have a foot fetish? I know a lot of people do‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúActually yeah‚Äù
Girl: ‚ÄúAre you into small or big feet?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù 
Girl: ‚ÄúLike mine?‚Äù *holds up feet* 
Me: ‚Äúyeah about that size‚Äù

eventually ask her the same questions back. We shared a lot of similar sexual interests and we both said that we were open to hook up with people. I asked her if she was interested in a friends with benefits situation with anyone and she said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. I then said I was too and then I asked her if she would be interested in something like that between us. She said yes. 

We left it at that only watched some vines and laughed together (she was starting to get sick) and I went home. 

The next day, her partner texts me and says that she was actually super uncomfortable and asked me not to make any more moves. 

I was confused. 

1. She brought up the sexual interrogation on to ME.
2. No awkwardness insued after I asked. She said yes, and then we watched vines
3. She didn‚Äôt bring it up with me herself. 

I say that I will respect their relationship and back off. I‚Äôm not really gonna get involved with this drama. 

Well turns out I was already too deep. I followed up with her a few days later by asking to clarify if she was at all uncomfortable with the situation between us. 

She said ‚ÄúAbout thaaat. Well, someone you worked with said you asked her the same thing. And then another person said ‚ÄúSame‚Äù... so I‚Äôm not really interested‚Äù

My heart stopped when I read this. 

Let me make something clear. This girl is the FIRST PERSON I have ever even insinuated being FWB with. I‚Äôve never asked anyone else. Hell, I was a virgin before my most recent ex. 

Note: this means that she was openly talking about a private conversation we both had. Which is really not cool. Everything was consensual and it‚Äôs not cool to talk about that stuff with other people. (Not to mention she started the fucking convo)

So based on that statement this means one of three things: 
1. Two people who know me (one at my work) are spreading rumors about me 
2. She is lying but probably will never admit it
3. Two people I know may have misinterpreted something I said to think I was sexually propositioning them

But one thing I know for sure. I have never once intentionally asked or insinuated someone sleep with me who I am not in an exclusive romantic relationship with.

So what the hell do I do? Talk to my manager at work and explain things? Talk to this girl more to figure things out? Forget about it? 

Something to note: I work in the entertainment industry and with the Me Too movement, I take any sort of rumors against me very seriously.",17Aug2019,2

123,"So just for starters. I‚Äôm using my cousin‚Äôs account. So her previous posts are something else unrelated. 

I come from a small town in NM. When I was 18 I dated this girl. She was 5 years older than me. And had the bad girl type to her. She had exes who were still wanting her and she didn‚Äôt help by telling them off. It was a mess of a relation. Which sucked cause we were amazing friends but horrible partners.  We fought bad too. All over texts. And I called her some mean names and just wasn‚Äôt the calmest person. She was with somebody else like a day after dumping me. This guy she told me was just her friend. 

Anyways for 4 years I didn‚Äôt date at all. I wanted to focus on myself and getting myself together. i became obsessed with the gym, I worked at some amazing jobs, and studied my ass off. I eventually got accepted to med school in UCLA. 

Here I met this amazing girl and she was perfect. She even had friends that I knew from back home. It was crazy

But things started getting weird. Till she finally confessed. Apparently she asked her friends if they knew me. And they told her about me and my last ex. And my faults. Minus my exes. 

Now my gf won‚Äôt stop talking about it. Even tho it was 4 YEARS ago. 

Today she started another fight and I told her I want to break up. And was tired of defending the mistakes my teenage self did. 

I‚Äôve been feeling so shitty. But I just can‚Äôt handle how she just won‚Äôt let it go. It was so long ago. And the relation was complicated.",17Aug2019,2
125,"Tldr at the bottom. 

I honestly don‚Äôt remember a time when my parents *didn‚Äôt* drink. My little sister and I have been putting up with this crap for way too long. My sisters only nine but they‚Äôve been drinking ever since we were both babies. 

Nothing violent or anything ever happens. They just get a lot more confident I guess and decide to yell and argue all the time at us and each other. 

I never see my father except for the end of the day after his work, and he‚Äôs always drunk. Slurring words and angry and sometimes just disgusting with everything. I honestly don‚Äôt have much respect for him because of this. He works hard every single day, and I respect that, but he cares more about money and beer than his family. Whenever I rarely have time with him when he‚Äôs sober, he gets mad when I don‚Äôt give him my full attention, full respect. I just find it so hard to do when I know that he puts on a mask everyday for everyone else and then comes home and drink and drinks. 

My mom is a lot better than my dad. She used to be almost as bad, but I talked to her and she realized that she had a problem. She stopped for awhile, only drinking on special occasions. Now, do whatever reason, she decided to drink 3-4 nights ever week. She is better when she‚Äôs drunk than my dad, but she slurrs her words so much and get mad when we can‚Äôt understand her.

I‚Äôm worried about both my parents health. My mom got on a diet and she lost a bunch of weight. I think 70 lbs. but now, she‚Äôs gone up again about twenty. I was so proud of her for sobering up, but then she went and did this. My father is very obese. He carries it almost disgustingly proudly on his beer belly and double/triple chin. I‚Äôm more concerned for my dad because he is way more likely to have a heart attack than the average human because of his weight and diet. 

I really don‚Äôt think that they understand what effect this is having on me and my sister. Whenever we try to do homework and don‚Äôt understand something, we don‚Äôt have help. I help my sister, but there‚Äôs no one to help me. Sometimes my drunk dad tries but he ends up spilling stuff all over the paper and goes ‚Äòwhoopsies‚Äô. 

The worst it‚Äôs ever been is when my parents went out for a night of fun and had wayyy too much to drink. My dad passed out on the bed and my mom on the bathroom floor, waking up only to throw up what I had to clean up four separate times. I tried to get her changed and in the bed but she just started yelling complete nonsense words at me. Then passed out again. 

Tonight, I flipped out when they both pulled out a six pack when they promised just yesterday that they‚Äôd try to stop. I told them how I felt, and they said that I‚Äôm just over dramatic and ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not how it is at all‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs obviously no use talking to them as they seemingly have no conscience. What can I do to make my sisters childhood better, and maybe to fix some relationship problems with my parents? How do I get them to stop drinking?

Tl;dr- how do I get my parents to stop drinking after words and promises don‚Äôt work?",17Aug2019,1

127,"Long story short, I am set to graduate by next summer but my dumbass finally understood the importance of work experience such as internships before graduating.

I never sought one out because my parents wanted me to just focus on school/passing rather than getting real experience in the field along with a lot of other family issues I don't want to bore you with.

Anyways, as of the past month I've just been on autopilot sending my resume like the plague to anything on LinkedIn that resembles a internship related to my major which is engineering.

Sadly all the engineering ones rejected me completely. It seems that during my resume sending spree, I accidentally sent one to an insurance company, they liked me &amp; are asking to meet in person. 

I only have 3 semesters left &amp; really need an internship within my major but the insurance company reviewed my resume &amp; said ""although your path may not seem most correlated with our business, we believe you are a very unique candidate that can bring something different to the table.""

The pay for the job they brought up seems very promising too.

133,"We started dating tail end of high school, moved in two years later got engaged ourselves a bit after that with the intent of saving for a wedding over a long period. We were still young so no rush. She left two years after that. Early on she was always a little more flirty and promiscuous with other men than I was comfortable with but we talked about it and I thought that I was pretty clear about laying it off. Guess not though because through out our fourish year relationship she cheated on me five times that I'm aware of. She also talked about not only our sex life but also the sex life she was having with some guy with a 10 inch dick to my sisters, 13 and 15 at the time. How do I know he had a 10 inch dick? She told my sisters. She also told them ""I'm not what you'd call vanilla."" I'm not delusional that teens are aware of more adult things. That being said they don't want to hear it from their older brothers fiance. 

When she left her reasoning was that she couldn't control herself and didn't want to hurt me later down the road when she couldn't help but cheat and there was a family involved too. She wanted to explore and sleep around a bit. Then why did you say yes to the proposal? Either way I took it amicably. I didn't know anything I do now and if you're not happy here then be happy somewhere else. I'm not going to keep you from happiness. 

She hooked up with some guy right after and couldn't help but brag to my face about it while she was moving out. Well she got knocked up three months later and engaged as soon as that became public. It's honestly kinda enjoyable to watch you know, like trash tv. Everything is going to shit in her life while I'm doing great. That being said I never got to be mad about the cheating, the lying, the being horribly inappropriate to my family, the forgetting about me 10 days after she left etc... And honestly I just want something. An apology, something that shows that she at least acknowledges that what she did was fucked up and hurt even retroactively. I'm happy now. I have a great life, a faithful girlfriend, the kind that makes you question why you tolerated anything less in life before they came along because of how amazing they are. A job with prospects that I can come home from proud every day. And honestly I just think I needed to get everything out and read it over a few times to make myself realize how petty it is in the long run big picture of it all but,

136,"So I‚Äôm a college student who‚Äôs been lifting weights since high school and recently I‚Äôve become lost a lot of motivation due to a number of different factors. Firstly, I always seem to fall into a cycle of working out at the beginning of each semester but stop due to work ramping up and my free time becoming less abundant. Secondly, I‚Äôve been exercising pretty hard for the past 5-6 weeks and a few days ago I started getting pain in the back of my right shoulder, which has put a serious damper on my progress and motivation due to the fear of injury (I have had similar injuries in the past which required PT). Now I‚Äôm afraid to work lift weights but equally scared of losing my momentum as well. Thirdly, for some reason my mother has been constantly telling me to stop lifting weights and just do cardio (a plan which I know will not be beneficial) because she doesn‚Äôt want me to become ‚Äútoo muscular‚Äù, and says my relatively modest goals are ‚Äúgross‚Äù and ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù. To give a bit more context, I‚Äôm not really very muscular and really just want a more toned and athletic physique that I can be proud of when I take my shirt off. I‚Äôm not fat by any means but have some pretty small love handles that need a bit of work (I used to row in high school so I‚Äôve been pretty lean until about a year ago.).

138,"I‚Äôm currently 28 years old. I‚Äôm estimating that I created a MySpace during 8th grade in 2005. I‚Äôve always had public social media accounts because I didn‚Äôt think I had much or anything to worry about. However in 2009, (Im pretty sure this was the year because I remember what picture was stolen, but I don‚Äôt remember what year I started using Facebook so I could be wrong) someone sent me a message from another MySpace account using my name and my photo as their profile photo. The message said, ‚ÄúWhy are you pretending to be me?‚Äù This is the first of what I didn‚Äôt expect to be a decade long situation involving some random person stealing my pictures and making fake social media accounts using either my name or a name very similar to mine. 
I didn‚Äôt know why anyone would do that. Now I‚Äôm older and realize that this person got caught up using my real name and the person he or she was catfishing called him or her out on it so they sent me that message to prove they were real. It shocked the hell out of me and it was really bizarre and creepy to feel creeped out about my own photo smiling at me- as if it were another person completely. I remember responding. I don‚Äôt remember what I said. I do remember reporting the account as fake and having to send Tom or Tom‚Äôs henchmen a picture of myself holding a piece of paper with my URL on it in order for them to be able to delete the account. The account got deleted and I continued my life never thinking about that moment again. Not til more recently that is.

It took me a long time to remember that it happened. Why would I dwell on it? Would you have? I obviously didn‚Äôt. 
During my high school days, I was very active on Tumblr. I would come home every day from school and just scroll through Tumblr and talk on AIM until I got tired and wanted to go to bed. I‚Äôd blog about random things that happened in my my life and post pictures of myself and other things I wanted to share. I‚Äôd reblog things I thought were cool- usually artsy photographs or something interesting that had to do with science or pictures of some art I created. I had a pretty good following. People would ask me for relationship advice. I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe they thought I would be good for that. Long story short, I was very very active on Tumblr and MySpace. I‚Äôd post A LOT and was very open to sharing photos of myself and my hobbies. 

Years pass and I‚Äôm gonna say when I was about 21 years old, 7-8 years ago, one of my best friends texted me and said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúHey, I think someone is catfishing with your pictures.‚Äù He sent me a link to a Tumblr blog. I remember looking at this blog with my jaw hanging wide open the whole time. I remember asking him how he found that blog. He told me he had been following it for a few YEARS thinking it was mine and he didn‚Äôt think it wasn‚Äôt me until a post he or she made that day. It said something about how he or she was high or wanted to smoke another joint or bowl or something. I just remember it had something to do with weed, which I didn‚Äôt smoke anymore.

I scrolled through the whole blog and was shocked and disgusted to see that this person had stolen, posted, and reposted my pictures from the past 6 years back to my MySpace days. By that time, I know I had moved onto Facebook and Instagram and I‚Äôd post a lot there as well. On this blog, every time I‚Äôd share something on social media, this thief would repost it and slightly change the captions. I remember being offended by one of the videos he or she reposted of me. I was talking in the video. In the caption this person re-wrote, he or she apologized for MY annoying voice. Whenever I tell people that, they laugh, but I still feel the same about it- What the hell man?? Not cool! How you gonna steal my whole face and body and personality and then diss my voice. Ugh, I hate this person. 

Anyway, I got that account deleted too. I remember that I kept checking after I reported it to see if it was still up &amp; then the relief of seeing that weird spinning disco ball and white text that said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here.‚Äù &amp; I don‚Äôt know why, but I still never made the connection to that fake MySpace account that messaged me years ago. I should have been smarter and that should have made me more cautious just openly posting my life on the internet. I should have known by then to make my social media accounts private.  I was young. I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt remember. I was stupid.

For whatever reason, I thought it was over. I thought that by deleting the accounts, it was over each time. Unfortunately, each time I was wrong.

That Tumblr discovery happened around 2011. You already know this but for time frame sake and this story, I‚Äôll just remind you it is now 2019. A couple years ago, an old coworker of mine sent me a DM telling me he found a dating account on Plenty of Fish someone made using my photos. He or she used a name only one letter different from my own and said they lived in the same city I live in. I got it deleted of course and again for whatever reason I thought that‚Äôd be the end of it. However this time, I was actually a little smarter because I got worried that they were trying to catfish people in my area. I thought to myself that if they catfish someone in my area and the catfished got frustrated or angry that fake me never wanted to meet, they‚Äôd hate me and then end up seeing me in public with my actual boyfriend and end up murdering me. So I set my social media accounts to private. Finally right? Ugh. I‚Äôm dumb. I should‚Äôve done that 10 years ago. I remember posting about this fake dating profile and one of my followers replied and told me he thought he was dating me online for a while but found my real account and realized he was we bamboozled. What?! Weird!!

I had almost 2000 followers on Instagram at the time (mostly people I didn‚Äôt know so it was hard to narrow down which of my followers was stealing my pictures again.) I have a love hate relationship with Instagram so I‚Äôd temporarily disable it a lot. But one time I disabled it and was never able to log back in, which in hindsight is probably a good thing because I probably would have kept it up leading to an inevitable mental breakdown due to my own self induced anxiety that one of my followers was a psychotic cyber stalker. &amp; either I can‚Äôt remember changing the password or someone changed my password but I still have never been able to log back in. I know it hasn‚Äôt been deleted completely because I can‚Äôt take my old username. It says it‚Äôs in use but when you search for it, it doesn‚Äôt exist.

I had an account I created before this one I loss access to, but I decided to start fresh. The older one was private and inactive so I just left it hanging out in limbo and made a new one- Instagram numero tres aka my current Instagram.

So that POF account was a few years ago and since then I haven‚Äôt heard about any more fake accounts. I don‚Äôt remember initially finding a fake Twitter in my name when, but recently I was scrolling through my twitter deleting dumb posts I made and I saw a tweet I made to a twitter that stole my name and photos again.  The handle was my first and last name with no spaces and a picture of me on Halloween but I didn‚Äôt create the account. The tweet I made was in 2017.  I found my own tweet at it 12 weeks ago according to my Instagram story highlight. Yep- a highlight on my IG dedicated to the fake profiles that I find on the internet. I thought the fake Twitter was still active but I checked just now and it says the account has been suspended. When I found this Twitter, I posted to my Instagram story that a fake twitter exists in my name with my photo but it isn‚Äôt me. A friend responded and told me about another fake dating profile on OKcupid. He said that he always reports fake profiles he sees on dating apps using my photos! I said wait how many have you found? He told me he wasn‚Äôt sure but he‚Äôs seen them often and he always tries to match with them but it never works. Apparently he‚Äôs not my stalker‚Äôs type. 

I went on OKcupid and I found the profile he mentioned. This psycho stole a photo off my boyfriend‚Äôs Instagram because he or she had nowhere else to steal from! My boyfriend barely posts and they took the one picture that was still publicly available to steal! 

That‚Äôs weird and totally unnerving that this fake profile thing is a never ending dilemma I apparently just have to put up with my entire life because this person has mountains of photos they can use to create fake relationship after fake relationship. I try not to think about this cyber stalker but ONE WEEK AGO I was reminded by an email. Remember that old Instagram I have that I said was hanging out in limbo? Well I got an email that said someone was trying to log into it. To me, it‚Äôs obvious that there is a really good chance that it‚Äôs the same person.

While on the verge of falling asleep the other night, I had an anxious thought: If I keep my social media private, then the fake profiles have free range to galavant as me on the internet and the catfished will never be able to discover that this person is a fraud because they‚Äôll never find the real me. That terrifying thought led to another and another and so I deleted most of my personal photos aside from pictures of myself and my boyfriend and I set my profile to public again. 

I shared my thoughts about my anxiety with my friends and one asked how long this has been going on and it wasn‚Äôt til just now that I remembered 10 years ago I received my first message from my obsessed anonymous stalker. This has been going on for 10 years and who knows how many people this person has catfished during that time. 

Every time I find another fake dating profile, I share it on my IG story and all my friends are always surprised by how long this has been going on. I don‚Äôt think anyone can imagine what it feels like to be in such a bizarre situation. 

I know this was a long story, but if you made it this far, I guess I‚Äôm just asking for advice on what you guys would do to cope with the anxiety and constant fear of being kidnapped or murdered by an angry cyber stalker that no longer has any current pictures of me to steal. I always think about who this could possibly be and why they have been doing this for so long. Why me? Is there anyone else they‚Äôre doing this to? Why do they say they live in the same area as me and work a job similar to mine? Does this person love me or hate me? Are they TRYING to scare me or make me miserable? 

&amp; does anyone have any advice on how I can find out  once and for all who this is so I can finally have some sort of piece of mind on this situation? Has anything like this happened to any of you?
 Thanks",17Aug2019,1

141,"Recently got my first job at Walmart, part time, making $11.50 an hour, working 32 hours a week. 

I make about $730 per paycheck (biweekly pay) and about $1300 a month (with taxes stolen from me, about $1500 without taxes).

Anyway, my parents are charging me $230 a paycheck for bills or other needs, in total $460 a month. 

This leaves me with about $800 in my pocket per month. I love my parents and everything, and since I'm 18 I'd like to live here a little longer before I figure college out.

I would like everyone's opinion if this is too much to pay for rent. Obviously I could get a raise and talk them about it, but I'm understanding that $460 is low average rent for a living adult, but at the same time I'd like to save up for my first car.

Thinking about it further, if I get my car I gotta pay my own car insurance which is another $200 at least. But that's another question for another day.

I take care of my neighbours cats when they g on vacation, and since they're retired they go on trips frequently. Petting the cats and just spending time with them is very therapeutic and helps me destress.

I am not an adult yet, but I have a part time job and Ive done calculations, Ive saved enough and make enough to support the financial needs of a cat. 

The biggest issue here is that my parents hate cats because they've been traumatized by one that lived in their house when they were doing their phds. The landlords girlfriend didn't like cats, so he told my parents he'd decrease their rent if they took care of the cat. From what I've heard, this cat was a spoiled little shit and was always biting and scratching.

159,"Hi, I‚Äôm a girl that‚Äôs 17 years old and the thing is that I think my mom prefers my sister, so this is why I‚Äôm writing my story, so the thing is that I have an older sister that is 22 and as I said before, I‚Äôve always seen my mom show more favoritism to her. When I was little I remember my sister having all these nice things and I always asked my mom why I didn‚Äôt got cute clothes or stuff and she always told me that it was because my sister was the oldest but I always thought it was unfair, either way I didn‚Äôt said anything but when she bought clothes to my sister I remember she would always help her and she wasted more time in her than me. I always thought that it was because I was little and that when I grew up my mom would pay more attention to me too, the thing is she never did, even to this day she always helps my sister pick clothes and she never helps me, luckily because my dad is sometimes bored he helps me pick clothes since he doesn‚Äôt have a bad taste, but still, I never got the mom and daughter time buying clothes and stuff or other things and when we are in the car they always talk really happily but she never does that when I‚Äôm alone with her. Also since I was little my sister showed a behavior towards me that was like unhealthy? I mean she used to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with me to this thing that was putting a pillow in my face so I couldn‚Äôt breath and I remember that I cried afterwards and I remember that she told me to do it to her too but remember, she was 5 years older than me and when I told her that I remembered she laughed and said she used to breath by a side of the pillow and she did that so I wouldn‚Äôt tell mom,and also even to these day my mom doesn‚Äôt show any concern about the behavior my sister had those days oh and may I also say that my sister sometimes sees me with this hate towards me that gives me like chills.Another thing is that she treats my sister like she is my age, so she lets things pass that I think are not right for someone that it‚Äôs already an adult, like she hits me or scratches me and stuff and my mom never yells at her or anything but if I do a minimum thing like idk slapping her hand my mom would get furious, and what gets me angrier it‚Äôs that she says that my sister is an angel, that she‚Äôs really nice and stuff and I‚Äôm like where? She‚Äôs really selfish and I‚Äôm not, yes, she helps with the house chores and I don‚Äôt but the thing is that it‚Äôs because she has like a type of ocd or stuff that she needs to have everything clean and I don‚Äôt (1. Because I‚Äôm lazy 2.Even if did she would think poorly of me.) so because of that she says that I‚Äôm mean and stuff, I must say that at first I tried to be nice but I got tired and now I‚Äôm these cold person around them sometimes but can you blame me? My mom never defends me, my sister can insult me, she can say my defects but oh boy If I say anything to her my mom defends her right away and tells me all my physical defects when it was my sister that started it but still I mean, which mom ‚Äúdefends‚Äù their kid by saying mean things to the other one?. She always shows remorse because my sister used to stay with my grandmother when she was a baby cause my mother used to work but I mean, she was a baby, she doesn‚Äôt remember anything and she was well loved and my mom stopped working until she was grown enough but for me, I was raised by my mom until I was like 8? Cause she used to go to work and I stayed with my sister in the house and we weren‚Äôt even in the same room, so I think if she should be having a remorse it would be towards me cause she missed a lot of stuff. Also another thing is that she kind of hates for me to get attention and I don‚Äôt know why, one day I remember that my mom was talking about how pretty my sister is (one thing that she usually doesn‚Äôt comment about me) while we were walking and she was like oh look, some boys in a car are coming, they probably will look at your sister cause she‚Äôs so pretty which I‚Äôm used to hearing those things about her so I was like meh but the boys looked at me and not her and instead of laughing or being like oh look they looked at you, she was like disappointed and stuff cause they didn‚Äôt looked at my sister and she was like ‚Äúugh, they looked at u‚Äù and she always likes when people compliment my sister and when they don‚Äôt do it to me she laughs and says that it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm ugly but when someone compliments me she never says anything.

175,"For simplicity, I'll be referring to the class I'm already registered in as Class A and the class I'm waitlisted in as Class B.

So bear with me.. this might get a little confusing? Basically, I prioritize Class B over Class A but as you've read above I am already registered in Class A and am waitlisted for Class B. How my university works (not sure if it's the same nationwide/worldwide), you get dropped from a class if you can't attend the first day (unless you send the professor an email and let them know ahead of time you'll be missing class). Likewise, if you are waitlisted for a class, it is best to attend the first day as well as you will get priority over possible open seats. So, what I plan to do is attend the first half of Class A and then attend the beginning of Class B to see if I can get in the class.

I need to email my Class A professor that I will be missing the second part of class which I assume has its own individual attendance (first half of class is lecture- the one I will be attending, and the second half of class is lab- the one I'll be skipping to attend Class B). How should I tell my professor that I will have to leave early? **Obviously, I don't really want to lie to her but I also don't want to tell her I'm going to another class because if I don't end up getting into Class B and end up staying in Class A, I don't want her to have ill-feelings towards me.

181,"So I had a situation today regarding 3 employees. I‚Äôm going to refer to them as: E, K, and S. E is a great employee, she communicates and is productive however today she complained about doing her job. I initially made a joke about her complaints but as the day went on she was very slow and annoyed. Her job isn‚Äôt hard so to me it speaks volumes that she isn‚Äôt motivated or wants to work. She was also helping a new employee but didn‚Äôt enforce the rules just waiting for me to come by and nitpick. Not good. If I have to come around and babysit employees because they‚Äôre lacking motivation I think it‚Äôs time to hire someone else who understands what needs to be done and just gets it done without complaints or hesitation. It‚Äôs not a hard job!!!

Let‚Äôs move onto S: I asked her to oversee and micromanage the new employee to make sure she‚Äôs following rules and doing her job correctly.  She successfully trained her but as time went on she did nothing when K(the new employee) was on her phone WATCHING VIDEOS!? E told me what was going on! She wasn‚Äôt on her phone when I was around. I tell S to come into the office. I approach her about what happened and how it‚Äôs her job to make sure people are following rules. She tells me that‚Äôs it‚Äôs my job. Absolutely not. If I am working with clients and things are being done behind my back people need to get fired. I don‚Äôt want to be met with excuses!

186,Okay so I'll try to keep it short and sweet and I am looking for some advice. Hence why I am here.  Quick background on my girlfriends parents/ family. They are very religious. Pray before every meal and go to church religiously. (Heh). Anyway. The mother of my girlfriend is the most religious out of the family. And she has a brother who is gay and has made comments that if he were to ever get married that she would refuse to go to the wedding. So heres my issue. I plan on asking  both of her parents for their approval to marry her which they will no doubt give me. BUT I want to make it clear that if and when we have children and if one or both turn out gay that there will be no different treatment of the gay child and that they cannot refuse to go to my child's wedding. If they decide to refuse to go then they will have to not go to either child's wedding gay or straight.  I will not allow my child to feel less loved for who they are no matter what. So my need for advice is how to go about bringing up and presenting the subject. (I do love her family and they love me and I dont want this to ruin our relationship). My future child is more important over if they like me or not and wether they give me their blessing or not I'll be proposing anyway. Thanks in advance. Love peace and chicken grease.,17Aug2019,1
187,"First of all, there is actually nothing wrong with how my friend is feeling.
She was actually trying to express how she felt in a group chat I was in. However, the other person flipped out and turned into a while scene. My friend (Let's call her A) always had to deal with other people in my group fighting. She just expressed how she felt about them disrespecting her when she told them to stop arguing or stop talking about a common subject she had been traumatized by but they just kept on going. My other friend (She'll be B) thought A was acting how B was when she wanted to play games which she would bug us about it a lot which really didn't make sense why she said that to her. Since B was making it into a big scene, A got frustrated and left the group chat. Now, this is where I feel guilty about. I'm usually the one who helps A out when she's feeling frustrated but this time she seemed really angry and didn't want to talk. So knowing that, I decided to leave her be so she can cool down a bit and I would talk to her later. Turns out that was wrong because she unfriended me and almost everyone who was in the group chat. I found a message from her in our own group chat saying she felt so uncared for because no one came to talk to her. I honestly feel like she was talking about me not talking to her when she needed it. I understand her feelings and I really think she has the right to be angry. She's always so kind and A is the glue that keeps us all together, I can't imagine how much she was trying to endure when everyone was at each other's throats while she was making an effort to stop them from arguing.

193,"This is my first time using reddit so I hope I‚Äôm doing it right. Anyway a little bit about me I‚Äôm going on 17 and I‚Äôm just now a senior in high school, and I‚Äôve had the same group of friends pretty much all the way through school. This summer I was fortunate enough to go to boys state and the summer leadership experience at West Point which basically makes you learn how to communicate. Before this summer I was a really bad introvert and I didn‚Äôt like to talk to new people at all. I was terrified by it. But after I experienced those two events I became better at communicating. Right after I got back I promised myself that I would no longer be a shy kid and a downer of a person. I promised myself that I was going to be the guy that I always wanted to be: funny, outgoing, helpful, honest, friendly, and attractive. Over the summer I worked really hard on improving my social skills. My friend and I decided that we wanted to have experience talking to girls so that we could improve our social skills even more. ( my friend and I agreed on my goals and we followed them together.) We had some girls over at his house and it was a great time. But we had some friends there that didn‚Äôt like the idea of us getting out of our comfort zone ( which I learned was really important for communicative skills) even when we told them that it was all ok. My other friends now feel like they‚Äôre left behind I think and they are clearly and explicitly jealous of me and my friend. There was a lot more that happened this summer but I won‚Äôt go into it. Basically the other friends have gone behind my back and started shit about me that either isn‚Äôt true or is something that they have no business talking about without me there. I never really realized what ‚Äú fake people‚Äù meant until now and I can confidently say that fake friends are what I‚Äôm dealing with. They have tried to destroy my relationships and shit in the past and now it‚Äôs to a whole to level and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Part of me wants to tell them to screw off and that they are completely fake and all that. But I know I can‚Äôt do that or it would make it much much worse. I‚Äôm getting to the point now where I come home and just lie in my bed shaking because I‚Äôm so angry at them. I know that I can‚Äôt just leave them because it‚Äôs a small town where I live I can‚Äôt just ignore them. 

One example here: one of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù was so pissed at me because I didn‚Äôt check on him after he got rejected. He is 18 years old and should not have to be checked on like a child after he throws a hissy fit. And he showed up to my house and wanted to fight me.

Alright, so I am a young female who recently came out to my mother and my sisters (not dad) that I believe I'm a lesbian. They all took it well as they are very accepting. I've always been best friends with my mother as I'm the youngest and quite spoiled, it also turns out I have a few mental problems that have made themselves known but are still not completely diagnosed,  I most likely developed them from my mother's side,  but that is not particularily relevant. 

It's beeb going on for about two years now, but whenever I got into an argument with my mother she threatened to kill herself, drive off a cliff, run away etc. but mostly kill herself. That really scared me, and still does scare me, so much so that I would have trouble breathing at night and would break down crying in my room due to the stress.  
About a week ago my mother and I got into a squabble, I don't remember what over, but she called me a ""Horrible fag"" which really upset me so I ran away. I messaged her some things (I now think were slightly irrational)  saying I hate you &amp; i want to die. 

When I came downstairs after calming down, my sisters, dad and mother were all glaring at me. I asked what was wrong and my dad shouted ""How dare you tell your mother you hate jer, apologise now!"" angrily and I started crying. I yelled back ""How dare she call me that terrible name? she's a terribke mum and you are a terrible dad"". (for context i dont like my father much as i dont respect him, nor do i view him as my dad) 
my mum fired back saying ""i called you a horrible frog in a french accent"" at this point, im like seriously wtf quick thinking i guess. That was the end of that argument but it's been playing on my mind all week and my mother has been distant and giving me dirty looks. 

I don't know what to do, what to say or how to act. Is this a toxic home? I feel somewhat safe but I am now feeling very uncomfortable and distressed.

TW: rape

A little over 2 years ago my ex raped me. There had been about a year of sexual abuse leading up to the rape. The manipulation and gaslighting and little things like forced kisses and groping fucked me up just as much as the actual rape.

A few weeks later, I met my current BF. I truly believed he saved me from further abuse. He helped me cut my ex out of my life. 

My BF is my ex's uncle (though they are the same age, they're family), but they are not in contact with each other and don't interact with each other's immediate family frequently.

I have had a lot of trouble trusting people after my abuse, My friendships are mostly people who my BF is friends with, people who he trusts I believe are safe to be around and I am more comfortable around them.

My BF's two close friends are dating each other. They have been together for years. I thought they were in love. They are extremely good friends with my BF, and I liked them and was very interested in being close to them as well.

THE INCIDENT:
My BF's good friends were apart for a few days. One of them told my BF he cheated on his partner with My abusive ex. My ex has told their friends that He raped them. My ex is trying to talk to me again. My BF doesn't know what to do about this all. 

I am in absolutely shambles. I have spent years avoiding contact with me ex, but now not only have my friend destroyed his relationship to ""have sex"" with him, but I believe my ex was raped by him. I have to cut off a friend who I tried so hard to warm up to and put myself out of my comfort zone to interact with because I discover he is a POS. And now my rapist is coming to me wanting help after they have been raped. I am always a big advocate for helpin out sexual assault survivors but how the FUCK am i supposed to help out my rapist.? The poor partner who has had their relationship destroyed is coming to me for help. Help, Reddit.",17Aug2019,1

219,"So I'm supposed to be graduating this year, well, hopefully, I'm in an alternative online class thing because I'm behind on credits, which is one of the reasons I don't want one. Other reasons being: 
-I don't want to be a charity case to the people who barely even know me. 
-I don't want to disappoint everyone if I don't graduate and it's honestly the pressures already kinda of stressful and the year hasn't even started yet. 
-I think my moms trying to do this for herself because she never did. In her words, ""it's my time."" I didn't really think about it till later on. Like if it's anyones time it's mine right? Yeah she raised me and has been through everything, but it's still mine?
-I'm not going to know anyone but my mom, grandparents, stepdad, and boyfriend, everyone else it going to be her friends and half of them won't even show up because they all like 2 hours or longer away since we moved. 
-Like every other teen I got some anxiety, it's not severe, but it's enough to make me just want to hide when I'm around crowds, even if it's people I know and been around forever. 
-Lastly, I hate graduation parties. Never heard any one say they enjoyed a graduation party, even my mom doesn't like them. So I don't want people to feel forced to go to something just to give be money and not ever have a good time.

We spend an inordinate amount of time together and being away from her for just a week is extremely difficult. We have sex daily but have only ever kissed other people. When we talked about what our situation was going to be this year I said I wanted to stay together but not be exclusive while we were away from each other. I said this because  I don‚Äôt want to create resentment or put pressure on our relationship if either of us were to feel that we were chained up and not able to fully experience college. I also think we might need to experience other people before we can truly say we are meant for each other.

225,"I'm an undergraduate, having met my girlfriend at college when I was a freshman and she joined one semester before. Since it was my first month, I still didn't have an idea of what area interested me the most. Meanwhile, she earned an scholarship and joined the biochemistry lab and her work there (her P.I. gave her a project planning to publish in some journal) became subject of some talks that we had. Later on, I found myself interested in the biochemistry/immunology area.

For that, I talked to her P.I. and joined that lab some months later to be in more contact with everything that was going on there and was not receiving any money, unlike my gf. One day, as we were at the laboratory, our P.I. told me that he was planning/writing a project between cancer cells and platelets and, supposedly, this was going to be the project that I was going to develop.

This month I earned a studentship from him, since he saw that I was interested not only at the money, but also in learning with them. The thing is that today, after telling me about that project, he told me that I was only going to be trained there and not developing any project. Meanwhile, I see my gf working on her project and everyday getting more and more results, being closer to publish. To be clear, I'm not feeling jealous about her, it's just that as her I wanted to work on a scientific research too (being one of the reasons I wanted to work there) and now I'm feeling a little bit sad.

Besides that kind of sadness, I also feel inferior among the other students that are there for a longer time (even my own gf), being the only one that didn't have a project when joined and feeling disconnected with them, even though they have been very very very friendly to me ever since.

I'd like to have some advices of how to deal with these emotions and control them, so it doesn't tear me apart from inside out.

Thanks!!!",17Aug2019,1
226,"I have a friend who I‚Äôve known since middle school, and we are currently in out junior year of high school. I love and care about her, but over the past couple of years she‚Äôs become increasingly more antisocial. At this point she only has two friends, me and a mutual friend we have. However, she makes no effort to talk to him and he or I always has to make plans together to get her to come out, And if we invite anyone else she complains and says she has anxiety about it which I could understand but the one other person we invite it a mutual friend that we refuse to exclude. (They haven‚Äôt had any past issues, in fact, my friend barely makes an effort to say a single word to the other and it‚Äôs incredibly rude)

When we do invite her out, she‚Äôs very antisocial and barely talks to anyone. She also complains about fake people all the time, but someone from school approached us and she started acting extremely fake and overly nice to them, even though she never talks to this person. It was hurtful to everyone else in the group since she‚Äôs never that nice our excited to see us, and honestly if we didn‚Äôt make an effort, we would never speak again. I know this because last year, life got in the way and I forgot to talk to her and she never texted me. I wanted to see how far it would go, and it went on for 5 months. Then I felt bad and texted her and she‚Äôs blamed me and victimized herself for a year now about it when she‚Äôs the one who can‚Äôt take 2 minutes out of her day to talk to someone.

I tried to talk to her about the way she was speaking to me one time (very dismissive and rude) and I said I didn‚Äôt feel like it was fair and that it seemed like she didn‚Äôt care about having relationships with friends and she just goes ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt deal with this right now amelia‚Äù and its incredibly frustrating because she has nothing else‚Äôs going on, and has no other relationships with people.

228,"This is a bit long, sorry about that.

The title really makes no sense so let me just explain. I (M15) am the kind of guy that likes to show affection for my friends and never really tries to hide it. I hug them all the time, I tell them how much they mean to me, I make sure they know I'll be there for them, and I feel the need to stress that I always tell them I love them because you don't know when you're going to lose someone in life, and I need them to know that they're the most important people in my life. I do however, respect boundaries set by those people and don't force them into hugging me back or any other stuff.

Now, I have 3 best friends, 3 people in my life that I constantly let know what they mean to me. All three of them are girls. One of them, let's call her Lynn (not her real name, but a name that relates to her), visits every so often in the year as she is the only one of my 3 best friends who doesn't live in my city (she used to but she moved, we keep in contact on social media and facetimed nearly every day until the events I'm about to say) and she comes to visit family and friends. Last week she came and we went swimming together, I wanted a hug and asked a couple times but she said no and I accepted it. Later we had a mini bonfire with another good friend (I should mention they have a history and had a thing together a while back) and the second they saw each other she went in for the hug with him which really hurt me, and I let her know it hurt me later on after the fire.

We were supposed to hangout the next day but because he wasn't able to go because of work she refused to go with just me and claimed she only liked going in groups. Later on that day she confessed that me sharing my feelings and being all affectionate and caring made her realize that she doesn't feel the same way, and that she doesn't think I'm her best friend anymore. We haven't texted or talked much since then, just a couple arguments that lasted 10 minutes over Instagram DM.

Yesterday she hungout with the other friend (lets call him Ryan, same story with Lynn: not their name but it relates to them) and didn't invite me despite saying she still wants to be just friends (I have 4 levels of friendship: 1. Nothing 2. Friend 3. Good friend 4. Best friend) and I didn't know about it until after they hungout. I've ignored Ryan over the last day and feel betrayed by both of them because they know exactly how I feel inside about friendship and it makes Lynn a hypocrite in my eyes because she said she wanted to hangout in a group.

It sounds to me she doesn't really care about me, and that my affection to her affected our friendship.

I don't know what to do, this hurts me and stings me. I think I've put in every little detail I could. I don't want to lose my other 2 best friends because of this problem I have of being overly affectionate. What do I do? Am I being a dumbass for feeling hurt? Do I just accept my best friend that I've loved for so very long is no longer close with me? I'm clueless, and I'm asking the people of Reddit for help.",17Aug2019,1

237,"I am a volunteer for a psychopharmacology lab, and I have been there all summer. Since a new semester is approaching, two lab instructors were discussing all the lab assistanta they have and future projects. One of the instructors says he likes all the assistans so far, which was fine. But then, the other one said that he likes all the techs except for one and that they're in the room, but he won't say who. Now, the lab instructor was laughing as he said this. However, I feel like he is one of those people that will laugh as they say some criticism or truth maybe to ""soften the blow."" Moreover, the second lab instructor was just quiet as well as the other lab assistant who were both in the room with me. 

I worked hard for that lab, but I have a tendency to run my mouth too much and make jokes. I have tried my best to stop because, while everyone is friendly, it is after all a professional environment. 
I also have a lot of social anxiety (which is part of the reason why I joke around a lot) so it's difficult for me not to suspect that he was seriously talking about me.

If he was some random classmate, I wouldn't care as much. However, I am hoping to get a letter of rec from the professor in charge of the lab who relies on the lab instructors' opinions in order to write them as he is not in the lab most of the time.

Not sure what I'm supposed to do here. Should I just assume that he was actually joking? Should I ask the lab instructor how I can improve?",17Aug2019,1

239,"So my roommate and I are good friends. We've been buds for a couple years now, and we always make a point to help each other out when needed. Lately, he's fallen on some hard times. He always worked as a roofer and this year was RAINY. He wasn't getting more than a day or two of work weekly for a long time. He couldn't afford his car payments or insurance, so the finance company deactivated his car. His phone bill has also been behind, so he can only receive calls, and not make them. He barely had enough money for food, let alone beer. Normally we both drink a lot, so I figured whatever, I'll get the beer for a while so we can still crush a few drinks after work most days. It's been getting a bit expensive, but I like to have some company while I drink, so whatever.

A couple weeks ago he got a new job with regular hours, but it's on the other side of town. No big deal, I have both a car and a motorcycle, so I always ride my bike when it's sunny out. I'll let him borrow my car when I'm riding the bike, and he can take the bus when I don't want to ride. He's always been cool about it and puts in any gas he uses so I don't mind. The car is old and has high miles, etc. but I love that car and it's a good reliable vehicle. I need it when the weather turns and I can't use my bike anymore. The car means a lot to me.

Now here's the thing. Today was his first payday, and I let him borrow the car to go to work. He was getting off at about 8pm today, so I figured he'd get home at around 8:30 tonight and have some beer for me since he's got a bit of cash and I couldn't pick up any beer (on my bike). I waited till after 10pm and called to see where the fuck my car was. He didn't answer so I started getting a little nervous. I sent him a text like ""yo is everything all good"" and didn't hear back. When I didn't hear back, I started freaking out in my head. If he crashed it or got pulled over and impounded, I would be pissed. I called him again around 10:30, and still nothing. By this point, I'm sure something went down.

He walked in at 11:00 and the car was fine. He said he went to an impromptu card game at a buddy's place when he was leaving work and didn't notice my calls till it was too late, so he couldn't call me back. And he also didn't bring any beer. The fact that he took my car to the game without permission has me pissed. It's like he got so used to me letting him borrow it that he didn't feel like he had to. I told him what I think about that, and he said it'll never happen again. Honestly, I believe him. But the fact that he did it in the first place makes me want to stop lending it to him anyways. And not bringing a case of beer? I'm a fucking alcoholic, and he knows that. That's the least I would have expected after the huge quantity of beer I've shared with with him lately. He knew I couldn't carry that shit on my bike. 

Writing all this out makes me think he looks a lot worse in this rant than he really is. He made a stupid mistake today, but he's always been there to help me out when things were the other way around too. But a pretty big part of me wants to leave that car sitting in the driveway, even if I don't need it and he does. And the fucking beer. That's the least he could've done.

Sorry for the rant. Should I let it slide or should I stick with my gut that says ""get used to the bus, cause you aren't using my car anymore at all""?

She's not the type to care about a big rock vibe but I would still like the ring to be impressive without going OTT. Perhaps more in the vein of contributing to the design. Does anyone have recommendations for places that will do custom designs in Aus? I like the idea of putting thought into what it looks like rather than picking it out from a window. Are there places online that are reliable to ship a ring and to deal with on custom designs?

Realistically I only think I can afford around 2-3k, so this might be a completely unrealistic ambition. Would love some perspective!

252,"Hello Reddit, so next week I move into my apartment but I went today to pick up the keys and check the apartment out.

The apartment is a two bedroom apartment with a small kitchen space and living room.

In the apartment, there is three total people. Me (in one room) and two brothers in the other room.

I was very surprised by this and I asked management why I was not informed of there being a third person living with me. They apologized and said it was an error. I was like okay and left. Now, keep in mind I am not mad about there being three people total, I am mad at the lack of communication.

Anyway, my thing is. I am paying for half the apartment and they are paying for the other half (splint between them). So technically each is paying for a quarter of the apartment..To me, I think I should get half of everything and they get the other half and split it between them. I don‚Äôt think it is fair for them to get each get more space (ex, fridge space, dining space, etc.) than me because I am paying for half.

Once I meet them, I plan on being very respectful and say that I think I should get half the apartment and they get the other half. I think it‚Äôs fair.

What do you all think? How should I go about this? Am I wrong to think this way? Keep in mind, I don‚Äôt mind if they need a little extra space, but I just don‚Äôt wanna be left with very little space. I just don‚Äôt think that is fair. What should I do?",17Aug2019,1

STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED
When the physical pain dissapeared, I began experiencing mental disturbances. Depression, anxiety, existensial anguish....

It is weird, it feels like my brain was protecting me from mental pain by creating bodily pain.

After that I had a mental breakdown, went to my GP, he put me on meds and afters months, me and my GP decided to go off them.

256,"I'm asking for advice about my feelings. Earlier this year I really liked this girl and I wanted to ask her out so bad, but she liked my brother. It didn't bother me much since I'm scared to ask her out, so it didn't matter. After a few months I began to have feelings for a different girl, but I still had feelings for the first one. I liked both girls at once, here comes the craze part. It just never stopped stacking. I ended up liking around 6 girls all at once. This isn't normal and I act different know when I'm with girls. I began to have feelings for my family members. Not the normal kind of feelings. It scared the sh*t out of me. Well since a few weeks I began to learn how to differentiate feelings of love and being in love. It didn't help much. As I still am in love with 6 girls. I just hit puberty, but I don't think it's normal to feel these kind of things for your family. I just want to know how I can stop these feelings and gain the courage to ask someone out.

However, lately I've experienced my first panic attack, had my left eye pulsing/twitching, and I now have acne breaking out (I typically don't have any acne). I did some research on all of these things and the only thing that tied them together/made them similar is that they are all correlated with either high amounts of stress or a sudden increase in stress. I think this is all tied in with my breakup, and this is the first time things like this have happened so I'm just wondering, when or should I seek help for these things?

I think these are all caused by my breakup with my ex and if they are, I understand that they will go away after I've healed/gotten over the breakup.

263,"So here is the thing, I'm now on my 6th semester of my mechanical engineering degree.
I have never been a fan of anything related to it, but most of the time I could keep dedicating enough to pass. So I just came from a one month break from uni,  which I spent most of my time improving my German, playing fortnite, sleeping more than I should etc.
Since the last days of my break I started to feel some anxiety, regarding my degree. I've never been a fan of it but right now it feels like I'm on a completely wrong area, and I'm not even sure which area I should go to.
The thing is, I am very very frightened of not being able of finding a job which helps me sustain a economically comfortable life.
Seeing the scenario for mechanical engineers in my country, I'm pretty sure I'll end up unemployed.
I study in another city, so I only stay in my hometown during the weekends, I feel anxious just about thinking leaving my hometown on Sunday night now.
I am 20 years old (to be 21 in December), that makes me feel like I'm too old to try to change to another area. The only area which grants some economical comfort in my country right now is medical (becoming a doctor), but I never thought I'd fit so I don't know if I'm considering it because I really have interest or because I'm just thinking of an area that can grant me more economical comfort in the future
Last time I felt so weak psychologically was in January and right now I just have the feeling I'm on the edge of going to a much much worse situation. I deleted pretty much all my social media apps, just kept WhatsApp but to be honest I don't feel like keeping it either. I wish I could just lay on my bed for days.
I need help because it's like I can see it clearly how bad it can get and I'm afraid of letting things get to that point.

298,"I am a truck driver, and my husband and I have been working at this company for about 8 months.  In that 8 months, it seems that the company is kind of falling apart.  There are things we have both witnessed that are definitely morally wrong around here and many people have made complaints to management.  Not a lot is happening to solve the many problems here.

In the few months we've been here, I have made friends with a lot of people.  About 2 months ago, a female gate guard told me about how one of her co-guards told her she gets less hours ""because she has tits.""  She went to their direct supervisor and he laughed at her.  She quit a couple of days later and I never saw her again.  This guy (we'll call him R) is still the supervisor, and doesn't seem to have gotten reprimanded.  At the next safety meeting, there was a 20-second half-assed reminder that sexual harassment is not tolerated.

Yesterday, an ex-driver friend of mine called me.  Her daughter is one of the other guards.  Apparently, she also reported sexual harassment to R, and the main person doing it to her is a driver, S.

I have seen dudes leering at her, and sometimes getting what I would consider to be too close.  She is way too patient and just puts up with it.  The other night, S asked her to come closer so that he could ""pull her hair.""  She immediately reported it to R.  Guess who still drives here?  And as a gate guard, she is basically forced to interact with every driver every day.  I am super pissed about this, but it wasn't the victim that told me, and she cannot afford to have problems or lose her job, as she is the only income in her household.

The owner of the company is rarely present, and he is finally trying to find out why his company is falling apart.  Driveds and dispatchers are compiling lists of the problems to present to him, and I want to tell him about the harassment.  Many of the supervisors here are his buddies, and I wonder if it will fall on deaf ears, or get the wrong people in trouble.

Well, recently my boss called me out for wasting company time due to my apparent lack of focus. I'm typing up a response to him right now, but I would like some input from others as to whether I should bring up ADHD despite the fact that I have not been formally diagnosed. I don't want to make it seem like I'm pulling this ADHD excuse out of nowhere (""Yeah boss, um, I totally have ADHD, but conveniently have not been diagnosed""), nor do I want to use this condition as a justification. But I'm virtually 100% positive at this point that it's playing a role. Is there a way that I can bring this up while remaining appropriately professional and without making it seem like I'm trying to conjure up a random scapegoat?",17Aug2019,2

304,"I don't post often, sorry if this is the won't format it forum. But tonight I ran into some shit that I can't comprehend. 

TLDR: I was wondering  accused of sexual assault tonight.

Story:

My friend of nearly a decade knocked up this chick who's about 12 years older than him. When they first started talking and going out, my wife and I had them over for dinner and drinks to meet this chick. During this first meeting she gave some very weird, overly-dominant vibes.

During that time my buddy complained of a toothache. We were smoking a bowl and I guess that made his girlfriend think I was okay with any drugs, for whatever reason. She told me that she wanted to inject my friend with something that would make the tooth pain go away. To be clear, she's not a medical professional of any sort. I looked my buddy in the eye right in front of her and told him ""Don't let this bitch put a needle in your for any reason."" This describes the rocky start she and I had.

Fast forward several months, my friend gets this chick pregnant. So they gave birth to a little baby boy. He decided to move in with this girl and do ""the right thing."" Tonight he invited me and my wife over to their home to hang out and have some drinks, as his mother was watching the baby. 

So we went over and we're having fun playing Cards Against Humanity and just chilling. At some point I said I was hungry so he put a pizza in the oven. His wife and I both went to the kitchen (like 10 feet away) so I could get a slice. 

Afterwards we sat down and started talking. Apparently, my friend and his girlfriend both tend to be pretty jealous. They began taking about how he was jealous about a friend of hers and things got a little hot, so he went outside for a smoke. She started talking about my wife's sister and saying how my friend was obsessed with ""her and get belly ring."" My sister-in-law lives 2000 miles away and had nothing to do with this or any way to protect herself. So I spoke up and told the chick she was just being a jealous bitch.

I immediately called an Uber to take me and my wife home. While standing outside waiting, and not saying anything else, my friend's baby-mama was being passive aggressive, but I ignored it. I then went on to the restroom before the Uber came.

When I came out of the bathroom my buddy was standing there and said ""Jessica (his crazy girl) told me you tried to fuck her while you were in the bathroom."" I immediately denied it because it didn't happen, we were never in the bathroom together, and my wife was no more than 10 feet away at all times. Luckily he believed me, but shit. Out if spitefulness she made up this story in no time. I had to explain to my wife what she had said before she heard it elsewhere, and all because I was taking up for her sister. 

Now I'm in fear she's going to say this shit to someone else just because she's fucking crazy. The way my buddy described this to me sounded like sexual assault. These kinds of accusations are detrimental to the lives of people who have done nothing wrong, but I have no recourse, as it's her word against mine. WTF. This person doesn't deserve to be in charge of her own life, much less that of a child.",17Aug2019,6
305,"I don't know how to go about this.

I've copied and pasted below a previous post of mine.

&gt; I applied through clearing to a university I did limited research into, which was admittedly my first mistake. I'll accept that.

&gt; I've yet to still withdraw my choice from clearing and withdraw my application fully. And no, I don't think I want to defer it.

&gt; I did this due to the fact that I felt like I absolutely had to. Throughout the entirety of my A-Level experience, we were shoved down the university path. 3/4 of PD lessons were about university, how you'd essentially fail without a degree, etc. While the other 1/4 focused on alternatives, these presentations were often rushed, half-assed. All in all, I felt like I absolutely had to go university, despite not being academic, otherwise I'd be regarded as inferior, and that's always been one of my biggest downfalls: how others perceive me.

&gt; Well, I made a split decision and decided to take a gap year to think about it. Perhaps I'll save up enough to travel, maybe do some volunteering. Although deep down this feels right, there's another part of me that's screaming, ""You're a failure! You're just scared! You're not capable,"" and all that fun stuff. I emailed my Head of Sixth Form last night and was, I shit you not, terrified I'd be berated. They've yet to get back to me.

&gt; The thing is, I'm struggling to find decent jobs. I'm struggling to think of how I can utilise this year to my advantage, given that I'm financially struggling and cannot afford to go backpacking across Australia. I did think about it, really, but everything just feels empty, as cliched as that may sound. A part of me for some reason feels disappointed, though I'm not sure why. What bothers me the most is the fact that I did alright throughout my A-Levels, given the circumstances, so I've no reason to be disappointed?

&gt; Perhaps I'll pursue an apprenticeship next year. It's just, university just doesn't feel right intuitively. I've also no friends, and so I'm struggling to cope with the inevitable loneliness as well.

&gt; If people could share some insight I'd be really appreciative.

&gt; Thanks in advance.

I feel so utterly hopeless, and as though I've failed. One of the reasons I wanted to take a year off was so I could focus on my mental health, given that I've intermittently experienced suicidal thoughts. They're amplified tenfold now, due to this potential disappointment I've bought to my teachers and family. 

I can't help but feel like I'll never get to experience great things due to opting for a gap year/potentially not going to university. It was always a vision of mine, but never one that felt right, or one that felt very idealised and romanticised. 

If anyone could perhaps offer advice/insight, as well as (affordable) things to do during a gap year,that would be terrific.",17Aug2019,5

310,"To start off, I'm sorry for the length of this and if this post is sounds like it is all over the place, I'm on mobile 

So my partner and I have been together for 5 years on and off. We recently had a baby back in March.. now there have been things in the past that he has done to make me lose my trust in him. Varying from going on lunch dates with exes without telling me, to sexting. Since I had our son, I haven't felt like myself. I do have postpartum depression, which I have been actively going to counseling and therapy for. and I  haven't lost the baby weight. Needless to say, I feel worthless and like he isn't attracted to me anymore. We haven't had sex since mothers day, and he has been acting very distant lately. So I went through his phone. Well, only his pictures because I think he knows to delete his texts now. Before I get into what I found, I just want to say that he deletes his texts because three months ago I found texts of him talking to a girl he had a sexual fling with about a year and a half ago, and since he got caught he makes sure to delete/lock everything. Now on to the pictures. He had TONS of screenshots of different girls on Instagram and snapchat. All of the pics of them are half naked or suggesting something sexual, like one chick had the front part of her pants pulled down a bit to ALMOST show the top of her vagina. Some of them are just the hot Instagram models, so I didn't care about those. We all look at the hot people on Instagram, I don't care if he saves the pics for jerking to later. It's what guys do. But what got me upset is the pics of girls that he either knows or works with.  When I asked him about it, he got very defensive and said I am always doing this and I have no right to go through his shit and literally flipped it around on me. And he couldn't give me a straight answer as to why he is taking screenshots of half naked pics of girls he knows if he isn't into them or looking at them later for jerking material. I don't know if he is just taking screenshots or actually has something going on with these girls or girl.. now he put a passcode on his pictures. When he said he wanted to go through my phone I didnt hesitate and gave it to him. He knows my passcode. And I dont have everything locked,like my pics, messages, social media apps, etc because I have nothing to hide. So then he said he doesn't give a shit what is on my phone or who I talk to... I wanted to work things out because of our son and I want him to grow up in a home with both parents who are happy and love each other. When I asked him if and why he wants to be with me, he said only for our son and then tried to take it back and say that's not the only reason, but couldn't give me any more as to why he wants to be with me. Am I just overreacting because I'm an emotional mess who is very self conscious and insecure at the moment? Or do I have a reason to be upset and should I consider splitting? I am heartbroken right now because I feel like there is more going on than he is telling me and I haven't stopped crying. I just want to do what is going to be best for myself and my son. If that means that I need to work on my shit and stop being so insecure or breaking up with my partner then so be it. I just need other advice of someone else who isn't involved.

We‚Äôve been ‚Äòdating‚Äô or ‚Äòseeing each other‚Äô and very clear and concise to each other that we are not a ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô which is fine. Or, I guess, was.

I want to be her partner, she‚Äôs not sure yet. Which is fine. We had a long talk about our respective fears of potentially dating, why she‚Äôs hesitant, and to healthily define and outline the parameters of our current situation. She‚Äôs told me that she likes me. As have I to her. She has also told me that she‚Äôs ‚Äòhot and cold‚Äô on dating exclusively. Basically, we‚Äôve agreed to keep seeing each other, test the waters, and see if we could be compatible.

She‚Äôs also explicitly told me I can see other people, and that she may do so as well. Which I also think is fair and fine. We‚Äôve agreed to be courteous to the other and let each other know if we‚Äôd date someone else. I think this is really a formality as she and I have both admitted we don‚Äôt really want to see anyone else while we‚Äôre seeing each other.

So a good friend of mine left her phone at my apartment, and told me I could just bring it to her tomorrow. I went out and bought a charger so that she could have a phone not on 2% for tomorrow, and ended up deciding to leave a little scavenger hunt for her. She'll get a reminder tomorrow when she has the phone to check her saved snaps, then her photos, then her contacts, then her notes, and the message for her is there.

We've been quite close for a while now, and while I do believe my feelings for her are not reciprocated exactly, I tried to make this a platonic and friendly message (purposefully avoiding the use of ""I"" and such). She's told me her password, and has mentioned that she wants to have my fingerprint in her phone because she has that trust in me.

However, I'm worried that she might see this as weird or invasive, and while neither of those are my intention, I would rather not have them there at all then upset her.

Should I follow through with it or should I delete all the stuff?

325,"Throwaway because I think he knows my account.

Giving people fake names so it doesn't get too convoluted. I am bisexual (this matters later on).

TLDR: I rejected my friend John and I compare him to my crush Jan. I realize they're very similar personality wise and wonder why I rejected him. I feel as though I am being artificial since it feels as though I rejected him for his looks. Now starting to panic and I have no idea who to turn to. 

For the record, I'll just say that my friend, John, handled it healthily but I still worry about him since he has had suicidal thoughts in the past. Please don't drag him down, he has done nothing wrong and I think it was brave of him to get it off his mind because he usually doesn't like talking about his feelings. As far as I know, John is not manipulating me in any way and he hasn't shown any signs of being an asshole. 

A few hours ago, I was talking to my friend over text and he told me his feelings for me. I apologized and said I did not feel the same way, but I hoped he would find someone that would fulfill that role in his life. John respected my decision and said he just wanted to get that out there. I couldn't bring myself to answer anymore because I felt uncomfortable and I didn't know how to continue the conversation. 

A few hours pass and I finally process the situation. I finally realize the impact of my decision and start to think about why I wasn't interested. First, I compare him to my current crush, Jan, who also happens to be my friend. Jan is fairly similar to John personality wise. So now I'm starting to panic and think that I wasn't interested in John because of his looks. I know I don't have to give out my attraction to everyone but I feel as though I am a one dimensional person over the fact that I rejected him when he is so similar to Jan.

 I feel as though as he is going to do something stupid because I rejected him. And what for? Why did I reject him? Why am I not interested? Why does making him smile feel less satisfactory than making Jan smile? I am clearly not rejecting him because he's a dude because I have had crushes on other guys in the past. Am I just a one dimensional person? 

I don't know, I need advice. I know it is within my right to reject him, especially since I don't have feelings for him. But I don't know why I don't have feelings for him, I just don't ever see a future where we could be more than just friends. Am I being one dimensional? Are these thoughts normal?

326,"Im not the type of person to get on social media and talk about stuff like this, but I need to just tell the whole story so I can get some peace of mind. First off this is not gonna be a sob story or a pity party I just need help and advice on how to move on from this. I just graduated highschool earlier this year and have since been really excited about going to college. All through highschool I told myself that I didnt like any of the girls around me and that I would wait till college. I did. Four years of highschool, and never did anything more than talk with a couple girls. My first two years were absolute hell for me. I had left my two bestfriends cause they got heavy into drugs, just to get into another friendship that was incredibly toxic. I was always struggling to understand my friends and why they were always so hostile and heartless. Despite my hardships though in my friendship, I decided to grow. I spent the entire summer after sophomore year by myself. I grew so much. Junior year I went back to school and was able to change my friendship's dynamic. Those last two years of highschool were fun, even if i still never felt fully understood. So flashforward to summer and i got a job at a Walmart Distribution Center making really nice money. My family had plans to go on vacation to the beach in Alabama, a place we hadnt been to in about 6 years. Up until a week before we left i had plans to stay at home and work while they went to the beach. Literally the last day I had at work until they left, my dad encouraged me to ask off, just to see. So i left the house that day and actually asked off despite my doubts about it. I got off, the nicest lady gave me 4 days off on the spot. No questions asked. That same lady ended up not even working on my shift when i got back. She literally gave me the time off and i didnt see her again. Anyways the trip to the beach was everything but eventful. I mean it was the typical beach trip we usually had when i was younger. It was great to be on vacation but I also have never been the biggest fan of the beach. Every time we go to the beach though, we always spend the last day shopping. So thats what happened. All day friday we went shopping, as we were leaving early the next morning. American Eagle was definitely a place we would end up at and eventually we got around to it. I went in and found some jeans and joggers i wanted to try on. I went back to the fitting rooms and there she stood. She asked me my name and how many clothes. I could tell she was shy because she kept looking away everytime I talked to her. I thanked her as she spelt my name on the board. She actually spelt my name with a Z. My name is Zander and people always spell it Xander. (Funnily enough she likes it with an X more but she still wrote it with a Z for some reason) Nothing at this point was out of the ordinary. Just another pretty girl that would get lost in the sea of people i would see throughout the day. That was my thought until this girl slipped her number under my door. I knew it was her because of the purple crayon she used to write her number. I literally was fist pumping to myself in the changing room. Meanwhile she was pacing around and singing out loud trying to avoid eye contact with my mom. I came out and showed my mom the joggers and everything. The girl stood in my peripherals getting clothes from another room. I could still hear her singing and she looked really nervous. So i knew it was her at that point. I left the store with the number. She told me that she was so excited when she realized i took the number with me. The reason she slid her number in the first place was because she was trying to work on her confidence and one of her friends thought doing that would be a good method of growing. I was the only guy she slid a number, she went 1 for 1. She waited a week before she decided to slide her number and for some reason she chose me. She said she could tell i was different, and i was about to figure out how amazing she was too. Against every logical part of my brain i decided to text the number. I mean im a pretty realistic dude and i still cant explain why i decided to text the number. I mean i live 8 hours away, what would i be looking to get out of it?? So i texted her and she responded as soon as she got off work. We stayed up all night texting back and forth. That night we both found ourselves saying that we liked each other. We had so much in common and despite her being a junior in highschool (2 years younger) she was really mature. After i told her where i lived and how i was leaving she was sad but she figured thats what would happen, i mean she isnt stupid either. I mean this was just meant to be a gig for her to work on her confidence. We talked everyday after that. We constantly texted the first week and then we stared facetiming on google duo. I literally cant put into words how quickly things went between me and her. We were both so comfortable with each other and she was brave enough to spill her very very troubled past with me. I even came to know her biggest fear, she was scared to fall in love again. Her past relationship was absolutely horrible, the man was abusive physically and verbally and didnt hesitate to make fun of her in public with his friends. It didnt start that way though. She grew to love that boy and she tried so hard to keep their relationship together. I dont want to tell too much of it because she wouldnt want that, but this boy ruined her. Her first love ruined her. She loved him with everything and he broke her both physically and mentally. That is why she was trying to build her confidence. Even after almost two years she wasnt the same. I wanted to give this girl everything i had, i wanted to try so much because i never wanted to hurt her the way she had been hurt. I wanted to treat her different than how her parents continously treated her. I wanted to give her everything. I still do. Before too long a whole month went by. We were falling for each other and we both were very open about it. When you try to make a long distance relationship work you have to be honest about literally everything. Everything needs to be explained, the other person needs to know your intentions and what you want. We wanted each other so bad. We would fall asleep together on facetime after talking for upwards of 6 hours. Everything was great between me and her. I was there for her on the days she needed me and she was always there for me. Even though we couldnt physically be together we found much more in how we felt about each other. (I know this is getting long and im shaking so bad rn typing this up but i need to keep going) A lot can happen in a short period of time and i was honestly starting to question how far we could take it. We talked about a future together, we agreed on almost everything. I would say something i wanted and she would respond with how much she wanted it too. She was becoming more and more perfect everyday we talked. And i was becoming that to her as well. We knew how we felt about each other and long typed out messages were what we left each other to wake up to every morning, afternoon, and night. She literally means so much to me. We had surprises planned for each other when i was gonna come down. I know what hers is know and when she told me i cried a bunch. I told her mine and she did the same. No one ever had tried to make something so perfect for me, but she was going to. She already had stuff planned and everything. I was writing her a book we could read together. Her perfect date was just to sit and read a book beside the person she loved. No one ever took her seriously for that but i always told her i would love it. It was adorable. I wanted to make her book date so special. I wanted to read my own book with her, under the stars with a huge blanket and pillows. I had a notebook with all her nicknames, things she liked, homecoming ideas, gift ideas. That was just the first few pages though. I wanted to write a book about our stories. How everything in my life led me to her and how everything she went through built her up for me. I wanted to write about how amazing it was that we met and how we both prayed about finding someone we could love. We both didnt want to be lonely. I still believe she is the girl god assured me about when i was younger. Me and her both prayed on our relationship so much. She built up my faith again. I wanted to write about our future and the house we talked about. I was gonna end the book telling her how she has changed my life, how much she means to me and why i want to try so hard to make things work for us. When i told her tonight about my surpise she cried. We both want to be with each other soooo bad. Im in so much pain rn. So things have ended up the way they are now for a couple reasons. Last week she told one of her best friends that goes to church with her about me. She wanted him to know that she finally found someone. She had made it clear to him many times before she didnt like him that way and he refused to listen. She was always there for him though. She tried so hard for him. She helped him so much when he needed it. But when he learned about me he got mad at her and stopped talking to her. She was really hurt. That was the only person she got hugs from. Her parents dont care and she has no one else. I stayed up with her after a long work night and listened to her cry on and off for about 4 hours. I was there for her. She was texting him the whole time trying to tell him how she felt for him. She cared about him and didnt want to loose him as a friend. He left though. Stopped going to church and everything. She hasnt seen him since then. The second thing that happened is with my plan to go see her. I mean i never expected anyone to understand about how quickly me and her grew to like each other, especially since we hadnt really met in person. She wanted to have a family so bad. Hers was always disfuntional and she was left to care for herself and her sisters. Despite how her parents shoved school down her throat, they really didnt try to take care of her. Here we have a 16 year old girl working 40 hours a week all summer being forced to pay for her meals, back to school supplies, clothes and literally anything else. She wanted out so bad. She tried so hard to be close with her mom again like when she was young but her mom didnt hesitate in pushing her and her dad away. The girl wanted what she never had, a family that cared. She always wanted my family to like her because that would mean she could have someone to actually care about her. I wanted to tell my parents more about this girl but i was so scared. I told her about my problem, how i was scared to open up to my parents. She understood. But after having to tell her the same thing over and over again when i talked about my parents, i decided to try and open up to my mother. I spilled my heart out to her. All i heard about was the circumstances. Not one positive word came out of my moms mouth. She talked so negatively about a girl she had never met. She didnt want to let me grow and was trying to shelter me. ""You dont need to drive 8 hours away for the weekend"" over and over again. I acknowledged the crazy circumstances over and over again. I just wanted my mom to know how amazing this girl is and why i feel I need to go see her. She never budged. I broke down that night on hands and knees and cried to the lord. I was so conflicted. I told my girl about the whole situation and she was immediately upset and thrown aback. Now im here. We have talked very seriously the past 24 hours. We both dont agree with my mom. Now that we are growing so attached we both realize how hard it is to put ourselves through this. We both really want to be able to hug and see each other. We want to be able to play with each others hair and fall asleep beside each other. I want to be able to stare into her beautiful eyes. We cant give that to each other though. We both deserve it but we cant give it to each other. As of a couple hours ago we know what are plans are. She is gonna graduate highscool and work toward her real estate agent license. Im gonna go to college for computer engineering and meet new people while im there. We both told each other how we still believe we are literally perfect. We both hope someday we can be together again. But we need to let go for now so we can focus on ourselves and not carry around this pain. We cried so long tonight on the phone. Im crying right now, again. This hurts so much and i question if things are really gonna be better this way. But after talking about it for an hour and half after i got off work tonight, i know this is what we need to do. She needs to heal, she is numb. She cant feel love anymore. We both dont know how we are gonna let go because we dont want to. She says hopefully someday we can pick up where we left off because she is never gonna find someone like me. We want things to work but we just need to acknowledge our situation and keep praying about it. I know i sound crazy saying this but i know im not gonna find someone like her in college. I know how crazy it sounds but she is literally perfect. I just need help. The only other person on this planet that understands what we are going through his her. I told her my phone is always open for her when she needs to talk and she told me the same. She is numb though. She doesnt even want to talk about this very much. I mean she has helped me understand everything but i just pray she can open up about her feelings. I never wanted to hurt her and she never wanted to hurt me. We both know it is neither of our faults but that doesnt change how much this hurts. Thats why i wanted to type this up. If anyone has experienced something similar please help me. I know its hard to help but just hearing a similiar experience will help me. Im not looking to change what has happened up to this point i just need help in learning to move on. She will always mean so much to me and she has made this past month the most meaningful month of my life. I really was falling in love. And as much as it pains me to say, im glad this didnt have to go all the way before we decided on something like this. I know seeing her in person and having to say goodbye again would have been even more painful. But still, i almost cried multiple times at work tonight. My chest constantly hurts and i just cant stop thinking about everything that has happened. I thank God for all of this, for bringing this amazing girl in my life, but im in so much pain rn. Me and her are just gonna have to grow on our own now and pray about this by ourselves. We want to stay in touch but we also need to get over this first. Im sorry this is so long but i just needed to tell everything, maybe someone might understand. Its just so hard to let go when nothing wrong has happened. When it seems like the world just wants to work against you, against me and her, us. We still have the same feelings but we know whats best for us rn, depsite how painful all this is; this is what we need to do. If anyone actually reads this all the way through, thankyou so much. Any advive/kind words is so greatly appreciated. And if your like me, i would really appreciate any prayer.",17Aug2019,1

330,"I am 23 year old female. I need some advice on how to handle not having things in common with friends. I recently went out drinking with my friend and her boyfriend. However, I feel like we have nothing to talk about. We don't really talk about values, beliefs, or politics because we share similar, if not the same, views on those topics. However, when it comes to anything else, I mostly listen to my friend and her boyfriend either banter or talk about things they both share interests on.


 It is hard for me to hold a conversation with them because I don't know what they're talking about and vice a versa. As for me, I usually just listen or listen to the music because their interests and mine don't even match up. Like not even close.


Is it okay to let the friendship drift and fade? They have stable jobs while I'm still continuing my education. I'm always wondering if I'll ever have a best friend out there that I can always talk to about anything. Or if I just need to accept the fact that I'll be by myself and that I need to focus on myself for now. I'm not sure.

Info: Girlfriend is 19, I am 21, and little brother is 14. Girlfriend (GF) Mother (M) and Little brother (LB). This is all over the place, but for context we're going to be strictly talking about (M)'s parenting toward (LB).

(M) is a very big narcissist and self absorbed. This makes things very difficult to deal with pretty much any issue due to the ""its my way or I'm gonna throw a huge fit and disown you"" attitude she has. Anyway, there have been many instances that have caused quite a bit of issues while my (GF) and I have been dating. This being said (M) has been confronted by (GF) about (LB)'s morbid obesity, which is a genuine concern. Her response was to blame (LB) saying ""it's his choice to eat unhealthy"" even though she buys the food and prepares most of the meals they consume.

Not to mention (LB) goes days without showering on a common basis, and once again ""its his choice"". (LB) also has an extremely foul mouth saying really inappropriate things and cursing. His excuse is ""Well you and mom do it so why am I not allowed"". (GF) has tried to explain to (LB) that he shouldn't curse out of respect for your parents until you are an adult, but every parent is different. (M) agrees that he shouldn't curse but lets him anyway, and will only say scold (LB) if (GF) says something about it first.

 (LB) has said some really just WTF stuff such as implying (GF) is a whore/slut ect. (M) pretty much embraces this. Yesterday (M) seemingly misheard (LB) and repeated what she thought he said, something along the lines of ""your sisters oiled tits"". To (GF) and I it was obvious that  (LB) did not say that, and (M) was just trying to embarrass him. When confronted about it being a really inappropriate, (M) credited (LB) saying ""well I live with (LB), of course I'm gonna say dirty things, I learned from the best"".

These are just a few things that have happened over the past week. This has been happening for years but is getting worse as (LB) gets older and is now in high school. (M) has never folded when confronted, and pretty much says "" Well that's how it is so deal with it or don't be in my life"". How should we deal with this situation?",17Aug2019,1

I hope I can get some help. 

Tldr; lost my long term job 7 year, 7 year SO,  lost my home, and now I think of death constantly.  I have clinical depression and dont want to take the medicine (my family might not let me stay if I dont take itmedicine) for years I was in a toxic relationship and ended barely. I think of death a lot and barely eat. Therapy does not seem to work and I've turned to christianity but if you dont fully commit it's bad so I always think I'm sinning.  How can I move forward.


My story is pathetic. I lost my long term job which had and I realize that my relationship I was in for years was the only thing I really obsessed about. He left me this year. I lost my place as well and my long term job. And now I am constantly believing that death is coming. I barely eat and therapy does not seem to do anything but keep me down. I think it has more to do with the fact that I left school early and and been mindlessly living for a guy and also was addicted to marijuana I stopped smoking too late and I feel braindead because I burned myself out also working 60 hours a week 2 jobs and then not eating or eating bad, doing drugs. Now I see how much of my life I wasted and there was a time where I was alone and had a room and a car and I was building a routine but I didn't realize how not having my dad around at a young age messed me up as I became codependent after I started dating people. I will ask more advice but please help. Every day it's hard to sleep but then if I can I stay in bed all day and it hurts now. Friends aren't talking to me so I am more isolated.

336,"All year before receiving my A-levels my plan has been to take a year out of education, explore my options and work. My family knew this.

Howevever, on Thursday when I recieved my results B, B, C, they told me they expect me to go to university. I told them this isn't what I had planned and I hadn't applied and they told me to apply through clearing. (For those who don't know cause I didn't before then, clearing is essentially when courses open up because people may have not gotten the grades to get in)

My step mum said that she applied during clearing and since then all my dad has sent me was links to uni clearing websites. 

I explained yet again that I'm not planning on going this year, there is no rush for me. I would understand this if I didn't have anything to do for a whole year but I do. In October, November, December and January I will be working a seasonal job as an elf, I wouldn‚Äôt even be in the house for months. 
Then in the new year I will be working (paid) on a Web series. Potentially acting but will be mostly crew stuff. 

If I were to go to Uni I would study something related to drama or TV and film so these jobs wouldn't be just random.

My step mum doesn't think it's enough and tells me I need to do more as she thinks the uni won't like that I took a year out and did these things.

My boyfriend says that it's okay to stick to my guns and go next year but my step mum and dad won't shut up about it and it's stressing me out.

Later on I finally told a close mutual friend about how I was feeling and she told me that this girl sees me as one of her best friends and she trusts me more than anyone and she's worried that me doing something could mess that up.

339,"My ex (22M) and I (22F) dated in a committed, serious relationship for almost 3 years long distance before breaking things off. We‚Äôve been apart for almost a year and recently after seeing each other again we decided we want to get back together. 

However the other night he told me he wants to be open and transparent with me since he‚Äôs making the decision to move here and we‚Äôre actually starting our life together. He said he had something to tell me, and it was that he briefly dated someone else for around a month while we were separated. It was during a period of time where I decided to go no contact with him. I asked him if they had sex, and he said yes. I immediately felt sick to my stomach. 

Now, the thing is that I can‚Äôt blame him for finding a companion during a time of extreme loneliness and depression. I‚Äôve told him this and I‚Äôve also said that I 100% would‚Äôve done the same thing had I had the opportunity to be with someone else. So I literally can‚Äôt find it in me to be upset with him. Plus we weren‚Äôt together, it‚Äôs not like he cheated on me, and he had every right to find someone new if he wanted. When we broke up we both knew that was a possibility and had discussed it. 

He told me he wanted to let me know otherwise the guilt would eat him. While I appreciate that he wanted to be honest with me, I could have gone my whole life without knowing that he‚Äôs screwed someone else. I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm feeling is jealousy, or some weird sense of betrayal (?) but I can‚Äôt shake this panicky feeling. Every time my mind has idle time I get these images of him screwing her. He says it‚Äôs okay that I feel this way and he understands and if I‚Äôm having doubts about getting back together then we don‚Äôt have to. He also says he would feel like this if it was the other way around. He says he did it to fill the void of losing me and he regrets it, and he broke it off with her so quickly because he knew he wanted me and he was tired of pretending to want someone else. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm being a baby about everything. Everybody had to have somebody before, right? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the fact that we were each other‚Äôs first everything that‚Äôs making this bother me so deeply... or if I‚Äôm just straight up jealous that some other girl got to spend time with him like that. I told him I don‚Äôt want to know anything about who she is and I didn‚Äôt want him to identify her. He says it was never serious and it wasn‚Äôt even close to what we have, it was purely about wanting someone to spend time with.  

I feel like it shouldn‚Äôt bother me so bad. But it does. It hurts really bad. And I can‚Äôt shake this panicked feeling every time I think about it. I feel like things aren‚Äôt the same. 

For those who have been in this situation, how did you handle it? Were you able to overcome it? Did it bother you this badly? What would you suggest I do here?",17Aug2019,1
341,"Hello,

Please don't judge 

I am having trouble with some intrusive thoughts and an obsession over my crush. I'm gay, he is not.

I obsess over him and always need to talk to him. I constantly wait for social media posts and always gets paranoid when he talks to someone else or I make up fantasies in my head about what he could doing with someone else(usually sexual) and lead myself into spiralling images of this leading me to an almost perpetual rage of anger and jealousy. 

I want to be with him so bad and can't stand the jealousy of someone else who gets to see him nude and have romantic and sexual relations. Please don't think I only like him superficially. Him and I are real close and talk a lot so I also feel like no one will understand him like I do.

I know he is not gay and all so I try to not make advances on him nor overstep my boundaries with contacting him, texting him, etc.... I have been pretty good so far using all my will power to stop me from going overboard. 

But now that jealousy and anger have lead me to daydreaming and wandering into deep thoughts of me hurting him or finding ways to force him to do something sexual  and it scares me because the thoughts are so intrusive and overwhelming it doesn't make sense to me why I'm thinking about this stuff and fantasizing about it?

I want to talk to him about this but I know it will only freak him out. 

Anyone know what I can do to make these thoughts stop!? They are on 24-7 and I need help and it is driving me crazy. Thanks",17Aug2019,1

346,"I‚Äôve just been accepted to my university of choice but over the summer I‚Äôve been thinking about a gap year.  My reasons are as follows:

I think I might be in danger of complete burnout because my grades have been (very) slowly worsening.  I also am not completely sure of the course I have chosen for myself- although I am competent at it, I‚Äôm not sure if it is my future, or my passion.  For this reason, although it is possible to switch courses during my time at university, there‚Äôs no definite situation where I‚Äôll work out what I actually want to do at university and switch.  A gap year would allow me to explore possible passions and also get a feel for the world in which I live without the burden of formal education.

I also have applied for a place to live in university, the same establishment where my friend will go.  The slight problem with this is that I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll continue being friends and I‚Äôd also like an opportunity to make new friends without feeling like I‚Äôm meant to stick with him.  In short, I need a complete break from him as a friend and being around him in general.  If I go to uni, I will be living with him.

The cons of taking a gap year, however, are that gap years typically cost money- especially if I make the choice to travel, there‚Äôs no guarantee of finding a (good) job to pay for my year out- but I definitely have to get a job as my parents are unable to help with the expenses.  Also, I fear that I won‚Äôt make the most of my time off and will waste it due to laziness.  I‚Äôm not sure how likely this is, though (I wouldn‚Äôt slack off at school, and typically out of anxiety work harder than I need to anyway).

To continue, I fear that I might end up out of the loop if I do take a gap year- as in, when I return to university, I‚Äôll feel out of place, being typically a year older than other freshmen, and I might even be worse at working in a place of education having spent a year away from it (although statistics show that those who take a gap year generally perform better than their peers who didn‚Äôt).

Does anyone have any advice for me?  This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòthis or this‚Äô question- I‚Äôm open to anything or even a compromise where I don‚Äôt take a gap year or go to university or whatever.  Feel free to ask me anything if needed.  Thanks!",17Aug2019,1
347,"So I (19f) have this friend (19f)  that likes conflict. When she has a problem with me she never asks me about it; instead she talks shit about me or posts something shady on Instagram. I was already pretty tired of it because we‚Äôre just too old for that. BUT

This week my boyfriend and I adopted a puppy that we ADORE. I fell in love with him the moment I saw him and I have done nothing but dote on him since we got him home. But earlier tonight my friend posted this shady thing on her instagram that was very specifically about me and my puppy parenting because of something harmless (I‚Äôve showed it to at least 7 people and they agreed) my boyfriend posted on Snapchat. 

I‚Äôm not going to go into the whole scenario but essentially my friend used some very harsh words to make some very bold assumptions that she had no right  to make and no facts to support. she did all of this in a public Instagram caption without using my name. 

I want to confront her. She felt justified enough to call me out but not justified enough to use my name or handle it privately like adults. That wasn‚Äôt a productive way to address her concerns. And this girl knows me well. She knows the bond that I have with my animals, and our new puppy in particular. How could she insinuate these nasty and hurtful things?? I know that if she and i part ways people are going to ask her about it and she‚Äôs going to spread really nasty rumors. Not to mention I‚Äôd have to go through the trouble of getting a suite change less than a week before the semester starts. 

But then again what‚Äôs the point of trying to save that kind of friendship ? How do I confront her ? Should I just let it go ?",17Aug2019,1

350,"Ok so I‚Äôm kinda having a midlife crisis, at 22, although at this point it‚Äôs just a crisis. Basically, I live with my parents and do uni online, not what I wanted but that is a whole other story and I also accepted that I probably wont be able to change that so it is completely fine. Life happens. I have been thinking of a compromise between what I want and what my parents want and what I have come up with is: moving to Germany and living with a friend. To break it down, I have a friend who lives in Germany and wants to move out from her parents‚Äô house to be closer to her university and im in need for a place. I live in a whole other country with my parents of course which means I have to travel. I can pay for my own ticket, just not for my education, yet. My plan was to go live with my friend and get a job to be able to support myself and not depend on my parents anymore because they like to point out how much everything and everyone is a burden on them (everyone being my siblings). I told my parents that I don‚Äôt mind still doing the whole online uni thing just to save money for them and I really don‚Äôt to be honest because it will make me working a little easier for me. However, when I said all this to my parents, they dismissed the entire discussion and got mad at me for reasons I don‚Äôt get. My dad got so furious over the fact that I want to get out of here and leave my family to be alone for a while and said out of anger that I could go, but I know he doesn‚Äôt mean it and I don‚Äôt want to leave on bad terms. I think I have to elaborate more on my life here, but then again it‚Äôs just me, living at home, doing uni online and not leaving the house except for once every 2-3 months bec a friend of mine remembers me every now and then. To be completely honest, I‚Äôm so tired of being sad and depressed (I was medically diagnosed and it is not getting any better whenever I‚Äôm home) and I need some time alone to figure out who I am and be my own person. But my parents think that I can‚Äôt do it on my own and they laughed when I told them I wanted to be independent and not rely on them on everything anymore. Kinda broke my heart but that‚Äôs fine. Oh, I should also point out that my dad said if I could convince my siblings to go with me along with my mom, then I could go but that is truly unfair and very selfish because they have their own plans and future to focus on. I told my dad that and as usual, he got more mad and started shouting. I really don‚Äôt see the benefit of disrupting my siblings‚Äô future for my sake and I would never ask that of them. Never. I mean I get their point in wanting us to be together as a family, but for now I think I need to focus on myself more and that doesn‚Äôt mean that I love them any less because I really do love my siblings and would do anything for them. I haven‚Äôt talked to my parents since then (that was 2 days ago) because I wanted them to cool down a bit and chill, but I don‚Äôt think they will want to talk about this again.

He's being super understanding and not pushing me for more unless I'm ready or in the mood. But I find myself beating myself up about it. I still find him attractive and love him very much but I just don't feel like having sex.

355,"Hey, this will probably be a very generic post, you've probably read like 10 similar to this one so there's that, I just need to vent out a little bit.

Sorry for the spelling, english isn't my main language.

December last year I moved to a city alone because I wanted to study in college and there wasn't any near by that had the career that I wanted to study (Aeronautical Engineering) so I left my hometown and come alone to the city (~600km).
I missed everything, my parents, my pets, my friends, every little single detail that you can imagine from your hometown, I missed it a lot.
College isn't going so well, I have lots of anxiety and it's very difficult for me to open to new people and make friends... 
About 3 months ago, I started talking with a girl from another city (23F I'm 18 btw)  I literally never  felt this level of confidence with anyone in my entire life, I could literally talk about anything with her, we talked day and night about things that we liked, religion, politics, space, relationships in general and about any topic you can think in between.
I was really in love, she was smart, pretty and understand me so easily, I couldn't be happier, I found someone just to be myself with.
We decided to start a relationship, and I told her, If something goes wrong know that I'll prefer being your friend than a bad boyfriend, I don't wanna lose you...
Some days ago we had some little problems, first of the relationship and I felt like shit, I let her down, nothing really serious, we discussed in a good way and solved it.
I was really happy with the relationship, I couldn't ask for a better person to be with, she helped me with all my problems and made me feel really appreciated, this is not something common for me, I am really antisocial and it's really hard for me to trust people in any way.
Yesterday she suddenly tells me ""We gotta talk""
And basically she said that she didn't wanted the relationship to go this way, that she couldn't handle the distance anymore.
I'm broken as shit, I truly didn't expected this and now I don't know what to do, I have been crying for about 12h straight, I didn't wanted to lose this person, she knows how broken I am and I understand her motives and respect them, but hell, now that the reality of being totally alone starts to kick in I really want to dissappear, I really wanted this relationship to last, we were going to met at the end of september, I was saving money to help her pay the trip here and now idk what to do with this money, I also trashed 1 and 1/2 letters that I was writing for her (Very old style, I know, let me be).
I don't have any friends in this city, I don't like going to parties or alcohol and every person that is important to me lives 600km away, I feel very ugly and insecure about myself.
Also college isn't going so well.
I really wish things were different, I can't have this person as a close friend because that would hurt me, but also I don't know how to stop talking to her, we literally talked for 2 months straight and I just don't know what to do, I know I should move on but I'm just afraid, and of course I got this stupid mindset of ""I will never find someone like her again"".
I had 2 relationships before this one, and none of them hurt in the way this is hurting, I have been thinking on going to a psychologist for a very long time now but I just don't have the money.
I just want any kind of advice you have, I would really appreciate it, thanks for your time.",17Aug2019,1

It didn't bother me much since I'm too scared to ask her out. After a few months I began to have feelings for a different girl, but I still had feelings for the first one. I liked both girls at once, here comes the craze part. It just never stopped stacking. I ended up liking around 6 girls all at once. This isn't normal and I act different know when I'm with girls. I began to have feelings for my family members. Not the normal kind of feelings. It scared the sh*t out of me. Well since a few weeks I began to learn how to differentiate feelings of love and being in love. It didn't help much. As I still am in love with 6 girls. I just hit puberty, but I don't think it's normal to feel these kind of things for your family. I just want to know how I can stop these feelings and gain the courage to ask someone out.

362,"Hi Guys,

I'm struggling atm with my life and actually don't know what to do with it.

The story behind it, begins with my ex girlfriend (I know, every ""good"" story begins with an ex).

We broke up 2 years ago and haven't had contact for about a year. After this break, we casually met on a party and had sex on that night. Since then we kept contact and had some dates again. Every time we were drunk we even had sex and everything seemed like we were going to be togheter again. Yesterday we had again sex and I asked her, whats going on with us and how we are going to proceed. She began crying, told me, that she loves me and said, she will leave the country in about 2 months for studying and it doesn't make sense beeing togheter. I didn't know that she is going to leave for studying and didn't know what to say... obviously I told her that I love her but she kept being sad and left. Now I'm sitting here, not knowing what to do and what to tell her.

I started thinking of moving to the city where she studies, but I don't know if she would be happy with it.
Another thought I had, was going for a backpacking - trip in Thailand, Laos, etc., because I always wanted to go there and maybe I can forget her while backpacking through the nature.

And the last option is staying where I live, keep working and hoping that she eventually comes back or forgetting about her. The problem about this options is, that I'm not that happy with my current job and I already wanted to quit it, even before this struggles begun.

What would you guys do? I'm thankful for any tip, suggestion or thoughts about it.

PS: sorry for bad English, it's not my mothter tongue ;)",17Aug2019,1

366,"**(WARNING: This is going to be a long one. I will provide a tl;dr at the bottom, if you aren't interested about ALL the details.)**

I have a friend. Let's call this fella Brian for the sake of protecting his identity.

Brian, in a way, is sort of a controversial figure on Twitter. He's not afraid to speak up, and he's not afraid to attack the ""trolls"" and ""snakes"", which I think is just nuts. Sure, justice is nice, but paying attention to them is a terrible idea, from how I see this situation.

So a while back, there were numerous of gimmick Twitter accounts, one of them posted videos of some characters dancing to various songs. It was later supposedly hacked, with various signs pointing to my friend Brian, who I've known for a long time, and who managed the account with a few others for a few months before leaving. Naturally, everyone thought it was him, under this ""guilty before proven innocent"" mentality, because of tweets' relation (tweets mentioning his name, and even deactivating when a specific account is mentioned).

When I was looking for the real hacker, many people have provided video evidence of their confrontation and Brian's attempt to cover it all up in Discord chat rooms. They told me Brian was known to have lied constantly in the past. I sorta believe them now, yes, but I suspect something is up, I still believe he is innocent, because in the end, nobody is the same person as they were a few years ago.

Since then, Brian has constantly ranted about how they have ruined his life, making him do stress eating, by framing him for the hack he supposedly didn't do. (He's had diabetes since he was 9, so this was especially terrifying.) He even sued (or is about to sue) one of the accusers for trying to smear him. I constantly told him to not overthink it, to not even pay attention to them, to move on. And then, I got to know about his love quest.

You see, he is best friends with a girl. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah is a programmer and a big Nintendo fan, the latter just like Brian. So after he told me about this, he told me that Sarah said he is not her *official* boyfriend, meaning that she can't be public about their relationship because otherwise these accusers will harass her. Brian wants to change that, he wants to prove to her that he is trustworthy and can do self control (as in he will not attack the trolls or snakes).

So time passes and I become friends with Sarah, and Brian forces me to pass on his messages and tries to prompt me to bring him up every now and then. After talking to Sarah about me being worried about Brian and his stress eating caused by all of the smearing, we both figured that deactivating his Twitter account is the best choice, for the sake of his health. So last week, I discussed this with him. At first, he was hesitant, but in the end, he accepted. I took over his famous username until he was ready to come back on Twitter. 

In the meantime, while he was deactivated, I helped him code a love letter to Sarah. It was kinda sweet. I don't know if he sent that to her yet. Anyways, back to the drama.

I got a message from one of Brian's ex-friends (John) accusing him of lying about having access to another ex friend (Jim)'s account. The last time Jim has ever hung out with Brian was 2015. Nothing happened. Literally nothing happened, I asked John what happened to make him ""realize"" that one would still have access to that. John repeated himself and I just ignored him after that.

After Brian talked about this whole deactivating thing with Sarah, she said to me that she has no idea of what to do now that he deactivated his Twitter. I mentioned this to him, and he thought it was her... princess calling out for help, that he was actually abandoning her. I said that was total fucking nonescence, he can still talk to her literally everywhere else where they both are (and let me tell ya, he has her added on every possible social media platform).

So he came back and now he is back to ranting about how he can't have nice things and how he can't be left alone. He recently tried getting a picture of a sunset, but it was blocked by trees. I said it was just a shitty angle, she will be okay with it if he sent it to her anyway. He saw it as a sign from God, that he was being told that no, he can't have nice things. (Brian is very overdramatic in general, as I mentioned about his reaction to the accusations and his overpromotion of things like stress eating and not having nice things.)

**TLDR:**

* My friend might have hacked an account
* Everyone hates him
* I may be oblivious
* He's desperately trying to become someone's girlfriend
* I'm helping him do that
* He is overdramatic

**QUESTIONS:**

1. How do I get Brian to stop overthinking about and overreacting to everything?
2. How can he prove himself to be absolutely trustworthy to his... princess? Actually, how can I make him stop using me as his messenger, and be a real man and go talk to her directly?
3. How can I move attention away from him, so that she can finally be public about their relationship?",17Aug2019,1

375,"Alright, so i‚Äôm 21 years old and feel like i‚Äôm in a hole that I can‚Äôt get out of. I know I dug this hole myself and I kick myself for it every minute of every day but I just don‚Äôt know what to do as I grew up in a family that is bad with money.

I guess i‚Äôll start where I started getting some money. I worked at a call center that opened up just 20 minutes away from my small town, which was a miracle because it‚Äôs extremely hard to find any sort of entry level jobs in my area without making an hour commute to work. I worked there for about 6 months and decided to upgrade my car because the one I had was unreliable. I went to a dealership that gave me only two options for a vehicle as I had 0 credit at all, and they were both newer cars and both around $14,000 before interest. I chose one out of excitement which I now know was the biggest mistake I have ever made. I was paying $350 a month for car payments, and $290 a month for full coverage insurance. I thought this would be alright as I loved the car and I was making about $950 a month at the call center and had no other bills to pay at the time. Well, my family dog got sick about 3 months later and I needed some more money quick to pay for her vet bill, or else she‚Äôd be put down so I applied for a credit and got it. (Again my parents are very bad with money as well and no bank would loan them money if their lives depended on it) So I max out the credit to save my dog. I eventually turn 21 and I get a couple large speeding tickets around $300. I also hear a cannabis farm is hiring people for the same amount of money and hours I get at the call center, and it had been about a year working at the call center and it was mentally draining and customer service wasn‚Äôt my favorite thing in the world so I wanted to try something new and go apply. I apply at the farm and they hire me on the spot and want me to start the next day, so again, I made another mistake and left my call center job without notice. Well, only 2 months later the farm closes down because the owner decided my state wasn‚Äôt where the money was at anymore for the cannabis industry and moved to a different state. I was fucked. I still had the tickets that I couldn‚Äôt pay off now that I was unemployed, couldn‚Äôt make car payments, couldn‚Äôt make payments on my credit cards anymore. Worst of all, I re-applied for my call center and they didn‚Äôt even reply. I don‚Äôt blame them. So I can‚Äôt find a job and my car gets repoed and my license gets suspended for not paying the tickets and now I‚Äôm stuck at my moms, jobless, no vehicle, feeling a hell of a lot shittier than I felt working at the call center. I look at indeed every day for jobs in my area, but no luck. Both of my parents have cars but they work full time at their jobs that they‚Äôve had since I can remember and are only off weekends.

I feel so stuck. My dad nags me about getting a job and moving out but I don‚Äôt know where to start. I feel hopeless and like a failure. Being locked here doing nothing but looking after my younger siblings while my parents work their asses off has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I‚Äôve always had anxiety, but now it is 1000x worse, my depression is getting to the point where I feel like there isn‚Äôt anything more to live for and I ran my course and I need to end it. I know, people have it way worse than I do and i‚Äôm grateful I still have a roof over my head and a dinner to eat at night. I just don‚Äôt know how much longer until my dad decides it‚Äôs time I leave and figure it out myself. 

I‚Äôm hoping someone can offer some advice on where to start. I do have an older laptop that works decently well, a nice smartphone, a good hd webcam, I just don‚Äôt know what I can do. Ideally I would like to make enough money at home to get my license back, and I still have my old car that isn‚Äôt exactly reliable but I just need to renew my tabs on it and it will get me places. I just need to make maybe $1000 at home and I will be able to start living again. I have tried doing webcam porn as I am gay and above average on looks, but I don‚Äôt get enough tips worth cashing out.",17Aug2019,1

Lately I have been feeling sad and I have wanted to cry. I can feel tears trying to come but it just wont. Do you understand? It can only be hormones because I am a teenager, but on the internet everyone talk about depression and it has made me think what if it is not just hormones. 

 I have read somewhere that people with depression often don't want to get out of bed. That has happend to me once. It was in the summer holidays and I was laying in bed and I whas thinking: "" what is the point of getting out of bed anyways"". It is not like I am going to do anything productive"" That thought scared me a little bit because I dont want to be depressed. The fear alone that I might have depression made me get out of bed.

Other than those things I am happy. Not bullied. Good friends and my home life is great. But then again my father was depressed a year ago, my sister has anxiety and my mother was also depressed when I was younger. (Post surgery)

So is there anyone out there that can give me a helping hand? Everything helps. If you need more just ask in the comments.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when‚Äôs our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‚Äòmines 21st‚Äô and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‚Äòooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that, I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that‚Äô  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes.

SS18 had been in an apprenticeship since November last year.

On Monday he was sent to get a bottle of milk for the staff break room, when handing the change to the office lady a little bag of pills fell out, it was ecstasy from the weekend. His boss got called in asked what it was and SS18 reply was anxiety medication, so straight away tried to bullshit his way out of it. The boss said if that's the case then he needs to come to work tomorrow with a doctors note. As you can guess he had no note and was let go effected immediately.

On another note with SS18, he has also just gone threw the courts with assault (bottled someone around the head last year at a party). Because of his age at the time he got a smack on the wrist. His boss has been awesome with SS18 even with the assault stuff, really wanted to see him succeed and is really bummed out that this is the outcome. He was also the one to tell SS18 Father on Wednesday.

SS18 had been living with us from the age of 13, he was asked to move out in May this year as he couldn't follow the simple rules of no drugs on the property.

Now the conundrum.

SS18 is 4 weeks ahead in rent and his Father has said to him if he can't find another place in that time or another job he will help him out, meaning he can move in with us. I have tried to get my point across that after all the stuff that has gone on the last couple years SS18 first response was to lie to his boss, I don't trust him around our house and haven't seen an inch of remorse from him and I'm not happy that we didn't have a talk first. I even put it to Husband when does it just become enabling? His response was he has to help him.

I'm all for helping him, we have done in the past but he needs to sort his shit HIMSELF.  
His Father thinks we should help him if he has no where to go after the 4 weeks otherwise he will be on the streets.

I have tried to voice my opinions but apparently I'm the wicked Stepmother who doesn't give a shit about SS18 and what Husband is hearing is if SS18 can't move in then Husband has to move out. This is not the case.

I'm not sure how else to go about this, we are going in circles with the arguing.",17Aug2019,2

My boyfriend‚Äôs dad(40) and I (20) have had a strained relationship for about a year. It started because of a lot of stuff he has said and it has spiraled since then. I am the type to shut down. As soon as I feel tension I just get quiet and pull away to avoid the awkwardness. I can be confrontational if I feel it is worth it, but my default is just to go quiet. 

His dad is very conservative. He basically views women as walking baby makers. He believes they shouldn‚Äôt work and should stay home with the children and a whole bunch of other old fashioned views. He grew up in a different culture so I try not to take it to heart but sometimes it feels like his comments about women are directed at me specifically. One example is he asked my boyfriend and I how much we have spent on a trip so far in a very judge mental way and then makes a comment about how women don‚Äôt know how to save money and they only see short term. 

We are on a three week trip to his home country(I paid for myself). I feel like an outsider because I don‚Äôt speak the language and I have to have everyone translate things for me. I feel like a burden so I am quiet a lot of the time. I know some people take this offensively so I have been trying to make conversation with him even though he doesn‚Äôt reciprocate very much. 

My breaking point: there was a campfire with all of his extended family. I come out and his dad is sloppy drunk and is touching me, hugging me, and picking me just making me very uncomfortable. After about 30 minutes of this my boyfriend comes out and he sits next to me and in front of everyone his dad goes ‚Äúwhy are you always uptight with me?‚Äù In a very loud accusing way. I just stammered and turned red. It felt like everyone was looking at me. Then my boyfriend‚Äôs brother steps in and says ‚Äústop touching her she doesn‚Äôt like that‚Äù and he gets defensive and says that I‚Äôm always like this and he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I walked out. I don‚Äôt want to feel this stress every time I see his dad. I don‚Äôt want to feel like me being me is wrong. I want to cut contact.

Sometimes I am too harsh on myself thinking that I look hideous and I wonder how girls like me. Yesterday, I had received the biggest hit on my confidence. I was talking with my mom and dad, and I asked them to take some pictures of me. They took some pictures, and I looked just horrible, they asked to change my hair direction and they said I look really good with a different hairstyle, but I thought that I look even more horrible. I was pretty photogenic when I was 14 years old and I want to know how can things change in 2 years. I used to look clean and I wasn't even doing much to my face and hair. 1 year ago, I started looking deeper into attractiveness and I developed a face routine and hair routine, always washing my face, moisturizing, and putting some products on my face, because I was obsessed with looking good, as I always thought, if I look good, I will feel good. I always had my hair cut. My overall look is pretty bad in pictures and this insecurity made me look hideous even in the mirror. So, Reddit, I'm asking you. What happened in two years? How am I looking worse than I was looking at 14 years old? I don't have any signs of beard, just moustache yet. What can I do to look good again?

390,"This post is about to describe 3 years about this girl that I like. I remember that I was with a friend in sixth grade (I'm going into 9th now) and I didnt have a phone at the time and my friend had the number of the girl I liked and he was like ""you want me to tell her you like her?"" And I said sure because I thought this wouldnt be screwing every attempt to interact with her in the future.

He tells her and asks her to rate me from 1 out of 10, 1 being she hates me and 10 being she loves me, and 5 being just friends. I got 5. My brother told me that girls that know you like them start to like you a little more over time. That was not the case. My friend gives me her number and since I dont have a phone I talk to her on my moms phone. It was bad. It was really cringey and she said one thing that stood out and I'm not gonna mention, but I ended up blocking the number  because I misunderstood it and didnt talk to her for the rest of the summer.

Fast forward to 7th grade a year that I wish I could erase. I ask her out in the hall and she says she would ask her parents. I wait a week and havent gotten a response from her (I still dont have a phone) my friend goes to her table at lunch and asks her what her answer is and she says ""my parents said no.""

Fast forward to Valentines Day. I hate this holiday.
I have chocolates. I go up to her lunch table and lay the chocolates down in front of her and say ""happy valentines day."" And walk away.
I hate Valentines Day.

Near the end of the school year I ask her for her number (I still dont have a phone) she writes it on her arm and i have my friend save it in his phone for when i get a phone.

On the 2nd to last day of school I pick the most random moment to pretty much shout ""Are you allowed to date yet?"" I get no response and we both go to our classes and see her laughing with her friends quietly while walking away.
I'm so bad at talking to girls.

So its Eighth grade and i have a phone but my friend who saved the number lost it so at the end of the day I go up to her in the hall and ask her for it in front of her friends. It was really bad and probably worse than when I texted her in 6th grade. I haven't talked to her since January 25th.

Occasionally my friends got a hold of my phone and texted her some really dumb things and she never responded and it was probably really annoying to her. I'm about to go into high school and I barely talk to her and I just cant start to become friends with her because it's hard and her knowing I like her is like this wall between me and getting to know her I wanna get over her but I cant stop thinking about her and how bad I've been at every attempt at interacting with her.

At this point I'm convinced she doesnt like me a d have given up but all the other girls at my school are just not like her and I just cant get over her.

So. I never really got friends during middle school. There were people I would hang around with, but we never did stuff together like I wanted, because they were too lazy. I‚Äôm now a senior in high school, and I‚Äôve moved onto a Jope-class, which means less students in a class, and more tight friendships. The main reason I moved was because of the bullying in my normal class. Things like threatening to ‚Äùrape me and have my wolf children‚Äù and ‚Äùsqueeze the fat juices out of my slimy pussy‚Äù.

I really like him, but I feel like as a girl texting a boy for the first time, he‚Äôs gonna catch I like him. Now, this might just be me being paranoid. I‚Äôve been left on read about 6 times from different boys, and if I text him, I fear he‚Äôs going to do that, and it‚Äôs over. Since the class is so tightly together it would become very awkward. But finding even a friend in him would mean a lot to me, and i dont know if its worth the risk. He‚Äôs very nice, but we‚Äôre very different.

However last summer, I worked an internship in a similar field to the job I'm currently applying for. I was going through a break-up that was practically a divorce. My ex was calling non-stop with suicidal threats, graphic images of self-mutilation, and the works. I was emotionally and physically distracted, and I didn't perform to the best of my abilities. Additionally, the organization was not structured for an internship, and with 5 different supervisors, my tasks and responsibilities were too varied to be able to really ""own"" the role (because I never quite understood it, despite asking for feedback). Long-story-short again, I passed the internship but I am confident that I will not be able to use them as a reference.

Sadly, I loved this job and I want to work this job to some degree. I have applied for a similar position, and they requested references. I gave three references, but they've come back saying I need the reference for the above job (the one I am not comfortable giving the contact information for).

So at the risk of being blunt here, I've just been feeling very unmotivated and unintuitive lately.  I'm 16 and during this whole summer, I've just spent time alone watching television, playing videogames, sleeping, basically nothing really to propel myself forward. I've been feeling extremely ashamed of myself and I feel as if I can't muster up the will to change it. 

I'm sure my anxiety and depression have played a part in this as I've been struggling with them mostly since the start of my teen years and recent events in my life haven't helped. However, I'm realizing now that those aren't the only things holding me back. I think I've just been slothful for the sake of it. Things I've put effort into in the past seemed to pass me by and so now I feel as if there's no point in trying anymore. I can't leave the house without feeling as if I'm being judged, I can't read without my brain wandering, and I put no effort into my physical health. 

In spite of all of this, I know I have a problem that needs fixing. I come to conclusions but I just don't think they're working. So I've decided to ask for advice today from Reddit. What basic things should I start and are there general ways I can stop feeling so anxious about trying in the first place?

403,"Hi all, I'm posting here because I have no where else to turn to, I am at a loss.. Allow me to give you a brief overview of my background, and why I believe I am in trouble. I decided to join the Marines at the age of 20 because I lacked confidence and at the time I felt I needed  a change  in life. I've always been to myself when I was little. 

Right now I'm 30 years old. The military gave me structure and I did very well, I decided to leave after 4 years of service to pursue a college degree using my G.I. Bill. My parents are doing well financially, my father did 30 years in the Air force and he is now a physician. He was one of the main reasons I decided to leave the military, he encouraged me to get ""job training"". I don't have the best relationship with my father, it is mostly awkward, but I know he cares and just wants the best for me. I transitioned out of the military in the beginning of 2013, pursued a 2 year degree in business management at a local community college with the intention of transferring my credits to a higher university.

 The G.I. Bill was a cushion. The financial aid was a free check, as  were the loans. I can get up to 10 grand in loans?!  It was easy. Rent was no problem, even with my current live-in girlfriend.  I was living well outside my means, eating out, spending recklessly, knowing the consequences  But it didn't matter at the time , right? Everyone has these problems.. I'll figure it out later.. Eventually I ran out of my G.I. Bill, I am now living in my parents guest house.

I had an old friend from high school who pulled  me into the world of bartending, knowing I lacked certain social skills. Making decent money every night seemed fantastic! Bartending provided me with a new skill set I desperately needed, people skills. Although I did well in community college, as soon as I went to university my grades went to shit. I found myself distracted, for some reason not giving a fuck. I was placed on academic dismissal after 2 regrettable  semesters.

I Ended up applying to another university and did well in the summer semester, bombed the fall and spring semester..   
Since then, I've been feeding my parents bullshit, and I'm tired of it. Long story short I'm over 50k in debt from student loans I didn't even use to pay for school because I had the GI bill. Hitting the accept award button, it's almost like an additive drug, hard to say no.  

  
Currently I have about 96 credits towards a degree in  computer information systems in business but my  institutional GPA is so shit.. My G.I. bill is exhausted since I changed degrees a few times... I'm embarrassed to tell my family the truth but I can't sign up for fall semester because I'm on academic dismissal. Any advice would be  appreciated.

I was at university last year, and there was a girl called R who was about to get into a relationship with a guy friend of mine who was a real manipulative and abusive dickhead. At the time I also had a bit of a crush on R, and asked her drunkenly (i.e stupidly) if she had a crush on this guy, she did, and I told her that maybe she should be careful bc he could be v cruel and maybe she should be careful, alongside drunkenly blurting out that I also had a bit of a crush on her. Yeah I threw him under a bus but honestly he was a real piece of work, really nasty. She didn't respond well to that though, and I embarrassed myself and apologised to her later. They went out for a bit but he was v horrible to her and they broke up soon after.

Fast forward a couple of months and my different friend, P, asked what I thought about whether he should ask her out. I realised I had messed up my shot at it, and I want my friends to be happy so I told him to go for it. Things went well and they are in a relationship now, but over time hanging out with them or in group settings with them is just beginning to get really painful for me, I thought my crush had passed but it seems to keep rearing its ugly head, and its tough bc I love my friend so much but being around them together just feels constantly like a small knife in my back. Every time they're intimate in a group setting it just hurts seeing it, not really out of jealousy more out of it reminding me of my failures and how things could have been different. It's not good to live in the past but also it's hard to ignore when the person in question is constantly still in your area reminding you of this.

I have been really trying to get over it, to work this out of my system but it just keeps hanging about. I'm travelling out to see P soon, and I want to tell him its bothering/hurting me, but if I tell him that it would just basically be telling him to break up with her bc what other options are there once I let him know this? Like I can't unopen pandora's box about it, and I imagine it would create some kind of rift between us. Plus he's not going to break up with her bc of me bc it's dumb for me to put that pressure on him. But I'm worried that if their relationship only deepens this might only grow into more of a problem for me, maybe it'll fade over time but maybe not. I don't know, I'm just at a crossroads about it. Do I just keep it silent? If I do talk to P, what do I say and how would I frame it?

&amp;#x200B;

The truth (from her point of view at least) is that she has fallen victim when her boyfriend borrowed some money from my friend for some false purpose, when it turned out that the Boyfriend used it to buy gift cards. That's all I know from her.

&amp;#x200B;

She is in a dilemma whether to call the police on her BF or not, and she asked me for advice. Her BF is one of her best friends after me, and she doesn't want a (possible) conviction of his to ruin their mutual relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The amount is not too significant (just around 100-200 USD), she doesn't want to go thru the hassle (I **personally** think the cops might not deal with it either).

&amp;#x200B;

She is torn on this, and she asked me for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, **will the cops find out by themselves by monitoring the BF's records, without any external ""tips"" from me or my friend?** Will the cops need a reasonable doubt to exercise their inquisitive powers?

Also, remember I said that the Boyfriend is a Redditor? My friend is wondering if she were to tell the cops about her BF's Redditing record, and possibly the ones related to Support chat (no more no less), which she herself doesn't know about, **will he get busted all the same?**

I have chocolates. I go up to her lunch table and lay the chocolates down in front of her and say ""happy valentines day."" And walk away.
I hate Valentines Day.

Near the end of the school year I ask her for her number (I still dont have a phone) she writes it on her arm and i have my friend save it in his phone for when i get a phone.

On the 2nd to last day of school I pick the most random moment to pretty much shout ""Are you allowed to date yet?"" I get no response and we both go to our classes and see her laughing with her friends quietly while walking away.
I'm so bad at talking to girls.

So its Eighth grade and i have a phone but my friend who saved the number lost it so at the end of the day I go up to her in the hall and ask her for it in front of her friends. It was really bad and probably worse than when I texted her in 6th grade. I haven't talked to her since January 25th.

Occasionally my friends got a hold of my phone and texted her some really dumb things and she never responded and it was probably really annoying to her. I'm about to go into high school and I barely talk to her and I just cant start to become friends with her because it's hard and her knowing I like her is like this wall between me and getting to know her I wanna get over her but I cant stop thinking about her and how bad I've been at every attempt at interacting with her.

What should I do about it I'm really lonely and scared about what I would do in high school about it. Any advice is greatly appreciated just please help out fellow teenagers who may have any experience int this area.",17Aug2019,5

419,"Hi, I am a (just turned) 19 yo male.. (relatively poor family)

Every year, on my birthday, I want to be left alone more than the rest of the year; I want the people who know me to stop wishing me; I want to stop receiving a ""surprise"" cake which has all the traits of my favoutite cake when I was a kid.

My parents and brother keep making such an effort to make me happy at least on this day, but this worsens everything instead as they want to see me happy.

Now that I finally embraced and adapted to my ""lack"" of basic wants and needs, why am I being treated so differently by people?

On this day, everything and everyone I know makes me suffer more... so I override a sunny day with the help of sad piano music with rain sounds..

My Manager started out being really nice to me, but over the last 2 weeks she has become aggressive. Here are some examples:

- When I looked at the dockets to see how far away an order is I got told off for being in the way. She told me to learn to use the screen. I learn to use the screen, and then one day it crashes and she points at me from across the room and tells me ‚Äúnot to touch it again‚Äù even though I didn‚Äôt cause the crash. Now I have no way to tell customers how far away there orders are. 
- She doesn‚Äôt look me in the eye or say my name. She just says ‚Äúcan you do the floor‚Äù but without addressing, looking or pointing at me so I have no idea if she‚Äôs talking to me. When I‚Äôm making something to help somebody and she comes to take me over she‚Äôs says ‚Äúyou can go now bye‚Äù without looking at me.
- She ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to write my name on for breaks so I only got one in the last 45 minutes of my shift. She never apologised or looked at me when a coworker pointed out she‚Äôd forgotten. Instead my coworker apologised to me.
- I heard her (we were in the same 1m by 1m room) say ‚Äòpeople who are on tills tonight are either new or don‚Äôt know how to do anything else‚Äô. I was the only non-new person on tills tonight. I also once overheard her say ‚Äòeverybody is fucking useless they should just quit their jobs‚Äô. While I was sitting in the same room.

453,"I'm a 30yo man who's never given any consideration to kids or family. In my previous relationship we said we'd never have any but we were probably just young. That ended a couple of years ago.¬†


Enter my new girlfriend (30f) of 6 months. She already has 2 children who I haven't met yet. They have a great dad and she's not looking for a step dad for them. They haven't featured in our time together at all.


We've had the usual honeymoon phase. Lots of time spent together getting loved up and things have been going great. Until recently I'm suddenly the broodiest man in the world. Out of nowhere I want kids, I see them and smile. I'm picturing a life with my new gf where we have kids of our own, including hers. We do family days out, have dinner together, all that stuff. The problem here is that it's become incredibly overpowering.


Yesterday I spoke with her about it and we have touched on it before. She said she's open to the idea of more children she just can't definitively say yes she definitely wants more in the future but she also said its definitely not a no. She's just a bit in limbo, needs some time. That sort of thing. I'm not suggesting we have kids, I'm just wanting to know if it can be an option for the future.


The problem here is that when I hear her say ""It's definitely not a yes"" it's like a dagger is driven through my chest. Like I'm being told I can't be happy and can't have what I want. But that's not it all, I know her hesitancy is purely circumstantial and nothing to do with me. I've even said it's only been 6 months, a lot needs to happen before we can have these talks properly.¬†


However I can't change the fact it's now the main focus in my head. I know it's not logical. My logical brain is telling me not to worry. Cultivate this relationship first into a caring and loving one and worry about this stuff later. As a man, I've got time. The emotional part of me is getting incredibly upset. To the point where I can't even look at other people's children or hear about them because the pain of being told I might not be able to have my own with her is too great.


How can I temper this? I've gone from not caring about something to having it be my overriding emotion on everything. I spoke to a friend and he said I was just hormonal, he experienced a similar thing and it'll pass. I'm just struggling right now and wonder whether anyone has any advice for broody guy.¬†",17Aug2019,5

I live with my father, my step-mother, and my step-sister. I'm very depressed and have extreme anxiety when it comes to social interaction (I'm getting better with other people and strangers, but I still have not gotten better with my father, despite me living with him). My father takes care of the bills in the house and my step-mother takes care of the groceries, food, or basic things we need like shampoo, what I have noticed though is every single time they go out to buy food they always either hide the snacks, or take it to their room, now this wouldn't hurt me as much as it would because I can honestly understand this, the thing that hurts is that they only hide it from me, they share the snacks with my step-sister, they even wrap some snacks up and put her name on it just so I don't eat it, It may not be that big of a deal, it's just like the meaning behind what's going on, I wouldn't care about the food, they just do this without me. Every time I leave the house either to go to a friends house or just go somewhere else for the day, they will go out and do things like watch a movie or do activities, it just really feels like they wait until I'm gone and take my step-sister out with them. They also will go out and buy fast food and won't get me anything, I will come into the living room and see bags of things like Wendys, and other different fast foods, again it really isn't about the food, I just feel super disconnected from my family, I don't ever leave my room unless it's the occasional bike ride, or friends house trip, etc. I'm only 16, and going to high school, I'm also trying to get a job so I can start supporting my self, but I just feel so alone.

So because of that he has low bedroom confidence and we have never had much sex. 
In the beginning I took it very personally and figured he was just using me so he wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. I wanted flirting and foreplay and sex and also the non-sexual stuff a relationship offers. I never thought a man wouldn‚Äôt want sex much especially with someone he loves. (Been together a year now.) But he also doesn‚Äôt really bother with foreplay and definitely no oral... ugh. 

We‚Äôve had a hell of a year, arguments over stupid shit. He flips out at stuff just to apologize once he has calmed down. It‚Äôs hard to just be okay after he‚Äôs flipped out. 

A little back story on our fights, he lied to me about many things I caught him in. 

Idk what to do... I love the guy and he‚Äôs come a long way. But I hear you‚Äôre never supposed to fix  someone in a relationship. I don‚Äôt know if I did, or if I should stay. Am I a fool to stay or is this the exception.",17Aug2019,1
458," i am gonna explain it briefly. this instagram accound: yonald\_mario posts stuff like people getting stabbed, shot and run over and i keep reporting it, over and over but it is apparently not against the terms of service to post a video of someone getting shot in the head, point blank and seeing the blood leak out of his head.. i have reported many of his posts but instagram does nothing exept remove the post i was talking about. as i said, the video of the guy getting shot has since been removed but the guy posts plenty of bulls\*it.

459,"I‚Äôve been delaying this day for a very long time. I always disregard it because I know that it‚Äôll make me feel weird.

I‚Äôve liked this girl (I am also girl) for quite a long time now and she‚Äôs also been my friend for a few years, I‚Äôm attracted to everything about her and I just can‚Äôt deny it any longer. She‚Äôs currently in a relationship with a great friend of mine (also girl) and I love them both very very much. 

I miss her and look for her all the time and I feel happy when I‚Äôm with her and when I hold her hand (because we are good friends and friends do that hahaha pls don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm stealing her). She‚Äôs the sweetest and cutest thing ever. I‚Äôm still very new to the concept of liking someone because I‚Äôve always thought it was a waste of time and look at me now. 
I just think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs pretty sad that I realized my feelings too late.

If you could give me any advice on how I can completely get rid of these feelings I would very much appreciate it, thank you.",17Aug2019,1
460,"So, when I see people on the streets or online, I don't think anything about them or their looks. I'm not trying to be holy, the majority of the time I just look at people and nothing goes through my head. Not if they are attractive, not if they are unattractive, not anything. If someone is wearing something that reminds me of specific things, I'll notice. If they have a haircut I been thinking about getting, then I'll notice. If someone has an attitude, then I notice.
But besides that, I never really think about other people's appreance. I do however think I know what the majority would find attractive and think - and I'm often left with, ""that's probably what they think if they see this person"". 

I do however get attracted to people based on the connection I have with them.
Like, we need to be on the same vibe or I need to find them interesting or intriguing for me to get physically attracted to them. And that goes for all genders. 

Fx I'm seeing a guy and I don't find anyone else attractive, I think he's the most beautiful human being alive, but I know (because we've talked about it) what he likes in women, so I'll think ""He would think she has the perfect hair"" or ""she's wearing the kind of underwear he finds hottest"".
I do it with friends also, ""if she was here, she would think he's hot"", based on what she has told me. 

I need advice because I feel I can't have a relationship, ever, because I'll always worry what the other person thinks about the people passing through the streets or on the internet. I'm not calling anyone superficial or anything, I just have a huge problem because I can't relate or understand it - and that's on me, there's nothing wrong with thinking someone is ""hot"" or not so attractive from their perspective, I know.
But I honestly don't know what to do with myself, I get these episode where I just... kind of panic to the core... Because I feel so insecure and insignificant. I know there's always going to be prettier and nicer and everything else than me and I'm okay with that, it's just the knowing - I guess I'm just terrified about not being good enough.

Thanks for reading through my novel. 
What do you think I should do, change or think?",17Aug2019,1
461,"My wife‚Äôs ex-husband is moving to another state for a job. The ex-husband has a 15 year-old son that my wife helped raise while she was married to her ex (my wife is not biologically related to the son and has no guardianship rights). My wife loves and cares deeply about the boy and is concerned about his well being in a new big city with no support network except for his father.

The boy‚Äôs father has said in the past that he wishes he never had the son; he is an absent and distant father who doesn‚Äôt really invest in his son‚Äôs life beyond putting a frozen pizza in the oven every once and while. The ex looks for every opportunity to pass off the responsibility for his son onto any family member or ex that he can guilt-trip into helping him out. And he knows how to guilt trip my wife.

That said, my wife and I have his son over at our house 2 or 3 nights a week just to try and give the boy a normal-ish life.

The ex claims he can barely afford to move to the new state, and he needs somewhere for his son to stay until he gets a few paychecks and gets settled (about 3 months).

I‚Äôm concerned that 3 months will turn into 3 years because the ex has repeatedly demonstrated that he‚Äôs lazy and selfish, and not really interested in being a father (the boy‚Äôs biological mom is a drug addict who hasn‚Äôt seen the boy since he was 2 years old, so that‚Äôs not an option).

I‚Äôm okay with helping out for a few months, but my wife has also said she would be happy to have him in our home for 3 years if that‚Äôs what it took to help the son. I‚Äôve told her this is not okay with me for two reasons:

1. I feel like we‚Äôre being taken advantage of, and that we are bearing the brunt of responsibility for her ex‚Äôs poor decisions. We have no legal rights, and we would be inviting her ex‚Äôs direct influence and power into our home and marriage.

2. My wife and I are recently married and want to start our own family soon. We‚Äôre both excited to start trying, and I think this will be added and unnecessary stress in our home.

My wife is the kind of person who wants to save every lost and hurt animal she finds, and she is extremely loyal to who she loves, both of which are big reasons that I love her. She‚Äôs focused on the ex‚Äôs son, and I‚Äôm focused on our new family. I really don‚Äôt want to raise a teenager who doesn‚Äôt share the values and beliefs that I do, especially when he has a father who can and should. The son has almost failed school for the last three years and had chronic poor-behavior and discipline issues in class. He squeaks by with a combination of D‚Äôs and make-up summer school classes. The son consistently lies about anything school and behavior related, and consistently stresses my wife out to her absolute limits. She holds on because she herself had a rough childhood, and she wishes there was an adult in her childhood that cared as much about her as she cares about this boy. Psychologically, I think she‚Äôs trying to rescue the little lost girl in herself.

This is one side of the story, I‚Äôve tried to be fair... am I being unreasonable or unsympathetic? What should I do? I don‚Äôt want her ex‚Äôs son in our home for the next 3 years.",17Aug2019,0

463,"Tl;dr - temporary manager has a reputation for being blunt, but his email to me made both me and my coworker go ‚Äúyikes, that‚Äôs rude‚Äù. What do I do?

22/F, I got my degree a year or so ago and about a month ago got a really exciting job using that degree. I heard about the job through a friend I made in university (we‚Äôll call her F).

My actual boss in my division seems lovely, no problems at all with him. But for the first two months I‚Äôm on loan to the division my friend is in. The boss for that division (let‚Äôs call him J) is in another state, and basically oversees and doles out tasks via regular Skype meetings.

On the first week I worked there I was given a task to do, picking it up mid-project, and no real documents for it. F explained what she knew about it, but I didn‚Äôt get a link to the actual written info until the next week. That meant that I didn‚Äôt make any useful progress on it in the first week (2 days as I am part time). F warned me to prepare myself and that J can be blunt.

J was irritated at the wasted time, which was fair. He berated me for not going through the documents thoroughly. I figure he doesn‚Äôt like dealing with fresh-out-of-graduation workers, but that‚Äôs the way it is. The next week I trawled through the documents and made a summary sheet for future workers/practical steps for the task, as I had been told to. I had a few notes in the document re: questions.

In the meeting where we discussed that, J gave me good advice and I felt hey, he‚Äôs blunt but it‚Äôs a dumb mistake and I won‚Äôt make it again now. I don‚Äôt think F informed him that she failed to give me the documents, but it also doesn‚Äôt make that much of a difference - I should‚Äôve asked for them.

The project involves some encryption and I asked if there was any info on what key to use for decryption. I meant in a general sense, did it need to be set to a specific default? How often do we expect it to change?

J emailed back with just a quote of my question, and a screenshot of the simulator, highlighting the field where you can set the key to use, with question and exclamation marks highlighted around it.

It‚Äôs pretty clear he thinks I‚Äôm a moron (after 4 total working days) and I want to know what‚Äôs the best way to handle it. I feel like there is a difference between ‚Äúblunt‚Äù and that email. 

F suggested speaking to a different, higher-up person about J being too rude, but I‚Äôm not keen to start at a new company by going over my boss‚Äôs head to complain about him to his boss. But he is also not my permanent manager, so the backfire could be a bit limited. And I‚Äôd also like to not be walked all over just because I had one mistake and one unclear question within my first 4 days of work.",17Aug2019,1
464,"So basically me and my friends drank and were drunk, not black out drunk or anything but were drunk having fun. I sent some snapchats to some friends, I decided to do a cigar with my friends and sent some videos to some people of me doing it, which yes I get it I‚Äôm stupid for even like sending the video in the first place, but we were all legally smoking it so it‚Äôs not an issue really.My boyfriend smokes cigars every once in a while when he drinks with friends, I hate it for the most part but decided to give one a try with my female friends so I could have an open mind. But I sent one to a guy (we will call Alex)who is sort of a friend and decided to take a screen recording of me smoking a cigar, this guy always does this type of shit where he tries taking footage of people in their worst moments, I told him he can have the footage idc but don‚Äôt go showing my mother this shit. I barely even talk to him that often anymore but if worst came to worst he can show everyone if he wants, he can show my mom show everyone etc. I‚Äôm not smoking weed or doing anything illegal.

467,"It‚Äôs not often I‚Äôm asked, maybe once every couple months as they go on weekend trips here and there. 
The reason why they want someone to housesit is that they have three dogs that they don‚Äôt trust to be alone for extended periods of times. Which I understand. What I don‚Äôt understand is the need for them to be watched 24/7.

When they leave, they crate one of the three so that he won‚Äôt get into anything. It‚Äôs also weird to me because none of them are puppies anymore and there‚Äôs nothing to even really chew up. The house is very clean and they have plenty of toys, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff on the ground they can get into. I can understand crating a puppy but he‚Äôs at least two now and potty trained. 

According to them he can be in his crate for a max of two hours. He gets stir crazy in there so that‚Äôs the max.

So on these weekends I housesit, it is heavily discouraged that I leave their house for any reason, but if I must, then I have to be back within two hours. 

I live 25 minutes away. I hate to be selfish but there‚Äôs still stuff I need and like to do on my own weekends. I work hard during the week. I really like my weekends. 
They think it‚Äôs like a fun and easy gig for me because all it entails is sitting in their house and playing with their dogs. This is far from fun to me. They don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs actually kind of asking a lot of me. I have my OWN dogs at home. I want to spend time with my SO at home, clean my own house, get my laundry ready for the upcoming week, etc. It‚Äôs frustrating to know that during the work week you have nothing to look forward to when it comes to your days off. 

I got here at 6am today (Saturday) and am going to have to stay here until tomorrow evening when they fly back in. 

Last time they didn‚Äôt pay me, this time they paid me $150. Money isn‚Äôt an issue for them, hence them always going out of town whenever they feel like it. I don‚Äôt feel like $150 is worth wasting two days of my time. (That‚Äôs also nothing where we live in northern CA.) Like it‚Äôs better than nothing but to be honest I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough. 

I really dislike doing this. I‚Äôve suggested taking the dogs up to my own house, but my parents aren‚Äôt comfortable with the idea of their dogs being in  the new environment.

I‚Äôm the only local family that can do this as well. They don‚Äôt have friends and have burned bridges with the neighbors so it‚Äôs all on me to do it. 

I don‚Äôt know. Do I have any option here? Or do I have to keep doing this? Am I being selfish?",17Aug2019,2
468,"My best friend is really weird when it comes to doing stuff over a long time. 

An example would be video games. It's impossible to play video games with her, because she always deleted her character and makes a new one. I tried to play MMO's with her but it's literally not possible. As soon as we hit level 4 or 5 she deletes her character and wants to start a new one.

Same with her hair. She colors it in a new color everytime she sees somebody and thinks it looks good. Sometimes multiple times a week. 

Or with paintings. She draws a lot of things, usually a few hours a day, but I think in the entire 7 years I know her she finished maybe 6 or 7 drawings. Everytime she has a new idea she throws the picture she was just painting away.

In the past two weeks she turned. She's been getting snappy and recently she called all the managers in the state telling them that I clocked out 5 minutes early trying to make a case against me to get me fired (I only found out after one of the told me) but then acted as if nothing happened to my face.

I asked her why and she said that the regionals substitute did it (who's only here for a few days) but after I asked for more info she said I'm not going to be working there again and will be replaced.

478,"So I was at the supermarket earlier today with my brother. We were getting shopping for our grandad.

I leave the shops and go back to the car. As I get in and buckle up like a good buckaroo, we start to slowly reverse (I am talking a quarter of walking pace, so slow it would be measured in metres per hour, forget miles)

&amp;#x200B;

The back left sensor goes off, there's a tall, fairly well built mid 20's kid walking about 2 feet behind the car at a sloths pace... I notice he's staring into the car and I break eye contact and then regain to see if he's trying to stare me down. At which point he flicks his arms out with that ""come on then"" attitude and starts walking towards the car.

&amp;#x200B;

I unbuckled, got out of the car... I wasn't waiting to find out what the idiot was going to do if he reached the car before I got out.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask him what his problem is and he says that I nearly ran him over (I am in the passenger seat, this genius stares me down and says I nearly ran him over and then tries to lord over me with false aggression until I react) There's an argument that ensues. He mentions my lazy eye and the fact that I have ""ginger complex"" (yes I have a lazy eye and I am ginger) I remind him he was the one who beckoned me out of the car. I call him a fat c\*nt and tell him I'll knock his fucked up teeth out (feeling I have to say something back to the obvious insults from him)

&amp;#x200B;

At this stage I realised he wasn't going to hit me, I am not stupid (some of you will beg to differ I assume) I know not to throw the first punch but I put my hands in my pockets to try and give him the opportunity to start the fight with an advantage, I wanted to hit the guy pretty badly at this stage. My brother had stepped in the way and I realise when something isn't going anywhere and we went to get in the car again.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the driver in the car he was returning to got out and said he was going to kick the shit out of me. I got back up walked between them both and said come on then. He quickly put his coat back on and got in his car. (Probably after he realised how big my brother was) The lad who started it all chimes in with take a leaf out of his book and calm down. (Meaning my brother who had said, it was an accident we didn't hit you and that it was him who should have some self awareness) At which point I again remind him that he was the one who came towards me, until I got out of the car. He was also the one careless enough to walk literally 2 feet behind a car that could reverse at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is I watched my brother checking behind, this guy came out of a blind spot and we were going a snail's pace. As soon as the sensors went off my brother stopped. No one was hurt and I feel this guy thought my break in eye contact was a sense of weakness on my part, making me a pushover...

&amp;#x200B;

No punches were thrown, though I have had a few hours to calm down and I am still far from being able to relax.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the way I reacted acceptable? I mean I wasn't trying to instigate anything right up until I thought the guy was getting aggressive. I don't ever like the idea of hitting someone first but that's the closest I have ever been. The guy was trying to make me feel small by pointing out flaws I can't do shit about and it just reminded me of the stuff I put up with in school.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day it was an accident where no one was hurt, why does he have to be an asshole about it.

I'm not sure what it is that keeps me unmotivated to do some of the things I want to do. I have no trouble motivating myself to play games, in fact I can play games for quite a long time. But when it comes to anything that I deem as work I can't seem to get myself to do it.

482,"I graduated as an undergrad cs guy last year and started working at a company immediately after. I'm still working there at the moment. The problem at my work isn't too serious but because I think I have a lot of social anxiety already, I've gotten myself into a very weird state of mind and it's become very toxic. So the problem is of my making but I'm now unable to fix or solve it. I NEED advice please. 

So the owner of the company lives abroad and I had never met him when I was hired. Six months after having joined the company, he happened to visit the country and all of us new recruits got to meet him and it was all great. I guess he saw some potential in me so he decided to switch me from the project I was assigned to initially (which I didn't really like btw) to another project. The new project was AMAZING. It was in python (programming language) and I genuinely enjoyed it. I worked on the project alone, and the guy who I worked with happened to be a friend of the owner and he worked in a pretty big place somewhere else in another country. 

The issue is this: I worked on the fun project for a little less than 4 months and I got to learn a lot and improved my skills immensely. Unfortunately the guy I was working for on the new project kind of let me go. He did in a super nice way and I genuinely have no issue with it all. However, when it ended, I got super depressed. Like immensely. For some reason I could not get over it. It's been 3 months since then and I still haven't gotten over it. 

Here's how the problem is manifesting into actually super horrible situations for me though. After my project ended, 2 weeks after that, the owner of the company happened to visit the country again and met all of us in the office. When he met me, I being super depressed, simply did not have the control to meet him nicely and kind of just greeted him in a fairly forced and ungrateful way.

And during he whole time he happened to be in the country, I went out of my way to avoid him completely. Now what can I do? I feel like I've ruined my prospect of progressing within the company and the fact that I'm still so depressed and my actions because of my sadness cause me to behave in ways that pull me further down, I don't know how to get over this. The new project I'm on is pretty trash to me as well. I went out of my way then to text the boss to ask him if I did something wrong with the guy who I worked with prior to know if there were any issues I could resolve to which the boss replied I did great and that he would have a coffee meeting with me when he came back to the country. Now, the boss happened to visit the country and stayed and left and during the whole time he avoided me completely and didn't even meet me. How should I react to that as well.

I feel absolutely hopeless and feel like there is nothing interesting or fun that I will be able to work on ever. I feel like because of my attitude, I will only get fired sooner or later. So should I just bite the bullet and resign?",17Aug2019,1

Okay so we started the adoption process for her when she was only 3 months old, She is actually my cousin but we took her into my family after my uncle and his girlfriend Could not control there Drug Habits, She was born addicted to Heroin.

now she is almost 5 and after years of going to court, the parents not once testing clean for any drug test the whole time we finally have fully adopted her and she is now Legal family.

I am so happy and love her as my sister, I'm glad she gets to be in a better environment but often I am being put in situations that make me really uncomfortable and seeing behavior that i am not sure is normal for a kid as I would not know only being seventeen.

And she only acts this way towards the men in the house, (me and my stepdad) we will be taking showers and she will walk in and try to say she didnt know we were in there and will get Naked and come into my room asking me to help her get dressed, often when we go into the bathroom she will try to walk in on us. Today as I was watching her while parents are at work she came out the bathroom with her underwear down to her thighs and Kept asking me to help her cause she ""couldn't pull them up"" and I honestly wanted to throw tf up like Is this all just a coincidence  or what because It is making me feel weird to even be alone with her and I just feel being a Male in society today I am not trying to be around her alone and have my mom thinking I'm a pedophile or somthing because even me and my mom have talked about it her behavior and it wierds her out to, even as I'm writing this right now, still watching her she is laying down on the couch across the living room on her stomach with her hands under by her Private parts and like dry humping the couch. 

I honestly dont see anyway she could be being sexually abused because she is always home with my mother, sleeps with my mother, My stepdad is never home Because he works 24/7 and when he is he just sleeps in his room with the door locked. She goes to daycare but all the workers are female and I personally know them. So what could explain this sort of activity?",17Aug2019,2
487,"So... This is a long story.

My husband is perfect. 

His old friend (a man) was in love with him and made it clear from how bad he hated me. They fell out and didn't speak for years. 
Got back in contact a year ago. Husband is now on his phone a lot, taking sudden long trips to see his old friend, and when we were all together for a music festival he insisted on having time totally alone with his friend (who is engaged to a man). 

A couple weeks back I went to use his computer in his home office for work, and I clicked the wrong file. 

It opened up a pornographic video of my husband and this other man together, recording themselves having sex. 

It's very old, more than a 15 years old video which I know because they look the way they did as teens and I recognise his mom's old house, but he's clearly been watching it because it's in his recently viewed section. There might be more but I was so upset I shut the file and left the room before he got back.

He has social media accounts where he talks to this friend but he always logs out every time he puts his phone down or leaves the computer so he must be hiding more. 
I'm a wreck, but I love him so much and he's so sweet and loving to me and our family. I don't want to leave him. What do I do? Do I confront his friend? Tell the friends fiance his guy is a cheater? Do I find his password and log in, get proof he's cheating? 

I've been married for over 10 years. My husband is the best, sweetest, funniest man I've ever met, and so incredible. I feel like I'm in a dream with him. He's an incredible father, treats his stepson and our little one like they're both his own, and the kids love him. 
I don't want to leave him. Please help.",17Aug2019,5
488,"Hello,

Thank you for being here. Allow me to give some context for the question in the title, and the reasons I have been torn between the two.

I am turning eighteen in mid-November. I want out of my parents' house. My whole life, they have been extremely manipulative of my thoughts and feelings, controlling, and selfish. They forced me to go to church up until a few weeks ago, even after I told them I was not a believer and I did not like listening to the same sermons over and over again. They did not listen. And after I am independent from them, I will never speak to them again.

Also against my will, they forced me to be a homeschool student forever. I told them how much I wanted to go to regular school like a normal kid, but they would just respond with: ""you are such a spoiled brat. We are just setting you up for success."" How do you even respond to that?

Anyway, back to the matter at hand, I am debating whether or not I should move out when I turn eighteen, live off of my $7,000 savings (which I have earned every penny from my part-time job), my car (which I bought used, and paid for all maintenance and insurance) until I can get my G.E.D. and apply to a college. My job consistently pays me about 1k a month, and though I don't know of any friends I could move in with, a quick look on Craigslist shows me I could rent out someone's spare room for about $500 a month.

I have a high GPA, 28 ACT score, and I would really like to go to a four-year university to get a Bachelor's in either Business Management/Administration or Computer Science.

I do apologize for the massive wall of text.",17Aug2019,2

490,"Hi, 

I want to get to know my grandfather, hes very old but still healthy. To say the least, I was never in his interests, there was a span of 5 years where I didnt see him and my uncle at all and they didnt call, so I left them for dead out of anger. All the men on my fathers side are very weird, avoidant, distant and have no family bonding.

My grandfather didnt treat me well when I was a kid, I could feel the animosity, now he avoids being around me out of shame, he will say any transparent excuse to leave as quickly as possible.Summer time he comes over at our house to give us a bag of vegetables, he actually doesnt get in, he drops them at the gate so he can leave as quickly as possible avoiding contact with anybody. I want to call him to break the distance, I want to talk to him, only me and him, but he is so elusive.

492,"I have been a high school teacher from a very young age- I started when I was 23, and even still at 31 I get told I look young for my age.

Very frequently, when I tell people I teach high school, I get comments along the lines of ""Oh wow, I would have LOVED to have a teacher that looked like you when I was a boy"" or ""I bet the boys all have crushes on you!"", and even comments that go so far as to either imply my inability to maintain respect in my classroom like ""Wow, do your students ask you out/hit on you all the time?"" or ""Oh I bet those boys get pretty distracted with you around!"", like I can't have basic control over a classroom while performing my job.

It's not always men either- it's often women making statements like this.

It always makes me feel diminished- like somehow my body and my gender are perceived as obstacles to me being successful in my job. But people seem to think they're giving me some great compliment by implying I'm 'too attractive' to be able to do my job.

Also- I am a DAMN good teacher. I work hard at what I do and I see results, and this feels like it chips away at that just a little.

Firstly, let me clarify that I dress modestly and respectfully- I don't show cleavage or leg above the knee, I don't wear super tight clothing- I work hard to make sure my clothing is above reproach in any 'sexual' way. I dress fairly casual- knee-length a-line dresses or cardigans and slacks or jeans- not 'office' friendly but very teacherly, in a way that mirrors colleagues' level of dress. I am proportioned with curves- but I can't help the size of my breasts or hips, and I work to make sure they aren't being 'displayed' sexually in a way that is unbecoming to a setting meant for learning.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly- my appearance has NEVER actually caused any problems at all! I never have classroom management issues- never have uprisings of drives of students clamoring for me or saying inappropriate things. My classroom has a very intentionally-fostered environment of mutual respect.

&amp;#x200B;

Comments like this create a lit of difficulties for girls and women on a regular basis and can be damaging to their sense of self, as they constantly get told that their appearance and sexual function are primary modes of being female, and part of my goal as a teacher is to make the world better for my students, for the girls I teach and hope to grow confidence within. I want to help steer the world away from comments like this when I can.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I respond to them politely in a way that expresses my discomfort and frustration, so that they can maybe see the problem with commentary like this, how it affects women to hear things like this? I want to be kind, but I want to maybe make them consider what they say to other women going forward? They don't mean to be diminishing- but comments like this have to stop being so common in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- How do I politely respond to people implying that my appearance and gender detract from my ability to be a teacher? (More for posterity even than my own sake)",17Aug2019,27

What else could have I done ?

I fell for her and it is what it is.
I am saying this because a few of mates told me that you cannot say this to her..bla bla bla.

508,"I grew up on Long Island, NY in a nice quiet town. A little over 3 years ago, right after I graduated from college, my parents moved to Maine. It's a gorgeous area, really close to Acadia National Park. But I stayed behind because at the time I had a girlfriend of 4 years, and I'm an artist so it felt like a good call to stay close to the galleries and museums. 

Since the break-up with my ex about 2 years ago, I've been moving around from neighborhood to neighborhood in Brooklyn, and hopping between jobs. Nowheres really felt like home but the city does have its conveniences. But I'm starting to feel like there's no point being here anymore. 

I'm not making a living off my art, and working 40 hours/weeks doesn't leave much time at all to paint and try to improve myself. My savings account has also been steadily dwindling to the point that I don't have much to fall back on, and the idea of just quitting everything and moving back with my parents is sounding really nice. At least until I figure out my next move. 

At the same time, I know I'm romanticizing that a bit.

510,"I had an insane day yesterday and am having trouble wrapping my head around it.

I woke up to several missed calls from my dad and brother. The messages were vague, but they seemed upset. 

I called my dad and he tells me to call my brother. He said my brothers story was more important. 

I call my brother and he‚Äôs bawling on the phone. That‚Äôs not at all like him, but after a couple of minutes he composed himself enough to speak. 

He tells me that he‚Äôs going to beat the shit out of my wife‚Äôs brother. These are both guys in their 40s, my brother is about 6 years older. 

He proceeds to tell me that while he was in camp for a month away from his family that he had some random girl add him on Facebook. He said she claimed to know him from school. He asked for a picture since her profile was blank. She sent back a picture of her nude but covering herself with her hands. My brother said that they flirted at that point. It was just a few texts that he knew was wrong, and he regretted it. 

He stopped talking to her, and 5 minutes later she wrote him and said that her roommate knows his wife. Before he could respond she blocked him. 

He was still out of town for another day and was planning on having a talk with his wife about this when he got home. They were already struggling with the long distance, but were in counselling to work on it. 

When he got home, his wife was gone. He spoke to her and she told him what my BIL said. He said that my brother was cheating on her with his roommate and was planning on cheating with other people. None of that was true. He definitely was wrong to send those texts, but my bil just exaggerated the fuck out of everything. 

I think this is a good point to explain my brother in law:

* he was diagnosed with bpd and has an issue with doctors. This means he is not treating it. In fact he refuses to work on himself in anyway because he honestly believes he doesn‚Äôt have any problems. 

* now for the contradiction, he has depression and self medicated with CBD. 

* he is 42 and unemployed with zero money or motivation. His mom still gives him money because he threatens suicide if she doesn‚Äôt. We are trying to get her help because her enabling him has cost her multiple relationships. 

* he has a teenage daughter who he denied having for the first 10 years of her life, and since the rest of his family have been in her life he now acts like he raised her. He hasn‚Äôt actually met her because he thinks the mother will serve him support payment papers. He hasn‚Äôt contributed a single penny towards her life. 

* everything is a pity party. The world screws him over every single day according to him. It‚Äôs never his fault though. At least that‚Äôs what he thinks. 

* his now ex-wife cheated on him. Honestly, her and I were close to the point of sharing some advice. She told me that he‚Äôs a loser and would never change. She took the wrong way out of their marriage, but it was failing anyway since she was the bread winner and all he did was play video games all night and sleep all day. 

* when his wife left he was arrested for domestic assault. He told us it was all a lie. She was granted a protective order which don‚Äôt require proof, just reasonable suspicion. Getting it extended requires proof, and she got it. 

* he attempted suicide 4 times in the last two years. Each time was after his mom refused to give him money or let him live in her rental property for free. Hell, one time was when his computer broke and she wouldn‚Äôt shell out thousands for a new one. 

* he‚Äôs a one upper. My wife literally just gave birth and he tells her that he had gallstones. He said that they are definitely more painful then child birth. According to him, he‚Äôs done everything better then everyone else. Makes me question why he still relies on his mommy to survive. 

This all being said, he‚Äôs been like this for too long and after a lot of bad experiences, my wife decided to distance herself from him while she was pregnant. She didn‚Äôt want his stress on her. 

She kept him at arms reach. He came to meet our newborn and sure enough he tried to make the whole visit about him. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where everyone is just hoping he leaves. This time he left, but not before asking my wife for a thousand dollars because welfare screwed up and didn‚Äôt send him a check this week. She refused. 

As for my brother, he has only met my bil a handful of times. Still, while my bil was posting his pity party messages on Facebook hinting at suicide, my brother reached out and tried to help. He offered him a place to get away to, and even someone to listen if he needed it. 

When this all happened my brother wrote him and asked why he couldn‚Äôt just come to him first. Why couldn‚Äôt he give my brother the opportunity to tell his wife himself. My brother in law not only wrote some horrible shit to my brother, but he continued texting my brothers wife saying that my brother was a piece of shot and she needs to leave him. He wouldn‚Äôt stop. 

I had to break this news to my wife who‚Äôs still recovering from giving birth. She took it harshly but was quiet for a couple of hours. Finally she wrote her brother and said that he is no longer part of our family and isn‚Äôt welcome in our lives. He wrote back a pity party response about how we‚Äôve never understood him anyway. My wife was pissed and wrote a short fuck you and good riddance, then blocked him everywhere she could. She felt bad about her last text but we both know it‚Äôs deserved and was a long time coming. 

For a long time now, since his wife left him, I have been thinking that he‚Äôs a toxic person. He only provides negativity into our lives. Nothing else. I would never sway my wife on these things, so I was glad that she finally did what I have wanted to do for awhile. I wish my mother in law would do the same, but considering that she ended three marriages because of him, I doubt she ever will. However, that‚Äôs on her to navigate. 

I will clarify the catfish part of this. The bil roommate never went to school with my brother and is 6 years younger. She also did know him, they have mentioned this in the past. This was a setup, and considering the quickness of the bil to write the sil, and the exaggerated way intended to blow up the relationship rather than just inform her, it was clear who orchestrated it. 

I guess the advice I am looking for is what now?

How can I help my brother now that the bil is in the sil ear and continuing to be involving himself in my brothers marriage and his efforts to end it? 

How can I help my wife transition to life post toxic brother? 

How can we help my mother in law stop enabling him?",17Aug2019,1
511,"My friend(19) was in a relationship for nearly two years with the gf he thought was the love of his life. It‚Äôs very apparent now, he didn‚Äôt do a great job of treating her well. He‚Äôd ignore her, rarely offer any attention even if she was right beside him(he‚Äôd just play video games the whole time), she often had no choice but to beg him to make plans or make himself more presentable by cleaning his appearance and keeping his room tidy. Things went on for a lot longer than I could imagine after learning about everything, he‚Äôs also kind of a neck beard/ nice guy. She eventually grew tired of having a child for a boyfriend and has moved on to someone else. The breakup was about 6 months ago and he‚Äôs just been unbearable ever since. Every other week he texts us telling us ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go on‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid of what I‚Äôm willing to do to make everything end‚Äù. As one of his friends that drops what they‚Äôre doing at a moments notice to try and help, I‚Äôm just exhausted. We‚Äôll spend five hours with him, letting him pour his heart out, comforting him, suggesting help, and trying to help him turn things around. We‚Äôll give all that we have mentally and emotionally only for the next day have him tell us he‚Äôs going to kill himself. I‚Äôm slowly growing resentment towards him bc I know he‚Äôs absolutely wrong in almost every way and he continuously plays himself to be a victim. This has gone on for about 3 months now and I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I‚Äôm obviously well aware he‚Äôs depressed and have spoken to my older brother on how to talk someone down when they‚Äôre a threat to themselves, he‚Äôs in the air force and with the heavy issue suicide is in the military this kind of training becomes a necessity. I finally spoke to his ex yesterday just trying to clear the air. I found out before they were ever together he also claimed he‚Äôd kill himself after a relationship that spanned 3 weeks, he was diagnosed with depression and saw a therapist once a week, and took meds frequently. I‚Äôm not sure how much this has to do with him not treating his condition for one reason or another but I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs a key contributor. He‚Äôs a guy with lots of potential and is good with words, but never acts upon anything. I was blindsided when I was 16 and 2 of my friends took their own lives without me ever being able to intervene and help, thinking of them is what‚Äôs really keeping me going here. I‚Äôm starting school in two weeks and won‚Äôt have the time to keep a close eye on my friend anymore, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do anymore, I‚Äôm not sure there isn‚Äôt anything I haven‚Äôt tried.

512,"Last night I (24M) couldn't sleep and live alone, so I decided to listen to music with my earphones in, with do not disturb on my phone. And this morning I woke up to find my parents breaking my door to get access to my flat because they were worried about me. 

Told them I wasn't happy and for them to *get out immediately* in pure rage! I have CCTV right outside my door and was/am strongly considering getting the police involved, as I value my privacy and they had no right to do so. They have since been hindering me on my mobile and my landline which I have disconnected. Also, blocked them on all social media. 

I'm 25 years old, and I have lived alone for 5+ years now. My parents are really starting to annoy me, from letters, to not allowing me to go away for a couple of days - because they would worry about me. We used to be close but now I'm having different feelings surrounding them. They are basically suffocating me as there ""only sweet boy"".

In my defence I know I shouldn't have put my phone into do not disturb mode, but I really needed sleep and some relaxation without hindrance.

Need some advice on this situation... what is the best way to deal with this??????? Because I cannot have them doing this every time they can't speak to me!",17Aug2019,200
513,"So, I had a phone interview set up with Coca Cola on Thursday at 3:30pm. I confirmed it with the person I was supposed to talk to via email.

Thursday, at 2:11pm an odd number had called my phone, but I had no voicemail set up. So, around 2:30pm I called the number back and realized it was the woman who was to interview me. I just figured she made a mistake and was going to call me at 3:30pm as planned.

Well, at 3:30pm I am waiting for the call and by 3:45pm I realize she isn't going to call me. I called the number and left a message to let her know. Later, I also emailed to ask if we can set up a new time. However, I have yet to receive any reciprocation.

I did end up setting up my voicemail, which was bad on my part. Though, I'm trying to understand what is going on. Could she have seen my Facebook and not liked my long hair (I'm a guy)?

519,"I (F19) already made 2 posts about this and got nothing that explained anything. My mother (50 something) has threatened to kill me on multiple occasions including burning me to death, screaming at me that she'll tie me up and have my brother beat me, etc when I was &lt;11 yrs old or so. After the age of 11, she stopped talking to me and interacting with me all together except for necessary communications. She recently was done with chemo from breast cancer. I had headphones on so I couldn't hear her. She got angry with me over a blender being too loud and came over to pull my headphones out. I saw her hand come near me face and instinctively pushed her hand away from my face by grabbing her wrist. I didn't twist it. I held it and pushed it forward and away from my face since I had good reason to believe she would hit me again and it was just automatic at this point. It wasn't a startled response, just a reflex. I let go of her wrist as soon as I realized I caused pain and apologized multiple times. She started crying and told me she would've never done this to me. 

Some variations of the comments I got: 

\---&gt; You're an asshole because theres a strength disparity between you two - I asked this person if it was justified for a male to push away a woman's wrist if he had good reason to believe he was going to get hit by her from being threatened/hit by this woman for years. And if he was wrong even if he let go as soon as he realized he caused pain and apologized many times. They told me I was derailing and switching topics and that its not the same. Can someone explain why its not the same? That person in particular seemed downright stupid to me. All they would do is say I'm wrong while I would try and get to the bottom of WHY exactly its wrong. 

\---&gt; You need therapy/you need to find a therapist to fix the resentment you have towards your parents. Sure, but once again doesn't answer my question. 

\---&gt; I have violent tendencies. Violence = physical force intended to hurt. I did not intend to hurt. Also, how is it a violent tendency to be cautious and want to make sure that the person that has such a violent history keeps her hands to herself? I have no indication that she's changed. My only guess as to why she stopped is because she realized I wasn't weaker than her anymore since she was getting older.

\---&gt; I should be doing everything I can to make sure she's okay/comfortable and help her as much as I can with chores because she's battling cancer. I explained that mother doesn't have cancer anymore. And I don't see why someone deserves so much care/help from me when I sure as hell know she wouldn't do it for me if the roles were reversed. And I already do the chores. I don't know why people assume I wouldn't have to 

\---&gt; Just move out. I would if I could and this person didn't explain why I'm apparently a cruel, twisted person for justifying hurting my biological mother. I'm don't understand whats cruel and twisted about someone that never intended to cause pain unlike her. 

If you had to deal with a violent family for years, and then nearly 10 years later one member of the group decided to get pissed at you again over a blender being too loud, wouldn't you feel at least have some instinct to keep distance? Knowing that the only time they ever put their hand near your face or get close to you is to hit you.",17Aug2019,0

I have no purpose in life and little to no hope that I‚Äôll ever find purpose in anything. I have extreme social anxiety that holds me back from everything for the most part. I believe the reason for my social anxiety is simply the fact that I‚Äôm not as intelligent as everyone around me. I have a hard time holding up my end of the conversation because my mind is totally blank. I have a really hard time with articulating. I‚Äôm unable to make eye contact with anyone I speak with because once I do make eye contact I get nervous and stumble over my words more than before. My older brother is diagnosed with autism and I sometimes wonder if maybe I am in the same boat given that I act similar to him in social situations. 

I‚Äôm almost positive I have the inattentive type of ADHD since I find it extremely difficult to focus on anything really. I spend around 70% of my day zoned out. It‚Äôs almost as if my brain is cloudy which makes school and work extremely hard. 

It‚Äôs come to my attention that I am depressed and have been depressed for a very long time (even in my childhood). I have no energy to do anything at all, not even something as simple as brushing my teeth at times. When I get a job, I lose it because getting out of bed is too much for me to handle so I end up calling in multiple times, shortly after that I get embarrassed and quit.

521,"Hey, I need some **advice** on how to proceed with a friendship of mine:

‚ÄúIn a nutshell‚Äù I (M17) repeated the 6th grade a few years back.

I  didn¬¥t knew anybody in my new class and was pretty lonely. Then I  started to talk to a girl in my class on WhatsApp pretty excessively for  about 1 year, but because of my shyness back then, and quite a bit of  social anxiety with regard to meetings, we only met 2 times in person  (and in school we pretty much ignored each other), but via chat and  conversations on the phone, we became **pretty much best friends**.

Then  it came to a point where she obliviously wanted to meet me more often,  but I simply couldn¬¥t because my anxiety was way too big and I was  dealing with some other pretty bad things at the time as well, so I  couldn‚Äôt really bring up the courage to meet her or to talk to her in  school.

Also in Part because she  has ADHD and is therefore pretty ‚Äúactive‚Äù at school, this also added to  my anxiety, because I was extremely afraid that my other -newly won-  classmates/friends would think in a negative way about me, because of my  friendship to her. *(I know it sounds like I¬¥m a complete \*\*\*, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself, I was much younger and had a lot of anxiety back then)*

Following this time, I tried to stop any contact between us for months at a time, simply because I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

**Now about 4 years later**  I have talked to her about the things that happened back then and I  apologized, after which I stopped the contact again, simply because I  thought it was the best thing for both of us.

But  unfortunately I had some pretty rough times (Trauma,Depression) over  the past 1,5 years and so I sometimes simply needed someone to be there  for me (even if only via Whatsapp), so occasionally we had more contact  again.

But obviously things have  changed over the past 4 years and now we don‚Äôt come along at all and we  simply don‚Äôt ‚Äúfit together‚Äù anymore. (If it weren¬¥t for our past, I  wouldn‚Äôt have contact with her, simply because we are so different.)

But she still thinks that we have a ‚Äúgood friendship‚Äù and because of that I don‚Äôt really know what to do. **Because  I know that if I would end it now, I definitely would hurt her quite a  lot, (also because I¬¥ve ""ended"" it before, without a real result,  because she simply ignored it), but I also don‚Äôt see a way to continue  like this..**",17Aug2019,1

All was well until A started making offhanded comments to me about how he felt B liked me better than him and how I was her favourite or whatever like *""Isn't it funny how B always is nice to you but makes fun of me.""*. I ignored these for a while because he would only say them occasionally and I didn't know if they were jokes or not ***(I'm on the spectrum and have trouble with understanding social ques and tone)***

It got worse a few weeks ago when he started accusing me of trying to ""push him out of the picture"" and ""make everyone forget about him"" and then he started hinting towards wanting to hurt himself.

*Me: ""Please don't say that.""*

I‚Äôm a senior in HS right now and have been coming to grips with the reality of the world over the past year. I realize how shallow and fake most people are now, and how many people that I looked up to as ‚Äúcool‚Äù in the past are really just losers.

This has sombered me up a lot in the past few months. No more small talk with shallow people, no more smiles from me towards fake people who really don‚Äôt give a shit about me.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, this isn‚Äôt meant to be a sob story. I realize now that I must seek personal growth to become more confident and make the most of life, as for most of my life I have always cared too much about other people‚Äôs opinion of me.

I am trying to develop my character more by going to different events - clubs, bars, toastmasters, networking events - so I can meet truly great people and improve my confidence and social skills, so that I will inhibit my personality less in general.

Today I hung out with 3 of my closest friends, whom I truly appreciate for making an effort to spend time with me all the time. However due to my epiphanies regarding the reality of the world, I have become quite distrustful and insecure. This I can work on by participating in the aforementioned events. However, they are always so jovial and carefree around me, yet much of the time I cannot loosen up and let them down by being too serious when they are trying to have fun, e.g. while playing super smash bros or watching Netflix together. I am very stiff and unnatural in our interactions, so it hurts me because after making all the effort to spend time with me, I let them down every single time by being stiff and cold. 

This is actually because I‚Äôm insecure: what if they don‚Äôt really like me? Why did they pick me to be their friend? Why do they hang out with me everyday when I‚Äôm so cold towards them EVERY time we hang out? 

I am considering letting go of them so I can stop being such a bad friend for them. I plan to focus on self improvement and meeting many new people in the coming months in order to grow as a person. 

I have deliberated on whether or not I should tell them that I want to stop being friends because I am insecure and in truth, a bad friend as I have so many inner demons I have to slay.

Please advise me. Should I let them go or not? If I do, I will let them know how much I appreciate them. Incidentally, I will also still see them at school every day.",17Aug2019,1

535,"First time poster. Long time lurker on Reddit. Looking for some career advice from some more knowledgeable and experienced people on Reddit.

Let‚Äôs get to the point: I‚Äôm not sure if I should continue pursuing law school, or go back for my bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science.

My background: First generation American, first college student, first for so many things. I was and still am absolutely clueless about so many things. I went to college in the hopes of majoring in CS, but was denied for one reason or another. I was then asked what my interests were. Law school popped up and I majored in Poly Sci. In retrospect, dumb, maybe? Fortunately, my degree was free and my GPA was stellar.

I then joined the army as a Signal Officer. I acquired some valuable skills and certifications including Network+, Security+, and a TS/SCI. I also speak 3 languages.

I left the army for medical reasons and decided to pursue law school. Fortunately again, it is not a financial concern. Ultimately, my interest is to work in Cyber Security perhaps for the UN or some other government organization. I really enjoy the legal aspect of cyber security including cyber warfare, our response to hackers, and so on; but I‚Äôm also tremendously interested in CS and the value it has in teaching you some fantastic skills.

I don‚Äôt want to work in corporate law or be a judge or anything like that. But I do believe that a legal degree has a lot of value in these growing fields as many lawyers lack the technical knowledge or experience.

Last week was my first week in school so I‚Äôm having natural second thoughts and doubts about whether or not the investment of my time and resources is sound. Life has not particularly gone as planned so I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm wasting time again. I‚Äôve always been ‚Äúrushed to success‚Äù and that hasn‚Äôt always allowed me to think clearly. I‚Äôm not sure if it matters but I‚Äôm also in my late 20s.

540,"I have a stuffed bear that I‚Äôve had my whole life. My mom got a bunch of toys at her baby shower for me, and this bear became my favorite. 27 years old and I sleep with it every night. I‚Äôm really attached to it obviously. 

So two days ago my three year old got hold of it and dumped a milk sippy all over it. I immediately soaked it for a small time in warm water, gently blotted with a towel, blow dried it on low heat, then let it air dry outside the rest of the way since it‚Äôs warm and hoped for the best. 

Seemed to be okay, except this morning when I woke up with the bear near my face, I smelled it: the awful smell of old milk. Permeating from the head of my oldest and most sentimentally
valued possession.

550,"To begin with, my family is amazing and they have all been very supportive of me in my life. I have faced some trauma in my life which led me to take psyhciatric help and I have gotten better. They were there for me throughout the process. 

Currently I am single and I am not interested in marriage. They told me it was cool and that I could marry whenever I wanted to and they wouldnt even mind if I never married (I am from an Indian family so this is a huge deal) However, I confessed that due to my past, I am a little hesitant about marriage and that I would like someone who was understanding of my past. Someone I could rely on.  

They freaked out!!! They told me that I should never mention my past to my future husband whoever he is because its not a practical solution. When I replied that I would be spending the rest of my life with this person and I expect them to know about my life they told me I was being too idealistic. That its okay to have secrets in marriages and that if anything came up, I am to lie. They are so adamant about this that I am now thinking that maybe I am infact being too idealistic and this is the kind of stuff you never tell your partner about. This thought disturbs me though because it goes against everything I thought a relationship should be about. 

So basically what I am trying to ask is, am I being too idealistic when I say that its important for partners to know about each other or should I never speak of it and basically lie to him?",17Aug2019,2

557,"So here's the thing, my brother has this grandiose idea of becoming a millionaire after graduating high school by investing the money he gets by working summer jobs into stocks and bonds. The only thing he's done when it comes to education within finance is watching YouTube videos on how to get rich fast type of videos... (I know) 

Furthermore, he's reluctant in actually listening to sound advice within finance. I suggested (back when I thought he was only doing it as a hobby) that he go read into Warren Buffet and Martin Shrkeli and his response was ""I want to be original, everyone is reading those guys, but I want to be original and do it myself"" and when watching Martin's videos on investing he quickly stopped because ""He was giving off negative vibes, limiting me"" by this he meant that Martin's videos was a limiting factor because Martin mentioned the fact that a 100,000$ is nothing when it comes to investing...

Here's where my mother comes in. In no point has my mother ever in any way suggested that maybe such a grandiose goal isn't that realistic. That maybe he should just see it as a hobby or actually study finance academically instead of watching YouTube videos on it.

My mother also supports my brother's decision to quit normal high school (He started three days ago) and begin online high school (courses online designed for traveling parents with children who can't attend normal high schools)

I see this as a horrible thing for my brother. He'll only isolate himself more and become even more trapped in his bubble. No is going to challenge him. He'll be stuck in an echo chamber.  

His reasoning for quitting normal high school are a couple of very vague statements about the students there and also vague statements about the feeling he gets when he's in the school. ""I feel brain-dead there, during summer break I felt like I had a goal and could see my life trajectory"" ""The students don't care about academia"" (What the hell does he expect, it's high school)

I cringe at my own brother for making these kinds of decisions. But what's worse is that my mother allows it to happen. There's no resistance. I tried to talk sense into him myself but he won't listen to me, my mother is his haven. He'll go to my mother when he notices doubt from others. My father has taken the opposite approach and has critiqued his ideas many times, and almost ridiculing them (I know this is wrong, but keep in mind my brother has only had extremely unrealistic ideas from the start. Flip flopping from one extreme to another, he literally thinks that he'll never live a suburban life and that he's destined to greatness and the high life.) My father has limited access to us since he has been divorced from my mother and my mother has full custody, we only see him every other week and my brother sees him as secondary to my mother when it comes to authority (Rightly so) and it has only exacerbated the problem.

What should be done? Is there any way to get him out of his bubble? I feel like he's absolutely ruining his prospect for a future.",17Aug2019,1
558,"I've been suffering from depression for a while, but kept wearing the ""im fine""-mask because I don't want people to worry about me. I find it really hard to show these emotions and be honest about it because my parents taught me to hide shit like that basically. I know its not a good thing, but im working on it.
About 4 weeks ago I got so bad I called the suicide-hotline in the middle of the night because I was on the brink of making that decision. After talking I realized I really needed to get proper help and open up about it to my friends (relationship with family is difficult). Of course they knew I wasnt at my best but they didnt know how bad I really was/am. 
I told them I was in pretty bad shape and didnt see any point in going on. My best friend however, I wanted to tell her in private. She asked me whether I was contemplating suicide and even though this was the hardest question to answer, I was honest and said yes. 
She was very supportive during the talk and really sweet, but a couple of days later she met some guy and has been with him eversince (like literally 24/7 with each other). I haven't seen her for longer than 30min by herself. Usually we met up almost daily, had a proper bromance going on. I understand she's happy that she found someone but it feels like I'm being replaced in the worst of times by a random guy she just met. Of course I have more friends but she is my ""main bitch"" and I feel pretty alone now. I find it really hard to talk about this with her because I'm scared she will get angry and it does feel like it's my fault. I find it hard to reach out and I sleep a lot so I'm scared she'll think I'm upset with her because of this. But this could be the depression-guilt talking. 

Considering getting help, I have an appointment with the doctor and a safetyplan. I just really dont know whether it's my fault I don't hear her often, but it hurts so much because when she was in a bad place I'd call/text her often even if I didnt hear anything from her in the first place. I just dont know how to handle this situation and to be honest I dont have any energy for this at all.

Same with serial killers. With the more gruesome/crazy ones I have bigger trouble imagining that I could do the same, but I definitely understand why they do it. Cannibals and stuff.. I understand how they think and that they want to have the people with them for ever and closer then every other person ever had them. 

Now I want to say that just because I understand them, doesn't mean that I want to do such stuff or think it's ok. I think it's gruesome and I'm usually a really sensitive person. Like when I hear about such cases I often have to cry because I feeld so bad for the victims and their families, but I also understand the killers.

I admittedly somewhat awkwardly tried to ask her out via text, saying something along the lines of ""hey FYI I've had a bit of a crush on you and would love to hang out more and get to know you better.

Thereafter in class or around school she treated me as a total non entity. Before, we had at least exchanged pleasantries but after that text I got nothing but dirty looks. I wanted to say something along the lines of ""I got the message, you're not interested! You have nothing to worry about from me! Can we at least cordially say hi??"" but of course didn't say any of that and left her totally alone thereafter.

About 2 years ago my pitbull, (Judah, 3yo at the time) bit someone else's dog, seemingly out of nowhere, while we were on a hike.

My (still current) boyfriend was holding his leash and accidentally dropped it while attempting to switch hands. Our dog Judah ran up to a group of people/dogs before we could catch him and sniffed one of the other dogs for a moment before biting it. A woman from the group put her hand inside Judah's mouth in an attempt to get him to break away from her dog, thus getting her hand bit.

The dog was bit in a bad place that needed surgery to repair, ($1.4k) and the woman needed 4 stitches, ($5k) totaling medical bills at around $7k.

The whole scuffle lasted about 30 seconds, and landed me with 2 years of debilitating anxiety/panic attacks and a $50k+ lawsuit.

Now please let me say these few things before asking your advice...

-I know pitbulls have a bad rap as it is, and that it's all about how you raise them. My dog had never exhibited any noticeable signs that he would do something like that. He has had dog friends and has always been well cared for since I rescued him. (Ok, maybe I made him a little fat.)

- I had never had anxiety/panic attacks before, (except once as a teenager when I was at my first day starting a new job with no sleep.) So I know the anxiety is related to this event, along with my mother passing away 6 months earlier. I went to therapy for several months after this incident, but stopped when my therapist moved to Mexico.

- This dog, my dog, is a chill dog. He lives for peanutbutter, sun bathing and sleeping with his tongue out. He's just reactive, and I know it's because of me... he lunges and barks at anything that moves and I'm terrified I'll lose my grip on his leash and he'll bite someone or some other poor animal.

- With my newfound anxieties, I find myself terrified to take him to training classes now... About a year ago I even broke down crying at one of these classes the moment Judah started barking. Shamefully, I didn't complete the 6 week program.


It's been almost two years now, and I'm so excruciatingly embarrassed that I've put these things off for so long. I've asked my boyfriend several times in the past to take on the leadership role in Judah's training but he never actually follows through, maybe bc he has anxiety about this now too. I'm just not sure. But we hardly get out anymore, and when we do, my anxiety is through the roof and I'm twice as worried that I'm going to cause Judah to react poorly and something bad will happen again. It's at the point where I can barely just let him go off and be a dog anymore. Please help us.

How can I get the training my dog so desperately needs, when I'm scared to even bring him in a training environment with so many variables?

Is it possible to find a professional that can help both me and my dog simultaneously?

I've thought about putting him through a board and train program, but I have heard some awful things about some of those places and they're so expensive.. but it'd have to help more than nothing right?

I've felt so guilty that I've even considered rehoming Judah with someone who would hopefully be able to take on his behavior training, but that is a last resort.

I just want my dog to be happy and healthy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and honest feedback would be helpful as well.",17Aug2019,1
568,"Sorry if this is a bit all over the place, but I'm trying to figure out what to do here.

I have a son that's 5, and he's been diagnosed as ""moderately delayed"" by school psychologists. He went to a special needs preschool for a year and is now in regular kindergarten with an IEP. He has a two year old sister who is not delayed. They sleep in the same room together but not usually on the same bed. Sister loves him and will often try to climb into bed with him.

The problem is that recently brother has taken (what we feel to be) a somewhat unhealthy interest in sister's private parts. Any time she gets a diaper change or sits on the big girl potty, he has to be there. He's excited any time she poops and wants to see it. If they take a bath together, he tries to stick his penis out of the water and get her to touch it.

We've stopped giving them baths together, and that's helped, but what happened today really has us worried. This morning, he came and woke us up to tell us sister took her diaper off. It's normal, she does that from time to time. I grabbed a new diaper and when I went into their room to change her, he lifted her skirt and put his head under her skirt to look. 

I was floored. I was shocked. I'm still shocked. I feel that it went from innocent curiosity to something else entirely. Without getting mad, I sat him down and explained why that wasn't okay and how he can't do that anymore. We've already decided that they probably won't be sleeping in the same room anymore, but I'm not sure that's enough. 

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if that's a normal thing for a kid his age with special needs. I just have this sinking gut feeling that it'll get worse, and I'm not about to risk my little girl being potentially molested at that age. It happened to my wife when she was young, and I know how bad it can affect someone. 

We are already talking to the children's hospital about psychiatric care, but there's not much that can be done on weekends. 

Anyone have any advice?",17Aug2019,2

575,"This might turn more of a rant/venting out my situation. So I [25M] am planning on joining the U.S. Navy, possibly at the beginning of next year. I have a degree in civil engineering and I'm hoping to use that to get in and continue working in my field of study and pursue a master's in structural engineering which hopefully the Navy can pay for it. I have been in this depression mode/frustration on life because I have feel like I have not been doing anything with my life. I see everyone getting engaged, getting married, having kids, and traveling's and doing all these things that I have not done so myself. I have been consumed heavily by some of my family situations where I invested all of my money and income on a business that I'm hoping that it takes off here soon. It has drained me so much and I have no desire of being part of it, I just want my return in investment and call it good. I literally have no luck with girls, I'm not that bad looking, but I guess I'm too nice and girls just don't dig that? Some of the girls that have actually hit on me have been married and have 2-3 kids. Nothing wrong with that but its definitely something I wouldn't prefer, as drama can come with some of those girls with their baby daddies. 

I also think about it twice as I feel like I'll be enslaved by the military life and won't get a chance to live a good life or enjoy some of the things I plan on doing like traveling, meeting new people and experiencing a life other than what I have been living. I really feel like I'm gonna sell my life out and when I get out I'll be older and it'll be harder to find a stable life and settle down. I may also be overthinking too much and what I really should do is ""do it"" and let life flow and see where it takes me. I tend to over think too much and I think that's what discourages me from doing things.",17Aug2019,1

578,"I don't have any feelings for her what so ever. We have been leaving together for about six months with another friend. I started to notice her weird behaviour towards me a few times especially when we went out with friends for a few drinks. 

It was a little flirtatious at the start but it slowly became intrusive. Constantly looking for attention and benig rude to other people who we where hanging out with. She would also become over offended if I said or did anything towards her.

Last night was a mess. We where out on the town with a few friends. The night was going well then it took a turn. I was chatting to a mutual femal acquaintance. We where having a good time and laughing alot. I should point out that it was friendly chatting and nothing was flirtatious about it. I know she is dating someone. 

This seemed to really upset my housemate. Walking off by here self, not engaging in conversations. She then became visibly upset and was crying. Another friend of ours was comforting her at this point. I was constantly asking her if she was ok and our group of friends was concerned about her. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong.

The night went on like this and at this point I was just not enjoying myself. I was worried about my housemate but also becoming increasingly frustrated as her attitude became more toxic. There was a large amount of alcohol consumed by everyone at this point. We went home and it seemed that she was going to tell me. It was on the edge of her tongue. I suggested we should talk about it tomorrow when both of us where sober. 

I completely accept that I'm not prefect and can be very friendly which might come across as flirting at times. But I'm just not interested romantically in her and I have never given the impression I was. Should I be annoyed if she moved in to our house with feelings towards me? I just don't want to upset her. She is a mate after all.

My motivation to keep it up was that i could go back to school, and after that go filmschool. So now I have gone back to school so that i can get a degree and go to filmschool. I really really want that.

And to get started i want to buy gear. But not Just anything. I know exactly what i want and if i purchase all of it, i spend about 40% of what i saved up this year. It will be about 4200$. And i know its a lot of money. I already have a powerful  enough computer to handle both Audio and Media in different programs.

However my parents do not support it one bit. And if i buy it, they will be really dissapointed and/or mad at me. But i know this is what i want, and i wish to god that they could understand what it actually means to me. I saved up a total of  about 10 000$. And i will use about 4000 of that.

Let's say you have a couple, well call them Jack and Jane. They've been together a few years, are engaged. Jack has been an avid Magic The Gathering card player for upwards of 20 years. He plays in tournaments, as well as weekly games. Jane voices a concern that this MTG hobby is cutting into their time together. Jack cuts one of his 3 weekly games out for a while because one of the places he plays closed and Jane is happy with that.¬†

Jack then tells Jane he is thinking about picking up a third night of games again, but says it wont be every week. He¬† Picks up the 3rd night, and after a few months Jane realizes that he has indeed played every single night that he added to his weekly schedule. To top things off Jack has the modify his work schedule to accommodate the 3 nights a week that he is playing MTG. So on top of the 60ish hours a week he works, hes spending an additional 18 or so hours a week playing MTG, the nights he plays not getting home until well after midnight.

¬†Jane voices her on happiness with how this played out,¬† And Jack tells her hes been playing more because he was needed by his team. One of Jane's big gripes is that Jack didn't bother telling her that he would be needed more. Jack admits that he should have may be mentioned that he would be needed to play more. Jack also reminds Jane hes been playing since before he met her.

Now, lets say a few months ago Jane asked Jack to attend a function with her. Jack tells Jane he may not be able to get off of work for that function. Given their busy schedules Jane understands. A few weeks.go by and Jack asks Jane if they have any plans the day of that function because there is a MTG tournament that he wants to play in. Jane reminds Jack that it's the same day as the function she had asked him to join her for.

The week before Jane's function, Jack Informs her that he going to go practice for this tournament that he is playing the same day as her function. Jane is upset because Jack said he didnt think he would be able to get the time off for her function, but had no issues taking off and decided to play MTG instead of joining her.for her function, where they would have had the rare opportunity to spend the entire day together.

Is Jane over reacting? Is Jack being selfish? What should Jane do?",17Aug2019,1

590,"So I was hired a couple of years ago in the Anthropology department as a lecturer.  For the record, there‚Äôs 4 subfields...cultural anth, physical anth, archaeology, and linguistics.  The number of cultural anthropologists far outnumbers the other fields, especially physical anth.  I was hired because I‚Äôm a physical anthropologist and can teach in this niche.  Physical anth is focused on studying humans as biological organisms...basically human evolution, human anatomy, osteology, and primatology, so you really have to have a lot of evolutionary biology and anatomy experience to teach these classes.

These colleagues (all cultural anthropologists) are more senior than me and are arguing with the chair and dean that they should be getting these classes first before I even get ANY classes at all.  There also seems to be some discontent because they keep having classes get cancelled while mine fill up quickly (I do have a good reputation with students).  

I‚Äôm on vacation for my honeymoon and these colleagues just started to send public accusatory emails about this while I‚Äôm away trying to enjoy my holiday.  These emails were harsh and included bold letters, all caps, and pretty strong complaints and refusals to comply with this system.  I had no idea that this discontent was building behind closed doors.  My chair has talked to me and said that the department hired me because they want people teaching in their own niches.  They want cultural anthropologists teaching cultural classes, physical anthropologists teaching physical, etc.  These colleagues are arguing that since they‚Äôve been teaching longer that they should be able to teach the physical anthropology classes because they think they can teach them ‚Äúwell enough.‚Äù  In their eyes, students don‚Äôt know the difference and don‚Äôt care.  As long as you‚Äôre an anthropologist, you get some training in physical anth in school, so can teach it.

I don‚Äôt know for sure, but it seems like they are trying to get the chair and dean fired and get someone new in place that will go with their system of seniority.  I‚Äôm a little frazzled over this.  I know the chair and dean support me, but I‚Äôm certainly concerned.  I love teaching and really care about my students.  I find it absolute bullshit that students should be taking physical anth classes with cultural anthropologists that have no practical experience in this field.

597,"Hi everyone! 
I hope your days are going well! 

I have been renting a house for about 2 years now. It is a VERY small town house. 2 floors, 2 bathrooms, 6 rooms. The kitchen is so small there is only 2 cabinets and it is attached to a tiny area you can put a couch. I have lived here alone for these 2 years. It is essentially just a bunch of bedrooms and no space.

This Monday my landlord called and informed me that 5, 17 turning 18 year old best friends from high school are moving in, along with their 3 cats. They will be staying here while they attend a culinary program at my school.

I am about to graduate from my medical program on Sept 19, but I am concerned about the lack of space, privacy, etc. 

I have a dog who is good with cats, but I‚Äôm worried about their cats with my dog. 
I have a home nurse here for infusions weekly, and the idea of them asking questions about it and judging me for it scares me.

My campus is a very big party school. With my medical boards coming up I am scared it won‚Äôt be quiet enough for me to study and this small house will be a party house.  Most of the culinary students are housed at the dorms, so when you aren‚Äôt, your house becomes the party location. 

My landlord has no major rules really, only minor things such as people can‚Äôt stay stay longer than 2 weeks. He never checks in so he wouldn‚Äôt even know if these lenient rules were being broken. only has been over 3x since i moved in) 

Now my biggest issue... my husband and I bought a house up the road. It is ready to move in now. I am willing to pay my landlord the month of September‚Äôs rent and just leave so I don‚Äôt have to worry about all of this, but my anxiety has stopped me from bringing it up to him. 

I want to have a positive relationship with these girls, but all I am feeling is anxiety and frustration (at the landlord for springing this on me). I know it is not their fault, and I‚Äôm so proud of them for continuing their education! 

How can I discuss this to my landlord, and how can I have the best relationship I can with these young women while I make the transition to moving out!

I've been trying to help them find a way to get back what they lost, but they just don't have the will anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

The messed up thing is, they don't have any family or close friends. There doesn't seem to be anyone I can contact that would help them. They were managing their depression responsibly via medication and they're open to therapy and have been many times in the past. It's just that the weight of what they lost on top of their already precarious life situation caught up with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help, I've never seen them like this and I'm scared. I'm completely at a loss for what to do. I've tried being encouraging, offering some normal conversation, and advice on how they might be able to get back what they lost. I was trying to be supportive and just there for them in general if they needed a friend to distract them or whatever, but they aren't receptive to anything anymore. Do I just leave them be? I'm really scared of what might happen. Am I going into this with the wrong mentality? Am I missing something?",17Aug2019,1
609,"Lately I've been very appreciative of those who appreciate me and I'm starting to realize how many good friends I actually have. The good friends constantly check up on me and continue inviting me to places even though they know I don't really want to go to certain places. However, I then realized that my best friend would never do something like this. I'm someone who can rely on texts and phone calls to maintain friendships, but my best friend doesn't even do that. Sometimes, a couple days will go by and he'll finally reply to my texts. I've been around him enough to know that he's not a bad texter. When I'm around him he's always on his phone and he's texting other people. I've known him my entire life, but lately, I can't tell you what he's been up to. I cannot tell you what his favorite activity is these days. At this point, the idea of cutting him out of my life sounds so necessary because he just gives my life stress because I continue thinking this guy cares about me but his actions say otherwise. But I can't cut him off because I've known him my entire life. He's been there since I six years old and he will continue to be there because he's family. I'll always see him through family parties or holidays.

612,"Yesterday someone rear-ended me when I was parked. I was stopped at a stop sign, drove forward a little but stopped again to wait for cross traffic. Then the other guy drove into the back of my car while my car was at a full stop. 

The damage is minimal. At first, I thought there was no damage until I took a closer look. The bumper has slight dent about one inch wide.  There's a couple of scratches that are 2 to 4 inches across. You wouldn't notice the damage unless you're looking for it. 

My car is a 2012 Chevy Impala with 83,000 miles on it. There's no other damage or issues with the car other than the damage from yesterday's accident.

No one was injured and the police were not called. The other driver gave me his insurance card but that was expired. He said he would call me later with his current information. His father called me and told me he has insurance but doesn't have that information handy right now. He said he would call me later today with the insurance information. 

I have not filed a claim with my own insurance yet. 

This is actually the second accident my car has been in this year. The other accident happened when someone drove into my vehicle while it was parked in a parking lot. The damage from that earlier accident has been fully repaired and the issue is resolved.

I'm wondering if it's at all worth the effort to go through his insurance or my own insurance to repair the vehicle. Even if the guy has insurance to repair my car, then I have to leave my vehicle at a repair shop for a day or two.  Also my rates for my own insurance might go up. 

If the guy doesn't have insurance, do I call the cops? Would he get arrested? Filing a police report and doing anything like that would be a hassle and might not be worth the effort for the amount of damage he did. 

I'm considering just letting it go even if he has insurance but I'm not sure if this is a dumb idea or not. What do you guys think? What would you do?

613,"Background:  
Okay, I grew up with my Dad teaching me, hands on, how to kill and clean animals for food; and watching him abuse my pets. So I have a serious aversion to knowingly harming or killing animals. I spent most of my life in Kentucky, and Tennessee, where nobody bats an eye if you live trap animals, (like possums or raccoons), on your own property, and relocate them to the middle of nowhere.   


Current situation:

I've spent the last several years living in Ohio, in a gang area. We're two doors down from a house occupied by squatters. They have no power, or water, and there are gang symbols painted on the house. Across the street is a heroin addict/loud alcoholic, who visits with them often, and occasionally talks to me when I'm taking out the trash.  There are a couple feral cats, for whom I put food in a dish on the porch.   


This being northern Ohio, of course the cat food attracted some wildlife I've never dealt with before. Rats. So naturally I get a couple live traps and catch a couple rats, then I try to figure out where to take them. - And there lies the problem. A google search says that rats can't survive the winter in the wild here. They rely on human habitation, living in basements and attics. So I can't set them free in the woods, and obviously I'm not going to let them go in a building.   


Add to this issue the fact that the gang people and the alcoholic know that I was catching them. The alcoholic asked me if I was getting rid of them humanely, and I said ""right"".   


Except at this point I've just collected them in individual little hamster cages, in a side room that looks like the rat section of a pet store. I've got six of them, each in their own cage, with their own hiding box, water bottle, bedding, and food; destined to die of old age that way I guess.   


But! A google search today said that it is illegal to trap animals on your own property without a license in Ohio, unless you take them to a licensed professional to be relocated or rehabbed, or have them euthanized. It specifically lists raccoons and possums, but not rats. I can't find a specific law for rats, so I have no idea what I can even legally do with them.   


It was probably illegal in Kentucky, too, but nobody cared there. Here I have seriously sketchy neighbors questioning me. If they decided to call the dept. of fish and game  I might have a problem.   


My partner is killing the ones that remain the old fashioned way, and so are my house cats, and I'm okay with that so long as I don't see it.  


Any idea on how I might get rid of them?  Or whether a wildlife control officer could even look around inside my house? (If he couldn't I could just lie to him.)   


I'm just trying to do the right thing here.",17Aug2019,1
614,"Throwaway account because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be found out. 

I am a foster child. I have been so for almost a year and a half now.

I was taken away 3 years ago, by CPS, after they realized my living situation with my biological parents was getting dangerous. 

I live with foster parents now, a man and a woman. 

The man seems very excited over having a foster daughter. Not in a sexual way but in a genuine fatherly love way. The woman..

I feel like her and I are very distant. Like she only shows affection when others are there. She only hugs me or talks to me when someone else is with us. other than that, I feel like I am not seen as family. 

The man tells me a lot that he cares about me and sees me as his actual father, and me as his daughter. 

The woman has never said anything like this, except for one time when a person from CPS came to check up on me to see how I‚Äôm doing (it‚Äôs twice a year.) and although she didn‚Äôt directly say it she did act like it. 

Until that meeting ended and I was left on my own.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows what I should do or can help me in my current situation. I want to be closer to her but it feels like she sees me as an intruder in the family. Like i don‚Äôt belong there.

I don‚Äôt know what I can do. I‚Äôm too scared to ask my therapist because I just want a place to live. and my foster siblings seem very attached so I don‚Äôt want to disappoint them either. 

I don‚Äôt want to talk with the CPS people either because of the reasons listed right above.

This Is my first ever post on Reddit, and hopefully the first of many! You can call me Nick, or just call me Slayer, either one works fine It's up to your preference. As for my problem, here's what's been going on:

So, long story short, I got banned from Omegle again. Omegle bans are always stupid, I'm pretty sure you can put two and two together here. To cut to the chase basically I found a free VPN known as PortonVPN, downloaded It to my Mac, signed It and whatever and It looks like It works great. But... I went on the site (refreshed It tones of times, connected to different VPN server multiple times and all that) and I'd say I was unbanned for like a second and then It would say I'm banned again. *Why?*

Not only that but I can't even use the banned section, because when I try to connect to It while the VPN Is In on I get ""Connecting To Server: Error"" but when I turn the VPN off the banned section works fine. I really want to be unbanned and don't understand why the VPN Isn't working, can someone please explaining to me what's going on, give me some suggestions or know any ways to help me out here?

621,"I am taking AP Literature at a very liberal school in a very liberal state.  We had to create a short response to Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance, and I decided to relate it to Liam Neeson's bold choice to open up about his racist past.  Although my intention is pure, I worry that other students or teachers might misconstrue my message to be in support of Liam Neeson's racist actions, when I am *only* in support of his confession.  This is the full response below, please tell me if it comes off the wrong way, or if I should make an adjustment to clarify what I am trying to say:

Ralph Waldo Emerson‚Äôs Self-Reliance discusses the importance of staying true to oneself and not conforming to a predetermined set of beliefs.  The individual‚Äôs success comes from their unique ideas and values; no one can find fulfillment in life without staying true to their beliefs.  In the beginning of his essay, Emerson discusses the importance of self-reliance and asserts that regardless of one‚Äôs virtues, a person should accept who they are:  ‚Äú...he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till‚Äù (2).  Emerson is saying a person should express their true nature regardless of whether they are a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù person in the eyes of society, and he insinuates their power comes from their distinctive character and convictions.  Emerson‚Äôs simile of a farmer‚Äôs labor bearing fruit to a nourishing corn kernel symbolizes the nutritious knowledge found when one works hard on their personal development in pursuit of life‚Äôs truths.  Emerson explains the folly of blindly following in others‚Äô footsteps, as he reveals how most people would rather repeat and believe in what others say than uniquely think and speak for themselves.  He further expounds in the middle of the essay that ‚ÄúMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage.‚Äù (11).  Emerson argues that too many men lack self-reliance, and choose instead to mimic the teachings of others who are revered as wise and noble.  He emphasizes that self-reliance is important to success because one must stand out as an individual within society in order to convey and draw attention to their honest beliefs.  Society partially inhibits a person from true independence, he explains, as often people receive criticism for expressing their true self.  Emerson writes, ‚ÄúBut the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account.‚Äù (3).  Here again Emerson is clearly connecting the importance of having one‚Äôs own ideas with the difficulty in expressing, owning, living such personal truths.  He elaborates on the effect of society‚Äôs reaction to well articulated discoveries and how the anticipation of a poor reception can hinder the opening of more dialogue.  He states a thinker may shut down important opportunities for a deeper discussion because of such intimidation.  This effect could be seen in the wake of Liam Neeson‚Äôs remarks when answering some personal questions about his viewpoint on the seeds of racism.  In a February 2019 interview with Independent Magazine, Neeson, an eminent movie actor of global distinction, shares a story about how his empathy for a female friend raped by a black man reached unjustifiable heights as he sought revenge on African Americans as a whole when he waited outside a bar looking for a black man to attack.  This story received a lot of backlash from the public and media, and Neeson apologized for sharing it in the first place: ‚ÄúThe horror of what happened to my friend ignited irrational thoughts that do not represent the person I am. In trying to explain those feelings today, I missed the point and hurt many people at a time when language is so often weaponized and an entire community of innocent people are targeted in acts of rage‚Äù (Variety Magazine, March 2019).  As Emerson argues, people are discouraged from confessing important truths for fear of reprisal from their peers.  Neeson‚Äôs racist actions are fully deserving of criticism, but sharing his story was vital to understanding more about the mind of a person who may experience racist thoughts, and the reasons behind some of the world‚Äôs discriminatory evils.  At a time of racial conflict and police violence, it is words and discussion, not silence, that will bring humanity closer to resolution rather than division.  It is important not to censor people with whom we disagree, but to discuss and learn from each other so that we can move forward as a society, at least with better comprehension of fear and hatred than before.  


I do not need writing/grammar advice, I just worry that poor judgement may be cast onto my response by people who are not in support of Liam Neeson.  I am aware that this is hypocritical considering Emerson says that we should not take other people's opinions into consideration, but I am very nervous lol.  Please be honest!!",17Aug2019,1

626,"Hey everyone,

25(M) here with a 24(M) best friend. For some context involving our friendship, we've been friends since I was at least 15, all the way back in high school. The particular school we attended was known for its small class sizes (graduating class was 7, including us) and everyone knew each other. During those years and even during my undergraduate years (I went to a college only 2 hours north of home) when we'd visit it was mostly general catching up and playing tabletop games for the most part. There was some talk about our studies, but its the routine is the same for everyone ofc so it was small talk if anything.

Fast forward to after we graduate, I was forced to take a gap year due to only applying to PhD programs (in an MA program now) and was just shy of my 3rd year of my relationship. This was when I began noticing the invasive behavior. I was constantly asked about my plans for the future and mentioned I was applying to terminal MA programs. From there, I was asked about my chances as well as academic things like my GPA and all that. I thought nothing of it due to my own obliviousness but I do mention my overall academic stuff over time. He thinks I did 'poor' due to my overall GPA and suggests an overall career change, particularly social work. This was because, in his words, 'they don't have high standards'. He asked similar stuff about my girlfriend, as well as my family members. Eventually, it progressed to talking about politics and, as much as I tried to keep it to brief quips about it, he kept going on and on. I was also aware of showing signs of discomfort with them, but he never backed off of it and was always more than willing to offer his commentary on whatever I was doing personally. My gap year being a ""weird situation"", parents not saying much about what they do to me being ""weird"", finding it odd I didn't live with my gf despite neither of us making our own money yet, etc.  
I should note my biggest reason for just being blunt and quipping sometimes was because he was dealing with his own issues at the time. His mother had terminal illness (now deceased) and did not want to make pressure worse for him, especially since his relationships in undergrad notably fell apart. I had no reason to add more pressure as someone who knew him for as long as I have. I also never asked any sorts of parallel questions back at him about his personal life because I didn't want him to feel how I was feeling.  
Recently though, I visited him back in July (I'm out of my home state for my own graduate program) where he landed a job with his graduate degree and got his driver's license over the spring this past year to drive me around his new town. I give the benefit of the doubt despite our prior interactions this time, due to many stressors going down on his end (mother's health, getting a graduate degree to be sellable, making enough to live on his own) but its more of the same. I get asked all about what I'm doing personally. Notable examples: If I'm dating (I'm not and have been single for a year) and regretted my last breakup, then proceeds to cite a raw age saying most millenials are 'paired off' by 27 (w/o citing other demographic info like # of degrees, financial background, etc.), why I'd need a PhD in my field, and the worst of it... politics and political views. He also didn't like that I didn't offer my food to him I ordered when we saw a movie that day and noted that, despite not taking it if I offered, found it weird that I didnt offer him any. Reason I didnt was because he said out loud earlier that day he had his calories for the day after eating at a buffet earlier in the day. Despite mentioning that reason, he said very fast, ""Yeah, but still weird."" Awkward silence until we ate dinner and I get hit with more invasive stuff. I then ask him to drop me off at my car after dinner saying I need to go back and drive back home.  
I have been in seldom contact with him this past year as is due to being 8 hours away from home and him subsequently, but this is still difficult when we have the chance to talk once every 2 months or so and I want to try and make this clear. Its just difficult because I try to make it a clean slate each time we have the chance to talk but it doesn't stop. What do you all recommend?  
TL;DR: Dealing with a best friend I've known since high school asking invasive questions and sometimes trying to critique what I'm doing personally. Things like pointing out my situations at whatever time I see him and such. Makes me uncomfortable because after being friends for so long I'd just like to enjoy his company but I really can't. We talk once every 2 months at the most and I've gone in trying to put this aside each time but I can't ignore it any longer. Any tips on how I can disclose this to him next time we talk?",17Aug2019,1

629,"Hey all. I'm a 19 year old guy who graduated high school last May. I decided to take a year off to ""figure things out"", and the end of that year is coming up fast. A year ago I thought I'd have some things figured out by now and at least have some direction for the future. Well, turns out that's not the case.

As far as what I did in that year, I worked the summer job that I worked in highschool until the company closed for the winter. I sat around for a month depressed and not sure what to do. I then left home for 6 months to earn training and certificates to fight forest fires. Came back home a few months ago and have been working my high school job again, building up a decent (to me) savings.

I live in rural Florida. My parents want me to stay here and live with them and go to community college to get my associates degree. I don't mind the thought of going to college now, and I know it would be smart to not have rent or food payments during my first two years of school. It would be a practical decision to stay here for two more years.

This is where things get confusing for me. I know for a fact that what I really want to do is move to the west. Specifically Reno, NV. I don't want to stay in rural Florida where there isn't anything to do except sit at the beach and drink. I have no friends here and my girlfriend of 4 years just left for college last week. I feel like I would be miserable staying with my parents and having no life except school and some random part time job.

I'm torn between doing the practical thing and staying here or doing the thing I really want to do, which is to take my savings of almost $5k and make the move out west. If I did move, I'd stay in the city I decide on for at least a year so that I can gain residency and go to college in that state.

Now I know I'm 19 and I hardly have a clue how challenging it can be to make it on my own. I feel like I've just hit one of those major crossroads in life and I don't want to make the ""wrong"" decision. Any advice or words of wisdom is appreciated.",17Aug2019,1

635,"How do I respectfully transition to being just friends with my girlfriend?

Long story short, I broke up with my girlfriend a month ago, and we're talking about reconnecting. We had a perfect relationship (over a year long) that I guess I didn't feel romantically.

636,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. We love each other a lot and have a very tight bond and i¬¥m very comfortable with him,however,he has one problem that I can¬¥t agree with and that is me posting pictures of myself on social media. I don¬¥t post myself 24/7 but I like to here and there . It¬¥s the whole point of apps like snapchat and instagram. I often get insecure about my body as I was on and off with an eating disorder, my boyfriend always tells me im beautiful,perfect,etc,and that I¬¥m too pretty for him which makes me happy but I still like to post on social media here and there to feel good about myself, I constantly see all these instagram models with perfect bodies and I admit I get insecure here and there. I try to post some body pictures but my boyfriend hates it. He doesn¬¥t allow it basically because he doesn¬¥t want other guys trying to message me or looking at pictures of my body. He has even went far as logging into my account and deleting pictures off my story. It has definitely bothered me because I¬¥m his girlfriend not a child. He shouldn¬¥t have the power over me to tell me how to DRESS or if I have his permission to post a picture or not. Yesterday I took some really nice pictures since it was the first week of school. I showed him the pictures and he told me I couldn¬¥t post them and that he didn¬¥t like them because I was wearing false eyelashes and some concealer. He told me my outfit was showing too much when it was literally just a pink zip up hoodie and some grey biker shorts. We literally have been arguing all day and night over this because he sees it ¬®another way¬® I just see it as insecure and childish considering the fact that he constantly likes pictures of instagram models with fake bodies and caked up make up but when i do it he gets upset. What do i do at this point? I can¬¥t be with somebody who tries to tell me what to wear and or not to post something

TLDR- Boyfriend tries to tell me what to wear and doesn¬¥t let me post pictures of my body because he doesn¬¥t want guys looking at me . Took new pics yesterday and he wont let me post them because Im wearing make up and look ¬®fake¬® even though he ALWAYS likes pictures of females with fake bodies and make up caked on.",17Aug2019,2

639,"Hello,

I have a small e-commerce business. I rely heavily on USPS, and my main mailman does an awesome job delivering my stuff, as well as picking up orders. Saving a trip to the post office is extremely nice. I always keep a cool/friendly relationship with him...I chat with him, just try to be nice, in general. Recently, he invited me to hang out at the beach with his family. That's perfectly fine...I have no problem with him asking that at all. I just want this to stay as a mailman/customer relationship. 

So anyway, the first couple of times I said I had other stuff to do....or I was non-committal. You would think he would have had gotten the message, with me trying to do it in the nicest way possible. I think this last time was the 4th time he asked me (I think he goes with his family to the beach every other Sunday or something).

I don't make huge lies or even like detrimental ones but I tend to catch myself doing it even when telling a story just to make it sound better. Once I lied about hanging out with someone just to make my s/o jealous to get back (ik so immature). Sometimes I'll be lying in my bed and asked to hangout, I lie and say I'm out and don't think I can make it. Most of them I'd say are considered White lies that does really ever affect anything big, but it's still not good and I shouldn't be doing it. 

I guess idk why I do it and want to stop but I think in order to do that I need to understand why and maybe what to do to work on stopping it.

When I started, there was one guy who was the standout senior, he is really great and I have learned a lot from him. The other guy who is not officially a senior yet, but who is being moulded for that position himself is really fragile and is easily threatened by my presence and performance.

662,"Hi everyone,

I recently moved to state ""M"" after living in state ""T"" for years. The doctor's office in state ""T"" was a hot mess but I went there because I was very poor and had no other choice. Anyway, to contact anyone at the doctor's office in State ""T"" I need to call the 800 number and stay on hold for an average of 45 minutes, then I'm transferred to a few people who usually don't know what they're talking about and then after about an hour total of being on the phone I'll finally reach someone who says they can help. Then often times the person who said they could help with whatever my issue is (getting a document for example) forgets or isn't able to do so and then I have to rinse and repeat and start the process over again. As you can imagine this is incredibly frustrating.

So anyway, back in the fall I asked state ""T"" for my medical records so that my new doctor in state ""M"" could have them. The foolishness that I described above went on for months, and working 9-5 Monday to Friday I had no time to call them and just had no patience left either. I mentioned it to my doctor's secretary, and she said she would work on it. Lo and behold, she got my medical records right away! I could have kissed her. She told me she received them and sent them to the medical records department in her office. This was in March.

So I figured that nightmare was over, but then I checked my medical records on the portal out of curiosity and nothing was in there from when I was in state ""T."" I mentioned this a few times in the portal to my doctor and her secretary but nothing ever came of it. Finally I got frustrated because I have a right to know where my medical records are and I can't remember things like when the last time I got a tetanus shot was and I'm terrified of needles, so it would be great to know if I don't need one for a while instead of going through the anxiety of having to get the tetanus shot (and perhaps other shots I don't remember about) ""just in case.""

I wrote a few days ago in the portal to the secretary to ask about my medical records, and she said she did her job by sending them on to the right department, but for some reason they never got into my file. She said she is happy to call the state ""T"" doctor's office again to get them. I said ""No. I want to find out first what the medical records department says. You and I both spent a lot of time and effort obtaining my records, and neither of us deserves to go through that headache again, nor should we have to. We did our jobs, but what happened with the medical records department in your building? They're the ones who need to figure this out. It also makes me really uncomfortable that my whole medical record is just sitting somewhere in their office or whatnot and isn't in my file where it should be. Also, I can see the state ""T"" doctor's office saying that they no longer have the records since they already sent them to you and they got rid of my file, knowing them, but the main point is that it's not their fault either. This is something that the medical records team in your office needs to figure out because this is something really important.""

I wrote that a few days ago and haven't heard back (yet.) I hope I'm proven wrong, but all evidence is pointing toward the secretary telling me that medical records is so sorry but just has no idea what happened to my file after she sent it to them and all we can do is call the state ""T"" office to ask for my records again, which she is happy to do so I don't have to deal with it. But that's not the point. Medical Records dropped the ball and I want them to make this right. Is that not realistic though? Do I have any other recourse?

I'm a reasonable person and understand that mistakes happen. If they had ordered the wrong size folders for medical records or something, then that happens. That doesn't hurt anyone. However, with such sensitive matters such as losing someone's entire medical file, that's unacceptable. I'm a teacher and I just imagine myself saying ""Oh, sorry, but I lost your child's Epipen and the medical instructions you provided me with..... could you get me another one?"" Or ""Yeah, I know you gave me the paperwork for your child's Diabetes and their restrictions and accommodations... I don't know what happened. My desk was a mess and I must have tossed it with what I thought was junk."" Yeah, that would not fly. So in this case I definitely don't think it should be okay since it's my entire medical record and their job is to put it in the right place.

Have you ever heard of a medical record being lost before?

I really don't want to change doctors because I like this practice and don't want to go through the effort of transferring all my stuff again. Plus I've been happy with the doctor, NP, secretary, etc and it's very close to my house. I don't want to have to leave because one part of their office made a mistake.

Sorry this is so long. I appreciate any help. Thank you!",17Aug2019,1
663,"OK. I'm much like your average geek; I play video games, read comics, use the computer too much, etc. Only I'm transgender (non-binary.) My life might sound normal to you all, but ever since this past June, I've been distraught.

&amp;#x200B;

See, I have a fetish for the inside of people's bodies; specifically people shrinking and traveling into bodies a la Fantastic Voyage. IDK why I have this fetish. It stems from an episode of SpongeBob I liked when I was younger, and that's all I know. I'm not into vore, but I'm into this. Anyway, there's a comic I read where a villain who had the ability to shrink went inside a person's body to kill them. But WE DIDN'T SEE THE VILLAIN INSIDE THE PERSON. We only saw them exiting the body. And of course, I got angry that they didn't show the innards and only described it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The villain killed another person from their inside their body, but I know that because of the scene I saw, they wouldn't show inside either. The worst part has to be that the villain can't go inside a black man's body because of some stupid shit that could easily be bypassed, and if you knew me, you'd know I find black men INCREDIBLY SEXY. But of course, if the villain did go inside the black man's body, you wouldn't see inside like the other two scenes. And that just makes it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been perseverating on this comic for the past two months and I'm wondering if I'm alone in this fetish. All I can find is vore, and I get no results when I search ""fetish for inside of people's bodies."" My mom won't let me see a therapist because my dad's insurance won't cover it, and at least I'm going to get counseling at school. I've tried everything I can to get rid of this fetish because it is destroying my life, and it sounds like serial killer bullshit even.

668,"So, let me share three  background of this story. 

I'm a single child. I lost my dad at 7 and my mother had to work for long hours. So I grew up lonely. But never felt that way then. Need to thank my mom for taking such good care of me. 
Had to move to a different state for undergrad, had difficulties in coping with the distance from my mom for the first year, but got adjusted. Thought love and girlfriends were for grownups and didn't even approach a few girls I liked. Then I joined masters. 

In my post grad, made a group of friends. Had crush on one of the girls in that group. Told her. She didn't say anything but was giving me negative hints from the beginning. Thought I could convince her, but didn't happen. And from chatting everyday, we went to not talking to each other at all. Even though it was difficult, I tried to manage (She was the first girl I approached in my life). But slowly all the other people of my friends group stopped inviting me for parties and hangout sessions. I talked with them and said it was hurting me, twice. They said that those hangouts were impromptu ones and said they wouldn't  stop hanging out just because of the thing  I had with my crush. But they had a lot of parties and outings without me and noone  even talks to me now unless there is a need. Those guys are still hanging out all the time and don't even care to talk to me even when I'm right in front of them.

669,"okay, so I am a teen at the age of 17/M. I recently graduated school with an excellent grade. There is only a month remaining for college and I have no idea, what I am going to study in college, I have thought about everything and asked a lot of people, unfortunately everyone was helping me based on their own expertise. Also there are a lot of factors that limit my choice so basically I haven't decided yet. Which means I am just gonna go with whatever is on my mind when the college registration deadline approaches. I only know for sure that I'm moving to a different country  for college.

That was the first issue that made a mess in my life even though I've been thinking about what i wanted to study since the beginning of my senior year. The other problem I'm facing right now is my free time. With one month remaining to college I have nothing to do atm. No hobbies, no job, and most importantly, no friends to hang out with. I am not that of a social person nor am I that anti-social. I just don't go out much (as i have no business to do outside of my house and also nothing really that fun to do outside without friends in my country) which lead to me not having real friends. Whenever i try to go out with my friends and spend time with them its just a one time thing and they don't hang out with me anymore. Maybe it's because of my personality or I'm not just that fun of a person. So basically I have no one to talk to.

If you are wondering why don't i pursue any hobbies it's because I don't  have any. My parents aren't being really helpful on that matter. They always want me to go with my father to his company and do whatever he's doing or wants me to do, which is not going to happen because i have 0% interest in my fathers field of work. Even after refusing they keep asking me to do so and they aren't recommending anything else to me, because they think I'm being a child about it. Because they have tried me before by paying for graphic design courses which I liked at first, but hated then because it turns out they're online courses that are recorded, and I have to listen to at an institution which was extremely boring so i stopped going. They also tried buying me a drawing tablet for digital art which I also liked, but was extremely hard so i stopped after a while of not being able to draw anything. After these two hobbies me and my parents knew that i was the kind of person to get bored easily. After that they stopped trying with anything else and just told me to go with my father to his work, and if I didn't they would just keep blaming and shaming me for sitting home and doing nothing. I am the kind of person that likes to learn new things, but i can't find anything to fill my time now, or in the future.

Sorry if this was long with boring details, I just wanted to get it off my chest since i had no one to talk to. Also please Excuse my English as its not my first language.",17Aug2019,1

I live in an apartment complex and there‚Äôs a parking garage for residents, each resident is assigned a specific parking spot. It‚Äôs a standard closed lot and I drive a small car, so does the person who‚Äôs assigned to spot next to mine. 

A few times a week they park so close to my car on the left side that I have to climb over from the passenger seat just so I can get in. I‚Äôve asked them many times to be more mindful considering the spot is big and their car is small, they have no reason to block me out like that. 

Last night things took a turn for the absolute worst. Another day of climbing in from the passenger seat just so I can get into the drivers seat had happened, I came home, parked and a few hours later I returned to my car to find a massive dent on the drivers door, it certainly wasn‚Äôt there hours prior. They obviously opened their door too wide and hit mine, which is fine, shit happens, but leave a note and take financial responsibility. 

I know which apartment they live in so I knocked on their door. They didn‚Äôt answer so I decided to leave a note on their windshield that said I will be taking legal action if they do not fix what they have done. 

I had a date last night and was honestly embarrassed of the massive dent in my door, it is such an eye sore and makes me look like a wreckless driver. With only a few hours before the date left I decided to try and plunger out the dent. If you‚Äôve never heard of this method, it can really work (not always) you basically apply the plunger to the dent and pull it back the same way you would when using a plunger in a toilet. The suction can take the dent out. 

The jackass neighbor who dented the car has a kid that‚Äôs in high school and he‚Äôs a little devil. Him and his friends who honestly seemed drunk went to get into their car while I was plunging mine. The kid really had the audacity to loudly say to his friends ‚Äúsomeone tell this bitch that‚Äôs a car, not a toilet!‚Äù My blood came to a full boil. He hopped in the car with his little friends and dangerously sped out of the garage. While he sped away the note I had left on the windshield went flying into the air. I picked it up off the garage floor in defeat. 

I went to management and they told me that they can‚Äôt help me in this type of situation as car accidents are a ‚Äúmatter of the courts‚Äù - I suppose they are right. So now what am I supposed to do, call the police? It all feels so petty and dumb. One thing did work out well for me though - management told me that a resident is moving out next month and that I can have their parking spot. What do I do until then and what do I do about the massive dent in my car? I don‚Äôt have the money to fix that and I don‚Äôt feel like I should have to pay for it either. :(",17Aug2019,2
677,"I've been working at this company for a little over a year. Its your usual hardware, lumber, and appliance store part of a relatively small chain but it's big in my area. I started off part time with starting pay of 9 dollars an hour. Every six months the company does a evaluation and it's typical during that time you get a raise. Come time for mine I do the self evaluation part and a few weeks later I get called up to the office. I'm sitting with the store manager and we go over how the self evaluation went. We talk and he says my self evaluation was very articulate and that everyone he's talked to about my work ethic has said I'm a great worker and that many have said I might even be one of the best. He says I have a bright future working there and gives me a .50 raise which is pretty standard for the company.

Time to around April and the assistant manager asks if I would be *interested* in a supervisor position in the yard along with our other two supervisors that help operate the yard. I say yes despite some hesitance as the position required me to be full time.

Time skip some more. I'm unsure as to if I'm a supervisor so I ask around. The other supervisors say John has told them I am now a supervisor. The yard manager says I am. Even some employees know I am. Problem is the the store manager doesn't know I am one. I went and asked said store manager and he said that last he spoke with John about my current position is from back in February when they where going to consider putting me inside working two aisles of the main store. And that I should get with the assistant manager and ask him to make sure I was a supervisor. Saying something along the lines of you gotta Wear a crown before you reap the reward or something like that. 

After speaking with the yard manager he asks the assistant manager with me standing right there if I am a supervisor and he says yes. 

I've not received my year evaluation yet and received the typical .50 cent raise that usually comes with. I've also heard from people usually when you move to full time you also get a dollar raise. (I'm also full time but not getting offered the benefits the company is supposed to offer) as well as working as a supervisor despite not having received any type of raise for the position. And I think it's mostly due to the assistant manager. What should I do?

*Extra info*

This job has a very high turnover rate. It's highly physical work and occurs in high temperatures with high humidity. We are also exposed to cold temperatures in the winter and year round rain.

I'm full time but also a part time student so the two days of the week I get off are dedicated to school and my other free time after I get off work is dedicated to my martial arts training. I've been under a lot of stress due to school starting up soon and my competitive training.

There is also a lot of back stabbing and position movement right now as the assistant manager is taking people out of the yard and moving them to other locations as well with some quitting. We are about to lose one supervisor. 

It's common for me to be the only one opening (or with one other person and I usually think we need a minimum of three) which is when we get pretty busy due to contractors coming in with large loads of supplies.

Most of the hires are lazy so I end up feeling like I'm pulling 40-50% of the entire yards work load.

At one point almost the entire crew I started with all quit one after the other and it left me one week working 50 hours almost entirely by myself.

Senior year I wasn't accepted to my dream school so I decided I'd go to my safety school and transfer after a year, all the while, I did the med school track and did ROTC (""Oh I'll be a surgeon in the air force!"" Wtf was I thinking...). I got accepted to one of my dream schools for transfer admission but turned it down (1st thing I did in maybe being less ambitious) after seeing the price tag and feeling the bite of tuition my first year. I stayed at my uni, dropped ROTC (Second thing I did, being less ambitious) because I wasn't feeling it. And then I dragged my feet sophomore and junior year until I finally dropped the med track because I wasn't feeling it either (3rd thing I did in being less ambitious). To be honest, I think to myself now, I think I would be satisfied as an accountant or some sort of financial analyst.

685,"Sorry for the length!

My ex and I broke up last September. It was amicable at first, but turned hostile about two months later and no contact since. Most of what's written here was written about a year ago for another advice post, so the present tense is now uncertain for some things.

Almost a year into the relationship, he confided in me his darkest secret, that he made me swear to never tell another soul. Besides, we were in love and expected to be together forever.

When he was around 14, him and his mom moved to a new state. He became depressed, obese, and lonely. His mom made quick friends with the local priest. This priest had a son. He would have been.... around 5 or 6?

I'm gonna call the ex Mark and the boy Phil.

Mark began to babysit Phil. I wasn't given a timeline of when it started, but he told me he would sit him on his lap to watch tv or play video games or whatever, and put his hand down Phil's pants.

He insists he didn't do anything else. No pulling off of clothes, touching himself, showing himself, etc.

But he said this went on for a couple years. Maybe once a month? He was very uncomfortable sharing the specifics like that.

What's worse, he's still very close with Phil and the priest. His mother is best friend's with the priest, talking and seeing each other almost every day.

Phil is a lovely boy. He's now around 13 or 14. Very funny, sweet, cute kid.

Hearing this made me sob. He began to sob as well, saying he has felt guilty for years and has almost turned himself in many times. That he tries to be a better person and the thought disgusts him now and he would never do anything like that again.

I almost broke up with him on the spot, and continued to struggle with this information from time to time.

I didn't let them alone in a room after that. It just made me feel weird. And I kept a close eye on Phil, to see if he showed any sort of signs of remembering or just issues in general.

Mark was now super sweet and didn't show signs of being a bad person. So I just tried to think that people can change and that plenty of people have made mistakes. Even horrible ones.

I told my best friend when we broke up. She was horrified.  
I told my therapist that something happened with a kid, she stopped me and said if I went any further, she'd have to file a report. She said it would probably be the right thing to do, though.  
I had come to you guys for advice and ended up filing. However, the report came back a couple months later as unfounded. I broke down and have felt like a piece of shit about it since, cause I should have done something when I actually had the chance to and I'll forever feel guilty about this.

I had given the priest's info in the report. The man never liked me, so it was possible he said I was just a psycho ex and of course that didn't happen. Or Mark denied it.

I know nothing happened about it because a month after that (Feb of this year) his best friend spoke to me and mentioned that Mark had a new girlfriend and he was in town visiting him.

I'll be leaving the east coast this winter and this area in October. I feel like I should make one last effort about all of this before I leave, but I'm not entirely sure what I should do.

I was the weird victim of movie-like bullying in school. I was raised to be really obedient and submissive, which meant i was happy to do whatever my bullies wanted.

We are from two different cultures which is important to say, but our views from that seem to have led us to many same beliefs for the most part. 

We have discussed our future and we want to get married eventually. Talked about engagement, living together, all of that. When we talked about it, we discussed getting engaged by the end of this year to early next year. I assumed engagement before living together since we discussed engagement by end of this year to early next year and we have discussed living together starting next February since my lease on my apartment ends around then. He assumed we would live together first for awhile then get engaged.  Although we both acknowledge that we each assumed wrong, given the discussion, I don‚Äôt see how he assumed that given the timeline. I also thought I was clear that I wanted to be engaged first. 

Important info. I am religious and he is agnostic. Although his culture would really frown on living together before marriage. To the extent that if we lived together we would have to hide it from both our parents and my friends. He and I both agreed that it would have to be that way. 

I hate the idea of ‚Äúgiving in‚Äù as it were. I feel that he isn‚Äôt sure of me when I am for him. He says it would be for both of us to be sure and tries to frame it as being for me to. But I am sure. I have stayed over at his place for extended periods due to illness, recovery, and not living in the same city.

705,"Hey all. I'm a 19 year old guy who graduated high school last May. I decided to take a year off to ""figure things out"", and the end of that year is coming up fast. A year ago I thought I'd at least have some direction for the future. Well, turns out that's not the case.

As for what I did during my year off - I worked my high school job for about 4 months until they closed for the winter, spent a month doing nothing and being depressed, spent 5 months living away from home and getting trained to fight forest fires, and most recently have been working my old job again and building up a good (to me) savings.

I live in rural Florida. My parents want me to stay here and live with them and go to community college to get my associates degree. I don't mind the thought of going to college now, and I know it would be smart to not have rent or food payments during my first two years of school. It would be a practical decision to stay here for two more years.

This is where things get confusing for me. I know for a fact that what I really want to do is move to the west. Specifically Reno, NV. I don't want to stay in rural Florida where there isn't anything to do except sit at the beach and drink. I have no friends here and my girlfriend of 4 years just left for college last week. I feel like I would be miserable staying with my parents and having no life except school and some random part time job. I also don't want to spend 4 more years in Florida if I can help it.

I'm torn between doing the practical thing and staying here or taking my savings of almost $5k and making the move out west. If I did move, I'd stay in the city I decide on for at least a year so that I can gain residency and go to college in that state. Additionally, since I am a certified wildland firefighter, I can spend summers doing that to earn money to live.

Now I know I'm 19 and I hardly have a clue how challenging it can be to make it on my own. I feel like I've just hit one of those major crossroads in life and I don't want to make the ""wrong"" decision. Any advice or words of wisdom is appreciated.",17Aug2019,1
707,"So a couple of weeks ago my family had a trip to New York. It was going great until my backpack got stolen outside a convenience store. The backpacks contained my nintendo switch, 3ds, my laptop, and a crap ton of games. In total I probably lost about 1000 dollars worth of stuff.   


I was utterly devastated, as I worked minimum wage and wouldn't be replacing it all anytime soon. My parents really did do their best in trying to find it but to no avail. Easy to say the past few days have been one of the worst of my life. 

When we got back from the trip I was going out to at least replace my switch, but my parents stopped me. They said that it was good those video games were gone, and that they didn't need to be replaced. When I insisted, they took my wallet from me. 

At this point, I'm infuriated. Why should they have the right to decide how I spend my hard-earned money? In a fit of rage, I broke my mother's favorite lamp and ran away. I am now sitting in a Starbucks two miles away. I genuinely feel like a spoiled brat, as my parents had treated me well my entire life. I don't know how to approach them or how to apologize.

I may be overreacting here, but I don't know. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. In the beginning, we used to talk all the time.

I was never a call person, but he used to want to call all the time and it got me to open up to calls more. He had depression when I first met him, but as time passed, it got worse. His parents don't make it any easier for him.

He used to bottle things up, never talk, always stuck to himself. Until he met me. He opened up to me, slowly but, definitely more than he has ever opened up to anyone else before. And I opened up to him. 

Lately, he's been breaking down a lot, and I've been trying to be as supportive as I can. I'm always careful about what I say to him.

But he hasn't called once in almost a month now. Maybe more. And it's a long distance relationship. Even when we were living in the same country, I hardly ever saw him. I'd always have to drag him out. 

So I asked him to call tonight. He refused, but I asked again. Basically begged. He replied with ""I can't be bothered anymore"" and just went offline.

Mom

Her now ex (labled as J)

My sister

Sorry for poor formatting, on my phone and writing In secret, haha

So, here's the story. Mom was in a relationship with J for three years, to the point of J practically living with us. We had 2 dogs, him, my sister, my mom and I. He was the first descent guy she's ever been with, and she's really not doing well. J took the dogs, his two game stations, and most of the stuffed animals he got her. His reasons for leaving are 

1) she can't approach j without j feeling attacked. No matter the tone or topic (ask to clean up after himself, buy half of groceries, do laundry, ECT.)

2) he doesnt want the responcibility. He had to pick my sister and i up from school 3 days a week, and occosionally feed the dogs. Thats it

3) he just wants to work, then fish, then go home. He doesn't want to be responsible at all, pay bills, clean up, cook, be home by a certain time, ect. 

Mom felt ok even though she knew in less than 5 years, she's gonna be in this empty house alone, because she had him and the dogs. Now, theres nothing past those 5 years and she's scared. What should i tell her? What I've already said

-the brake up isnt your fault in any way

-im always here if you need me

-we can get new pets (so the house isn't as empty)

I will be starting my certificate in political science, which takes a year to complete, or two semesters to be more exact. I will hopefully try to go to law school afterwards.

I currently live with my parents so I have no bills to pay besides my phone (80$ a month). At 12,50$/hour at the job I hold down right now I could pay off all that debt in 3 months and have some money left to pay my tuition myself like a grown man instead of having my mom pay for it.

728,"For background, my family are first-generation immigrants from Bulgaria who came here with me and (25M) brother when we were very little. (Around elementary school age) We've visited back and forth to Bulgaria during the summers whenever we could, and even lived apart for awhile (~2 years) after our parent's divorce but have spent most of our lives in this house so you can practically call it me and my brother's childhood home. 

Although, the house has had alot of bad history since the divorce. After our (55M) father left for another state and our mother remained in it by herself for some 2 years, my brother went to live with him and I left for Bulgaria during that time, respectively. When we returned, my brother had gotten very severe anger management problems from my father's abusive and controlling upbringing and my mother had also taken the divorce very badly, so it became an extremely dysfunctional household (such as being assaulted and threatened by my brother on multiple occasions, constant shouting matches, fights between him, me, and my mother that would get physical, holes being kicked and punched in the wall, etc.)  

This continued until after I had finished my first year of high school and (47M) stepdad came in the picture. Because of him, alot of the 
stress and burden managing the house was able to be lifted off my 
mom. He was also able to guide my brother into finding a job and thanks to his help, both she and my brother mellowed out alot more. The house would have something constantly breaking (microwave, toilet, fridge, sink, lights, etc.) because of how old it was and he would help repair it for us.  He even renovated the bathroom me and my brother shared, as well as my room completely (Which was nice, because I had never had a ""teenage"" room I could call my own before.)

Despite the improvements, the house continued to be a burden on my mother because she has wanted to move back to Bulgaria for a long time, and it will take another 10 years for it to be fully paid off and go in her name. She has been working a job that she really 
hates for the past several years, where we have barely made ends meet multiple times, and now that me and my brother should be responsible, independent adults she is thinking more about selling it.

My brother works and has his own car at this point, and just remains behind to help pay the bills for the house, so he would have no problem moving out if need be. I'm much more lacking in independence, due to having been scared to do things like get a job and drive because of the severe social anxiety I had always had. Only this past year or so I had began making improvements, by getting a job and my license, and re-taking classes after almost dropping out of college. Although I still have no car and I lost my job, so I feel like I was put back at square 1.  

Her decision to sell the house has been getting even stronger since (80F) grandmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2017 and my (81M) grandfather has also been getting in increasingly poor health from years of heavy drinking. She naturally wants to be as close to our grandparents as possible during these times, as they have no other proper caretaker. 

Due to lacking so much independence, I would likely have no choice but to stay behind in Bulgaria with her if she does sell the house, although she is telling me she will provide a year's worth of rent for me if she does sell it. She has had very bad financial history with her spending habits in the past and continues being in heavy credit card debt today, so we are doubting if the money would be enough for her to move back. This also makes me find her ""help"" for me to move out more unreliable, if something goes wrong, and I'm very concerned whether or not I might end up on the streets because of it. 

Because of time running out, I'd like to find a part-time job to do while going to school again immediately once we go back to the U.S., from our current summer vacation in Bulgaria.  Although I had set such a goal for myself before finding my last job, and I had only gotten it due to a friend putting in a good word for me. I spent months before that going to endless interviews, being turned away from even retail and fast-food jobs because of ""no experience"". I'm afraid this will happen again and that I won't be able to get myself together for my mother who is looking to sell the house any day now, before that. 

There is the other huge issue (Hence the title) that I still have some sort of emotional attachment to it due to spending so much of my life in it, despite all the bad history, but everyone else in my family is also agreeing that it should be sold. I also find selling it too cold and cruel, since it was only a few years ago my stepdad put all that work in helping renovate it. To see it get sold like it's nothing but more money in someone's pocket now breaks my heart. 

At the same time, I would really like to move out and I could see it as a way to force me into being more independent. I'm just scared that my mother would take the route of sending me to my father instead, who is still very controlling and toxic, and this would also make me have to leave the local university I currently want to attend. (I've already taken care of the financial aid I need it for it, registered for classes, and everything else.) 

Is there anything I can do to have her keep the house, since it might be irresponsible and too cruel for her to sell it? 

**TL;DR:** Clock is ticking for my grandparents so mother wants to sell our very old house to move back to Bulgaria and be with them, ASAP. I still love the house too much but am also heavily dependent on my mother, so I'm scared what'll happen to me without it.

730,"I'm apologizing in advance if this is a stupid question, I'm legitimately confused on what I should do.

Some backstory: I'm 16 years old, in school, and my dad works in a field that allows him to employ my brother and I (we're not taking advantage of this, we're his hardest workers according to him). Over the summer I made quite a bit of money working, about $1600. I put $1000 of that into savings, $300 into checking, and bought car parts and a few other things with the other $300. 

About a month ago, my car wasn't functioning, so I asked my dad if I could borrow his truck to get something from the store to fix it. Now, I normally drive very small car, so I have to drive very differently when in anything larger than that. On my way to the store, I had to make a tight right turn in which I would usually use both lanes (long truck), but somebody was in the opposite lane. This led to me short cutting the turn and scraping the side of the truck on a telephone pole. 

The damage on the body was quoted at around $1400, excluding the $360 I already paid for a new door. He only has liability insurance on it because he ""trusts himself"", so we have to pay out of pocket for this. I realize that this is 100% my fault, but is it fair for him to have me pay him $120 each month while I'm in school for the remaining year until I move out to go to college? He makes about 80-100k a year if that's important.",17Aug2019,1

733,"My mother hates me with every fiber of her being. She regrets having children and thinks we are a hinderance to her as she wants to be reckless and disregard others.  

But I'm not always aware of this, she does things for me just to use them against me later. One of these things was allowing me to live with her. I am going to college soon, it is a pretty big university, and it is nearby. I somehow got accepted with a full ride that would cover the entire tuition, but it doesn't cover room and board. Luckily, my college has a rule where if you are within a certain radius of the school, you are allowed to commute rather than live on campus as is typically required. My mother agreed to this.

She is going on a date with a very abusive person tonight who messed up my sibling and I's lives. I didn't say anything to her. I just cried. I have cried around her maybe 5 times. I apologized for crying. She is kicking me out now for ""guilt-tripping her"".

734,"I've been having some issues with my mom (F17, live with mom only, stepdad lives an hour away, father not in the picture) Lately she's been so awful to me. I'm autistic and have pretty bad anxiety (I take medication for it) and a few years ago we moved away from the area where I was bullied as a kid into a lovely place where I have always felt safe.

Oh well, so I'm writing this from our only bathroom where I have currently locked myself in as a protest to her treatment of me. About a week ago she made me so upset by her blatant lack of care for my mental well being that I decided not to talk for her for an entire day and then I kinda ""ran away from home"" for a few hours. She didn't care. Came home, we tried to talk about it, I gave up and decided that I was gonna try to move on from that day. Thought she might have learned and understood not to do after all that, ya know? Well no. Earlier this week she came to me showing off an apartment 5min away from ours that she wanted us to move to. I didn't want to, as it would limit the space in my room and also mess up my route to school a bit. It'd also cause so much stress in my life to move right now that I believe it might send me to a breakdown again (had one last autumn, couldn't handle school for weeks). I couldn't stop crying for an hour while we talked about it. At the end she promised me we weren't moving, which I felt was really important. She showed empathy for me, something that has been lacking in her quite a lot lately. Today I'd had a long day with my boyfriend and his friends doing a bunch of stuff and I was soooooooooo socially exhausted afterwards. I was so tired, I just wanted to go home, have some candy, and sleep. But no. On the way home she starts talking about ""our future move"". I question her about it, she acts like my earlier meltdown didn't even happen. Like it didn't even matter to her how I felt. It seems how I feel never matters to her now days. It's not just that she's trying to force me to move from the only room/apartment I have ever felt safe in, it's also that I feel betrayed. She promised me. She knew how important this was to me but

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't care. It's like it doesn't matter to her what I say or how I feel. It's so odd, it always used to matter to her. I don't understand what I've done wrong to her to deserve this treatment. So now I sit here, locked in a bathroom uncontrollably sobbing while she's just in our living room, not giving a crap. If it was my child doing that I'd be by the door the entire time. I'd talk to her. A lil while ago she started texting me, just the same crap she always gives me ""You are impossible to talk to when you are anxious"" ""yea but what about me?"" Yea mom, but what about me then? Can't we just continue coexisting in the place where we have always both mattered???? And then she hits me with probably the meanest thing she could've said to me.

""Maybe you could find it easier to live in one of those autistic care houses?"". She's done this before. She knows how much it hurts. I'm very high-functioning, I don't need it at all. Even my therapist says it's very mean and wrong of her to say such things to me. I don't know what to do. What do I do to handle this situation? How do I make her understand my point?

Anyway it's some strange woman dressed all in black (jacket, trousers and trainers). She knocked, called someone on her phone, then went round the back of our house where we have a big iron gate that leads to the garden. This is always padlocked. So after trying the gate she returns to the front door and knocks again, only this time after knocking she tries the door handle, obviously it's locked. Then she goes round the back again and tries the gate for a second time. After this she returns to the front door, stands there on the phone to someone and then leaves in her black SUV.

739,"Hello everyone! 

I am an incoming junior in high school. I am considering graduating a year early by means of taking classes at the local Junior College. I don't have issues academically and have performed well in advanced classes so far. I'm considering this option because I'm very anxious socially; although I have some close friends at school that I really care about, I just generally don't feel comfortable at school or interacting with people. Part of me wishes that I could push myself to interact more with others, and therefore get invited to parties and social events, but I can't get myself to do that and I don't want to jeopardize my academic success. In many regards, high school seems pointless. Although I try my best and succeed (understanding I'm lucky to have access to education), I resent the American education system and the emphasis it puts on test-taking, and want to escape it. 

I recently took physics at the local Junior College, and it was really nice. I didn't really make any friends or interact with others but everyone felt a lot less judgemental there and the teacher was wonderful. My boyfriend is a year older than me and graduated early last year. Now he suggests that I do the same. However, I would have to balance my AP/Honors classes with supplementary courses at the JC in order to meet the graduation requirements. Also, the JC track generally leads to attending state colleges, and my parents want me to aim for what they view as a higher-level college and that wouldn't be possible. I'd also probably lose some contact with the close friends I have. 

Basically, I don't know if I should try to graduate early or not. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much in advance.",17Aug2019,1

745,"Sorry, long post. There will be a TL;DR but you may have to read the ""Key Facts"" for a better idea. I'm kinda panicking bc I need to figure out what to do before Monday. 

**Okay, a bit of background:**

The company I work for is extremely disorganized. I'm a new temp working at a store and they kinda just dropped us all on the floor with the notion of ""do work"". Another temp and myself were practically thrust onto the registers with the managers floating about or constantly in the office doing f all while we had to rely on a senior coworker to help guide us through. There's no proper training session aside from these audio logs about the company, nothing about training in store and hands on work. It's just audio logs about ""THIS COMPANY IS WONDERFUL----""

In addition, one manager is completely forgetful and will occasionally not bring back paperwork for a special type of account. The other managers are either non-existent or just flat out all over the place. I'VE HAVE BEEN HERE A WEEK AND A MAJOR WEEK IS NEXT WEEK WHICH MEANS MANY CUSTOMERS AND ME ON THE REGISTER OR PLEASE BY ALL THE GODS ABOVE LET ME BE ON THE FLOOR.

Alright, with that said. The situation I'm asking advice is in the topic title. I'm extremely good at math, so much so that I've received rewards for excelling in the subject, and I'm called in to the office to say there has been a shortage on two registers that I have been the last on. I'm asked about how I count out money, etc, you know, and then they hit me straight away by saying this has happened TWICE and one more time and I will be FIRED. I know very well that I didn't miscalculate anywhere, I'm not fully relying on my head to do math unless for change bc change. I make sure to recount the money a million times to both myself and the customer to make sure everything is in order, standard counting out bills before they get to the register and after several times. There were no other explanations except for the argument of ""I was the last one on the register""

**Key Facts:**

\-The Registers are all shared throughout the week before I get there for my shift.

   \- I have been on a total of 5 registers. 1 new (completely untouched and new money in the register) and 4 used (used by previous coworkers). Shortages

   \-The shortages were from 2 different registers ($40 and $60, iirc). If it was the new register, there could have been a high chance of the money sticking together which is understandable of me to overlook but the only major thing that was purchased with cash on the new register that I could remember were FOOD ITEMS. A total of four customers on that register purchased food with cash but the bills given to me were two customers with $5 bills and the remainder with $1. 

   \-The used registers were being shared with other coworkers. There's a repeated log of who comes on and off of the cashiers. Anything can happen to this register before I get to it and the argument against me is that all that's known is that I was the last one on the register. Someone could have made a mistake during their shift and due to the fact that the registers are shared, I believe there's no balancing of the drawers during shift changes. In addition because I'm new, I had to do my best to research about shortages bc no one at work told me about balancing and shortages. They didn't even take the time to check the drawers with me before I left WHICH I FOUND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO (I work until closing time) The new register was realistic and I would have taken responsibility for it if the shortage ended up on that one but that's only one of two that the shortages.

\-There are also cameras everywhere. They would have seen if I was mishandling money or if anyone else came to the register. I haven't left my register for more than a minute as I would just go straight to get my water bottle and come back.

\-Managers also hop onto random registers to complete transactions if one of us steps away. I've seen them ringing up customers on other peoples cashiers constantly.

\-I'm always touching base with them about the smallest things. If I buy something in the store, I run the receipt by the managers to look at and ask if they would like to see my bag even though they say they don't need to. As soon as I see something that looks remotely fishy on my end, I stop everything and go grab one of them to help with the issue. etc

\-I am unsure if this is a scare tactic to get people to fess up if they made a mistake and if they questioned my coworkers in the same manner. When talking about this with my family, my sister brought this point up.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I was questioned and marked down for shortages on shared tills and possibly one new register. None of the information I'm putting together makes sense. Their argument is ""Since you were last on register, this automatically defaults to you being the culprit"". Just because I'm the last one on register doesn't mean I'm responsible for the shortage. I'm planning on talking with them Monday to tell them of my findings and ask if the registers that had the shortages on were the new one or both the old one. I need help with how to proceed.

Should I talk to them or should I do what some other people say and suck it up and try to work on the registers and pray another shortage doesn't come up?",17Aug2019,1

748,"Hello, in advance, I have never been to this sub and don't know how things work here so apologies in advance for some mistakes

One of my very best friends has been really changing for what I believe to be the worse. To give context: We are both in high school, I'm about to start my senior year and she's going to be a junior. We became friends through the swim team that we train in together. She has always been an incredibly healthy person with a strict regime against things such as smoking, alcohol, etc. and lately a lot of shifts started taking place. My friend started to slow down on swimming, and instead of doing it on a professional level she wants it to be her less serious hobby. This is fine, of course, but what is more concerning to me is what followed. The last time I saw her was a month ago. Summer break happened, we were in different countries. Before that, she was staying over at a friend's house for about a week and she decided to go drinking a bit. She wasn't necessarily sober before, but I could maybe count on my one hand the amount of times she's consumed alcohol before, but still, I wasn't worried. However, this time, she got drunk. She asked one of the friends who were their with her if she could drive on a scooter. Luckily, they stopped her, but still, this was the first red flag. Then, on her instagram, I saw her posting a video of her with a wine glass. Fine, whatever, but still, it seemed weird to me. Then a few days ago, she calls me and tells me about how ""fucked"" she got the night before. Telling me about how she was smoking weed the night before and she got high. Yeah, I know, teenagers, weed, whatever, I wouldn't care if it was literally anyone else I know. But she told me that she was never ever going to smoke anything, because she didn't want to damage her lungs. I know she might've been going overboard, but still, this just isn't the same anymore. Now she went to this music festival with some people and she's been sending me weird-ass texts without responses, I can only guess under the influence of alcohol. She's there with people who we made FUN of together, saying how BAD their life decisions are.

I don't want to lose a friend. She's possibly one of the best people I know and I couldn't handle the thought of losing her to what has brought my uncle on the verge of dying a few weeks ago. Somebody help. What should I do? I'm so scared right now and I just can't have someone so important to me falling to something like this. Please, what can I do?",17Aug2019,1
749,"I'm completely baffled.. I don't know what I can do anymore. Sorry, this is a bit long, but please feel free to just skip to ""my question"" (3rd paragraph).

A little story about me:
I am 24 years old, a med student and I have been struggling ever since I started uni. I have failed 3 times, but since it's kind of a private uni it is still possible to continue for a definite amount of time. Why did I still continue, you may ask: a mixture of what was expected of me and because I didn't know what else to do/didn't want to do anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love medicine, I am especially interested in surgery and I am actually pretty good as much as we learned.

When I failed the first 2 times, I was very upset, but I could keep going; I have never failed this hard in my life and I was shocked, but I could still continue. Before failing for the 3rd time, I had a huge ""breakdown"" where, instead of being happy that I passed my last exam for the first semester, I found myself crying the whole day. And since then, the second semester has gone really bad.. I did go to classes/lectures, but when I came back home I was always on my bed, didn't have any motivation to do anything and by the time the year-end exams arrived I was crying on a everyday basis. It wrecked me so much, that I took a semester off and all I wanted to do was sleep, because everyday I woke up exhausted and sad, even though I didn't do anything at all. This continued on until I repeated the failed semester the following year, but I only made little progress (I.e. I still have one more exam to finish). I did get myself checked out for depression, but only very late. 

My question:
So my question would be.. in the case of having to drop out or giving up completely.. what shall I do then? Am I too late to have a successful career in my life? Should opt to start just part-time jobs and live that way until I can earn enough for a different degree? Is that even worth it? Has anyone ever done this/been in such a situation? 

I have wasted all my life doing ""what's right"" or  according to what I was taught, and only did things to please or what was expected of me: which is why I have never had a proper life outside of academics, even in university. I haven't experienced life at all and everyone around me is living their lives and enjoying, while the only thing I ever wanted was to get a good job as a doctor and live the rest of my life normally and peacefully.. away from expectations and judgement. And I worked hard, even if it meant to sacrifice my time socialising, just so that I get a job that I wanted.. but my life is shit and became even worse.. don't misunderstand, I expected med life to be difficult, and honestly I was ready to give up family and whatever ""social"" life I had.. but I never expected it to spiral down this bad.. and my breakdown just wrecked me so hard, I am still not motivated to do anything at all.. and I am scared  and will feel guilty of dropping out..

I‚Äôve found that so many people on there expect so much... ie. very sexual convos, meeting up the day we match, etc. Where as I‚Äôm the type of person who likes to chat for a couple days just like regular flirting or friendly to make sure I‚Äôm comfortable meeting these people... 

It seems like every time the conversation is going good with someone they either get mad because I say I‚Äôd rather get drinks on the weekend or whatever or they comment on my body and make me uncomfortable.

Ex. Of a convo I just had with a guy I‚Äôve been speaking to for a couple days.

At this point I told him I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable meeting up like we planned and he told me that he didn‚Äôt want to meet me anyways if I‚Äôm upset about his joke. I didn‚Äôt see this as a joke and this gave me some creepy vibes..

Am I being a prude? Is this just what flirting is like?

It's my 25th birthday in just over a week and I decided where I wanted to go with my family for my birthday including cousins etc. It's a Bar that has 2 bars, Ping pong tables, Pool tables, karaoke and beer pong. I want my parents to organise it for me but I am scared to talk to them about it for some reason. 

I have general anxiety disorder and my parents argue a lot in front of me and have done it for as long as I can remember. My guess is that I'm paranoid about other peoples opinions and form peoples opinions of myself and things I do and think about. i think I'm also afraid of talking to my parents and other people out of fear of what they might say. I don't know what to do about this situation, I love my parents and really want to do something big and fun for my birthday; they just had another argument and the whole house will probably feel awkward for the next couple days",17Aug2019,2

I know it‚Äôs kind of early to be planning my escape but I think that‚Äôs a good thing since I can add to my plan and improve as I age and it also gives me way more time to plan it out properly so that it actually works.


My parents don‚Äôt want me to leave. They would keep me with them forever if they could. Feels like I‚Äôm a bird trapped in a cage. They take me out to let me spread my wings every now and then, but just as I think I can fly, they shove me back in the cage with no way out. 


They are pretty religious, and also the type of parents that are shown on r/insaneparents (Not even an exaggeration, they are horrible parents, the type of people who shouldn‚Äôt even have kids)


I am not planning on telling them when I leave or where I go, which is for the best, trust me. 


I won‚Äôt go into detail about my parents or home situation but let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs filled with emotional and physical abuse and it‚Äôs enough to make me want to leave and never come back.


I have been planning for maybe 4 months, I have paragraphs after paragraphs on the note app on my phone on how to find an apartment and move out, what I‚Äôll need, how to save money, budget, pay bills and rent. The whole 50/30/20 budgeting thing I learned at school is there too. There‚Äôs also a lot more I can‚Äôt think of now but you get my gist I think. 


I‚Äôve only shown ‚Äúthe plan‚Äù to one friend who is 19 and he has helped how he can but he can‚Äôt offer much since he hasn‚Äôt moved out and doesn‚Äôt know much about it. 


I‚Äôll take advice from anyone who can provide it honestly. I need to improve my plan and make it so that it‚Äôll work. I know there are some holes but maybe they can be filled with help and advice. 


I‚Äôd appreciate if you kind strangers have any advice or tips you can offer me. Wish me luck?

761,"Hello Reddit

I‚Äôd like to apologise in advance for the abbreviations used in this post. Also, I hope I posted this on the right subreddit.

Furthermore, I‚Äôm using a throwaway here, just to be safe. I would be so grateful to anyone willing to help me here.

This story involves a cousin of my dads, who is my first cousin once removed (abbreviated as FCOR), his now ex-wife (my first cousin once removed-in law, abbreviated as FCOR-IL, if you will) and their two daughters, my second cousins.

Ever since my father and FCOR started getting into the same business and got closer, so did I get closer to my second cousins. I always greatly enjoyed it when we got to visit them. They certainly were one of my favourite relatives.

Fast forward to about 7 years ago. My FCOR and his wife, my FCOR-IL, divorced. From what I heard and could piece together, my FCOR-IL found out her husband, my FCOR, cheated on her. So she kicked him out of her house. Relations between him and his daughters, my 2nd cousins, completely turned sour.  Contact between them and our part of the family seemed to have completely ceased. I didn‚Äôt speak to them for a very long time.

Later on, when I created a profile on Instagram (sorry, I‚Äôm a normie), my 2nd cousins were among the first people I added. I had missed them so much by that time, I wanted to know what was up with them. Sure enough, they were nice enough to follow me back and the times I did speak with them via insta, our conversations were very nice and enjoyable! :)

I‚Äôve had very sporadic contact with them via insta and nothing really changed.

Fast forward again to this year. I‚Äôm going to a different city to go to university. This city happens to be the same city my 2nd cousins were born and have lived in for a long time. My choice to study there had nothing to do with them living there, though.

Fast forward for the last time. Their grandfather, my great uncle, died (God rest his soul). I saw them both at the funeral, but I just couldn‚Äôt get myself to talk to them, however badly I wanted to. But I just froze. They looked like they didn‚Äôt want that either, which may either have had to do with them being disconnected from our part of the family or my anxiety telling me they didn‚Äôt want me talk to them. Anyway, I only got to send them a DM via Instagram (once again, an apology for being a normie is in place here...)

So that brings us to the present. What can I do? I like them so much. I want to get back in contact with them. What is the best strategy to do so? Or should I just leave them? Most importantly, I just want redemption. I want this family drama over and done with.

Big thanks to anyone willing to help me!

But I ended up breaking down on the first day. 
There wasn‚Äôt one big thing that happened though that made it this way it was more of a bunch of smaller things that piled up onto me. 
One being stress due to me taking a couple college classes in one of the programs at my school. 
Another being I don‚Äôt have as many classes with friends this year. In freshmen year I had almost every class with at least one of my friends and it was great. I‚Äôm not going to act like freshmen year was amazing for me (I actually broke down the first day then too so...) but I enjoyed it. 
I also am stuck in a geometry class with mostly freshmen and only about three other tenth graders and I am extremely uncomfortable in class and I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong one or I‚Äôve been held back even though I haven‚Äôt. 
One of my close friends also recently had to move to the new school that opened in our district because they denied her transfer to continue going to her own school. I really miss her and it‚Äôs weird not seeing her every day. 
This is pretty much it, I‚Äôve only gone two days so far but I cried a bit the second, didn‚Äôt last as long though. It‚Äôs just putting a lot of stress and anxiety on me about what‚Äôs going to happen this year and I‚Äôm scared.

772,"First I'm gonna talk a bit about the backstory so people might have the information to give advice.

I got to know a girl about a year ago. Let's call her Anna for the sake of it. Anna and me got to know each other through friends that we had in common. We pretty much started to go out immediately. After about a month of hanging out together we were seeing each other almost every day. People thought we were gonna get together and people that got to know us thought that we were a couple. We were pretty honest about our feelings and clarified that there was no sexual interest nor any intention to become something more then friends. As I got to know her better she slowly opened up about her past. I was pretty shocked about some things. She was stalked and tied up by one of her ex boyfriends, she had an abortion at 17, she had to take medication and had to go to therapy. In the period where I got to know her she was off medication and said to me that her life was taking a good turn, as she felt better day by day. I always felt like she was a very impulsive person as every little inconvenience led to her almost throwing a tantrum. 2-3 months ago she wanted to confess me something. We met up and she told me that she had contact to one of her ex-boyfriends again (the one she had an abortion with). She was almost afraid of telling me since she thought I would hinder her decision, but I was calm and told her that whatever she does in her love-life isn't any of my business and as long as she's happy I'm happy. So I got to know her ex-boyfriend. 

Now comes the actual day that I wanted to talk about:

A couple of days ago I went to pickup a friend because we wanted to go to a bar to have a nice evening. She wanted to come along so I told her that I could pick her up. I drove to the cafe were she was waiting, my friend and I entered the cafe and she was very silent. She then suddently told me monotonously that she broke up with her boyfriend. I asked what happened and she told me that she would explain it someday. Since I didn't know how she really felt that evening I asked if we should do something else or just postpone the planned evening. She still wanted to go out with us so we started to drive to our location. She asked me if I could do her a favour. She asked if I could drive to her ex-boyfriends house because she wanted to talk to him. It was basically a 5 minute drive from where we were and I couldn't ever imagine what would unravel at that same night. I parked the car and she called him. He wasn't responding so she took my phone to call him. He still wasn't responding. She threw a fit, crying and screaming that I should find out where he is. I called him a couple of times, called friends. After 15 minutes I wanted to drive off since it didn't make any sense. As I started the car she started to pull me to the backseat where she was sitting, clinging onto my neck and screaming ""If you drive away I'm gonna cause a crash"" I drove like 200meters down the road where I couldn't drive any longer. I was shocked. She went from calm to throwing a tantrum in no time. In that moment her ex boyfriend called her. She screamed like there was no tomorrow, screaming things like ""how could you do this to me again?"" and ""you're gonna regret everything"" (note: she dumped him, not the other way around). She screamed at him to come out of the house or else she would ring the door bell (it was 1 AM) and at that moment I found out there was a restraining order filed against her from her ex boyfriends parents since she assaulted them at the door once. I tried to calm her down but she threw punches everywhere in the car. Ripped the backside of the co driver seat completely off. I couldn't calm her down for half an hour. After that time her ex boyfriend came out since you could clearly hear what was happening. They talked for like 5 minutes very peacefully and quietly. He then went back into his house and she was walking towards us (we were waiting in the car). She then asked for a key. I wasn't gonna give her the keys since I knew what she was going to do. She spit on me and sent me to hell. As she was walking towards her ex boyfriends car I got out of my car and tried to stop her. I knew she wasn't going to stop. Then she started to talk about things she had done and that scratching his car would be one of the ""less bad"" things that happened. She once stabbed a girl with a fork because she slept with his ex boyfriend. Threw hot grill charcoal onto someone. Threw stones into someones window etc. She still kept insulting me and threatening me that she would fuck my life up if I tried to stop her. I was about to lose my patience so I just turned away and drove home. 

I don't even know what I should do. My first defence mechanism in my head was to never have contact with her again. I was thinking about the things she has done to the ex boyfriends family and that she could/would to that to my family. I wasn't scared about her reaction and the actual tantrum that she threw but about the fact that she didn't calm down. I tried to calm her down for more then 2 1/2 hours and she still was in this blind rage, throwing punches and screaming like she was being kidnapped. I just didn't know what to do.

Over these summer holidays we were given almost 40 pages of work to do, which reflects the ridiculous amount I receive in regular school weeks. The subject is a constant burden on my mentality and I'm always worrying about my homework and performance. I have an option to switch it for supervised study which would allow me to focus on other subjects and remove the burden I feel from it, however I would only be taking 8 GCSEs afterwards (counting further maths and maths as one). I understand GCSEs aren't as crucial as they are made out to be but I don't want to be letting anyone down (my parents are wholly supportive of whichever option I choose, by the way).

The problem is, I was already given the option to leave several months ago and I chose to stay, thinking I could bear the burden for another year, since such a tough language GCSE would be another feather to my cap, however the workload and stress is now catching up to me. I would rather be putting more energy into subjects I have more motivation for, but it might be difficult to leave due to the previous choice I was given. Should I pursue dropping the subject, or stick it out for another year?",17Aug2019,1
791,"I think I‚Äôve come to the realization that I‚Äôm really someone who has moments where I just feel like I‚Äôm such a luck person, I‚Äôm awesome, etc, and then other times I‚Äôll feel like the most worthless piece of shit ever.

I kind of want to blame my parents and specifically my dad, bc as far as I can tell, thats where of the majority of the source comes from. I‚Äôve always described my dad as my bully growing up, and in school/highschool, I actually rarely had anyone try to pick on me, but my dad was such a dick that I think some of the things he‚Äôs said, have seeped inside me and I‚Äôve internalized them.

It makes me actually mad that he did this to me, and I remember asking myself why someone would act this way to their son. Calling them stupid, saying they can‚Äôt do anything, saying I‚Äôm a jackass, dumbass, my hairs fucked up, I‚Äôm not doing this right, I‚Äôm not doing that right, it makes me actually so mad, and I‚Äôm getting angry just typing this, bc he really did do this on a consistent basis. Type it out doesn‚Äôt really do it justice, but it‚Äôs just like having someone belittling you, bullying you, and trying to bring you down, really affects you, especially when they have power over you. 

Now that I‚Äôm older, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúshit no wonder I have problems‚Äù like he would try to hurt me every time with the things he said and how he treated me. I always thought the words rolled right off, but I was too depressed and fucked up to see how they affected me.

And that brings me to here, where I‚Äôm laying in bed right now, wondering why I feel so down, and depressed for really no reason. Im 19, I don‚Äôt really interact with him anymore and I‚Äôve kind of accepted that I‚Äôm never going to trust him, or let him into my life.

We live in the same house, I go to college while living at home, and I just wish I could escape the negativity, and move out, but it‚Äôs just too damn expensive in Southern California. I have a job right now and plan to save up to move out, but how can I solve my self esteem problems right now?

At this point I‚Äôm in a decent place objectively speaking, meaning I have friends, I workout, my grades are alright, but I still feel like shit, and worthless and alone some days. I feel like the only solution is to move out, and start building a whole different identity so that I can reverse all the damage that‚Äôs been done.

I‚Äôm just mad that I have to deal with all this damage to begin with, but how can I work out my problems in the meantime. What I‚Äôve been using to cope is weed, exercise, hanging with friends, and that type of stuff, but what else can I do?",17Aug2019,1
792,"After moving to the big city for school and making friends all over the world during my time here all I‚Äôve known is school and hanging out with my classmates. Now I graduated this week and had to see the life that I knew slowly disappear infront of me. Everyone I know leaving to their home country, and just not having the regular thing I knew (being in school) be apart of my life anymore had kind of left me in this weird haze where I don‚Äôt really know what to feel. I have a job lined up already which is great, but I feel as if the life I knew has now left me. I assume a lot of people have gone through similar things, and I am looking at ways to cope with this lost feeling I have now.",17Aug2019,2
793,"My dad left me and my mom before I was born and I've never met the man and hope I never do, for years it was me and my mom but when I was 10 she started dating this one man, who I thought was really nice and funny.  I really really liked him and I could tell my mom loved him.  He told me a couple times but not until I was about 12 did I even meet his son (who is one year older than me), when we first met each other I was pretty excited to have a ""brother"".  At 13 they got engaged and we started spending weekends and weeks at their house and we got to know each other other than 1 day visits, and he's a totally fine person but we have little in common and he can come off as someone who doesn't care sometimes.

The wedding was perfectly fine, but I was not really looking forward to moving in with them but my mom was happy so I was too.  I love my step dad, he's kind, funny and really has cares for me.  The problems come with his son, my mom and his dad forced us to hang out when we first moved in and it just made everything super awkward and I could feel he felt the same way. We kinda stopped hanging out, he's a totally fine person and we haven't had any big fights or arguments.  But every time he's home and we eat breakfast and dinner together I feel like I have a stranger just judging me even tho I know he's probably not.  I am now 16 and I got a job that keeps me away from the house and I started going to my friend's house till around dinner time cause I don't feel comfortable in my house.

TL;DR:My mom got married almost 4 years ago, me and her husband's son don't have much in common and I feel uncomfortable at my house so I stay away as long as I can.

I guess I'm asking if there are ways I can get over this, or is there something me and my step brother can do to get on better?",17Aug2019,1
794,"For some background - I was discharged from hospital today after trying to repeatedly take my own life over the past week or so.

I‚Äôve been through many periods of depression in the past but I feel like I‚Äôve finally reached a point where there is no value left in living anymore.

From when I wake up on most days I will just lie in bed and wait until I can go to sleep again, with the exception of getting up to eat and drink. I very rarely talk to other people and only have one or two people who I could even potentially message online if I wanted to

799,"I just graduated in Spring with a degree from a good university in chemistry and with lots of lab experience. Unfortunately, breaking into industry is difficult regardless of experience when it's not industry experience specifically. I got a couple of interviews, one of which went terrible but the job didn't appeal to me anyway. Another interview went very well and they literally called with an offer 3 hours later (and let down the apparent group of people they said they'd be interviewing this week??). It's 2nd shift and I'm a small young woman with a lot of friends and a boyfriend, which I'll probably lose, and it's a job that only requires an associates when I have a BS. The pay and benefits are fine, but I literally feel like this job is going to suck me into a black hole. All of my instrumental experience and data experience is going to fizzle out while I do this job and I can't back out since I've already filled out paperwork etc. Plus I'd burn every bridge ever.

My dad says if the party continues past 10 and it's loud he's calling the police. I'm worried for my bestfriend she's on thin ice with her mother. Im on thin ice with my parents as it is I've fought with them to see my bestfriend. I'm 18 I got no where to go and i have a feeling I'll be thrown out for me standing by my Bestfriends side. I'm already planning what I'll do if i get kicked out it. I'm concerned for my bestfriend becuase she'll most likely be arrested if the cop's show up and i won't see her for a long time. She's the only thing that is holding my fragile and partially broken life together. She genuinely cares about me and i genuinely care about her. I already know the probable outcome and it isn't pretty for both of us I'll end up to fend for myself and she'll be grounded or sent to her grand parents in another state.,17Aug2019,0

802,"I've been with my for 9 - 10months and for the past few months we've both been extremely stressed due to money issues and life events. We haven't been sexual for 4 months due to an unrelated injury of mine, which has now recovered, but I've gave the excuse of stress (partly true, for some reason the idea of it just makes me uncomfortable)

I feel extremely guilty and whilst I enjoy hanging out, I can feel I havent been emotionally fulfilling to her and it's taking a toll, the easy answer is to say 'break-up' however, 

1. We live together, and before we met she had difficulty paying rent 
2. She sold her TV so we can share mine, if I was to move out she literally wouldn't be able to afford a TV for herself 
3. I adore her family, I've never gotten on so well with a partners family before, and in many ways I'm more comfortable with them then my own

Most of all, we just got out a 3 year loan on a car and recently been let go from my job (was fired for looking for another job).

Each of these points are important to me, but I know I shouldn't be feeling this way especially before the one year mark. I really adore her to bits, but at the moment more of a friend, and it's all the intimacy that I can't provide her at the moment, and I fear it won't come back.

He dead from a car accident which killed him, plus the other car. Moving forward to the 2010s. My life with one brother and sister and one mother is quite normal ish I mean we have our up and downs but things are fine. So me I have a learning disability which is dyslexia. Now I don't know why but maybe because  of this learning disability that I've become emotional unstable.   With a bit of depression.

808,"I'll keep this brief.  I asked this on AskMen and it got removed. They told me to post here. 

I have a very small group of close friends. We are in our earlier 30s, same university, lived on same block, various stages of life. I grew up with 1 older sister, this bro grew up with 2 older brothers. Me and this bro have always been the closest. Well, a few months ago, a handful of us were drinking (pretty loose at this point), having a good time, and he went to get a beer. He came back and when he was returning, he walked behind my chair, and blindsided me with a fishhook. I froze, I didn't do anything, I had a bad experience in high school where a kid put me a chokehold. It wasn't a legit fishhook like ripping my face off, but it was 1 finger and tugging on my cheek. But my flight or fight just did nothing. I rolled it off initially, but the next day, I was so fucking conflicted. Do I say anything? Should I retaliate? etc. I did end up joking about it the next day in a group chat and he just rolled it off. I was mess. After I was literally spiraling insane, I decided to take a big step back from being there for him and my friends (calling for me to grow up). I think I had PTSD because I was a mess for a few weeks until I could get psych help.

So I am still conflicted, I don't know if I am being a nut about this or did it cross the line? I know he was wasted but his personality is ""alpha up"" flex on the guys, usually not me, I am the strongest one in the group. It just really took a toll on me, I felt betrayed, trust shattered from my closest bro. Over time, its been different, I have recognized I was putting myself out there in the group too much and not getting much in return. I can't talk to him about it because he will just say stop being a pussy, or its because you grew up with a sister. I question if he is jealous, his life isn't necessarily great by any means, he kinda failed to launch.

Did I do the right thing by distancing? Should I chalk it up to being drunk? or should I just distance myself from someone is trying to flex like that? Just had to get this off my chest. It just has never been the same since, not sure it will ever be.",17Aug2019,2

813,"I live in a wonderful small town in Wyoming which is populated mostly by religious Christians. I myself am a Christian, so I‚Äôm actively involved in the church community. The preacher is a really nice man and he has six kids, and I‚Äôve gotten to know his youngest daughter really well this summer. Let‚Äôs call her Laura. We both 19 year old college students and are both maths/physics nerds so we would meet up on the weekends (we both have jobs) and try solve theorems together, which was encouraged by mine and her parents who are very good friends with one another. It started off innocently enough. We‚Äôd study for two hours and then go for a walk in the woods by her house and sit by our favorite spot at a creek to ‚Äúrefresh our minds‚Äù and then come home and study a little more. Her dad told me that he trusts me and approves of our friendship (I assume because I go to church multiple times a week) and actually told my mom that he thinks we would make a good match as a couple.
One month into summer and I develop a serious crush on this girl. One weekend we went on our walk and she held my hand. I didn‚Äôt know what to think at first because I assumed it was just a friendly gesture. We reached our spot by the creek and sat down across from one another. She kept touching my thigh and leaning in when we‚Äôd talk, and she kept telling me how interesting she found me. My heart was beating so hard but I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was flirting at the time (looking back, it was painfully obvious that she was.) I eventually told her that I wanted to be more than just friends, and she kissed me. We made out for like an hour and then decided to head home. The next few weekends we‚Äôd study less and less and spend more time in the woods. She gave me oral sex the third time, and we started having sex around the fourth time. We were sitting on the sandy bank by the creek and it just sort of happened. We were both virgins and didn‚Äôt really know what we were doing. I remember thinking how pretty her breast were, how nice and warm it was inside her, her soft breath in my ears and her fingers digging into my back. I came quickly and pulled out a bit too late. 
We had sex again three more times over the next two weeks, our only form of contraception being pulling out. However, the week after that she told me that she was late and that she thinks I got her pregnant. She was crying and told me that it would look very bad if the preacher‚Äôs daughter fell pregnant out of wedlock. She did 10 home pregnancy tests and they‚Äôre all positive. She‚Äôs pregnant with my child. We both agree that we‚Äôre not having an abortion and we want to take responsibility and raise our child. I really care about her and I want this baby very much, and we‚Äôve decided to get married. We haven‚Äôt told our parents yet. I‚Äôll probably have to drop out of college and work as a farmhand full time to support our baby, and she‚Äôll have to drop our too. This will be a blow for our parents.
She wants to tell her parents about the engagement and then get married as soon as possible so that they don‚Äôt find out about our extramarital relations. I‚Äôm trying to convince her that this is a stupid plan and that lying will only make our lives harder, she‚Äôs already starting to show and it is obvious that we‚Äôre marrying for this reason. I think she‚Äôs just scared of how her parents react and about being the object of gossip for a while, but I also understand how scared she must be and I don‚Äôt want to put her under any more pressure than she already is under.

826,"(19/F/ also just starting college, living at home because I‚Äôm broke and need to save money). I have had three father figures in my life and each has done me so wrong.

My birth father: super close the whole time growing up, but has took a steep downfall into drugs and is now facing 10 years in prison. completely out of it every time I see him and rarely makes an effort to see me. I miss how close we used to be. 

My moms ex husband: Raised me from ages 2-12, gave me a ring as well at their wedding making a promise to always love me as his own. Right after the divorce, would scream at me. Call me names, did not allow me in his house, wants nothing to do with me. Still sees his actual daughters all the time and loves them dearly.

My moms current BF: I was always so trusting to him. So nice. We bought a house with him my sophomore year of HS and he and my mom got engaged. He has always been verbally abusive to her and when we moved in I would sit on the steps with 911 dialed in case he hurt her during fights. Eventually kicked us out and I had to move again right after making friends. Also just an asshole. 

With all of these I‚Äôm left wondering why I‚Äôm not enough??! Why aren‚Äôt I enough reason for my dad to want to get better? For my dad to want to see me? Why am I not enough for my moms ex husband to still care about me? To actually love me? Was he lying when he said he did? And why I am not enough for my moms current BF to try for me. Why does he not see how he‚Äôs hurt me and try? He will try to make me and my sisters happy when he knows it will make my mom happy. He tries for her, not for us.

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‚Äòohh...how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there‚Äô in a smiley way I didn‚Äôt Say anything. she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",17Aug2019,1
831,"My old best friend recently developed schizophrenia I found out last month after being invited to his party

Ever since then, he calls me 10-15 times a day every day, knocks on my door at my house. And acts crazy.

Idk what I should do but, I‚Äôm honestly afraid of him and the way he acts",17Aug2019,1
832,"(Copied from my entitledparents update post)

I went for a visit to my sisters to also have a catchup eith cousins and such. Great day. Went on a treetop course, had a meal, good time.


BUT AT DINNER. I GOT A (metaphorical) SUCKERPUNCH TO THE FACE.

(Talking about the family)

Sister 1: so me and sister 2 went to see brother 1 and brother 2 the other day!!!


Sister 2: brother 2 is so cuuuute!


Me and mum: **visible confusion**


S1: did dad not tell you?

NO. HE DIDNT. I HAVE HAD A SECOND YOUNGER BROTHER FOR OVER A MONTH AND HAVENT BEEN TOLD. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Not having a picture of brother 1, i can handle (not rly). Being bullied by dad, ive... learnt to handle. BUT NOT BEING TOLD ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A SECOND BROTHER. WHAAAAAAAT.

Also, do you think i should confront my dad by call, or pretend that i dknt know? Im at a loss. This whole thing is SERIOUSLY fucked up. I guess at least i can see the posotives, i got to see family, had fun and failed miserably at brawlhalla on my cousin's xbox. Cheerio all",17Aug2019,1
833,"So. I work on a floor with many people. I was in work today. Saturday. No one was there. As I walked into the office I saw a fiver next to someone's chair. I never talked to this person . We are in different departments different teams .. same floor though. I walk past her desk but never said hi because I mean I walk past many desk and don't say hi (we are about 100 people on this floor). Anyway. I saw the fiver. Took a photo. Put the fiver under her keyboard and saw her name on the phone. I sent her a message on Facebook telling her about the money and sending her the photo of where I found the fiver thinking that if it's not hers at least she'll know where I found the money so she can return it to one of her colleagues. I added her because I know those messages go to private and not many people see them. I would have expected her to say hi. Thanks. And that's it. I'm not interested to make friends or things like that. But ... She rejected the friend request without looking at the messages. Now the situation suddenly became creepy. Because I'm not sure if on Monday I should go by her desk and say ""hey have you found the fiver. I sent you a message yesterday that I've put it under your keyboard"" or just ... Ignore her and pretend nothing happened...",17Aug2019,2
834,"Hi, as the title says, I'm about to finish HS and I've come across the opportunity to finish those 2 years abroad and continue onte Uni there (I plan on going to Uni there anyways), the thing is that obviously I don't know anyone there more than my whole maternal family and my current school gives me a EU-Valid title.

Also and it's something that s somewhat important the economy in that country is much better than the one I'm now in.

I don't know what to do, do I take the opportunity abroad and abandon everything and everyone I know or do I spend the next 2 years suffering in my country (because I love that country) with the people I know &amp; have grown attached to and get that degree?

I really need other people not emotionally attached to me's advice &amp; opinion on the matter.",17Aug2019,2
835,"To start it off, I'm a 17 year old male. I love my parents, they're always there for me, and they go out of their way to provide for me. But I feel that they're too involved and I don't know what to do about it.

So, my family, extended included, are very conservative, as we live in Georgia. That being said, makes them very christian. I am not. I told my family I did not believe in god, and both of them started crying, and my mother said that she ""failed me, herself, and god."" Their response was to force me to pray every night, pray over the food, and go to church every sunday morning. The reason for me telling this is to say that I feel like I have no personal freedom. I'm not christian, but I feel like they're trying to force me to be one.

My parents, mother especially, loves to get very involved with my relationships. Currently, I'm not allowed to see my girlfriend (who I'm only ever able to see every other weekend) if I go out to be with my friends a decided amount of times throughout a week, because they feel I'm ""spending too much time with her."" They got very involved with my last relationship, and ultimately we had to split because they were setting too many boundaries and it was just screwing things up.

I'm not allowed to do my own laundry. I'm not allowed to cook. I don't know how to do either to any extent, besides microwaving leftovers, obviously. 

I told my mother I wanted more reaponsibility, and that I feel like she should be less involved with my relationships, to which she responded to by setting another rule that my phone must be turned in every night at 10:00, and setting a bedtime for me at 10:15 every night.

I feel so trapped and suffocated. I need advice on what I can do, badly. If anyone has any advice, please, share it. And... I know ""moving out as soon as you can"" is the obvious decision, but I have to endure one and a half more years of being here... I just need to know what I can do until then, because it just keeps getting worse.",17Aug2019,1
