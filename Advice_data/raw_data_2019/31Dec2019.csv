1,"My boyfriend is becoming abusive but I can't leave 

Okay so I (25f) have been in a relationship with ""Steve"" on and off since I was a teenager. 
When we were younger we would fight alot and were always ""that couple"". We both moved away for college and lost touch until we meet at a mutual friends wedding when I was 23.

Everything moved super fast after that. We got together after that and moved in together. I had no family (grew up with my mum who died in my second year of college) so ""We"" decided if move back with him.

Our house is in his name. The bills come in his name. Legally I have no right toy he house as far as I know. He convinced me to quit my fulltime job last year and now I only work part time. All my savings are gone becasue I put them towards the house. 

When we started fighting again I felt so stupid but brushed it off. It wasn't that big of a deal but then he got super controlling. 
He needs to know where I'm going when I leave the house. My pay checks go into ""our"" bank account that is used for bills(he has his own account and only puts a small part of his money into the joint account). 
When he drinks (No more than three or four times a month) he gets violent and has thrown things more then once.

I found out I was pregnant around two weeks ago. I'm worried that he'd hurt the baby when it's older. I don't know what to do. 

I have no money. I don't know anyone here. I can't stay in the house but I can't leave either. 

Is there any way I can save money? I don't think he'll hurt me when I'm pregnant but I am afraid of what will happen later.",31Dec2019,1
2,"Last night I (24 M) was drinking and hanging out with friends and at the end of the night went to sleep in my friend’s bed.  My best friend (call him J) asked to sleep there too since there weren’t many options and I said it’s cool since we do it pretty often when we stay at someone else’s house.  Then, our female friend (call her A) (who he has hooked up with before) came down and he asked her to hop in bed and I agreed that we could all spoon since we were all in a good mood and having fun.  I, perhaps stupidly, assumed everyone was just gonna go to bed since we were laughing and someone even suggested watching a movie.  Next thing I know, I thought that they were moving around a little more than just rolling in your sleep.  Mind you this is six inches away.  I wish I had said something right then but I waited a minute and when my suspicions were confirmed, I grabbed my stuff and Ubered home.  J apologized the next day and I told him I needed space.  I haven’t heard anything from A and she just snap chatted me at work like nothing was up.  

Personally, I feel disrespected more than anything.  Obviously, they crossed a line but I don’t want to lose two of my closest friends.  Normally, I choose forgiveness of holding a grudge but I just feel so stupid.  This is something I would never do to a friend and for two of my best friends to do it so nonchalantly was eye opening.  If they don’t respect me enough to treat me like I would treat them, what is my course of action?  I love them and don’t want to be the one to choose to end or suspend the friendship but I know I’ll feel so foolish around them.  

J is going back to the army in a couple days and he is my beat friend so I think we’ll eventually get through this but A and I have become very close friends in the past few months as I have tried to be there for her as she goes through a family tragedy.  A has always been nothing but kind to me but she did this without even considering that I might be upset and has acted like nothing happened.  I’m sure when I tell her how hurt I felt she will apologize immediately but I’m just not sure I’ll be able to feel comfortable around her for awhile.  I don’t want to lose them but I also don’t want to feel this stupid and disrespected and I know being around them will make it worse.  What do I do from here?",31Dec2019,1
3,"2019 has been both an incredible year and a terrible year, but the past 3 months have been absolutely awful for me. Everything about my life has been either changed or totally disrupted in such a short time and because of this my mental health has taken a nosedive. I've been reflecting on this and realized I've just been content with my life and not happy at all. I want to change that. I think a change of work would be the best place to start.   


I'm 25 years old, dropped out of University for financial reasons, and absolutely passionate about illustration. Currently, I work as an overnight janitor for a grocery store making okish pay, but I'd much rather be working in the art industry. Comic books, Animation, or Video Games are Ideal.  


Here is some of my work. [link!](https://imgur.com/a/f8dmON8)  


What can I do in the next year to land a job doing what I love by 2021? I'm looking for general tips or moves I can take to get me there. They can be about my art, networking, or anything really.  
 I don't know anyone from in any of these industries and don't know who to talk to or ask, or what I'm even qualified to do.   
I'm willing to do anything to make a change.",31Dec2019,1
4,She broke up with my after 2 years and found a new boyfriend for a month. I didn’t know till last week she found someone new but the whole 3 weeks before she still liked my stuff So I thought I would wait till she got home for break because she is in the air force. Then I found out and she kept saying she’s moved on and is happy and told everyone I just treated her bad. But today I rejoined twitter updated my pfp and retweeted some stuff and she was the first like I we don’t even follow each other. Whether she is trying to wiggle in and be friends or. Feels regret for her choice I am so confused any advice,31Dec2019,1
5,"I met this girl (A) during freshman year of high school, we instantly clicked and became really close. We became friends with a guy (B) and the three of us were inseparable during freshman and sophomore years of high school. 

During junior year (B) became friends with another group of people but he was still really friendly with us. (A) would sometimes talk about (B) behind his back. 

5 months pass and (A) starts making me feel really bad about myself, constantly side eyeing me, ignoring my texts, avoiding me, and even tried convincing a teacher that he wrongly graded my final paper because I got a better mark than her. I confronted her and she said she was just really focused on her studies and that nothing was wrong. 

I forgave her instantly, and we became close again. A month passed and she started being distant again. She became friends with (B)’s friend group, not (B) himself but the entirety of the group. She stopped replying to my texts, I texted her a few times asking what’s wrong and she just ignored me. I figured she might be dealing with some things and I let her know that I’m here if she needs anything. She’s really bright and social with everyone else but me. 

Junior year is almost over for me, and I will be transferring schools for senior year of high school, and everyone knows that. I’m just really confused as to what I did wrong, because it’s bothering me so much but she just seems happy. 

I recently realised that I deserve better than someone who will make me feel shitty about myself and always ignore me, it just bothers me so much that we were best friends for two years and now she’s treating me this way. I get nightmares about her listing why she doesn’t wanna be friends with me anymore, and it’s making me lose sleep. I don’t know what to do. 

I have friends that make me feel so comfortable and so welcomed and we have the most fun, outside of school, like I’m not hanging onto the friendship because I want a friend, but because I’m genuinely confused.",31Dec2019,1
6,"I was thinking how come as soon as someone says they have 0 interest in life people think they're depressed? What if you just don't have any joy but also don't want to harm yourself and don't want to die? Can someone be like this and technically not be classified as depressed or is much of the definition of depression the lack of enjoyment in life? I just think it's odd that life is supposed to be this amazing thing that everyone must love and if you aren't thrilled about it you must have something wrong with you. Maybe life just isn't that interesting, but you have no interest in dying either. We are animals who live to survive. Do you really need to derive enjoyment from that? Couldn't it be possible that for some people just surviving is a good enough reason to live?",31Dec2019,1
7,"This is my first time writing something like this and I still feel weird, I dont know if this is even worth writing down but I have to get it off my chest. I'm sorry if I'm not clear about something...


A little backstory, we've known eachother for 7 years now, and for the past year I have been attracted to him but never had the courage to tell him,   because i tought that it would mess up our friendship and he is a major player.


Fast forward to December, we  went out to have some drinks with some friends. We got drunk and he approached me and me being young and liking him a lot I  went with the flow.  We got to my house and made out. I knew the type of person he is and knew  it wouldn't end in a happy ever after but I had my hopes.


 I felt happy, I finally felt desired. We went out once again and got really drunk, and he invited me to his place, being naive I went with him but noticed that a friend of him was coming with us too. I initially tought that he was going home and just happened to live near so I didn't  really care... But when we got to his place his friend was still with us.


He told me that we are going to have threesome but I said no many times, I didn't want to lose my virginity like that.  But he was getting annoyed and told me that he doesnt care,  after some talking I got his friend to leave.  And I lost my virginity that night.
 

That was still acceptable,  I mean ...I didn't really agree with his intentions at first but I liked him and did this so he'll like me more so  I agreed that we didn't use protection.


The next day I started having a panic attack that i was going to be pregnant and thought that if I told my best friend she can maybe confort me and help. But she got angry at us and started messaging the guy,  and arguing  with him (i had faith in her that she will keep this between us) and the guy got mad at me because i couldn't keep my mouth shut because I told my best friend.... then I found out that his whole friend group knew about us and started hitting on me as well. It seemed weird that he was allowed to talk about this but I wasn't.


I just needed to talk to someone about this,  it was a rough time for me and weird but he didn't care about me and just ignored me. I tried to get in touch with him but it wasn't going anywhere.

It's been 4 days and he still won't talk to me. He also tells everyone that im a bad person and they shouldn't talk to me because I'm annoying.


So now I have ruined 2 friendships because I got mad at my best friend for telling my personal issues I have told her in confidence. But I know she was only trying to help....


I have no idea what to do,  how to make him understand that I needed someone to talk to because he wouldn't. I know he's an asshole and I shouldn't have even bothered with him. But I can't get him out of my mind and I can't  sleep knowing that he hates me for something perfectly normal.


I'm at a loss now,   and I have no idea what to do with my life. I really need help


I just don't want to lose him as a friend,  that's all.",31Dec2019,1

9,"I have been radiosilent to my friends and basically anyone for 2 months, before that also for a longer period and a MDMA Trip kinda brought me back for 2 weeks. My life is an absolute shitshow right now, had this pressure building up due to my anxiety and general social akwardness, and it just feels like the dam finally broke and I alienate myself from everybody. Had that happen a lot before, I’m just so damn depressed and beaten by other people and past trauma, and now I feel like an animal trapped in a cage. 

I wish I could gather the courage to just message my friends, but since it’s been so long that I shut them out if feels like this HUGE deal now and all I want is just spend the rest of my life in a dark room being left alone by everyone. Funny thing is I’m responsible with drugs even though I’m so mentally fucked, never formed a habit out of any substance even though I enjoy them. Godfuckingdammit. Sorry I just wanted to rant and maybe get some expertise. I’m still on the verge of I should do M for NYE so maybe that’ll help me open up to my friends about wtf is wrong and that I’m sorry",31Dec2019,1
11,"I’m 19 and still live with my parents. Few months ago I started sneaking out of the house, because... well... to have sex with a fuck buddy who is twice my age. Tonight my mom caught me when I arrived home and started asking me what the hell was I doing outside at 1 am. I didn’t tell her anything, because her yelling made me super anxious. She started asking me what kind of business am I doing and if I’m selling drugs. I denied everything, but she doesn’t believe me. 
What the hell do I do? Telling the truth is obviously not an option, so what other options do I have? I’m feeling sick just thinking about it.",31Dec2019,1

But yeah I’m 18 and I moved away for like a month and I was really happy because I was finally done living with my asshole of a dad and my mom who’s kinda insane ( I don’t blame her tho). but I started to miss being around some of my family who I actually like being around cuz I was all alone up there. so I came back and Its only been a week and I’m already starting to hate myself again and feel miserable I also feel like a complete idiot for thinking there would be a different outcome than before but obviously it’s the same as before I feel trapped and have no idea what to do 🤙🤙🤙",31Dec2019,1
13,"PLEASE DO NOT SHAME ME- THIS WAS A MISTAKE AND I KNOW AND REGRET IT 

my mind is eating at me. so here it is. 
basically met a partner on bumble, went on a few dates and we really connected. 
all is good except the fact that they think i’m 18 when i’m actually 17. on my bumble account my age shows up as 18 because i set it that way to meet older people (because that’s my preference)
 the second i met my partner they asked “are you sure you’re 18?” and i said “yes.” 
i lied to them. and i feel so bad. i just fear that once i tell them they will leave me. 

should i wait until my 18th birthday? should i just outright say it? i’m regretting everything that i’ve done with them but i just don’t want them to go away. i know i made a huge mistake by lying but i just need a little help :/ 

fyi: 
i know, i know “why would you lie about your age” well i like older people (18- 21, which is legal in my state (IL)) and for whatever reason i thought this was an okay thing to do- which now i know it is not.",31Dec2019,1
14,"I go to university in a field that is female dominated (bachelors in child &amp; youth care). I had volunteered my time to host a paint-night for one of the programs in our school. I asked a classmate who also painted to help me. I was cautious to ask as she was consistently late and twice pulled a no-show for two other social events with no explanation other than ""Ï'm going through a lot of s\*\*t right now"" which to add context is a line that has been overused by nearly all the women in the program, the dudes (four of us) always show up and get things done. The profs give extensions so easily, all you have to say is ""I'm going through a lot"", Which is very aggravating considering I have high expectations of myself and others regarding accountability and professionalism. I showed up for the event, hosted it, it went alright maybe 7/10 rating, It could've been better considering i had to leave the group to restock on canvases, more paper towels, this was her role to fill while I mentored the group. To be fair, I intentionally did not remind her of the date. I texted her afterwards. I asked what happened. She said she forgot and was terribly sorry. She began to start blaming me, telling me that I shouldve told her when it was happening, to which i did the day i asked her. She had her phone in her hand as she said yes, and me telling her to punch it into her phone and ""dont forget!"". 

More context. I've tried to host two paint nights and one board game session at the university bar. All three i was stood up with no explanation. In group work, I had one woman tasked with editing our work tell me my work was awesome, the research was on point. I was consistently communicating in group chat about that project. All the while the group gaslighting me telling me everything was all good. The editor went to the prof trying to throw me under the bus saying the exact opposite. The prof wasn't biting, told her to talk to me first. she didn't. That group all knew about it and never told me for two weeks. They all agreed to talk about it with this girl but when time came at the end of the meeting they all bailed with awkward expressions. I suspect racist, and sexism at work here as I am an indigenous male in a white female dominated field. 

Back to the original issue, I told miss 'no-show', that i felt easily dismissed considering the my past experiences. She continued to play her violin complaining about how hard school was and how depressed she was, never taking full responsibility or even acknowledging my grievances. I am anticipating that she has already gone to others to gain support, try get me to ""talk alone"" which will really mean, lets go to a remote location where my crew will be waiting, the crew of people who kept standing me up, How should i respond? I am perfectly fine chatting about it one-on-one but if she brings anyone into it, I'll lose my ever-loving mind on these people. I have three more semesters to go and plenty of group work assignments ahead. with the exception of one group work out of maybe 10 total, People have been ghosting me and being late with replies. It is driving me crazy and I don't know how to deal with it professionally. 

I low key worry that this type of malicious passive aggressive behavior is something I will have to deal with, which is fine. I'm confident that If i play my cards right, I rank up above these petty bitches and nip this gossiping high school behaviour in the butt when i see it, but until then I have to play ""nice"".",31Dec2019,1

20,"I'm 37 y.o., and since I'm using an alt, very attractive. I have been having a FWB thing with someone, with emphasis on the F part, for the last two years, but back in June they went back to their country. Also they think of me as their best friend and they like the sex but they don't want a  relationship with me.

I've been a bit screwed up since they left until I decided to start doing something about it so I stated seeing other people. I sort of fucked around a bit and thought I was over it, but...

I recently met this person who checks all my boxes, They are cool and funny and ridiculously good looking and we are both massive nerds and the sex is fantastic. And this person, we just met and just had lots of sex on the first date, but I \*know\* they are going to ask me for a relationship. And I know I should want it, but my knee-jerk reaction is that it's too rushed to be bf/gf, that we should keep the fwb thing as it stands and maybe reconsider after a year when we know each other better... I don't know. 

This new person is amazing and I really like them but them wanting commitment (hasn't happened yet but will happen very soon, I can tell) and me resisting the idea has me thinking maybe i'm not really over the fwb.

I feel like a should give this person a try and sure enough with enough amazing sex I will forget about the fwb. But I also feel like they deserve more and I shouldn't expose them to the possibility of being my rebound. I do my best to never hurt anyone but people get very taken with me so either I go five years without dating anyone or I will be in the same situation once and again. And this new person is seriously super cool, and sexy, and great.

26,"I’m super confused. 

I have a best friend who I’ve had ups and downs with and we’ve been through lots together. We are extremely close, like sisters and always talk to each other. Recently, we had a really rough patch in our friendship which has been resolved now.

Basically, she made friends with new people that I wasn’t particularly fond of. I did everything I could to deter her from befriending them but in doing so I pushed her away. I was jealous. Now this wouldn’t be an issue until I started thinking about why. Why was I jealous? I didn’t want to be replaced, especially by another female. I didn’t want another girl to take my spot. I wasn’t particularly bothered about the males.

But why? Why was I so bothered by her becoming friends with other girls? I clearly wanted her all to myself ( I know this is wrong now), but why? 

We are very good friends now. She has a boyfriend whom I’m not jealous of but dislike. I dislike him because he presents toxic behaviours which I won’t get into. But every now and then, I still get these territorial feelings towards her female friends. I don’t like it when she talks about them at all and there is one girl specifically that I just can’t bring myself to accept.

Now what I am terrified of is if I like my best friend. As in more than friends, or if I’m just confusing our close bond with affection. This idea popped into my head during our rough patch and it’s stumped me. 

Today, she was at my house and I thought of kissing her. Thinking, what would happen if I just did it? The thought didn’t leave for a while. Now I have considered myself straight. Completely and utterly straight and to be honest the idea of doing anything sexual with a girl makes me feel ill ( not to be rude ). 

If I do like her, there is no way I could tell her. Like at all. She has a boyfriend and it could and will shatter our friendship. I’m just confused. Why don’t I want her making friends with other girls? And why would I be jealous?",31Dec2019,1

Just to keep you posted.

B is the sweetest person I have ever met, we have a great relationship, our personalities mesh perfectly. Sometimes I think that he has feelings for me too, but I always chalk it up to him being such a nice person.

35,"I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 yrs now, and I've known that his mother is polyamorous for a few months. I dont see anything wrong with others being poly, people should love how they want since love is a wonderful thing. I don't know his parents that well but they seem nice. However, I've been distressing myself because although I don't see anything wrong with poly... I wish it weren't true that my boyfriend's parents are poly. It's fine that they are, I can't mess with that and nor will I. Other people's business is none of mine. The problem is with me- I want to love and be comfortable with his parents because I really like my boyfriend and hopefully someday marry him...but I get distressed when I think of them being poly. They seem like wonderful people but when I think about it...I don't want to become part of their family. I think it's because although I don't see anything wrong with being poly, I'd rather not be involved with people who are. My boyfriend loves his family and I shouldn't get between that, no one should. How should I deal with my feelings?

The problem is that I’ve always had the mentality that I’ve wanted my gf’s friend to envy me since I never made the chance to try and date her. Last month my gf’s friend posted to “get yourself a millionaire so you can have money to shop” with her holding money, (not more than a few hundred dollars) making it sound like she’s with a really rich guy. It’s making it hard for me to live with the fact that although I do love the person I’m with, that post made me question everything. Does she really have the looks to get with someone like that? Why didn’t I try back when I was hanging out with her before my current gf? I realize they’re toxic thoughts to have, but I feel like I’ll never get closure knowing how to deal with this.

39,"This is mainly a shout for help, I write this because I know it helps putting things down to ""paper"".

TL;DR: I look for a girlfriend, but not have sex, but to have someone that I know will be there for me and that I can talk without boundries. But any girl I talk to thinks I want to fuck her first date when I only need someone to talk to when I need it because what I consider friends are out of the picture. Im asking for advice on what to do.

I've been having the worst nights I've ever had, not in terms of nightmares but in terms of deep lonely deppressive thoughts.

I think friendship is something Im lacking, am I making an effort in finding a friend? Not really, but because I want a partner to grow with.

I feel like my ""friendships"" are just a one way street.

I start the converstations, I ask 'How are you doing' 'How was your day' I ask and ask, I plan things, go out and then I dont hear a word from them.

I've experienced 3 big moves in my life, 1 was a city and the others were countries, and all the friends that I used think were the 'best', lost complete contact, tried several times, and I end up getting dry conversations.

I understand people have their own life, and that they wont accomodate to talk to me, but  it seems odd when I would do my best to keep contact.

Im a person that likes to talk, I like memes I really do, but man, can I have a chat for once, not just memes.

This is the reason why I look for a partner, to have someone to spend my time with, forget about stupid things like this because I cant live without fucking recognition from my friends.

And whenever that awaited partner comes, Ill try my best to not even come with all this problems to her, so this is why Im letting all the shit out.

Essentially, I wanted to call her the c word, and think now it would have been the correct action to take. That would have raised my reputation with the people I care about, while lowering it with those I despise. So, a net benefit. Instead, those people still thought lowly of me, and I angered my friend.

Now, there are all these rules of politeness for existing in society. In order to abide by them you have to be rather creative in the moment, which is not always easy to do. When should one break proper social etiquette to achieve the ends beneficial to oneself and close friends?",31Dec2019,1
41,"So hello all, first time Reddit User...

I need some advice. 

In a nutshell: I am 42, single, unemployed, dislike where I live (both home and location) and dislike my life overall. 

This past year opportunity came knocking and life handed me a do-over. A total ""change your life around 180 and start fresh"" card.  No I didn't win the lottery, but what I got was something even better. The chance to take my life into my own hands and fix everything I did not like about it. Physically, financially, mentally, emotionally and geographically. Imagine a life of total apprehended freedom to choose; This is what I received. 

My very first order of business was to clean physical and emotional house.  After a ten year long divorce battle and living in depression and poverty, I had gained so much weight at 320 Lbs, I could barely walk.  I had Plantar Fascitius in both feet and was suffering from Diabetic episodes every night where my blood pressure would soar and my heart would race. I dreaded leaving the house, became a shut in, and withdrew from life. The thought of a trip to Costco gave me sweats for weeks as I tried to muster both courage and strength to physically push a cart to the back of the store, both feet in screaming pain, sweat pouring down my rolls of fat, and a grimace on my face. 

Then opportunity came. I flew to Mexico and in 3 short months had a life changing weight loss surgery that I very much needed. That was 8 months ago and I am now down well over 100 Lbs and am a ""Normal"" size 14 and wearing size Medium comfortably.  With my newfound health and energy I started dating and exploring nature and the outdoors again. I started really taking care of myself, appreciating my looks, doing my hair and my makeup, and gave myself a new wardrobe.  Life was good. 

I was now able to fly, to fit on a seat in a plane and to travel and find a forever home. Somewhere better. 

I had been in the same Career for almost 20 years and had started a home based business where I could work from home.  My new energy and zest for life and people and wanting to have relationships again helped me decide I needed to end this career. The career ended for me this past winter as my last profitable client left me. I didn't really protest and knew it had to happen anyways.  I had identified as this ""Title"" for 20 years, so the idea of no longer being a Professional in my field was and is still hard for me, but I latched on to the idea of something new, something more befitting my energy and desire to be with people and not chained to a desk all day. 

I had a plan set in motion, my life was all decided. I just needed to get through Christmas holidays, and the rest would fall into place easily. 

I decided I wanted to give myself a gift. Something I had never had or done or experienced in my life. A 40 day trip to explore the world, to find a new life and home to live. I had the money all saved up, and had planned on going mid January through to mid February. I started planning, writing my 5 week itinerary, researching and exploring all the places I would go and see and do by myself while I was there. I had no-one to travel with, and had given up on finding a boyfriend or partner in time for this trip, and really just felt like this was something I needed to do by myself anyways. To Live. I was free from work and clients and obligations and had enough money saved to go and more importantly I had the time since I had decided to go back to school in 2020 to become a red seal hairdresser. School started March 1st, which gave me plenty of time to travel before then and meet new people and explore new places to live. 

Then Christmas happened. 

My Mother is very particular about the holidays and honestly I cant really take very much time with her or my parents. They have been married 49 years and my Father just went through his second hip surgery. I am the only child in the family who cares for my parents as my younger Brother has a fiancee and lives with her in the city and he is more involved with her family now than ours. Because I am the oldest, and the daughter, and single, and unemployed...all the responsibility falls onto me to take care of them, which I have and do. I stayed weeks there while my father recovered, and I do the same each holiday preparing and planning the food and meals for everyone, and any other time they require me. I have 8 people in my family who do not offer much help, so this is a big job which I have come to resent now. 

My parents were going to look after my small dog for me so that I could travel to Thailand. I have been planning this trip for months, and getting many costly expensive vaccines. I had to apply for a new passport, and a visa to the Thai Embassy. I had to pre-book flights, return, and register all my stays and train tickets within Thailand. I have been shopping for this trip too, buying all the special travel items I would need to travel solo.

Christmas was exhausting. I did everything I was required to. I spent over $600 on food and supplies for the family for a Christmas eve feast and Christmas Day Turkey Dinner for 8 people, including extra desserts and more for leftovers for my elderly Grandmother and younger Brother to take home. I was sleeping in a guest bed that wrecked my back and after cooking for two solid days I could barely stand. My fingers were cramping from all the chopping and cutting I did, but I never complained and just made it all happen. 

Everything went fine, and then a few days after I had neatly organized all the leftovers into separate containers and had everything in the fridge to be microwaved and reheated as leftovers by my parents. This is when things started to go south. My Mother decided to take over the food storage and decided to dump everything into one large pot which she would reheat in the oven for us. At first I was a little upset by this, but figured its her house and kitchen, she can do what she likes and I ignored it. When the pot was left sitting on the counter for about 6 hours, I grew concerned about its freshness. The next day it was back in the fridge. The day after that, more fresh food from my containers were dumped back into this pot still containing old food, and again reheated in the oven and served. That pot too was left to sit out on the counter for hours into the night before going back into the fridge. I often experienced food poisoning as a child at the hand of my Mother so I said nothing but became selective and only ate mashed potatoes after this. 

I became ill. I felt horrible that entire day, but I kept my mouth shut and said nothing. My tender vertical Sleeve Stomach was in pain and agony by now, and I decided to go home rather than stay there any longer and risk further food poisoning. I decided I needed to tell my Mother that her food storage and handling were not safe and that we were all at rick of food poisoning. She immediately defended her actions telling me repeatedly to get over myself. I decided I should probably just quietly pack up and leave and go home rather than cause fighting.  My father has learned to defend my Mothers actions even while vomiting himself from food poisoning, so I get no support from even him as my Mother is a controlling bully in the home. 

On the way home, about an hours drive, my Mother left me a curt voicemail explaining how she could no longer look after my dog while I went to Thailand, because she fears he would be poisoned by her. I honestly do fear leaving him with my parents as last time I did he was very unhappy and returned to me covered in glue. She tried to ""doctor"" him by home remedy and he had glue all over his skin and coat, im not sure why. I have no-where else to leave my dog, although maybe he is safer with a stranger, but I dont know.

I contacted my Brother and reached out to a few family members for support who offered me none other than interest and curiosity about the matter. My Brother has also sided with my Mother and told me I need to apologize if I want to take my trip.  I dont feel I should apologize as I did nothing wrong. She feels me telling her she is handing food wrong is elder abuse. I said to her that allowing my Father to eat it would be elder abuse. 

I have dreamed of this trip all my life, and before Christmas was finally free to take it. Now I have lost the support of my entire family for speaking up about the food safety standards my Mother defends. I have lost my ability to travel as no-one will take my dog for the month and airlines will not permit dogs to fly a 20 hour flight. Also my dog is 13 years old and requires special medication and diet, which I cant trust to just anyone. 

I love my dog but I am now faced with the burden of having him put down so that I can fulfill my dreams and remove this oppression forced on me by my family. My Mother is now blackmailing me so that I can no longer go on my trip. I assure you she is pleased with this and wants nothing more than for me to go nowhere in life or do anything. 

I dont know what to do. If I dont go on this trip, I lose it all and the opportunity is gone. If I go, I have to put my dog down because I cant afford the dog sitting fees of $25/day for 40 days, and airlines wont permit him on the flight. 

What would you do? Please someone? Anyone?

If I kill my dog, am I a murderer? Which will I regret more. The decision of having a life? or having a dog?

I feel like my life is over. That I will never see anywhere but this one shitty province in Canada I have lived in my whole life.

That I will never get to travel or meet new friends or people, or maybe even have a partner in life again. 

My Family is controlling me and taking away my freedoms and my dreams...Any advice you can think of or give me would be great. I am so stuck.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I tell my Mother I was wrong, that reheating three day old room temp food is safe to eat?

Even if I did, my Dog would suffer and be recovered in glue again and probably worse.",31Dec2019,1
43,"Reddit, I hope you can help me. Myself (30M) and my Fiancée(28F) just got engaged this past Thanksgiving and have started the process of planning the wedding. 

A little background about us both. We are both out spoken Christians. Church going on Sundays. Mission trips and small groups. We love God and it’s well known. We also like to have our fun. We enjoy drinks from time to time but in the entire time we’ve dated I’ve only seen her drunk twice and she’s never seen me drunk. We both have full time career jobs and make about 110k a year between the two of us. Our wedding will be close to 20k and although we have not asked either of our parents for money, her parents offered us 7k to put towards everything.

Over the weekend we were discussing wedding plans and her parents house and it came out that we want a open bar. Nothing was said at this time. Conversation moves along, no worries. Now her parents are pretty strong Christians. Mom works at the Church, Dad leads small group. They are very imbedded in that part of life. Which we love and don’t have any negative thoughts about. They also drink themselves.

Today, my fiancée gets a call from her parents and they start in by saying the “Want to make sure that their money isn’t going towards the open bar.” No problem there, I even stated the past weekend that I was paying for the bar myself. They then proceed to tell her that they are worried about how our wedding will be viewed and how it will make us look as Christians. That they are worried about someone in recovery being there and is facilitating alcohol to everyone. Her father even proceeds to text her after the conversation and quote scripture to her about how strong Christians shouldn’t lead others to sin. (1Corinthians 8:7-13, 9:19-23, 10:23-33) Those are the verses he quoted if you want to look them up. My fiancée is going dress shopping this weekend and even said that she would tell them what about went to the dress, the photographer and any other part that wasn’t the bar. This has all just completely torn into my fiancée and has made her feel like what should be the happiest time of our lives not be the happiest time of our lives. Her parents said they wanted to sit down and talk to us soon which I imagine will be, for lack of a better term, a face-off between myself and her father. 

How can I make a case for us having the open bar without telling her parents to toss on?? 

I adore her parents but frankly this has upset my fiancée and as her future husband it’s my job to step in. I also feel upset that they went to only her and didn’t talk to both of us directly. 

Fell Christians, How can I make a religious case for this situation?? 

Thank you all in advance and God Bless!",31Dec2019,1

We were all having a great time and at midnight we lit the candles and walked out singing Happy Birthday, as per tradition and as soon as he blows out the candles his father stands up and announces he's dying. 

Most of the family begins sobbing and I'm still holding the cake rather numb and traumatized. He continues on about all of the major events he will miss in our lives and tells everyone he will financially take care of them. He wouldn't stop talking and the sobbing got louder with some people running out of the room. 

I feel sorry that this happened on my partner's birthday and that this has become a holiday memory.

57,So my sister applied at the local grocery store and the gave her the job and said she would start after the holidays since she still needed her work permit and sone other stuff and she cant get any of it until then.

I completely understand where she was coming from and I was ready to give her space in order to figure things out, but I then took some of the worst advice I had ever received and said something along the lines of ""I'll give you some time to think about us, but give me an answer as soon as you can because I don't want to be hung up on someone that doesn't like me back.""

63,"I'm incredibly conflicted and finding it impossible to detangle my feelings. I want advise but there's so many details to the story that it's difficult to even express what I'm going through. I'll start at the beginning, and try to keep it relevant and detailed at the same time. 

Ive been with my current boyfriend for close to four years. He is intelligent, kind, interesting and funny. He's also difficult to compromise with and he's very firm in his opinions and values. 

When we first met I was decidedly in the 'friends with benefits' state of mind. However we got along very well, and had an amazing physical connection. During this quasi together stage I slept with someone and it disgusted me. It was the wrong thing to do in many ways and I was so ashamed of myself that I didn't tell my not-then-partner. He asked me direct if I had slept with anyone else and I lied. Several months later and we are going well, and he finds out. It caused a huge rift, but also pushed us closer together. We decided to go backpacking together and although we fought, we had an amazing experience. I should note that what i had done had deeply affected him, he's quite sensitive and felt hugely betrayed. While we were travelling he went found intimate pictures from my past that I had forgotten were on my laptop/phone. It put mental images in his head that didn't belong there and further contributed to his insecure/jealous state of mind. We fought a lot, but each fight brought us closer together. We returned home and moved in together, travelled, lived. But we fought. He had deep insecurity issues about what he'd seen and we really did have some awful fights. 

About two and a half years ago our sex life started declining. His doing. I tried to initiate and he would reject me. I tried talking about it and his reasoning was always along the lines of 'I can't have the physical without the emotional, and I feel that you're not connecting and engaging with me emotionally. I feel like you aren't taking our future seriously and don't want to improve yourself.' He also expressed recently that he has always struggled to settle down and feels like we are living in the same moment doing the same things, that the lack of adventure in our lives doesn't equal a passionate sex life. The sex has dwindled to once a monthish and I'm so twisted with thoughts that I struggle to enjoy it. I've always equaled sex with love so the lack of desire has deeply affected me. I feel insecure and lack confidence to express myself sexually to him. 

At the beginning of this year I went through his phone and discovered he had cheated on me. I was going to leave but he convinced me that it hasn't been cheating for the sake of cheating, rather that his mental state had deteriorated so badly that he had made a stupid decision despite not wanting to to punish himself. I'm a believer that nothing is set in stone and no experience is general enough to apply for everyone, and his explanation and obvious distress convinced me to make it work. But the lack of sex was brought up and I expressed to him how important it was to me. Since then we have both achieved incredible leaps in our lives. Both started fulfilling careers, and the emotional side to our relationship improved vastly. I was no longer the only one who had caused pain, the balance had evened out and we both had hurts that we had put aside to make room for our relationship to grow. 

But it's a year down the track and our sex life hasn't improved. I've tried to improve my emotional side, but I'm beginning to think of he couldn't see those changes within this last year alone then perhaps I simply don't have what he needs to combine the physical and the emotional successfully? 

To further complicate matters, I'm a disability support worker and I've developed feelings for a client who has suffered beyond imagination ever since his accident 4 years ago. I've developed a friendship with him and we've set boundaries for that working friendship relationship, but I know he returns those feelings. It's a separate matter entirely, and I wouldn't act on those feelings while I have a partner, but the very fact that I've developed feelings makes me wonder if my heart is even in this relationship anymore?

I've begun to give up hope, and my boyfriend finally noticed. We had a serious chat and he asked for another chance. Asked that I let go of the last and look to the future and trust him. I'm trying, but I'm feeling so emotionless about everything that I'm scared I'm not giving it the proper last chance it deserves. Am j too scared of the unknown to make a break or do I want this relationship? We have almost four years of shared experiences and imaginings for the future. That means something. I'm really so lost, I feel like I can't move forward or backwards without ruining something. Any advise is appreciated.",31Dec2019,1
64,"Husband and I are $2252 away from getting approved for a first time home owners loan. We have a plan to pay down the credit cards, but we are kinda in a crappy living situation and live in NYS so if we found a house tomorrow, made and offer, and had it accepted...we wouldn't be in the house till March. Our current plan would have us paid down by the end of Feb, meaning we most likely wouldnt be in a house till June ish. So the sooner we get our cards paid down the better. I have a wedding ring that we paid just over $2000 for. I'm not attached to it. Like, I love it, and will cherish the memories of picking it out with my now husband...but it's just a ring and a house is a future. My husband (who is perfectly happy with his $12 ring from Amazon) is really uncomfortable with the idea of getting rid of my ring. 
I guess what I'm asking is A. Should I sell my wedding ring? And B. If yes, what's the best way of successfully going about it? Should I pawn it? Or attempt to sell it on marketplace? Seems like people don't get a lot of luck there.

66,"I got a semi spontaneous tattoo while on vacation with my husband. When I woke up in the morning I didn’t love it. It was a simple line drawing of a fox and it didn’t translate like I hoped. Instead of looking delicate and wispy the lines were drawn a little thicker and it looked like a corporate logo. So I went back the next morning to see if he could add some botanic floral elements to it and he convinced me that instead adding color would give it more of the organic natural look I was going for. He did a mock-up and it looked cool! But in person it just...doesn’t. It’s a water color style and it just looks messy and not blended. He used orange, yellow, and red and there’s way more red than in the mock-up he did and it looks like blood splatters. When I first saw it completed I actually thought it was my own blood. It’s about three inches in the center of my back and I hate it and can’t stop crying.

67,"Backstory for context: when i was 16, i stole a lot of money from a family friend while i was being trusted to take care of her dog while on vacation. I spent most of it on Xanax and weed. My family sent me to rehab for this.
Okay so three years later, i’m 19, in community college but failing classes, and not really having drug problems anymore other than occasional party-drinking or weed. But no addiction. I was so sick of my job and i just was depressed all the time. I think it largely had to do with my mom babysitting at home for a living so i felt constant pressure to escape. I didnt want to be a broke miserable Uni student nor did i want to work a new factory/UPS job and be miserable just so i could live alone.
So I... randomly decided to go back to rehab?
I don’t know why. It was a gut instinct. I thought maybe i could learn some life skills in there and also convince my Dad (who is rich and oblivious to what goes on in my life since my parents are divorced) that I solved my nonexistent “alcohol and drug problem”
And... it worked? After inpatient Rehab (which sucked) i went to a “recovery home” where i could be out until 10 PM and work to save money for my own place. I feel guilty that i basically... lied my way through rehab? I mean most of my “drug stories” i told the guys in my group counseling sessions were true. But i basically got a worthless rehab completion certificate just so my parents would help me move out of my toxic town and help me with my apartment financially. I have gotten in trouble before but i wouldn’t really consider myself a “drug addict”... just a kinda... lost soul? So now i work part time and plan on going back to a community college in the town i moved to. I know NO ONE around here other than my buddies from the recovery home. It’s like a twilight zone. But... i feel as if i made the right desicion? All i really do is work at a certain store where i get min wage plus commission and i cook and workout. This is the life i wanted, but i cheated to get it by taking advantage of a rehab system i was already familiar with",31Dec2019,1
68,"Don't know if this is the correct sub to post this in, but I feel that other fatherless women who have been in similar circumstances may be here.

All of my life (I'm eighteen) I have been raised solely by my mother in a female-dominated household. The only male relative who has played a prominent role in my life is my uncle, who is more like an elder brother to me due to the relatively small age difference between us. Both my mother and grandmother were raised by abusive, emotionally unavailable alcoholics fathers and their parent-child dynamics were replicated in the men they chose to be the fathers of their children. However, in my case my father didn't stick around. I've never met the man (despite him living in the same neighbourhood as me) and he hasn't paid child support in years. Additionally, he has two other daughters (one older than me, one younger) that he is equally indifferent to. I know very little about the younger one, except that she looks very much like me (we both resemble our father physically). The older one is an abject basket case, with two young children at a very young age and a revolving door of men/baby daddies.

For the longest time I always felt that fatherlessness never affected me in any meaningful way. I lack the stereotypical traits of fatherless girls; I'm academically successful with decently high self-esteem, I have no body image issues, am not promiscuous in the slightest, etc. It's only recently since I've gone to college that I have being doing a lot of self-reflecting as I've being growing into young womanhood. I've learned a lot of things about myself, my goals, my values and my relationships in the past few months. Since doing this I've come to the realisation that there is a yawning chasm in my heart where my father's love should be.

I realised this by examining my emotional fantasies over the past few months. I'm an introvert with a rich inner life. One of my favourite pastimes is creating very detailed fantasy lives in which the protagonists are avatars of my ideal self. In nearly all of my favourite fantasies the girls/women have involved, loving fathers. Mothers rarely feature (if at all), which is odd as my mother and I have a great relationship. I realise now that the protagonists of my fantasies have everything that I currently lack; large families, close-knit rural communities, high-flying careers, devoted husbands and fathers whom love them unconditionally.

My fatherlessness has caused me some internal psychological issues, which could prove problematic for me in future relationships. I wouldn't necessarily say I have abandonment issues. However, I'm suspicious of men with female friends as I've been told by a few men themselves that they would sleep with their female ""friends"" given the chance. I constantly fantasise about a ""rescuer"" male who will be totally devoted to me and me alone. I often feel misunderstood so I subsequently pine for a man who will come into my inner world and love and accept me unconditionally. I idolise and am deeply attracted to the ""family man"" archetype and the men who represent it. I long for the traditional and conservative white picket fence life with a large family and parents that love each other deeply.

Furthermore, I've been working on developing relationships (both platonic and romantic) with men and learning not to stereotype/judge/misunderstand them. However, I now acknowledge that due to lacking any meaningful relationships with men I view the opposite sex as either fantasy objects or placeholders for projection. My feelings can go from disgust and revulsion (when they don't fulfill my inner fantasies) to adoration in a short period of time. My feelings towards women are far more stable and neutral as I can easily recognise women as individuals with their own unique flaws and virtues and not as a monolith. I credit this to my mother's influence as well as the several female friendships that I have. I constantly sexualise men in my head while simultaneously project those feelings onto them. I long for attention from multiple different men, even from men I don't find attractive, while hypocritically being disgusted by men that can't have platonic interactions with women. I really want to both ""play the field"" in my youth and assert my attractiveness and femininity while still longing for a storybook romance and a monogamous, meaningful soulmate relationship (Important note; I'm a virgin with no male friends (just a few acquaintances) and have not yet acted on these feelings).

Now that I acknowledge this about myself I'm unsure of where to go from here. How do I ensure that these issues don't hamper my relationships with men in the future, or render me vulnerable to manipulation from predators looking for sex/a controlling relationship? I don't want to repeat the cycle of failed relationships that my mother and grandmother did with the men in their lives. I really want to experience profound connections with men (both as friends and as a lover) but have no idea on how to go about doing so. I really want marriage and family with a man who will be a devoted husband and father, but am probably too young to have this kind of relationship. I would like to have a boyfriend and lose my virginity to someone I care about but am wary of potentially leading him on if I decide down the road that I want something casual. Deep down I don't really want casual sex but my ego seems to demand that it be stroked by many different men. I feel that if I had a father and some idea of what a healthy relationship between a man and a woman should look like I would at least have some kind of blueprint to help me understand and deal with these issues. Have any other fatherless daughters here broken the cycle and healed both their inner wounds and relationship with men?",31Dec2019,1

93,"(Sorry for this being so long) I'm currently a Junior in highschool and one of my best friends since like 6th grade has started to become a really ""bad"" person. He's had his moments where he's stabbed me in the back before, but none of it was ever that bad considering that I myself am not perfect either but I've always forgiven him. But these past 2 months he's been hanging out with this drug dealer that's in the same grade as us, and has started to smoke weed. I'm personally against the idea of drugs, but it didn't really bother me that he started smoking weed ""every other 2 weeks"" as he claimed. But I know him, and can tell that is not true considering the fact that he's been hanging out with this drug dealer alot and definitely smoking more than that. It worries me because I know he will end up getting into the worse kinds of drugs with this guy, cause this dealer has told multiple times about doing hardcore drugs such as crack. 

Now here's where he stabbed me in the back. I had told him about how I had a crush on this one amazing girl who is pretty smart, and someone who I literally am so in love with. But this drug dealer who is great friends with my backstabbing bestfriend also has a crush on her, and I fear that my bestfriend has gone and told this drug dealer about my crush on her.

I invited the girl over my place yesterday to watch some movies and we really hit it off, and she had told me out of the blue how she felt like the drug dealer who she had hung out with a couple times (and no she doesn't do any drugs and I know the drug dealer hasn't asked her to do any) had a crush on her due to how noticeable it was that he was trying to compliment her and ask her bestfriend stuff about her. After telling me that stuff, she told me how she likes hanging out with the drug dealer man, but that she's not ready for a relationship and something along the lines of not feeling the same way about him as he does for her. 

Now how I know that my bestfriend is stabbing me in the back in order to help the drug dealers chances of talking to the girl over me. Is that a few days back I had mentioned how I wanted to invite the girl me and the drug dealer have a crush on over to my house to watch movies, cause I was hoping to buy a new speaker system for my tv. And then today he started asking me questions (which he literally never goes out of his way to make small talk with me by asking questions) about if I ever got that tv sound system, and which after me saying no eventually led to more questions and then him being like ""so hey did you ever invite the girl over your house if you didn't get that sound system"". Which is an inoscent enough question, but I know him and I know that he wouldn't go out of his way to ask me that unless he was seeking info. And to add the cherry ontop, when I looked at snap maps after he asked me, I saw that he was on ghost most which he NEVER does UNLESS he's with the drug dealer guy.

96,"Sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I’m 17.  My parents are overprotective. They basically control my life. I have to get their permission on everything. I can’t hang out until I finish the things I need to get done, which I completely understand, and I obey them and respect them. But...

Recently, I got accepted into my top choice school. Thinking my parents would be more lax because of this (since, obviously, Asian parents believe which college one goes to defines who they are) and knowing that they know I worked my ass off, nothing really changed.

This winter break, all I do at home is practice my instrument for 4 hours every day and study from my calculus textbook to prep for next semester’s class. I feel like I don’t even get to take a well needed break. 

Today, I finally got to hang out with my boyfriend. Of course, they set a curfew and everything. I always had to be home on the dot. I didn’t obey this one time because of how fed up I am about their shit. I came home 2 hours later. They said I will never be able to hang out or go out again. 

My parents are extremely sexist. I have an older brother who gets to go wherever he wants with whoever, whenever. He doesn’t need to ask for permission. My parents said I’m A GIRL and I can’t go out at night. Calling them out on their blasphemy, they replied by saying they’re just trying to protect me. I’ve had my license for more than a year and I still can’t drive anywhere by myself except to school. My parents still check on what I’m wearing before I go out, clothes or shoes. 

I’ll be in college 500 miles away in less than a year, and I feel like I’m not prepared in being independent at all. In fact, I’m scared that once I’m in college, I’m going to let loose and be rebellious so I could experience all the things I never would’ve experienced if I were living with them. 

Also, talking to my parents never works. They always think I’m talking back to them, they don’t listen to me, and we never come to a consensus on anything.

99,"My brother is an addicted (he's on medication for the opioid addiction but has begun drinking instead). I am a recovering emetophobic with general anxiety disorder. We are both adults and we live with my mom and younger sibling while we recover from our ailments.

My mom and brother have a strange up and down co-dependent relationship. She supplies him with his drug of choice when he needs it and he does well those days. She takes him to his appointments for medication (to deal with the opioid addiction), and gives him rides whenever he needs it. When he doesn't get his drug of choice he becomes angry and lashes out: slams doors, screams, rants, etc. Then she fights with him, and an hour or so later they're laughing about something on TV. It's bizarre but its normal for them.

Let it be noted: he never physically hurts me or my mom. When we had a dog he would scream at it, kick and hit it if it did anything wrong. I would have to block him and protect the dog, which terrified me since confrontation is not something I usually deal with. He's verbally abused me over the years but I think its mostly just him lashing out because of the addiction. There have been days in the past where I think he's come close to hitting me, and part of me hates him for that but at the end of the day he's never done it.

One particularly awful night my brother called my mom a bunch of insults because she wouldn't buy him beer and she stormed after him and started hitting him. I froze and didn't know how to react. I was in the living room and they were upstairs above me. She kept screaming ""I hate you I hate you!"" and all I heard was loud thumping and banging. I don't know how long it lasted, but once it was over she slammed his bedroom door shut and told him to stay in there. Then she went out, drove to the store, and then came back with beer for him. She berated him some more and then they both went to bed for the night.

This sort of thing is becoming regular and Im stuck hating myself for not stepping in to stop my mom. I think she's right to be angry with him but wrong for expressing that anger with violence. Part of me is afraid of confrontation, another afraid of getting on mom's bad side and being kicked out of the house (I make minimum wage and dont really have any where else to go atm). Another part of me just hates my brother sometimes and I cant forget how threatening it feels to be around him when he's verbally lashing out and slamming doors.

My brother and I got in an argument the other day and he accused me of being a bitch and selfish and not caring about him. I can't help wondering if he's right. I think he resents me for not stepping in to stop the fights and not asking about him. I don't know what to do in this situation. Should I step in? Should I leave it alone? I have an appointment with my therapist next week so I'll talk to them about it then, but until then Im wondering if anyone has any advice if there's another blow up.

101,"First of all im bisexual but would never come out its just that I am attracted to both gender but would probably marry a girl soon.

Now here's the story why me being that matters.

So we are a group of friends (9 to 13 all guys all straight? ) and us would usually hangout to drink alcohol and vape shit like that (No Drugs).

The thing is I actually have a crush on 2 of my friends (Just to be attractive due to their physical features + their personality) and one of my guy crush is weirdly weird whenever he gets drunk

So this one time we friends (7) were drunk at our friends house then I was one of the person that didn't drunk hard that time so that I could actually take care the drunk people. That guy kiss me on the forehead a lot of times (I just didnt try to care because I know hes drunk) and during that time when we were sleeping, He was next to me when I woke up.

Now heres more, about 4 or 5 months I guess is that he is becoming more light on me and whenever I drunk hard, he would always try hard to care even if I could do it myself like one time we were crossing the street, He would always hold my hands and stuff like that. (Btw we live in the same neighbourhood which is why we always go home at the same time during hangovers with my friends)

Now just this December, He now tries to push me away from him but whenever we get tipsy and all then he's gonna be back doing weirdly things I guess?

What do I do? It feels so weird when he does it because sometimes the weird thing is he'll try to hump me sometimes lol",31Dec2019,1

106,"I am struggling to become my own person and I would like to hear from the reddit community about how they became independent.

I am in my early twenties and about to finish university. Currently, I'm financially dependent on my parents but I am planning on breaking away after I graduate and find a job. 

I love my family a lot but I feel they are very judgmental at times. It seems like they are always very controlling and there is very little room for my opinions. I'm the youngest in my family so I'm often met with the ""we're older and more experienced, be quiet"" attitude. What hurts even more is that my parents respect my older siblings wishes and opinions while mine are often dismissed. My opinions are not valued, so I have learned to keep quiet. My parents and my older sibling often add snarky comments that shatter my confidence and usually makes me feel worthless. I also feel emotionally and mentally manipulated by my family to bend towards their decisions. I have been berated for my weight, for my appearance, for my grades, and for the people associate with. It feels like i am being constantly watched and that everything I do is wrong. I have attempted to talk to them about it, but I've been dismissed as a ""weakling that can't take criticism"". Now I have no interest in reconciliation but rather I just want to escape. I feel like my relationship with my family is toxic and it is taking a toll on my mental health. I am split between listening to my families opinions and my own voice. I feel as if their influence is extinguishing the already small voice inside me.  

Nowadays, I feel sad and confused and just doubtful for every decision I make. I can't build up  my confidence because my family is not encouraging or supportive. I just feel lost and I want to be independent. 

What should I do, What steps do I need to take to become independent?

107,"Made an anonymous account because my main account has to much personal information.

First, let me mention that I do not condone victim blaming in any way shape or form. That’s why I’m asking if I’m a jerk for even assuming this girl is lying.

My ex-friend is claiming that she slept with my best friend’s dad.

The situation is complicated, half a decade ago I had a very close friend group. Three of us, Anna, Mary, and I. (Names are changed for privacy.) Anna is my long-time
best friend, her family is closer to me than my actual family is. Mary is a friend that came around when I was 17 and Anna was 14. Mary was 22 at the time. In retrospect this is much weirder than it seemed at the time. 

Anna and I have almost a sibling type relationship and I only put up with Mary because Anna looked up to her. I recognize I may be a bit biased.

Eventually Mary’s manipulation and lies caught up to her and she stopped coming around, but before this, she temporarily lived with Anna because of some family drama. (It was maybe a month?)

Cut to 2018 and Anna’s public figure father, for a mid-size town, is openly shamed after being caught in an affair. I recognize what he did was wrong, but don’t blame him because he felt trapped in his previous marriage. 


The rumor mill obviously did what a rumor mill does and only made the situation worse.

Anna’s parents divorced and she chose to keep living with her dad. 

A year later December 2019, Mary has decided to come back into our lives by telling everyone we know that she slept with Anna’s father.

Mary lied about a lot of people she’s slept with, and I don’t know her to be someone to just be quiet about something like that.

But with all of this, there’s a chance that it could have happened, however unlikely I think it is. I want to alienate her and pretend like she never existed, but I’m also tired of her further hurting Anna. We’ve delt with this long enough.

My caring mind wants to protect Anna but also doesn’t want to hurt Mary if it actually happened and she’s hurting.

I’d be thankful for any advice.",31Dec2019,1

110,"On mobile, sorry if my formatting is awful.


Let me preface this by saying my fiancee and I work together in a fast food place, mostly the same shifts. She's african american and I am as white as Casper's ghostly ass, I will label her as M. There will also be a bit of examples and such to help with my question further below , and as my fiancee doesn't use Reddit I'm posting thid for her sake.


I have never once had a problem with this manager but lately, M seems to be taking the brunt of some sort of ego fueled powertripping bullshit from the manager who only seems to be targeting her and no one else in the predominantly white workspace. 


The manager, whom I'll call Jay for anonymity sake, is constantly trying to start something or argue with M, has written her up for the stupidest of things, for example as from yesterday she asked her to sweep the floor after her shift was over (she was still on the clock), which she did without a complaint, then clocked out as it was the last thing she needed to do. 

A few minutes later, Jay comes out to the lobby asking M if she clocked out, which she replied yes, she did. Jay then wrote her up for ""insubordination"" for not mopping the floor which she claims she asked her to do but that's not what M had heard even after she cleared it with another manager who was in the kitchen with her at the time and had even repeated it back to M when she asked to make sure.


Today, and like a couple months prior, M went to the bathroom to go clean it since a customer had complained, and had loudly announced it along with telling two different different people what she was doing, and Jay went and clocked her out when she still had 40 minutes left of hee shift claiming ""she didn't know where M was"" and never bothered to ask anyone. 


M has talked to the store manager a total of 3-4 times now about Jay but it hasn't stopped the manager at all and it only seems to be escalating. We can't leave this job, as for one they are short staffed as it is and we like almost everyone we work with, and for two we need the money since we're trying to save up for a vehicle to get us to and from our job along with obviously paying bills.


Is there anything she can do to get this to stop? We feel stuck and extremely fed up with this manager.",31Dec2019,1
111,"(Sorry for this being so long) I'm currently a Junior in highschool and one of my best friends since like 6th grade has started to become a really ""bad"" person. He's had his moments where he's stabbed me in the back before, but none of it was ever that bad considering that I myself am not perfect either but I've always forgiven him. But these past 2 months he's been hanging out with this drug dealer that's in the same grade as us, and has started to smoke weed. I'm personally against the idea of drugs, but it didn't really bother me that he started smoking weed ""every other 2 weeks"" as he claimed. But I know him, and can tell that is not true considering the fact that he's been hanging out with this drug dealer alot and definitely smoking more than that. It worries me because I know he will end up getting into the worse kinds of drugs with this guy, cause this dealer has told multiple times about doing hardcore drugs such as crack.

Now here's where he stabbed me in the back. I had told him about how I had a crush on this one amazing girl who is pretty smart, and someone who I literally am so in love with. But this drug dealer who is great friends with my backstabbing bestfriend also has a crush on her, and I fear that my bestfriend has gone and told this drug dealer about my crush on her.

I invited the girl over my place yesterday to watch some movies and we really hit it off, and she had told me out of the blue how she felt like the drug dealer who she had hung out with a couple times (and no she doesn't do any drugs and I know the drug dealer hasn't asked her to do any) had a crush on her due to how noticeable it was that he was trying to compliment her and ask her bestfriend stuff about her. After telling me that stuff, she told me how she likes hanging out with the drug dealer man, but that she's not ready for a relationship and something along the lines of not feeling the same way about him as he does for her.

Now how I know that my bestfriend is stabbing me in the back in order to help the drug dealers chances of talking to the girl over me. Is that a few days back I had mentioned how I wanted to invite the girl me and the drug dealer have a crush on over to my house to watch movies, cause I was hoping to buy a new speaker system for my tv. And then today he started asking me questions (which he literally never goes out of his way to make small talk with me by asking questions) about if I ever got that tv sound system, and which after me saying no eventually led to more questions and then him being like ""so hey did you ever invite the girl over your house if you didn't get that sound system"". Which is an inoscent enough question, but I know him and I know that he wouldn't go out of his way to ask me that unless he was seeking info. And to add the cherry ontop, when I looked at snap maps after he asked me, I saw that he was on ghost most which he NEVER does UNLESS he's with the drug dealer guy.

114,"So my BFF is a self proclaimed serial dater. Ever since high school she’s been in one serious relationship after another. In the past she seemed to date guys that seemed like more of a crutch than anything. they were always guys that seemed like they were into her so she liked them back. 

so finally she breaks up with her latest guy after two years. (again this was a guy that wasn’t all that great, kinda drove everyone crazy for various reasons, etc. and it was obvious he just wasn’t the guy for her). she says she broke up with him bc she feels like she’s never really gotten to be single (true) and that she wants to get to explore the single life. (of course as her single BFF i’m stoked to have her back on the single side!)

but then. she goes on a date with this guy, about 3 weeks later, and immediately they fall in love with each other. i’m shocked at how fast this has moved. now they’ve been seeing each other for over a month and hang out a few times a week. but the hard part is, he is a really nice guy and they seem very compatible and she seems so happy, but she’s also so stressed about getting into another relationship so soon. 

so she keeps asking me advice on what to do. on one hand, i feel like she really does need to focus on being single and exploring and learning about herself. but on the other hand, should she really throw out a potentially great relationship just for the sake of being single?

141,"I really find this girl cute and even if I’m not in her league or whatever imma still shoot for it. However, there are a few major problems: In the one class we have in common, she sits in the opposite side of the class. When she comes to class and goes from class she is surrounded by her friends. And tbh, I’d rather not ask her out in front of all her friends; that added pressure and awkwardness is just something I don’t need. Is there some way I can ask her out in private or am I absolutely positively fucked? Cuz the way I see it right now, I’m in the latter. I wanna do it before school ends preferably.(if this helps in any way we  are both sophomores). Then there’s the issue of the “social hierarchy” if you will, on which she is probably way higher than I am. Don’t get me wrong, I’m known, I think I’m pretty popular. People hear my name and go “yea I know that guy” cuz I am quite eccentric. but I’m not a part of like “the popular group”. So if I wasn’t fucked enough before, now I think I’m colossally fucked. Also she’s on the competitive dance team, so there’s that. I’m also not sure if she is single. But guess what; I’m still doing it cuz I’m a crazy motherfucker. Any way I could pull this off (just the asking her out part, not actually getting her to say yes).",31Dec2019,1

143,"I’m a 19 yo guy and I will be turning 20 in April and I am absolutely terrified of aging. I’m starting to see people around me age and grow older and the impermanence of life is terrifying to me. I realize that many would consider 20 to still be a kid but I don’t see my anxiety over this getting any better as time goes on. I will say this however: I am an INCREDIBLY hardworking individual and I can honestly say I haven’t wasted much time so far. I’m in college studying geology which I love and I also work super hard on my guitar playing which is my other passion. I don’t do much else but I’m ok with it because I love the two things I’ve decided to pursue. 

The issue I have is that I feel like I’m not having the life experiences I should be having.  I have celiac disease that went untreated (by diet modification) until I was 17. From about 15 to 17 I was in a lot of pain and hated life. I am in a much better place but still struggling with trying to heal the damage to my body. I’ve made considerable progress but I frequently eat stuff that makes me feel like shit on accident (because of gluten contamination) and just want to sleep all day. I know I’m on the right track with my health but it is so damn frustrating. 

In addition to this I have also never had ANY experience with women whatsoever. Like literally zero. I don’t even have any female friends. I’m introverted but not awkward and would consider myself a considerably above average looking guy (not to brag haha). I think I have a great personality but im just not a huge fan of people. I have a couple close friends both at home and at school but I can’t seem to relate to most people. Everyone loves to go party and get shitfaced at my college (It’s a big party school) and this doesn’t appeal to me at all. I spend all my free time outside of class practicing my guitar like a maniac and working out at the gym with my even more introverted roommate. I care too much about my health to do stupid shit like that. 

On the outside I look like I’m doing pretty good but I feel so unfulfilled. My social anxiety is absolutely terrible and I constantly compare myself to other guys. I just don’t see this getting better. The other day I noticed my hairline has started to recede (my dad is bald) so now hair loss in my 20s is coming up. You can’t be a bald guitarist! It’s not fair! I can’t decide if I’m terrified of getting old or going through the best years of my life without making the most of them. My health is an issue sometimes but it’s something I’m working on and the diet I have to eat will only make me healthier. What do I do to start feeling some excitement in my life? I’m just so overwhelmed by how quickly life passes and how little living gets done.",31Dec2019,1

I might be being too harsh, but some he says about my friends sexuality (which is a sensitive subject) and how toxic he can come off as sometimes just scares me, I get really nervous hanging out with him (even with our group chats on Discord) and I'm worried about the things that he might say. For instance, my friend called him a p\*\*o as a joke for something he'd said earlier, which he then responds with ""only the gays are p\*\*os."" Obviously, it was a joke but it made my other friend really uncomfortable, especially since he's only out to a limited number of people. Or even if he's won a game or beat us in an exam, he'd go on about it. ""What's that? All I hear are bad grades."" ""Sis really said 'irrelevant.'"" and whenever I brought up the subject to him: ""Shut up no one asked you!""

He tends to say that I never listen to him when he has a problem and brings me down for it. If he's mad at me and giving his side of the story, then I'll listen. But if i even dare to disprove to anything he's saying, no matter how true it is, he just insults and fires back at me saying I didn't get his point/fighting against me with insults.

I'd never say this to his face. I hate to confront anyone about anything negative, but especially if it's something along the lines of ""I don't want to be friends with you because the things you say make me uncomfortable."" I could never muster the courage to do it.

146,"I met my crush in person for the first time today. We live far away from each other, but we've been corresponding via email off and on for a few years. In some ways I feel like I know her. In other ways I feel as if she's a complete stranger. I developed a crush on her during a dark period in my life a few years ago and when I told her about it, she turned me down on the grounds that I'd never met in person. She did express a wish that we lived closer to each other, so we could get to know each other. 

She, her grandmother, and I went to see Frozen 2 today. Her grandmother is a family friend who calls me her ""adopted grandson"". Her grandmother is the one who put my crush into contact with me all those years ago. Long story short, we enjoyed the movie, I asked my crush for her number, and she gave it to me. At least she put some number in my phone. It could be fake. I haven't tested it out yet.

It's hard for me to process my feeling. I've had crushes before, and I haven't always handled them in a mature way. I am a hopeless romantic at heart with mental illness and also a very unhappy childhood. I have a history of looking for people who will ""save me"" from myself. It could be something like that. I don't want to pursue it if that's all it is, because that's just immature, stupid, and wrong. Nobody can ""save"" you. There is no salvation in this world.

Another reason I'm skeptical of my feelings is that she's a Christian and I'm not. I'm an Atheist. I'm not against other people being religious, but I would lying if I said I was a Christian. If she's a committed Christian, she would never want to date a man who disagrees with every aspect of her faith (the existence of God, Jesus as his son, heaven, hell, etc.). As for our similarities, we're around the same age. We're both politically left-wing. We're both good students. From what I can tell, she likes my sense of humor. She wants to be an English teacher, so we have a shared love of literature.

148,"I was just thinking about this and wanted to vent a little. Also need a little advice on what to do.

Background: I started college this year and I live on campus which is 30 mins away from my hometown. I’m still pretty close with 3-4 friends from our big “friend” group and really only consider them to be my friends out of the whole group. Im not that social but get along with my suite mates. Once I started college I got texts from one of the kids in the bigger group asking when he could visit. This is where things get weird and what makes me mad. (During the summer I had hung out with them and he was there for a good amount of the times we hung out but we were never really friends. I tried to become better friends with him by starting a streak on snapchat with him which he never responded to multiple times so i took that as a “no we arent gonna be boys” like I am with my closer group.) I had two of my closer friends visit and he came along with them and all of my suite mates liked him and always ask when hes coming back. He doesnt talk to me at all unless he wants to come to my dorm or go to a party. I was just thinking about this and it kinda pisses me off and im not sure how to just cut him off because I will probably see him if Im with friends at home and Im not sure what to tell me suite mates when they start asking about him.

150,"i apologize in advance for the long post. if you read it all, thank you. i love you. 

so, I took care of three dogs for nine days. from the 22nd to the 30th.
one dog belongs to my friend M and the other two to my friend R. 
i have taken care of my friends dogs once before, and they had paid me $15 per dog every day. that’s $45 everyday. 

so the 22nd-30th is 9 days. 9 x $45 = $405 

if you want to be technical and count how the 22nd and 30th weren’t a full day that’s 7 full days ($315) plus two half days ($60) = $375

during the time i was dog sitting, one of the dogs threw up a few times from eating a new bone her owner had given her. gross, but no big deal. one of the other dogs had diarrhea for a couple of days. he has a really sensitive stomach and this apparently happens to him often. i cleaned up explosive diarrhea off the kitchen floor twice. one of those times he also peed on the floor, and his diarrhea had blood in it. so i literally cleaned dog shit, blood, piss off of that floor. and vomit. 

when this happened, i told M and R and they both venmoed me $20 for a trip to the grocery store where i got pee pads, paper towels, medicine for the dog, and disposable gloves. it was only $20, so they overpaid me $20. so subtract $20 from what they owe me. 

if you pay me the full 9 days, that’s $385
if you pay me for 7 full days and two half days, that’s $355

M paid me $120 and R paid me $220. that’s $360. i don’t want to sound ungrateful, but i was really hoping they would pay me more. i was at M’s apartment for 9 days. it was a lot of work. i slept there almost every night so i washed all of her sheets for her before she got home. i cleaned the whole apartment up, got a christmas gift for her and made dinner for her to eat when she got home. i’m not saying she needed to pay me extra for this. 

i feel like they think i did a bad job??? like they’re really intense dog parents and i feel like they thought it was my fault the dogs were throwing up and having diarrhea. maybe they think i gave their dogs human food (i didn’t) and that’s why they got sick. i don’t know!!! 

so i feel really mixed up. when i was dog sitting i thought damn, they’re totally gonna pay me way extra because it ended up being such a shitshow (literally) but i feel like they paid me the bare minimum.

153,"AITA: some weird shit happened and I'm not really sure how to process it.

I don't even know how to possibly explain this, but here goes...

So throughout this past high school marching band season, I (M17) was shocked by a sort of ""harem"" being formed around me by the school's rather small color guard. I know, it sounds weird, but it wasn't anything like a real harem. Basically one of the members, a Spanish foreign exchange student (F15) sent a picture of us all to her cousin who lives in Spain currently (F13-14). Apparently she saw my dace, and found me attractive, saying things like ""stay away from u/ImprovedBore he is MINE"" and shit. I found out about this, found it weird but funny and left it alone.

...until she found my number and contacted me out of nowhere.

I was at my house hosting my grandparents on Thanksgiving for dinner when this happened, got really stressed out, and almost had a panic attack. Frankly, I don't have any real sense of self esteem, have never had a girl approach me out of romantic interest, and didn't have a clue what to do. Eventually, with some help from my parents and marching bandmates, we got things settled. There was no way I could possibly reciprocate her feelings, considering the 3 1/2 year age gap, not knowing a damn thing about her, and the fact that we lived an ocean apart from each other (I live on the east coast US). She understood, but was hurt, so I did what I could to lessen the pain and try to make her think more rationally about it, saying that I would still be in touch with her, while being a little uncomfortable at the same time.

Keep in mind that I really suck at getting back to people about things that really aren't too important.

A few days later, she tried to contact me again, but considering I turn WhatsApp notifications off, I didn't see it. When I did eventually look, she proceeded to get very... clingy, and I began to see her more... crazy... self. The next day, she sent me a long note saying that she wasn't going to talk to me anymore and that she had blocked me, claiming that she realized that it made me feel uncomfortable and the like, albeit in a more guilt-trippy way. I felt bad that I made her feel this way, but I was relieved that this whole situation would be laid to rest.

but it somehow wasn't over. Over the next few weeks, a friend of hers (I'm assuming) added both me and her into a chat, which I didn't see until after it had ended (again, I'm really bad with looking at WhatsApp notifications). I didn't think much of it but was getting more and more freaked out, eventually blocking her. but that didn't work for group chats, apparently.

Just today, I got a message from her saying how pissed she was at me for not talking to her, and how miserable I made her feel. I'm now in a state of confusion and shock, because I merely listened to her requests following my delayed responses.

What should I do exactly? Cuz like I feel really bad for making her feel this way but at the same time I'd rather avoid contact with her if she keeps acting this way.",31Dec2019,1

My first time using Reddit so please try to bear with me if I make mistakes. I feel like I am not doing too much to benefit myself right now financially. I want to start making money, but not by doing something ghetto like flipping my money on shoes or something borderline illegal like drop shipping. I am qualified to get a job, but don’t have any good way of getting to it transportation wise.

I was searching for clothes of mine she stole in our closet and came across her daily journal. She said she writes cool stories in there she thinks of when I saw her writing once and thought I’ll read. It turned out being a diary with only a couple pages filled in, but in it she wrote 

“I’m starting to wonder if I’m depressed or not. Not in a bad way, but I genuinely just don’t feel anything anymore. Maybe the occasional sadness or craziness (she refers to feeling craziness a lot not sure what it is specifically”) and that she’s incapable of caring anymore. Grades have put me in a constant state of sadness and craze”

Next year, I will have a friend group, we'll have awesome NYE plans, and I won't be alone."" I've also never had a solid friend group. I grew up watching my sister have these amazing NYE parties when she was in high school, and those were always really fun for me. Spending time with her friends made me feel really good. Ever since she moved out and graduated from high school, she goes out to drink and ditches me.

Honestly, my depression and anxiety are really triggered by New Year's Eve, and the combination of A.) being alone, B.) being a college freshman, C.) it being a new decade, and D.) it being 2020 (which is so cool and it won't happen again until 3030) has made it a lot worse. I just feel like a failure. I'm aware that people are sick, homeless, and without *any* family or friends, and I know that I have it pretty good because I still have my immediate family with me. However, in high school, I would look at the social media accounts of friends I went to HS with - who weren't popular - who had great social success in college, and they were with their new friend groups for NYE.

I have worked for this company for about 7 months now. it is a fast passed family owned Roofing/Siding company in MO, I have had many meetings with the owners and my direct supervisors to keep track of my performance and have not had a bad review yet, even to the point that I received a raise. I feel I am a hard working and reliable person with generally good attendance, I got many compliments during these meetings for my passion to learn.

I have called in sick from work in the past totaling up to (I believe) 3-4 days total across the 7 months. other than that I have worked an average of 50-55hrs/week since being at the company, I have also been one of the top salesmen at my location since being there.

I am not perfect and I have made some mistakes, miss ordering some materials or forgetting something in the rush, but I constantly tried to push, The company uses a CRM and I was constantly the most active employee at the company.

Today at the end of my shift I was fired, the reason I was given was, and I quote ""A lot of factors, but the straw that broke the camels back was Friday"" I had called in sick Friday after being ill at work during the Thursday work day.

This is the first time I have been fired and I am scared, I have a 4 year old with autism and a wife to support. I know I am still in shock as this happened 4 hours ago, But I need some advice on what to do next. And how to present this to future employers.",31Dec2019,1

181,"my parents found out i was dyslexic in grade 3 cause my grades were really bad, and i really struggled and worked super hard to overcome my learning disability as best as i could. i was also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and depression fairly early on.

fast forward to now, i’m in second year uni, my gpa is awesome, and i’m right on track for med school. so my parents are pretty proud of me and constantly shower me with praise.

my sister in in grade 8 and she has add and dyslexia, unfortunately my parents aren’t working as hard with her as they did with me to overcome her two learning disabilities (i only had one so i already had it easier than her) and she was diagnosed significantly later than i was, she also has pretty bad anxiety. 

due to my parents very obviously favouring me in every possible scenario, i get the feeling that she doesn’t even want to try to better herself, she doesn’t have any motivation to do so. which i can understand. because of al that, her grades are reaalllyyyy bad. 

her and i are extremely close, we do everything together but i’m starting to feel a lot of resentment coming from her. i treat her really well and never ever boast about my successes, instead i tutor her and try to help her improve herself as best as i can. but it’s hard to always be there for her while i’m away at uni. 

what makes it worse is that both my parents are verbally/emotionally abusive to the both of us, but to her far more often. we definitely bonded a lot with each other cause of shared trauma lmao.

i want her to know that i’m so proud of her even though our parents are not, i want her to feel good about herself and i don’t want her to hate/resent me cause my parents obviously favour me over her.

183,"My whole life I have been constantly rejected by women based on my looks. How do I know it's based on my looks? Plenty of experience.

When I was a teen one of my friends who was a tall white good looking guy used to want to do three-way calls with girls he knew with me because I'm funny and charismatic and I would always know what to say to keep the conversation going and make it go well. They would all love talking to me and talk about how great I was. Then I'd meet them and they'd completely change and have zero interest in even talking. 

Once I went to a matchmaker and she connected me blind with a girl. We chatted for a while by text. She kept saying how interesting and nice I was and how great it was to talk to me. Then she sent me her picture and asked me to send  her mine. As soon as I sent her my picture she went cold and basically stopped replying.

Another time I met a girl on 4chan (yeah it happened) who happened to live in the same city as me and we were chatting by email for a while. She even sent me nude pictures. Then she asked me to share my pics. Again, as soon as she saw me she had no interest anymore.

When I do online dating, I can't get any significant number of matches and/or they don't reply. If I do get a like from a girl she's obese. I'm physically fit and I want the same. I've only dated one girl off online dating. If I send personalized messages on sites like Match/POF first I get a reply from maybe 1/30 at best.

If I go  to nightclubs or bars and try to talk to girls, they instantly have zero interest or are cold/rude and turn away or give one word replies or say ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""we're lesbians"" or something and that's it.

Is this all normal or has short height and ugliness ruined my life? I seriously look back and I think this is what happened in my life. I could have had a normal or good life but instead I got shit in large part because my appearance isn't what women consider good enough for them. I posted a pic to Photofeeler and got a 5-6/10, and that's after some surgeries (I was uglier when I was younger). So I know I'm not a monster. But it's like it doesn't matter. I just keep getting treated like a monster either way.

When I was young I thought looks didn't matter for men because women cared about a guy's personality or character. Now I wish my parents would have given me height enhancing drugs in puberty and I could have gotten intensive surgery to be better looking maybe around 20 years old. I didn't know back then that this would happen.

I think he's only really ""there"" in the relationship when it's convenient. If I'm able to make him laugh or in the mood, he'll be there and contribute, but if there's a scenario that requires him to hold his own weight, he'll avoid it as much as he can.

I feel like he thinks everything I say is either a lie or a joke, no matter how serious the topic is. For example:

I don't have a good home life, and whenever I bring up serious problems that go on, he tells me that I'm a liar and that my family life isn't the way I describe it. He's never been to my house, and the fact that he acts as though he knows my home life better than I do feels incredibly insulting.

When I was overweight, I wanted a quick way to get skinny, and I tried to make myself throw up. It didn't work, but once I brought it up and he said I was lying. He also used to call me ""fatty"", but he denies this ever happened now that I've lost the weight.

Recently, I tried to talk to him how this relationship felts demeaning. Instead of having a serious conversation about a serious matter, he started mocking me. He copied and exaggerated everything I did, my accent, every word and incorrect pronunciation, everything.

I kept asking him to ""please stop"", but he ignored that. I eventually snapped and said ""Would you fucking stop?""

He got quiet and apologised, and he genuinely seemed sorry, but I don't know how to feel. I do think that he felt bad, but he doesn't act like it was that serious considering the fact that he's gone back to mocking me and calling me a liar.

I think it'd be best for me to leave, but I'm not sure who to go to. He doesn't let me talk to my old friends and it's been two years. I'm not sure how to tell him that I don't want to spend time with him anymore without sounding rude.

197,"So, I’ve had a dream since I was a kid. I’ve simply always been to afraid to chase it. My dream is to play (American) football. I absolutely love the sport. Watch it every Sunday (and Monday and Thursday). I love breaking down plays, and learning about the very intricate game. 
Right now I have one more year left of highschool. In other words, one more chance to follow my dream. I know and understand more than about football then almost every one on my school football team (I’ve talked to many of them) and I got a big school with an outstanding football team. Like state champ every other year.
So what’s holding me back? Well, I’m small. 5 foot 8 , 140 pounds. Sure there’s been players in the NFL who has been able to excel at that height, but, I’m not sure if I could. 
Despite being fit, and having powerful legs, I’ve never played a game of football. I have no idea if I’m athletic. I mean I got to the gym every single day and bench 160, which isn’t bad for my age or weight, although I want to increase it.
I don’t want to grow old and this be my “what if?” What if I played football? I will never know if I would be any good.
I’m simply to scared to try. No one really knows how bad I want to play. I would have to change everything about my life to pursue it. I’m a musician in my schools marching band, and getting quite good. I would have to drop that for football. I would love to, but I don’t have the balls. What if I’m no good? And anyways it’s not like I’m going to go any where, my school ha immersive depth, and what coach would start a senior who has never played before? Even if I know more about it than anyone, willing to work harder than anyone, I won’t be able to make up for it.
I also don’t want to be wrapped up in the jock stigma. I worry to much about what others think about me.
But honesty at this point, I feel like all I need is someone in my life to push me to do itZ I have never had anyone tell me that I could, and should do it. I feel like that all it would take. But no one will. Therefor I will live my life without ever playing football. It breaks my heart. 
There’s nothing I’m talented at in life. Not many passions. I don’t know what I’m going to do with my life. Football is really my only passion. I really don’t know what to do, and truth be told, I’m afraid I’m going to make the wrong choice.

**The Context**

I came to my friend a few days ago to vent about a recent revelation about my older sister that I had needed to talk about to other than my family. I did not make it clear that I was meaning to vent about this, but nonetheless, he made me feel as though I could not talk to him about this subject. 

The conversation began after he talked to some coworkers of his, asking for a plug for “acid tabs.” Their conversation reminded me of my sister’s schizophrenia because of a talk I had with my mother the day I saw my sister for the first time in awhile. There is a history of schizophrenia on my fathers side that I had no clue about, and my uncle (that I know nothing of) had a long history of drug abuse and schizophrenia that eventually led to him living under a bridge. 

We planned just to hang out and talk for a bit while after I dropped him off at home. My best friend talks about his experiences with different drugs he’s tried, and I say to him that I would love to try tabs, but my family’s history of schizophrenia scares me (regardless of whether or not there is any correlation between the two). I say this because I wanted to ease into the conversation that I needed to vent about my sister. (I have never been great at articulating my feelings) 

**The Details**

I go on to talk to my friend about how my sister has severe schizophrenia, and I had just found out last Christmas night. I relay to him that she didn’t even know it was Christmas because she felt so “trapped” in her house. She wasn’t allowed to drive, she rarely left the house unsupervised, and she resents *her* mother. She whispers to herself, and only occasionally would she hear me and respond to my questions when I was trying to catch up with her. She was out of it, and it hurt to see someone I love but barely know suffer this way. I was really broken up about this all night, but didn’t show it. 

Meanwhile, he kept interjecting to say that “that is how schizophrenia is” or “I sometimes feel trapped with my depression and bipolar,” etc. I feel as though he is completely minimizing my own situation. It wasn’t exactly what he said, but how he said it so dismissively, as if I were completely ignorant to mental illness and it’s effect on people. He’s never talked to me about any of this before, but he felt the need to bring it up while I’m clearly just trying to vent about my own problems. Something I rarely do to begin with because I suck at articulating myself. 

The guy has a good head on his shoulders. He is allowed to work, he has freedom to move around, he has a good and supportive family, while my sister is being “taken care of” by a single mother (with mental issues of her own) who used to feed her diet pills when she was a little chubby pre-teen without a father. There’s a whole slew of shit that she’s been through, but I can’t get into it for personal reasons. 

I felt as though he was trying to make the situation about him, because at this point he is raising his voice to me as I tell him, slightly annoyed, that I am just trying to vent here. He sounded almost as if I were writing off his own struggles- like I didn’t understand. Really, I’m willing to head you out, but I’m trying to get something off of my chest *now*. Not listen to your problems when you were just in a chipper mood. 

So, I just shut up and drive him home. When we arrive, I tell him dejectedly that id talk to him later (with no real intention to, unless he wanted to talk further about this). 

He always talked about before that he feels like we are such good friends, that we can communicate about any issue we have with each other. We could make up over things that upset us, but never have we had to make up over things that made us angry. Well, now he made me feel like that’s no longer true. 

I feel as though an apology is in order, but I doubt that I will see one coming. I’m a person that can easily let things go, and I’m slowly but surely letting this one go, but I refuse to be friends with someone that makes me feel like I can’t vent to them about problems (of which I rarely speak to anyone about), especially when I’m receptive to their drama (of which there has been many with him, not involving me). 

**Question**

*Am I justified in this feeling? Am I being insensitive to him, or was he? And is this a red flag of a potentially bad relationship?*

**TL;DR**

Best-friend compares his depression and bipolar to my older sister’s schizophrenia, mistaking his interjection to the situation as an appropriate response to a friend simply trying to vent about a new and horrible experience. He gets angry when I express my frustration that I’m trying to vent.

206,"I have an infection in my foot that has gotten down into the bone. This is the second one this year. The last time this happened, I had two choices: amputate part of the foot, or treat with antibiotics. I chose the latter. I spent a week in the hospital, followed by 7 weeks with an IV in my arm at home pushing my own meds, then another month+ waiting for the wound to close up.  It was a long and painful experience, but I finally recovered from it. 

Now, I have the same issue on the opposite side of my foot. I have the same choice. Given how long the process took to heal last time (almost 4 months total), I have asked about the amputation route this time. The surgeon has told me that I won’t lose too much physically, and should be able to function at 95% of normal. And the time for procedure and recovery is less than a month. 

The second occurrence is not directly related to the first. So it’s not spreading. It was just a bad set of circumstances that caused it. Amputating will remove any chance of reoccurring in the same location (obviously), but I did respond very well to antibiotics the first time and seem to have eradicated the original problem.

So, do I drag this out for potentially another 4 months to keep all my factory parts in tact, or do I just take the hit, and hopefully end it here and now?  I’m just fatigued with having dealt with this already, and not sure if taking the surgery route is just giving up, or if I should just keep going. 

The surgeon is leaning towards the amputation, but he also did that the first time and said less than 25% could recover the way I did.",31Dec2019,1

208,"So for a bit of perspective. The ""drug"" was weed, something I've been smoking since I was 16. I'm now 19. I've always liked having a smoke but never really went overboard with it used in moderation. I dropped out of University in my first year as I was failing, and I was failing because I was missing classes and exams due to anxiety and just a general negative outlook on live. Weed was something which would relax me and clear my mind usually a good way to relax and calm my anxiety if I was feeling any. After dropping out I hid it from my parents for a few weeks until I finally had to tell them. They were dissappointed but could see the effect it was having on me. I was in a bit of a dark spot after dropping out for a few months and smoked a good bit of weed. All this time I was working retail but decided to quit and start an electrician apprrenticeshift. Somewhere within this period I had a total change of perspective and a new drive. I started my apprenticeship, started working out a lot and passed my driving test. Months went by, I kept working out and working on my job. I bought a full set of tools and was enjoying learning. Now my job is residential electric so it's working on different houses around my area. My car is absolutely vital to me having a job. The pay is only €6.50 for 18months but goes up every year after for 4 years.
Then I was pulled over by the police and ever since then it's just been a worry at the back of my mind. I've stopped working out and lost all my gains and just find myself filled with a sense of doubt. Doubt about everything, it's hard to see a path ahead sometimes.

Now my dilemma is 2 months ago I was pulled at a police stop driving after smoking a joint and was brought in for a saliva test (positive) and a blood test (pending-2-3 more weeks). When the blood test comes back I will relieve a summons to court and because this is in Ireland the law is a minimum disqualification of 1 year driving, up to a €5,000 fine and a 6month prison sentence. 
I am going to lose my job and I feel heartbroken imaging telling my parents. I feel like a failure and it's hard not to be overwhelmed by sadness thinking about it.

My plan is to do up my CV and to try get into a electrician company that is local and dosent move or something of close locally that can pick me up. 
Long term I want to flip houses and I feel like this is definitely a big stepping stone. But I've had time to think about it and if I can get a job somewhere where I don't need my car for a year I can get over this and even just writing it out like this brings a small sense of calm.

The Ex in question who we will call ""Emma"" I dated from January to March. We were very different in our personalities and we broke up due to not being able to really bond with anything, I mean we were polar opposites you know, but she wasn't ever a bad girlfriend, and I enjoyed seeing her a lot, and she played a really good role in my life and I would do a lot to go back in time and change how I did things when we ended our relationship officially, I name called her and was really immature about everything going on, and maybe if I wasn't we could still be together this day.  


Post-relationship I was single until June. I dated this new girl who we will call ""Savannah"" all summer and honestly it was probably the best relationship of my life. Once school started up things got iffy. I am a senior in high school right now and Savannah is a junior. She felt I had disrespected her family, to clarify: I sometimes called her mother crazy, her mother wasn't the most accepting of allowing her to hang out with me so I can say that sometimes I downed her mother but it was only in times of her saying it first, thus I agreed. (looking back I should've never agreed and I should've treated her mother with respect... I mean come on now she is a single mother.) So Homecoming came around and since my Girlfriend at this time ended up not going to homecoming with me because her mother would not allow me to, she ended up going to homecoming with her Neighbor (a guy) and I was not allowed to come over for pre-hoco pictures. So I ended up breaking up with her. I danced with another girl at homecoming and from there on things were kind of over. But... I ended up talking to her again for a week or two. We both agreed we were willing to continue the relationship and we did some things that were sexual and agreed to try again, but we never officially labeled our self for the second time.   


During this exact time, a girl in my history class the year previous who we will call ""Makayla"" had broken up with her boyfriend and I asked what happened, I ended up catching feelings for this girl and I thought to my self... ""Should I go back to Savannah who's family dislikes me a lot? Or... should I try things with Makayla"" so, I chose to break things off with Savannah and tried to talk to Makayla. Now I've talked to her for a little over a month, we have done a couple things but after a month now I can't find my self not thinking about those two relationships I've had and how happy I was in them when they were working. Yesterday I told Makayla I was not looking for a relationship and I didn't feel morally right about how we were not keeping things platonic when we clearly are not in a relationship. I feel like a jerk for leading her on but how I feel is that I am not ready to be in a ***new*** relationship.

I want to write a letter to Emma explaining how I feel... in fact, I have it written out already.

""Hey, I don't know why I'm writing to you, I know it probably will not mean much to you. As you can probably know I am too proud to apologize to you in person. We were only together for a short amount of time, but you played a significant role in my life and I took our time together for granted. I'm sorry for the way things ended between you and I.  I was a lot more immature 9 months ago and you didn't deserve what happened. I'm not expecting anything out of you from writing this, I just felt I needed to share how I feel. You can throw this away if you'd like. Thank you for helping me start off 2019 with someone really cool and unique and even though things didn't work out between us, that's okay and I want to wish you the best and most promising future.""

&amp;#x200B;

So really I just want to know if this is a good idea about writing a letter, I mean what really am I trying to get out of it, Emma is in a relationship and has been for the last 7-8 months and she seems happy and I don't want to ruin that for her. Am I being selfish, should I not say anything? In a week it will have been a whole year since we started that relationship. Will I come off desperate, is there even a point? What do I do.",31Dec2019,1
211,"My best friend, one who ive been friends with for about 7 years (im 17 he is 16)  is going through something i dont understand. I havent lost a loved one yet, so im sure what to do for him.

214,"Hi, i’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub. I just need somewhere to write this all out without having consequences.

So i’m 14, 15 very soon. This might just be of puberty or teenage hormones or something... but i’m just a mess right now.

For some context, i manipulated my closest friends back in November. More specifically, my boyfriend (i’m bi). We broke up and then I manipulated him to get back with me again. We broke up again shortly after because he came to his senses. I was (and am) a horrible person for doing this. I put it straight because i have the tendency to fluff my stories to favor me. I still talk with my friends and my ex, but it’s very tense. I just want to talk to them like normal again, but it’s clear that that won’t happen.

On to what this post is about.

My mind has been going in a circle since this whole... thing happened. Basically my thought process is this:
1. I need to stop manipulating people. Ill act OK and repress my feelings.
2. No, that won’t work. Ill have to act tense.
3. No, that’ll be playing the victim card. (Note: that’s basically how i manipulated my friends)
4. Repeat thoughts 1-3.

To be honest, the thought process is more complicated, but it’s too long to write out. It really all boils down to this.

Beyond this point will be edgy stuff that i’ll probably look back on and puke. Or something.

I don’t know how to act. To be honest, I don’t know who i am. What was my personality before I went haywire? I had anger issues when I was little, was I always this mad? Have I always wanted to beat the ever loving shit out of my friend who “started” this whole thing (he didn’t. It was my mind that thought so)? 

Have I always been this much of a piece of shit? Probably. My old school friends always say that I was an asshole kid. I was just the “bully” in the lunchroom. My other friends always say that I was hard to approach. Maybe that’s why I didn’t have any friends in my first year of camp. Maybe that’s why I threatened to kill myself and maybe that’s why they all cared. They only cared because of my shitty manipulation practices. 

I’m a fucking disgrace. I’m not lying. 

The only escape from this dumbass situation is daydreaming. All I do is turn on some music, lay back, and just let my imagination take the wheel. I do this for hours. Late at night, during class, damn, even during meals. Its getting to the point where I can’t tell what’s real or not. 

What do I daydream about? I daydream about being a better person. Everyone would like me, I would have more friends, I would go outside more, I would be successful, I would be *happy*. 

Nothing really makes me happy anymore. Seriously. I’m an artist going to an art school, but even that isn’t cheering me up anymore. Drawing my dirty fantasies isn’t helping either. 

God, I’m not even religious, but there has to be something, someone looking down and judging us. Judging me.

I’m going to hell. Or something like that.

I’m a failure. I’ve quit every sport i’ve played, my grades are declining, and my art skills are deteriorating. I am utterly useless in every field of life. I’ve concluded a long, long time ago that i’m not fit for life.

There I go again playing the victim card. I really need to stop doing that. I need to stop. Everything.

Sorry about the long post. I’m not OK, as you can see.

I need advice on how to act or what to do, guys. Please.

Peace.",31Dec2019,1
215,My girlfriend had been on vacation for 2 weeks and when she got back I was really looking forward to having sex with her. We went out and got really drunk and when we got home I was really excited to have sex again. We started having sex but she said we needed to stop cus she wasn’t feeling well. Soon after she passed out. She was just In her panties and she looked sooo hot. I put my fingers in her and she didn’t seem to react so I put my penis in her. She was still really wet. I fucked her for like 10 minutes and then made sure to cum in a towel. I’m starting to feel really guilty and I’m going to tell her. What can I do to make her less mad at me?,31Dec2019,1

217,"So about 6-7 weeks ago my mom came home from an outpatient center for individuals who suffer from alcoholism. She works a fairly stressful job but not enough that I’d think for that to emerge. I love my mom and she is the best my all standards, except for honesty and trust. Whenever we ask her where’s she’s going she always gives us the silent treatment. I’ve seen her cry before, but I have no idea what it was about. My dad on the other hand, he’s well, not doing great. He routinely cries 2 times per day (but we’re working on that) and is just sad. My mom has been getting worse over the past few years and finally she getting better. But she shamed him and puts him down because he “exposed her”. I am trying to help my dad and he’s doing a lot better since she first came home but I’m well, not. I get sad multiple times throughout the day and I never cry but I just feel anxious and depressed. The feeling of anxiousness gives me panic attacks sometimes causes me to stop breathing for one second. I repeat ONE second. I know it’s not a lot, but this has been going on since I learned why my mom was going to be away for 6 weeks. Any advice or tips appreciated.

221,"Hi!

I wanna start this by already saying thank you for using your time to read this and possibly replying. Also I want to apologize for bad english. Im from Finland so its not my native language. Ill try my best :)

So...im not sure where or how to start this but I think I should do it in chronological order. (THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG ONE)

I (M17 back then) started to date (F18 back then). It was my first relationship and of course I was excited. ""Problems"" began right at the start of that relationship. We talked a lot about seeing each other and every day we agreed to meet, there was always some problem with her. We could agree on seeing at evening but she would stay cruising around town with her friends untill midnight or she would end up drinking alcohol and end up in her home and we of course would not meet that day. It was my first relationship and because it was so exciting and I liked that girl backthen I forgave her everytime without bigger concerns. When that relationship got more serious there started happening more and more some weird stuff. First thing was she canceled her cellphone service provider contract because she had ""troubles"" with her interent connection all the time. I let it slide because I thought that shes 18 so she would take another service provider immediatly because lets be real...who in this time of age would want to be without internet connection? We also had a problem with her anxiety problems. She didnt like to be hugged or be even near me in public places. That kinda bothered me even more but still...I let it slide because I thought maybe she is really anxious person and that is a real thing. Well it went months and she didnt get her internet connection back to her phone so it was really hard for me keep contact with her if she didnt have WIFI or some friends around her giving her internet. I started to wonder if she didnt want an internet connection to her phone just so I couldnt contact her and she would always be able to say ""sorry I didnt have internet"". I want to add also that she was never jelous of other girls that i talked to. I first thought it was good thing and a I still think it is but considering all the other things it seemed a bit weird to me. AND ALSO I tried talking to her about these issues many times and she always said she would do something sbout them and I voluenteerd to help her of course. Nothing changed.

Imma fast forward here a bit so this wouldnt be too long. She started to be really close friends with this other guy and of course that raise my suspisions even more. One day I came from work and saw that his car turned from the intersection where he lived and he drove past me. I saw my GFs head in his cars front seat but obly her hair. I noticed that and send her a snapchat asking where she is. She send a pic of a local shops vending machine and asked ""why are you asking?"". I said I saw her with that other guy coming from hes place. She answered she was just sitting in hes car and they went to ""pick something from hes house"". I let it be. 

Fast forward on that night we broke up. I was driving my friends to another close city to go drinking. I had 2 girls on my car that evening because they werent interested to go drinking in a bar or night club. My GF was also drinking that same night. She knew some how that I had to girls on my car with and got furious. (I didnt try ti hide it in anyway but I dont know how she knew about it). She asked me to take her home and i agreed. I took her home and at her yard she started accusing me of cheating on her. Shes was a little drunk but still...she yelled at me, hit me and smashed cars door. I jumped out of my car yelled her that ""its over"". My first relationship that lasted about a year.

Fast forward:

to the day that my little sister was spending some time with my EX GF. They were driving around with that dude that I was a little jealous about that my GF hung out with him. At one time my sister went to see some other friends quick and my EX and that guy dissappeared. My sister tried to look for them and she called them but none of them answere. She went to hes house and knocked on the door. He didnt answer on the first time but second time he did. He said ""not now"". My sister asked if my EX was in there with him and he answered ""maybe"". Next day my sister texted me about that after my school day and I texted my EX about it and asked ""how long has this been going on?"" Her answer: ""leave me alone"". So I did.

I believe that she cheated on me before we broke up. Considering all the things in our relationship I think it was really obvious. She hasnt admitted to that to this day but every other person Ive talked about it says they believe so as well.

Fast forward to this time of age.

I (M19 today) met this really nice and cute girl (F19) on a website. We met up once in parking place after we discussed about meeting in real life. She came with her friend of course because I was still ""random guy from internet"". We talked some time and then they went to continue their day and I went home. 

Fast forward here. 

I started to develope some feelings of her and I felt she also did about me. Still I was kinda afraid or shy to tell her about. 
One day she went on a cruise with her cousin and there drank alcohol and ended up in bed with some guy. (She didnt tell it straight next morning but I knew it considering her snaps). It didnt feel great, well because I had feelings for her and I thought shed had feelings for me too. I kinda got over it in couple of days and asked her out. She agreed. We went on date and Ive never been more happy. It was my first real date because I didnt do anything with my EX because she was anxious about everything. After the date I took her home and she asked if she could call me. I said yes. She called me when I was almost at home asked if I would like to start a realtionship with her. I agreed. 

Fast forward

We have been in a relationship about 3 months and I love her to death and shes also said she loves me. She lives in about 2hour drive from my house but weve managed to see each other nearly weekly. Weve been on couple of other dates together and I think weve both enjoyed it. Buuuuuut Ive started to have some trust issues with her. Ive always said to her that ""she can tell me anything at anytime and anywhere and that all I want is honesty"". Ive asked her about that night on the cruise ship and if shes been contacting that guy after the incident. Shes always said no. She even said that they didnt change phone numbers or social media information and that she doesnt know his name or where he lives. Well this evening I started a conversation about it again because Ive had a feeling for a long time that shes not telling everything. She ended up confessing she indeed was in contact with that guy after their night on the cruise ship and said they talked about meeting each other again. To her defense she said this was before our date and it was only talk and they ended up never meeting or talking again after our date. But still...She ""lied"" about not changing phone numbers, not knowing his name, not knowing his living town, not speaking to him. She said he lives in about 1hour drive from her place and that makes me a little anxious knowing that she might go to his place anytime and because of me living far from her id not have no idea. And how could I even know? But I am jealous about him in other ways and one of them is that I havent had sex with her yet. Ive said that sex isnt that important like it isnt to me but still in some way it bothers me. She ended up having some STD from that cruise ship night and she doesnt want to ""infect"" me. Its not 100% sure but its very likely. (I understand that she has a lot of pressure on her because of that and her not wanting to infect me but I try to support her and to me it isnt even that big thing because from what Ive read its not that serious). To add to this ive talked about my trust issues to her and talked about where they might be coming from and she has said she understands. Thats why she was afraid to tell me about those things even tho Ive said that telling the truth might hurt me in that moment but in a long run its much better then lying.

So...my first relationship was horrible in all ways and I believe I was cheated on. That causes trusting issues in this new relationship. (Ive never blamed my new GF about it).
But after this evening Ive really started to have bad trust issues with her even tho I want to believe her and I love her. Considering all the things she lied about this whole time I have some issues trusting her and what she told about it being only one time thing and they not meeting after that. And also in the future this might cause some problems considering trusting her.

I might seem like a selfish guy for being so jealous about these things. Or insecure (wich I totally am) but I think I have good reasons to be...I dont know. You tell me. Im in a point that I dont know what to do. Thats why I wrote here...for some advice.

Thanks! And sorry for it being too long. I think it was necessary to know about my past relationship also because it has carried some ""bad seed"" to this new relationship.",31Dec2019,1
222,"This sounds very stupid but a lot of nights I can’t sleep I’m so scared there’s something in my bedroom.

As soon as I close my eyes I have to quickly check the grudge girl or something disfigured isn’t hiding on my wardrobe or something. I know this is the sort of thing for kids but it really messes with me. I’m scared to flush the toilet once everyone else in my house is asleep, I run up the stairs with my heart racing convinced something is at the bottom.

I can’t have a mirror in my bedroom because I have to keep checking it just to make sure there’s nothing staring back at me. I haven’t watched a horror film in years.

It’s not just small things I make up entire scenarios of horrible things as soon as I close my eyes and try to sleep.  I was up until 5am the other night because I couldn’t sleep with the door closed in case something was on the other end but at the same time when I left it open I kept imagining something sticking it’s head round it.

My friends think the situation is hilarious and have resorted to screenshotting  any photo I send them and asking “what is that behind you?” Or when we face time acting scared and point behind me. I don’t feel like it’s a joke anymore I’m terrified to be alone and can’t even get a drink after about 12am.

And to be honest this whole situation is just very nerve racking. Coming from a male who most of his life believed he’s straight, this whole thing is very exciting/scary for me.

224,"I live in a home with 4 other people and considering my car is one of the older cars that we have within the bunch I opt out of the driveway and just park on the street.

She’s gotten lax with boundaries and she doesn’t always respond promptly when he does something gross (like wipe his hands on the couch, or eat at the couch). Being that it is New Year’s Eve, I can’t imagine sending her away after the ball drops, but I also can’t imagine having her toddler sleep over.

228,"So for months I've been looking for a pet bird, and done plenty of research. I finally found a wonderful seller for the price of $400 USD, with two cages included. My mother isn't fond of birds and disagrees with the idea of me buying one, although she knows I've been looking for one for months.

229,"I may end up having to elaborate on this a lot but for now I'm going to keep it short as I can.

So, I have a sibling that was taken at age 6 or 7 by an uncle during my mom and dads divorce. He may possibly be her father. This was 20 some odd years ago and I was 15-16 years old so I wasn't at an age that I really gave a fuck about what was going on. I already worked a lot and was out hanging out with friends if not so I don't have the best grasp of what things were happening when I wasn't around so I can't very well explain how my sister got taken. My Mom has told me that she thought she was doing something good for my sister since my uncle does well for himself financially and also possibly was the father. I have never asked my Dad why he let my uncle take my sister but I imagine he just came and pretty much asked if she could spend the night at his house and then she never came back. To be honest I think my Dad may have figured this might happen but he let her go anyways. I think hes afraid of his older brother and with good reason, at the time he was a very intimidating person. He drank a lot and he could get crazy as fuck when he was mad. I think that whole side of the family is scared of him to this day. I also think thats why nobody has ever said anything to him about this situation. 

Relevant information:

I know my sisters ""dad"" has told her not to see my mother. He told her that if she tries to see our mom then she doesn't need to come see him again. I have this confirmed by 2 different family members. Everyone has suspected this but no one has ever admit to have heard him say it.

My sister hates now my mother and will not even give her a chance despite my mom wanting nothing but that for at the least a very long time. I cannot speak on her effort levels to keep my sister during the divorce and there are two very different versions depending on if you ask my sister or our mom. I stopped by and saw her at her ""dads"" house when she was 11 or 12 and all she would do was talk shit about mom and then look up at him for approval. It pissed me off and it discouraged me from visiting.

My uncle contacted me probably 10 years ago and At that point had written my sister off and had moved to another state anyways and none of this was fresh on my mind so I didn't have a problem talking with him. During the conversation it steered towards my mother and his relationship and he described it as, this is no shit, Hulk Hogan and Macho Man's relationship. He said that they were the best of partners and when the separated that they were the greatest of enemies. (This shit is hilarious I know, please don't laugh) He then started talking bad about my mother and I don't recall exactly what it was but it got to the point where I had to tell him that me and him wouldn't have a relationship if he thought he was going to call me and talk shit about my mother.

By chance my sister moved to my town which is 5.5hrs away from where we grew up. The very first night she came over she cried and asked why mom didn't love her and I told her that wasn't true at all and that mom loves her very much and talks about her all the time. I thought she would want to see her by the way she was acting but she insisted that she would never even consider seeing her.

If I need to elaborate or fill in anymore blanks I will, this story has so much shit to it and I'm not staying on here all night unless there's something I need to do right now.

So to the brainwashing. I and others believe that my sister has been brainwashed and manipulated into hating her mother as a form of punishment from her ""dad"" to my mom because he can't get over her despite it being 20+ years ago. What do I need to do to help my sister understand that her family loves her. What do I do about my uncle? He still controls her even though she has a husband and a child now.",31Dec2019,1

231,"I don’t know who to tell this to. I’ve only told one person. This might come down if I become overwhelmed. 

I am 16 and female. I came to the US at 3 years old. For most of my childhood, I lived with only my mother and older (17y/o) brother. 

When I was 8, my father came migrated from our country to live with us again. 

Around this time, my mother had a baby — my younger brother. She had been going to school but decided to instead start a family daycare in our home, as she didn’t want to search for childcare. 

One of the first kids (D) was a 4y/o, about 4 or 5 years younger than me at the time. My mother started off in the summer, and I was not busy, she sometimes asked me to help out with things like bottle feeding the babies or entertaining the kids. 

One of the ways she also asked me to assist was by supervising D when he went to the bathroom. So I did. But sometimes bad things ended up happening. I remember kissing D on his lips and also putting my mouth on his private parts. 

I never talked to anyone about this. I don’t remember it 100% clearly. But I’ve seen similar stories in which people say that this doesn’t happen unless the kid has been exposed to this stuff. I never stumbled across porn at this age, nor did I know anything about sex. 

How do I make sense of this? I really hope it’s not a part of D’s memory now. He must be about 11 years old now.",31Dec2019,1
232,"This isn’t interpersonal advice, like most of the advice asks here, but I’m hoping some who workout and exercise regularly might be of some help.

I’ve been meaning to for a while, but with the start of a new year/decade on the horizon, a recent 18th birthday, and a new relationship I feel like this is the push I need. I plan to workout, fix my diet, and improve my overall health, but I’m not sure exactly what I should be doing.

I have a gut I need to work down, which if I’m correctly informed would be helped by both exercise and diet, I am not very strong and want to be stronger, and I have horrible skin. The problem arises when I try to figure out *what* tackles each of them. Which diets are good for cutting down a gut? Which exercises work in gut? Which on endurance? Which on general strength? What diets works wonders for acne and general skin health?

We decided we wanted to do something for new year’s eve. so we made a group chat and we decided that it was going to be at one of the guy’s house. Here’s the thing. My parents are of the belief that girls and boys can’t *just* be friends. My parents are also of the belief of if they don’t know the parents personally, i can’t go to their house. The thought of this makes me extremely anxious and i get so scared to ask them to go out. Because of this, i’ve only been able to hang out with one person outside of school and school events. I’d like to believe i’m a good child. I have a 4.0 and I’ve never gotten in any trouble. I just want to be a teenager. I haven’t done any drugs, and i’ve been offered and i’ve said no. i will let her drug test and sobriety test me all she wants after.

241,"Okay, I dont know where else to go with this to get an impartial opinion... thank you all in advance for reading, I really mean it when I say I appreciate it. This has been weighing pretty heavy on me for the better part of a year, and I haven't felt like I can talk to anyone about it in a productive way. 

So, to save a LOT of typing, here's the gist of things; my ex broke up with me last year in a really nasty way that she knew would hurt me. It's been a year since then and her and I have talked some. The thing is, its ALWAYS about her and her needs and wants and how she feels, and not ONCE about how I feel. Few days ago, she tells me she still thinks of me as her lover and how she still loves me, even though shes dating someone and dated another guy earlier this year. 

Here's what I need help with: am I selfish for feeling resentful that she hasn't asked how I feel after all this time? I've tried asking my friends about this, but they all tell me that she just uses me for emotional support, which to be fair, that IS basically most of what we talk about when her and I do talk. Just her life and emotions and feelings. My thing is, I still love her a lot. I was really, really sad after what she did and get mad sometimes still, but I'm not sure if that anger is just built up resentment or what. 

Would it be wrong of me to tell her how I feel like its always about her, and how resentful it's starting to make me? I really, REALLY hate feeling the resentment and anger and frustration... it isnt who I am. I really miss feeling good and loving and happy and secure. 

I can elaborate on anything and everything if anyone wants me to, I'm just typing from my phone right now and wanted to get this out and posted while I have the courage to. I've been wanting to ask/get feedback for the better part of 2 weeks but just havent had it in me I guess.

i just don’t know what to do about my highschool friends. 

i miss hanging out with them so much like we used to, but so much has changed. 

I work four days a week, see my gf two/three and, due to conflicting schedules, i usually see my friends once every few weeks.

i always try to make myself available but they don’t seem like they want to hang out with me as much. none of them are going to school, most of them change jobs pretty frequently, and they all just get stoned and watch tv every day. 

i can’t smoke because of my anxiety, and this has further strained our relationships. It’s really all they do.

Furthermore, when they’re hanging out i’ll sort of joke about not being invited but they’ll always say stuff like “all we’re doing is smoking, didn’t think you’d want to come” 

i fucking suck at making friends and i’ve known these guys since we were in kindergarten, i don’t want to just make new friends, but i can’t go on feeling like i’m on my own. my girlfriend makes me happy but she’s really the only person i’m close with, when i’m used to having 10 of my brothers who always had my back.

245,"I work for a local grocery company and I've been with them for 3 years, I started as a stocker ($10hr)and worked my way up the ladder after three months I was moved to their morning crew ($12hr) which was a type of promotion and came with a raise because it came with more responsibilities. After four months of this I was asked if I wanted to be a front end manager ($14hr) which came with another raise and I said yes but after six months of this I was asked if I want to be a Assistant manager (aka manager on duty) and this would move me to be a salary employee and would almost double my pay to $1000 a week so of course I said yes. After a year of being at this new position I was given a 10% raise without asking and about two weeks later I was transferred to a different store I had no say in this but went with it because I thought that's what the raise was for but at this new store I was no longer at the bottom of the totem pole and instead of having four managers above me I only had two I wasn't told of any difference in the position by the supervisor but was given title of grocery manager of this new store and was in charge of all grocery related matters and that's a huge difference from what I was doing at the other store in which I only closed the store and got it ready for the next day but now I was given daily ordering, in charge of making sure all seasonal items are on the sales floor and properly displayed,  all stocker schedules, and booking future bulk buy items with vendors and the warehouse, I didnt mind because I was eager to move up. I've  been doing this for about eight months. But one day the store manager was wanted to teach me all of the payroll procedures he does throughout the week and I saw every person's (under management umbrella ) pay and both the assistants under me were making 25% more than me and I asked the store manager about it and he said I have to talk to our supervisor about it, that he can only recommend and raise. I  didnt bring it up to him again but its bothering me and I feel like I'm being under paid.

I've talked to my father for some advice and he thinks that it's because they've been with the company much longer than I have. I dont agree with him if I have more responsibilities and they take orders from me I should be paid accordingly. 
 
I'm not sure if to drop it and wait until I get there or to bring it up to my supervisor and ask to be paid more than what I am getting right now. 

Some info 
-This is a relatively small business around 30 stores and with around 60 employees each store depends on the size but that's the average.
-I'm 20 male

246,"Ok. First off I want to say that I have a psychiatrist. Now that we got that out of the way, I’ve never done anything against the law that isn’t something like a speeding ticket. 

Everything I ever did was ‘socially unacceptable’? Against the social norms and unspoken rules of society? I don’t know. All I know is that people don’t like me. Tough love, I get that. A lot of people will not like you in life. Thats normal. But I have this annoying fear that people will recognize me for the asshole I am and hate me behind my back. It’s stupid. It’s ridiculous. I did not kick someone’s puppy or did something totally evil like add permanent dye in someone’s shampoo bottle for kicks. I have no idea why I got this stupid idea in my head that randos I met on the street will suddenly know that I was socially insecure in college and easedropped on their conversations to hear if they said anything bad about me. I don’t do it anymore. I’m on medication for it and other paranoia. I’m just so goddamn paranoid that people will know the things I did that were wrong. Just people I meet on the fucking street or online. 

It’s ridiculous. It sucks. I sometimes say things to catch if people know about me or think about me in some way. Sometimes I’m so fucking paranoid that I don’t go out to meet new people when all I want are people and friends. I’m so tired. 

Just want to add, I do have friends and a life. I guess I’m ranting at this point. I just hate having mental issues.

249,"I (F,23)had a really close friend(M,22) for three years.  He was one of my best friends, and helped me when I was depressed about my mom having stage 4 cancer, and after my close friend in college died. I was there for him when his girlfriend he wanted to marry left in a day. He told me "" I would have killed myself if not for you. I can never repay you. "" and that he didn't understand how someone could love you, and then just \*snap\* leave you, and he didn't understand how to trust anyone anymore. We hugged and he promised to never leave me as a friend.  


We get closer for 6 months, and end up really liking each other. We went on road trips together and spent everyday for a year talking, telling each other everything. He shook as he told me he loved me, and wanted to date me, but' i had just gotten out of my first relationship of 4 years 6 months ago, and felt so scared. I loved him so much but I needed more time. I told him I wasn't ready. He asked me to ask him to wait. I was scared and couldn't say it. We hugged and promised to never leave each other as friends.   


He got more and more distant, and after a month I got upset and asked him if he still wanted to be friends, because I felt like he never had time to talk to me, or even play stupid internet games anymore like we did when his girlfriend was still around and we were just friends.  He said he didn't mean to, and he was just busy. I felt so cast away, like he had never really been my friend. I left for a few days, and then messaged him saying if we were to be friends, we needed to talk in person. he said okay.  


He never contacted me. after two months i contacted him and we talked. I cried and asked if he wanted to be friends. he said yes, but it was so cold. he said he had really valued our friendship.   
I told him I loved him, and that if he still wanted me, I felt ready. He told me he didn't love me anymore. I said okay. I could deal with that and never mention it again. I just wanted my friend back, to play stupid internet games with and talk to sometimes as we grew up and saw each other have kids.   


He ghosted me.  
I sent him a letter saying I was so sorry for everything. and 6 months passed. I had become extremely depressed and suicidal over it. He had been my best friend. and we promised never to leave. He had been at my side through deaths and depression and sadness all just as a friend and was just gone. He didn't even say goodbye.   


I got up and went to his house. I walked up and saw him with a girl from our friendgroup in his window. I knocked. He told her "" shes here"" in disbelief and disdain. she turned to look at me with a holier than thou look. He came out and lead me to a parking lot. told me he had no ill feelings toward me. I asked him why he ghosted. He said he had nothing more to say to me. that too much had happened and we couldn't be friends. He turned around and went back without saying goodbye. I went and curled up in my car and just cried.  


Its been a 7 months since then. I went and hung out with old friends today. They started talking about him and the girl and how that friend group had broke up because they ignored everyone for each other. It feels like my guts have been ripped out again. How can i stop hurting.

253,"To provide some quick background, I've had a good friend for the past fourteen years. Him, and a lot of other friends from that group have always exchanged holiday gifts with one another, and I've never participated. I'm sure I'd be welcome to participate, but the stress of getting involved in the big exchange has always turned me off to the notion. These friends have been exchanging for at least five years, and I've never participated, which I don't think any of the friends really mind (they don't give me, I don't give them, instead we just hang out and laugh around the holidays).

Around two years ago, my wife's best friend of 20 years began dating this other friend of mine. My wife and her have always exchanged gifts for the duration of our relationship, which again, perfectly fine with, just not the relationship I have with my friends. However, this year, we had those friends over for Christmas Eve, and while my wife's friend pulled out a bunch of gifts, my friend handed me a card with a fairly generous gift card. My heart sunk; I felt so badly that I hadn't gotten him anything. Had I know he was getting me a gift, I would've made the effort to get him a little something. To provide more context, we had another friend from that group over that night, and he didn't bring me anything, so I don't think anyone thought I was joining the exchange this year. Instead, I think his girlfriend insisted that he bring a gift since she exchanges with my wife.

This was on 12/24, and I've been racking my brain to decide what the proper etiquette is. I was of course very grateful, and told him it was completely unnecessary. He told me that giving gifts isn't about receiving, and thanked me for hosting them for the evening. I am unclear on what to do; should I be getting him a gift? should I send him a thank you card? Is it rude to ask him to not exchange in the future, because although the sentiment was great, I feel uncomfortable now in my current situation? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",31Dec2019,1

263,"This morning's interview was very promising. I elaborated upon the points she found most important and she liked it a lot. Lots of smiles and ""very good""s. It was a relaxing conversation and she said that she's ""excited to hand over my resume"".

It was with a Recruitment agency. The woman had a list of points to read out to me. Two of which were the good ol' ""Treats employees like family"", as well as the quote in the title.

In case you're unaware, this can indicate that bosses put pressure on their employees to go beyond their capacities under the premise that they're family and they do right by each other. I was told that this is typically done by being asked to stay back and do unpaid overtime. I'm a bit on edge but HAVE to take this job if it's offered to me and stick it out even if it's bad. Gotta have a roof over my head and stuff. Refusing the job without a backup is not an option regardless of how toxic it may sound. This will be my first job that isn't self-started in 7 years.

**My question is: What else should I look out for with workplaces that involve this kind of mindset, aside from the guilt-tripping? Is there a way to circumvent overworking myself with minimum conflict?**

My girlfriend had pointed out that if asked to ""stay back 10 minutes to help with something"", I need to reply that my shift ends at 5pm. But surely that interaction can progress further beyond just my reply. I don't know how to manage this kind of thing with a boss-worker dynamic. I so highly value honesty that I'm worried I could ruin chances for a good reference if I'm TOO confrontational. Advice?

&amp;#x200B;

I was also told that it's a family-owned company, they have a high employee turnover rate due to staff being overwhelmed by the fast-paced environment (I was provided enough info for this to not be vague and understand why it's fast) and that I'll be replacing somebody in an office of 4 others. I'm competing against up to 2 others for the role. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My highest priority** is to take the job and then come out of this with a promising reference for the next job I apply to. I will have 4 months probationary period and was told that I could stay or leave at the end if it doesn't work for me, so that's my go-to if this doesn't work out. I will take 4 months of sneaky swept-under-the-rug unpaid overtime if it means a good reference. If I truly can't have my cake and eat it too, this is what my priority will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this could all just not be the case with this particular workplace and everything could be totally perfect, and that those two sentences were included because they just genuinely feel that way and aren't actually a toxic environment. I want to be prepared in case it's true so bring on the advice assuming it will be. I wanna know what to look out for.

I am continuing to apply to more places, and am hoping that I get something else that doesn't have any major red flags before my next interview on the 8th, but will absolutely be sticking with this one if I get no other offers.",31Dec2019,1
264,"Can’t stop fixating on this... does this happen to you too?

First, a bit of background. I’m a gr12 high school student. Good looking. Not jacked, but in good enough shape to be considered an athlete. I’m average when it comes to popularity. 

Almost every experience I’ve had with girls has gone sour. It starts out with us hanging out a few times and talking all the time on Snapchat, then a few weeks later we’re talking once every few days, then POOF they’ve disappeared off the face of the Earth and out of my life forever.

Ik this is natural being in high school and all, but it seems to be happening way too much. I’m not exactly the most interesting man in the world, but I figure I’m good enough to make at least one girl stick.

Whenever I meet girls now I’m always skeptical bc the effort is worthless. It always ends up being the same result anyway.

272,"This one is a little odd, but hoping somebody has some context to help me. My wife and I have a queen sized bed, that is fairly heavy (headboard, and four drawers underneath that cannot be removed). In addition, the bed has two rows of support beams in the center of the bed running down the middle (think desk legs that run down the center of the bed to provide a back placement to the drawers, and more stability for a heavier mattress).

My wife and I purchased a rug to place under the bed today, and I remember the furniture company being very clear that we should never slide the bed, as it may break the middle support beams. Is there any recommendation on how I can lift the bed up? Do I just need to empty the bed, get three other guys to help me lift, and hold it up while my wife slides the rug under, or is there a different way?

280,"Recently I moved to another state to live with someone I met on a dating app. When we met, he liked to talk and I didn’t mind that because I’m naturally a quiet person. Things moved quickly between us and I thought I found my soulmate. He was much older than I was, a ten year age gap, 18 and 28, but that didn’t bother me. I was able to find a job and for a little while everything seemed perfect. At the time, I was desperate for a change. Prior to finding each other, I had experienced the most traumatic event in my life. I almost went through with a suicide attempt on a night when I had multiple panic attacks and felt that I couldn’t handle anymore. My plan was to throw myself off of a bridge, but I couldn’t go through with it once I got there. However, I stayed too long on the bridge because police came by and told me I was going to have to leave as I was breaking a law by being there. I wasn’t thinking rationally at all that night to say the least, and I refused to let the officer escort me to my car. Another cop came for backup after a few minutes, and they had to use force to arrest me because I refused to leave. I was sent to jail, and my family bailed me out after five days. The jail time was horrible, and none of the people in my tiny cell were given a mattress to sleep on, or clothes to wear because of that particular cell being on suicide watch. After going through that, I have a lot more sympathy for people in that position, especially for petty crimes. That’s a bit off track from the main story, but that’s the situation I had just gotten out of for context. It made me turn a blind eye to some red flags I should’ve been more aware of. Our relationship deteriorated after a few months, although that was one-sided. During the conversations we had, he turned whatever the topic was onto himself or something in his life. Anytime I brought this up, and that it bothered me, he promised he would turn things around, but it never happened. After a while of hearing multiple stories over and over, putting on a smile just to avoid conflict, and balancing that with work drama and financial stress, I buried everything I felt. I tried drowning my thoughts in weed and alcohol, which usually left me feeling sick or paranoid. Before all of this, I was, generally, an optimistic person who had a lot more confidence. By the time I got out of that relationship, however, everything inside me had changed for the worse. Now, every day I wake up depressed and cynical. I’m even more awkward in social situations, and the friends I’ve seen since I’ve been back have picked up on this. It’s probably understandably uncomfortable to be around me in this state, but I don’t know how to reverse the negative effects this brought into my life. I have a therapy appointment scheduled for the beginning of next month, and I’m hoping that will give me some guidance on how to return to who I was.

I have had a crush on this one girl for a while. I didn’t really do anything about it, and honestly I pretended I didn’t have it for over a year. But I finally got the courage to ask her to go to formal with me. I had originally planned to fall back to “just as a friend though” if I was confronted. She never asked me about that and accepted. We had a good time, but she seemed somewhat hesitant occasionally when it came to the multiple slow dances. She said she had a really fun time and still mentions it occasionally. Since then, I have been dropping more and more hints. I always offer things to her first before anyone else and I try to be kind whenever I can. She also compliments my intelligence often. I can’t tell if she likes me. This has been going on for a while and I can’t tell if it’s in vain.

Recently, another girl has been talking to me more. She often compliments me and agrees with me on things. Just tonight, I was at a party with a few friends (I was one of two guys, and I’m the only single guy) and she started talking more and more about how badly she wants a boy friend. She said that she wants a guy to give her flowers and that she wanted/wants(?) a boyfriend before New Years. I know her to be a very intelligent and responsible person. 

Tomorrow I had a New Years Eve party with the second girl. I’m now stuck in a situation. Should I directly ask the first girl what she thinks of me and risk losing a friendship I have built for years? Should I go with the second with and see what comes of it? Should I wait and do nothing and see what happens? I’m not even sure myself what I am looking for but I would like to enter into a relationship before I graduate.

I was too until I was on my psychiatric medications for about a year. At age 19, I had a crisis situation with my mental health that warranted a psychiatric hospitalization for about 72 hours. I was then prescribed fluoxetine and risperidone to stabilize me.

They worked, but they also gave me nasty side effects. Remained in compliance through my 3 years on the meds. Recently my physician's assistant decided it was best to taper me off the medications since it's been a few years since the hospitalization.

Anywho, I heard somewhere that honesty in a relationship mandates that you share personal things eventually. Since this hospitalization was a major event, I feel that I would need to share this with a potential girlfriend one day if I get into a committed relationship.

I tend to panic easily so I just started thinking about what I can do and what I cant do, so I decided I would go put my sleepover stuff in my room. I open the door and to my surprise, there were two naked kids who had just finished having sex in my bed. She never apologized, and blatantly lied about the situation to my Dad as soon as I came in, but luckily he believed me. I have seen texts of her swearing at my Dad, she has yelled at him for not buying a good enough Christmas present (Which for the record was not cheap) and has bullied my old stepmom. There is just no end to the awful things she does and somehow he has not ended the relationship, so I have decided to help speed things up. I'm not talking anything crazy, I would like to think I am a good person and no matter how bad she is I would never want to act the same, but if there are little things I can do just to mess with her I am all in. 

P.S. I am not vengeful because of a breakup of my parents or anything, they have been split my whole life and honestly, things would be worse if they were together, they are both good people and now they are friends, but I'm sure they wouldn't make a good couple",31Dec2019,1
300,"First of all, it was another group of friends who left me. Presently, I talk to them less but not just for this reason.

I was excited to find out that the tickets for a movie me and my friends were waiting for a long time to come out. I asked them if they wanted to watch it in case they already had reservations. Naturally, I though they would say no and we would make plans. Instead, I found out that they already made plans and just didn't tell me anything. I asked one of then why and he told me another it was another friend's job to tell everyone to reassure me, but I stopped him there and called it a day.

What I think is that they simply didn't want me. They invited me last time and, honestly, I wasn't the most pleasant company. But I feel like they completely avoided me so I wouldn't even ask them. Usually they would talk about it once or twice right? I just thought we were getting along, but they only see me as a friend when they need me to do something.

I don't know what to do. I feel like this is the same pattern that got me kicked out of the first friend group. If I get ostracized again I won't have anyone to hang out for the rest of the school year.

Plus, I really wanted to watch the movie with them, but I know that if they didn't ask me they simply didnt think about me. Its not the first time I kept myself from watching a movie because going alone made me feel like a loser. 

What can I do to keep this from happening? Should I just give up and find new friends?",31Dec2019,1
301,"Hey guys,

Right now I’m in grade 12 approaching 2nd semester. My high school experience has officially gone to shit. Grade 9 started off well, and since then it has gone downhill each year. This includes losing friends, not shooting my shots, doing stupid things, and unsolved mysteries lingering in my head.

Some examples: 

I stopped talking to my childhood best friend in grade 10. We’re like strangers now and it feels too weird to confront him now.

Every girl I’ve talked to (romantically or just friends) seems to ghost me after a few months. It’s like I’m interesting enough for a short while and then POOF they’re gone and never heard from again. I can never make relationships stick no matter how hard I try. This has taken a huge toll on me romantically.

I just continuously wonder what could have been if I had acted differently, and also, why things have turned out the way they did regarding certain things. I just feel so down because my life isn’t where I want it to be right now. I’m worried it will get worse. If I feel like this at 18, how will I feel when I’m 30? 

How many hardships can I endure before I lose my shit?

Any advice/replies would rly help. Have you experienced any of these things? Was uni better?

Thanks.",31Dec2019,1

So now every time we get together there has to be a “talk”.  This can be about how we need to stay in touch more or problems one person has been having but lately it’s turned into a targeted affair.

304,"Hi all, I'm a 23M student-teacher, who will graduate at the end of next year (2020). In the past year or so, I have learned so much about myself and more importantly that I don't see myself becoming a teacher, or at least teaching for long. While I think it is an admirable career choice and I have respect for my peers who are clearly very passionate about the field, I do not think I have the same level of passion to work with children. This conclusion has come after multiple prac experiences. I am open to the possibility of relief teaching for a while after I graduate, and I very well could have my mind changed during this time, but my current frame of mind tells me it's not for me. Regardless, I will finish my degree because I think it'd be silly to quit this far in. 

Naturally, approaching my final year, I am really trying to think and plan ahead so that I don't end up in something I hate. I'm looking at alternative careers, but I'm not really sure where to start, nor am I sure how much relevancy a teaching degree would have in applying for other work? Can anyone give me some suggestions or ideas? I enjoy explaining things to others, working with people (just not the kids so much lol) and could possibly see myself in some sort of training role where I am teaching other adults. I also enjoy keeping fit and doing work that strikes a good balance between being both mentally and physically demanding. 

I have thought about trying to be a firie but it's not really something I can rely on due to the highly competitive selection process in my area.

305,"I just started watching America's Next Top Model on Amazon Prime Video because I thought it was a show that would hold me over for a long time. There's 22 seasons and when I first looked a week ago they were all included with Amazon Prime which means I didn't have to pay to watch it. The only reason I started it was because I didn't have to pay extra for it. I watched one whole season and was halfway into the next season then suddenly I went to turn it on tonight couldn't continue watching anything. All of the seasons now, even the two I just watched, cost extra to watch now ($9.99 per season, $1.99 per episode) and are no longer included in Amazon Prime.

Has anyone else experienced this issue with Amazon Prime Video? It feels kind of crappy that they pulled it off of Prime as soon as I started watching it as if they baited me, and I didn't realize they could just switch it on the users to start charging extra for things that were originally included in Prime. If that's the case I'm considering ending my Prime membership and switching to another video streaming application.",31Dec2019,1

308,"I (23M) have been having back pains mostly in my lower spine area for the last year. I just got health insurance and I went to the doctors for the first time today while on vacation with my family. I had some blood work done and an X-ray done. The doctor called me a few hours after I went in and confirmed there’s nothing wrong with the blood work results they have obtained. Doc actually said I had beautiful blood work. They are still waiting on some more blood results (Thyroid and cholesterol) but he said it’s mainly looking good. As for the X-rays, the doctor said I had a stress fracture a while back and it healed incorrectly. He diagnosed me with a spine disease called Spondylolysis. I haven’t really researched much about it but that’s why I am posting on reddit. 

The doctor wants me to come in for a MRI this week just to see if the X-rays missed anything. He said that spine surgery is a possibility depending on the rest of my blood work and MRI results. He also said that with a lot of physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic appointments, massage therapy, hopefully my back will be able to heal. 

I also lost a dramatic amount of weight over the last year as well. I am a pretty small male around  5”5 and the doctor said I weighed 112 lbs.. My family had been telling me I look extremely skinny and I couldn’t agree more. The last year I have been dealing with a lot of personal and mental problems so long story short I just wasn’t eating very much or taking care of myself. I play video games and also work on the computer so sitting for several hours a day really messed up my back.

309,"I live in a rented house with my dog, but after a very controlling, emotional and physically abusive relationship ended, I decided to sub let my room out. 

My tenant is 30m and I'm 29f. We were friends before he moved in. He had to leave his old place because he was in so much rent debt. So i rented the room to him, his dog, and his bf. 

Problem is that he's very controlling and won't take any responsibility for anything. 
His dog pisses all over the house on a daily basis, he says 'oh well he's just marking territory'. Be that as it may, it's still an issue! I can no longer invite people round due to the smell. 

When we go out together he tells me off for every little thing. I said hello to the post man for example, it was met with 'don't say hello to him, it'll just confuse him'. I paid for something at a shop ' you shouldn't hand people crumpled up notes', my dog was sick, ' you should stop feeding her that dog food and change to pedigree like me'. I made a funny meme from the photo he sent me of his dog, 'don't make silly memes of my dog Jenny'. I tell him I can't eat something as it'll make me sick, and he tells me it's in my head. I tell him I hate a certain food, and apparently it's silly to hate this particular food, and I should train myself to like it. I tell him I'm starting a craft project to help with my depression, and he says its a waste of time and that I should do something productive. 

I'm not assertive or confrontational, I don't know what to do or say. He gives me SOOO much unsolicited advice that i can't keep up. I just want to scream that I'm not some stupid little girl. I'm not the one in debt, I'm not the one with an untrained, nightmare of a dog, I'm not the one calling in sick to work every day etc. But for some reason, my life is under attack by this guy and I don't know why!!

How can I say to him that all this needs to stop? How can i phrase it without being too confrontational?

329,"At 30 yrs old, I’ve finally found my father. I’ve never known him and my mother and her side of the family never spoke about him. For the first couple of years of my life I thought my stepfather was my father, until I got older and saw the many many differences I had between me and him. I’ve never really asked about my father because my mother never really said much and  for most times answered angry and annoyed. As I get to know my father and see his sadness and pain (although I can tell not all of it was from the situation that happened between him and my mom), I’ve grown more courage to ask why she had left with me when I was months old. We’ve fought over this recently and pretty much split that she left because of his arrogance and his constant assumptions. This was such a blow to this fake story of what I’ve told myself and given myself a story that my father must have been some horrible man who had done wrong that my mom had to leave; because I had such a blind loyalty to her. But I see the truth is that they fell into love without really understanding themselves first and in the mist of that whirlwind creating me to escape whatever it is they were trying to escape from. They had fought and my mom left with me to another state to follow my grandparents because she didn’t have a place to stay and for some reason didn’t want to stay with her best friends at the time.  (Yeap if you are thinking this is kidnapping you are right)

As I grew older I just told myself that seeing my father  as never meant to be. My mom had told me stories of PI’s whose swindled money from him when they hired him to find me or when his sister saw her and saw me and never bothered to mention it to her own brother. It blew my mind that there’s was family so close but no one to ever recognize me (as I hang out with my dad he would state where everyone of his family lived a lot of them lived as close as a mile or two near me.  It was like this odd shield or cloak of invisibility). As I speak to my dad he’d always talk about going to different places to find me but no one ever told him the right place and the people he took with him had other things in mind like drinking.  

I’ve always felt like an outsider in my family, I don’t look like anyone really. I don’t have the same hair nor the same nose nor the same thoughts as anyone else. I have my mother’s smile and eyes and laugh. I was an outsider and due to my mothers side of the family being insanity responsible I felt that I had to step up to the plate and be the responsible person and even emotionally responsible at an age that was way to young. I don’t know if she even realizes it and what sucks is that traditionally/culturally that’s what the oldest daughters do. The other truth is that I did it because it felt like I had a spot in the family dynamic.I was so tired of it and so tired of not feeling like I had any place anywhere, that college was my escape. My way to be free and my way to say fuck it all fuck everything and everyone because I can make my own choices, that it doesn’t matter that I don’t know my father because I can be alone, I can be my own family. I can be away and everyone can be their own family I won’t be that sore eyesight or mistake that I’ve always felt. For a while that worked, for a while I felt some sort of in place because everyone was lost and so was I, we can all find some way together. 

But life is life and I allow things or event or people to hinder my happiness/path/knowledge of self. I felt that the choices I was making were wrong because I don’t know the other side of me. I’ve heard from a friend that you’re parents inform a lot about who you are or how the different parts of them play into your life. So I tried searching online (didn’t have enough money for a PI) but all I had was a name that I couldn’t really remember. So I failed and failed miserably and honestly gave up. I had mentioned it to my mother here and there but she wasn’t listening because I just tiptoed around it. Honestly I had a fear of finding him since I knew he had a daughter.  I had a fear that I could ruin his family because of how chaotic the family I had was and so I just left it alone. Then a year ago my stepfather passed suddenly. The feelings I repressed has flooded through because the reality of mortality broke my wall and I realized that I’d have to take a chance and say something and so I did and my mom actually found him though one of those internet searches. We were able to start our relationship and I was able to try to do right and undo my suppressed feelings about meeting  and try to build a relationship.

So we did. I was able to meet my younger siblings and am trying to figure out how to have a relationship with them (two are going to college and one just graduated). His wife is really awesome and a wonderful person. First, meeting them all was such a high that i wanted to live off of because it was so wonderful to see them and experience them.

But that high, as all highs do, came to its end. The reality of the decisions of my parents made at my expense became clear and it’s effects on me and them (and everyone else) was also clear. The more they speak and tell me things the more I see that they place blame on situations and people and not really on themselves. My father consistently states that my moms mother was the reason for his and my mothers end. That his mother and sister would never tell them if they saw me because they’d needed his financial support. My mother always blamed her mother for moving and she does regret following her to another state.  My arguments with my mother has gotten more harsh as she’s used to always having me around and her passive aggressive comments have increasing. My father in the other hand has complaints about his wife’s family and unfortunately had been complaining about his kids as well to me which I’ve had to talk to him about. He has even blamed his failures in business and life on them as well, which again does bother me. I’ve also learned that since being in his life they’ve seen a more loving and kinder and more attentive side to him that they’ve missed out on which breaks my heart  and one of my fears came true. I’ve seen a more controlling and manipulative side of him that he has towards his kids and wife which has made me more guarded with him. Seeing him be so disrespectful especially with kids it’s very jarring and uneasy especially since his family he created is amazing in my eyes.

So I’ve come to reddit to ask, with all of this being said and knowing what I know now, how do let go? I know I may never find the truth or the why and what and I don’t think I will ever get a true apology from my parents. Nor do I think they understand the severity of their choice and how it effects everyone especially my siblings on both sides. 

So how do I let go because I need to for me. 

I need to because I’ve told my mother in a heated argument and in anger, once she told me that she left because she couldn’t stand his arrogance, that she should have never had me and I meant it and I still do now. 

I need to let go because in that fit of rage and anger when I said that, I realized where my suicidal thoughts and tendencies came from. I realized that that was the point, the beginning you could say, that triggered the feelings of not being valued. To choose people who may not be a forever, that may not always be around, that have disrespected me. The genesis That has kept me a guarded gatekeeper for my feelings and that was where it started keeping myself away from people so that I never have to truly open up to people so I don’t have to be disappointed. That was the beginning and some of people who had hurt me as I went through life where the imitators or symptoms of that pain I had.  Frankly it’s most likely a reason why I’ve hurt people as well. 

TLDR (idk what it means) how do you let go of pain and anger? Because honestly fuck it, I have this life and I’m not wasting it anymore on some bad cock-sucking feelings. I’ve got siblings I want to be with and get my shit together as well as live my life and enjoy what I have along the way.

Any advice is greatly appreciated  thank you all for letting me vent this out.

To all others please just read and pass it on cause we may either underestimate or don’t take into account of our choices in life and how it effects people. I hope it does good for someone!",31Dec2019,1
330,"For the first time, I was able to talk to a crush of mine without having anxiety! Need advice on how to move forward!

I am looking for advice, so please read the whole thing. Warning: it may be lengthy!


I have had many crushes in my life, as I am sure many of you have as well. I have never actually been able to carry a convo with any of them, and I was always super intimidated to talk to them, and scared about being judged by them.

So I have this crush at work. I am 17 so this job isn’t *the* job I will have forever, so if we do end up dating (unlikely, but what I am striving for) it won’t ruin work for me. 


Anyways, I would like to start by saying that she is sorta new. She started at the beginning of december I believe. I really didn’t think much of her. When she started we never spoke a word to each other. Never. Until literally yesterday. I was hanging out in the back since it was a slow day, and she came in and actually spoke to me, just talking about the weather. I was surprised and stunned since this is unusual for me. I have never had a girl that has come up to me and spark a convo. Well, it wasn’t really a convo, more like a quick chat that I could’ve kept going but she caught me off guard and I didn’t have much to say. 

When she spoke to me, I instantly crushed on her. I don’t know what it was about her, but I just did. I spoke to her a few other times that day, but nothing big. Today however, we spoke *a lot*. And it wasn’t just me starting the convos either, she was too! She came up to me a few times today and started talking and what not. We haven’t talked about anything outside of work yet, but we did talk a lot! I don’t know what it was, but I wasn’t scared at all! In fact, I felt very comfortable talking with her (Might be the fact that she ping ponged back too).

The thing about this is I am very reserved and shy at work. I don’t talk with others that much, but I am somewhat talkative to her. I feel like she is gonna start telling her other coworkers that I talk to her a lot and they’re gonna tell her that I don’t talk to anyone and then she’s gonna put two and two together.

I would be rearranging the stuffed animals on my bed and I’ll go to leave but a voice tells me to go back and cover them with blankets or something or they’ll be cold. So- I do that, but then I realize “They might be too hot.” So I go and fix it over and over again. 

When I hang up my towel, I rush to do it because I tell myself “If I don’t hang my towel up in 10 seconds I’ll die.” So I do that, but I tell myself “If it falls down I have to slap myself.”

332,"Hello reddit.

First time posting, sorry.

I need your advice on how to deal with this sensation of dread.

I have that gut feeling that scream at you to run or be prepared to defend yourself. Like in any moment someone its going to kick my door down and attack me.

I live with my mother and a younger brother.

But younger brother went with father and sister to pass the New Year’s Eve.

I stay to be with my mother so she wouldn’t be alone.

I just confirmed that my brother, sister and dad are ok and my mom its downstairs chatting in her phone.

But I couldn’t not get away from the feeling…",31Dec2019,1
333,"Part 1/2
Hey, even for a good story or to actually help. I’ve got a question for r/Advice. One that my mother and father. And myself have been looking for half a decade.

For starters, I have a brother. A bipolar brother, one that doesn’t work well under stress and goes through a manic state. Where it could be 
• Staying up to three in the morning making a back yard patio. Of which we already have one.
• Coming in my room and turning on the lights to tell me he’s on a mission. What mission is so important? Well a mission to get a bag of chips my little brother wanted to get. Days ago. Saying he’s got to get these chips. To the point that he walks to the nearest store and takes them. Not only that. A shopping cart and some other stuff.
- Drilling holes in the walls for useless decorations. Because in his mind. Someone is going to say something about the empty space. Or we’re talking early 2000s Mickey Mouse jewelry and saying he’s holding it down.
- To getting into fights and jumping my father to one point that if I didn’t stop him, he’d be severely hurt.

I point and billeted these points because I can understand that mentally. He’s not okay, but that also, mentally, he’s not okay. He’s a bully at home and at work, consistently antagonizing someone or trying to do so. And in doing so always having a hard understanding that people don’t want to deal with him. And I supposed my parents housing him, feeding him, buying him a car for another time he’s wrecked that other one (apparently eight of them). My parents really wanted to see there first son succeed. And outgrow them, hit milestones and go beyond what they could’ve done. They spent so much effort in trying to get him to go through college. And this is something my parents wanted in all of us to do. But he’s come with problems with cooperating with others in that. He’s a habitual smoker of weed. And that being in household where the owners/parents have conservative views. Don’t want to see there son constantly playing video games till 5am smoking and coughing. Waking everyone up at the house. Because in the end. He doesn’t sleep, making him more confrontational. My parents don’t look for trouble I mean it. But they want to sleep. They work. They provided. They feed. So they take things away from him. A PlayStation that he didn’t pay for. The car he didn’t pay off. Because he’s truthfully going to spend it on pot. Which in turn makes him thinks he’s going to be bored. Thus he would break into my parents room, stealing the car on my birthday and my phone. Money, pawing their tools for dope. And overall a bad time. And I supposed that should’ve been the end of it, but my mother has so much care to give. She can’t just say no her son. It’s something she mothered. As of me...
- Steal my phone to steal my parents car, so he can get high.
- Taken money from me
- Manipulated me for drug money when I was young
- Beat me when he was high thinking it was a game. There were moments in my life I dreaded coming home because he would get high and beat me and my little brother.
- And my most favorite part. Get so shit faced drunk to grab a knife and place it on my neck. And threatened to do it unless I helped him get those previously mentioned chips.",31Dec2019,1

341,"I'm 15F, and I live with my parents and my two siblings (18F; 10M). 

I recently bought a new phone, with my own money. I saved up babysitting money for a really long time. I was really happy to buy it and, although I thoroughly enjoy it I make sure to spread my time across a number of hobbies, such as painting, drawing, swimming, homework, etc. I'm a pretty well-rounded student and try my best although I haven't been getting the best grades lately, not because I havent been putting in the effort but because the work has gotten drastically harder since last school year and im trying my best to keep up. 

My parents have always been fairly strict when it comes to my phone usage, and would encourage me to leave my phone in the kitchen at night, to avoid hindering my sleep and melatonin production. I agreed, and it wasn't a problem for me because I'm not too reliant on it and don't use it at night.

Anyways, one day I was at the library doing homework when I spilled a whole mug of tea on my computer, that they had bought for me in around 2012. It was an accident, of course, and I deeply regret not being more attentive as to where I placed my tea. My parents, however, believe that I did it on purpose, in order to get a new computer. Honestly, it upsets me to think that my parents have such a negative view of my moral conscience. I would never do such a thing. 

They ended up buying me a new one, but there was a catch. They made me sign a contract saying that I would never use my phone in my room again, and that I am not to use my new laptop on my bed, or any area apart from a table. I accepted only because I needed a new computer for schoolwork and such, but I dont think that these rules are completely fair, in particular the one about my phone. Why should they have control over something that I saved up to buy? 

I have a small business which I use to earn money where I look after cats in my area while their owners are away. This kind of job requires that I keep in contact with the owners, and I send them pictures of their cats daily. By taking away my phone, my parents are not only limiting my freedom but also hindering my business. 

They have never bought any of my phones before. I would understand this sort of restricting behaviour if I was an avid phone user, however my usage of electronics is fairly minimal, I mainly use my phone to listen to music or sometimes talk to friends. It's just annoying because I need it to communicate with the people that are paying me to look after their cats, and small responsibilities of the sort. 

My siblings have different rules to me: my brother has the iPhone 8 at age 10 and he's already addicted to it, which I find sad to be honest. My parents have no idea what he's doing on the internet and make no effort to find out or restrict his usage. My sister is allowed to use her phone all the time, which I can understand given she's an adult, however whenever I contest my parents taking my phone they reply with ""Its under our roof, which means that its our responsibility"". Shouldn't the same rules apply to her? When she was my age, she was also allowed to use her phone whenever she wanted. I've tried talking to them about this but they won't listen. I think that at fifteen I should be able to manage my usage myself. 

So reddit, I need your advice. How can I convince my parents to give me more freedom in this area?",31Dec2019,1

343,"I'm about to reach that point where I have to choose what to do study and basically my future career.

I'm doubting between fashion designing and building engineering.

3 years ago I was sure I'm going to be an engineer, and made my parents to be all hyped about it. Then, few months ago, I started to learn sewing and I fell in love with it. My grandma was very excited and she would love to see me going to the fashion industry.

On the one hand I'm not a mathematical person, not to the point where being an engineer is impossible, but it would not be easy.

But on the other hand, engineers earn a lot, and at the end of the day we all need money. Plus it'll be easy for me to find a job. While in the fashion industry I'm not sure (and it's also very hard to succeed in this industry).

345,"Hello everyone, I’m posting this under a throw away account. This will be a long post 

😞 Please no judgement I’m already hating myself enough and I’m really going through it. 

let me start by saying that I’m a 19 year old girl, my boyfriend is 21 and we’ve been dating since I was 15 and he was 17.  We were each others first. He is a good boyfriend, we’ve fought but not seriously to the point of breaking up. Neither of us have had issues with cheating. He is not affectionate at all. Likes to cuddle but we barely have sex and he never wants to kiss me, he will straight up refuse both of those things. Gets irritated when I ask for them or even a hug. 

Right before we moved in together, I got a new job and a few months later we moved in, it was a very big mistake. I love him and care for him but I’m not in love anymore and he has said he isn’t in love either. We get along well as friends but I’m more interesting in being a friend with benefit with him rather than 100% committing or even a open relationship (due to the fact he does NOT ever want to have sex) . I’ll admit that I love attention from other men and I love to flirt, it’s fun and exciting to me. I’ve expressed the fact that I want to have sex more or be more affectionate and nothing’s changed. he agrees with me but we can’t let go of each other.

I planned on breaking things off when our lease is over in 2 months. But something very traumatic happened to me. My mom (and only parent) passed away unexpectedly. I’m an only child and this has been very traumatic for me. I’ve been very depressed and was only able to take 2 weeks off of work after ward. He was there for me at first, but after awhile I was still very depressed and he wasn’t able to comfort me. We can’t see eye to eye on empathy or sympathy. I ask him to think about how I feel and he says he can’t because he could never imagine how I feel and doesn’t want to think about his mother dying. (Fair enough, but I’m all alone and it would help me to have some comfort and not looked at as lazy for staying in bed all day crying). I expressed to him multiple times that a dog (that he promised me I could get and has went back on his word so many times) would help me emotionally as my childhood dog has passed away in 2019 as well. Leaving me all alone, the two closest to me are gone now. 

Now, once my lease is over I’m moving in with my grand parents as their care taker since my mom is now gone and my uncle is a alcoholic. 

Now that my mom is gone, I’ve found I’m trying to fill my life with all types of different meaningless hobbies and the amount of attention and flirting I do has increased significantly.  I even tried psychedelic drugs (I had a bad trip and a horrible break down)

One of the men at my job, who I find extremely attracting and was trying to flirt with him even before my moms passing is trying to be friends with benefits. I would do it in minute!! He is so fine. However I don’t want to leave my boyfriend, he is more of a emotional safety blanket for me and I feel like if I lose him I’ll be completely 100% alone.  His family is also amazing. His sister is like my sister and his parents are the sweetest, I don’t want to lose them they feel like my family.

I can’t tell if I really want to do this or am I going through a break down from my moms passing ? I don’t want to hurt my boyfriend at all but I can’t keep going on like this and I feel so stuck in every aspect of my life and my responsibilities are suffocating me. This would be a escape. 

Please give me your advice and once again please don’t be rude in your comments, I don’t know what to do at this point and I have no body to talk with this about.",31Dec2019,1
346,"Basically every time I meet somebody new, even though I’m well aware that I do it and that I shouldn’t, I always find myself acting how I think they would want.

This is with friendships and romantic interests btw. I don’t lie about things or pretend to be interested in things that I’m not, but I do leave out details about me that I think they won’t like and hold myself back a lot with things I want to say.

At age of 13 my parents were fighting all time (my father cheats on my mom ) and things so messed up that we discovered that he married another women in secret, first my mom left me with my older sister and she go living with her mom(my grandma) and my 2 aunt 
Me and my sister stayed for a while with him and his mother until he decided to bring the other women (that he cheated on my mom with) to the house , that day me and my sister left the house with some clothes on a bag to my grandma house, the house used to be silent and my aunt's liked it this way and I were disturbing them with smallest actions (not to blame them ofc) so I started avoiding house as much as I can I go there late at night just to sleep and get out to school when I wake up , and stay out.
I started to change and learning new stuff in that bad neighbourhood I get really fat cause eating from depression and I felt no one accept me and there is no one I could talk too (my only wish was to talk to someone).
I met new friend who I trusted then he stabs me in the back for some stupid reason and found myself alone again
( I promised myself that I would never be like my father, I will never do it to anyone even if he did it to me )
Then my parent back together after 4 years at that time I made a better friends I started working out and reading books and watching a lot of tv shows and lost a lot of weight and finished high school, and I started to notice that here everything is wrong people mentality are ruining everything and bad region ideas.... I can complain for hours about that , in fact it gets to the point it can't be fixed the only thing is getting out of this country. 
I had some small hopes but it faded away over time I failed 3 years at university while I study something I really hate with people who I see them as stupid they don't have hobbies never read a book or played a video game I can't imagine how they live, some of them became my friends and I just did that to avoid being alone but this makes me feel more lonely and over time I'm more depressed and getting suicidal from time to time

Anyway, onto my predicament:

Back in August, my then girlfriend broke up with me. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever went through and still going through. Prior to her leaving me, I was very depressed and only really spoke to her and one other person. Knowing she left me due to my depression, I was ready to change everything about my current life. I contacted one of my friends, we’ll call him John.

At first everything was great. He basically invited me into his friend group of people that I “knew” but didn’t “know” if that makes sense. It was great at the start but it took a turn for the worst awhile ago. 

I’ll keep it short but basically, they always talk down about me. They constantly say I’m not attractive and its really wearing on me. I mean, I don’t think I’m a bad looking dude… 
They keep saying I’m the least liked in the friend group and everything like that. 

I really like hanging out with people though. It’s going to sound dumb but before this I never really had a friend group. Deep down I know I want out, but I just don’t want to be alone. I’ve been going out every single night. I’ve had fun. But, I know these people are not treating me right.

What should I do? I’ve already tried talking to them but they just blow me off. I think I’ll just try and distance myself for awhile.

356,"Hey everyone, I could really use some outside advice about this tough situation. This is the first New Years I’d be spending with or with out my bf of 1 year. In late November he had said he would be away in PA with his family like they always are on New Years. However my friend is throwing a party with all my friends who I haven’t seen in awhile and it was going to be super fun. I thought since my bf was away I’d go to my friends party, which was my plan. My bf then told me his family was actually coming home New Years to throw a party which he invited me to. I had assumed since he was coming home he would probably come to my friends party with me, but then he informed me that he isn’t allowed to leave his parents party they’re throwing because his parents will he upset. His mom always likes for things to go to plan when she wants to throw a party. I told him I planned on going to my friends party still because not to sound terrible but in all honesty his family party would be boring there would be nothing to do and his parents annoy me at times, and I see him and his fam all the time. I told him I planned to go to my friends and he was alright with the idea, he had invited a few of his friends to his house as well so he wouldn’t be alone while his parents and older sisters friends were there, but then he tells me his friends all aren’t going to his fam New Years party because they already have plans to go to other parties. And on top of that I’m not going. Now he’s upset and hurt because no one is really coming for him and he can’t leave his house because his parents want him to stay for their apparently required family party. What parent won’t let their teenage son go out on New Years? I want to go to my friends party and get drunk with my friends on New Years, but I also wanted to see my baby. I know saying I want to go get drunk sounds bad but can you really kill me for it? It’s New Year’s Eve that was kinda the intended plan. He’s mad at me for choosing not to come to his fam party. I feel guilty at the thought of him alone at his fam party while I chose not to come, but I know if I go to his party out of guilt because now no one else is going I will not enjoy myself and will be salty lol watching all my friends have fun. Either way I can’t please everyone. My bf was okay with the fact that I wasn’t coming at first, but now that his friends bailed it made it worse and he thinks I’m choosing drinking with friends over him, which in a way it seems like I am. Which only makes me feel worse because I care about him so much and never want him to feel like he comes second to me. Therefore I should just go to his house right? But then he will feel like he forced me to be there. Ugh. But I’ve made sacrifices and gone to other fam parties and hangouts he and his parents have had, this is just one party. I don’t know if anyone will see this or help in time because it’s currently 2 am so technically it’s New Year’s Eve already lol...but I’m last minute contemplating.

We have our plans as well !

365,"Might be the wrong place to post something like this, but I guess I need advice on what I should do, if anything. 

For the past several years, a man has been walking around my street carrying a very large stick around 3-4AM. I remember seeing him do this for a very long time, but he didn't seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary so I kinda just ignored it. That is, until recently, he's been doing some very strange things. A few times I noticed he will walk into my neighbors yard. I can't see what he's doing (it's too dark) but I know that he doesn't live there because an elderly couple does. I saw him 10 minutes ago doing just that. He circled around my street, went into my neighbors yard (stayed there for maybe 2 minutes before I saw him exit). He then walked up to a car parked in the street and shined a flashlight on it. He did that for maybe 30 seconds before walking back up the street and I haven't seen him again, but from what I've noticed (at least before I go to sleep) he makes multiple rounds. 

Like I said, he's been doing this for years. Well, he's been walking around with a stick for years. It was recently that I actually started to see him walk in my neighbors yard (he does it to the same house every time). I honestly don't know what to make of it. I told my parents awhile ago about him but they're never awake to actually have seen him, so they just kinda shrug it off. My sister and a few other people that live on my street have also seen him. I don't know if there's something wrong with this guy and he's been doing this for as long as I can remember, but it creeps me out, especially since I've seen him go into peoples yards at 4AM with a large stick and flashlight.",31Dec2019,1

Anyway, so there is a girl in my workplace i really like since I started working 7 months ago, we didnt talk too much at first but eventually we started becoming more and more close.

3 months ago I gather enough corauge to start flirting with her, a week later I kissed her and shit went crazy.

Everything was going well, we went dinner together, we went to cinema, we went bowling, we went shopping, I make her laugh a Lot , and she makes me laught too. We dated almost every fucking day and sex was... REALLY great. But see, we had these little conflicts all the time where she got mad at something I do unconsciously, and I got mad at her too many times because she is younger than me (I'm 25 and she is 20) and I consider some of her reactions and thoughts very childish.

One of this conflicts went a little more harsh, and she said we couldn't be a couple, we don't know how to be together, but she also said she doesn't wanted to lose me because I am a really Nice guy and I make her laught a Lot. She also discarded the option where we become friends with beneficts, she said it won't work either. She only have sex with guys she thinks that could become her boyfriend.

 I went so mad and so sad at the same time, I did not talk to her or even look at her in the eyes over a week, until we started talking again yesterday and holy cow, when we chat is all about sex and shit and now we are here in the office and I can't quit looking at her. I really like her but I don't know what to do anymore. Everything happened so fast, and I don't know if there is a way to convince her to give our thing a second try, she was very clear when she said we couldn't be a couple...

He lives an hour away from me. After talking for about 3 weeks we ended up hooking up. It was random and weird but he was super sweet and made me feel like I mattered and I hadn’t had that in a long time. Well after we did that he pretty much quit talking to me.

My dads friends son brought along one of his friends to our party, so we have never met this friend before. He says he thinks I’m really cute  and wants to hang out sometime and asks for my number. I say that I have a boyfriend so I’m not interested. He said “can we be friends though?” I said sure. He asked for my number, I gave it to him and he said”are you sure this is your number”, called my phone and then texted me right away. He was nice, encouraging and supportive of my studies etc, made small talk. That night he texted me. Normal conversation. Next day he texted me . I was busy so I didn’t reply for 7 hours.  He texted “what’s wrong , are you too shy to talk to me lmao” . Honestly getting really desperate and awkward vibes from him , like he doesn’t have many friends or something. I said “sorry I was out and about with my boyfriend all day and just got home”. We have more of a conversation , the way he phrases things is kind of awkward, the conversation just doesn’t feel natural to me. He says he’s a bad texter and he asks if we could chat on the phone to get to know each other better. I said I rarely talk on the phone and when I do it’s usually catching up with my best friends that I haven’t seen in a while. He said “I promise I won’t be a boring conversation, I just communicate better by phone than through text” and he hopes that we have a “long lasting friendship” and he wants us to get to know each other. I say fine , we can schedule a phone call but only when I’m free. Then he said , hope you sleep well and asked if I had Facebook.

I’m down to make new friends, I don’t have many guy friends and no close guy friends so I wouldn’t mind being his friend but something is just so offputting I can’t place my finger on it.

I try to calm myself down when I’m just overrun by anxiety, and it helps to read the old conversations I’ve had with her but when I start overthinking I get to a point where I tell myself “she doesn’t want to date me anymore” and at that point there’s no going back so I just have to wait for the thought to pass or just go to sleep and hope it’s ok when I wake up.

385,"Recently, my grandmother (80s) confided in me (early 20s) that she had decided to cut my parents (50s) out of her will over a relatively minor (in my opinion) incident. I know that my parents also considered the incident to be quite minor and also in the past, so they will likely be shocked when they find out. My grandma has changed it so that myself and my sibling (also 20s) will each get half of her assets. She hasn't told anyone except me, and she made me swear not to let anyone else know (especially my parents and sibling), as she doesn't want them to find out until she's passed away. 

Now, my parents are quite well off, and don't really need the inheritance at all. What concerns me is how my parents will feel after my grandma passes away; especially my father (grandma's only son). I'm sure that abruptly finding out that they had been cut from her will will be a huge stab in the heart to both of them. I even can't imagine how devastating that would be to my father. They have a rocky relationship with my grandma, but I always thought the three of them got along decently well. 

On one hand, I want to respect my grandmas wishes by not saying anything to my parents. I'm worried that if I did say anything, it would start a ton of family drama, and I don't want what could be some of my grandmother's last years to be spent fighting amongst ourselves (as a side note, I no longer live with my parents, but my sibling and grandmother still do, so they have to see each other a lot). On the other hand, when my grandma passes I know it won't be easy on my father, and I want to spare him the pain of learning from a letter that he was cut out from the will. I also would hate for my parents to learn that I knew about them being cut out and kept quiet about it, as that might lead them to believe that I was acting out of greed.  

Obviously, in an ideal world, I'd like for my parents and grandmother to make up, and have them written back into the will. It honestly seems unlikely to happen at this point. 

The way I see it, my options currently are: 

1) Tell my parents that they have been cut out (breaking my promise to my grandma) and letting the three of them figure it out, potentially leading to lots of tears and family drama. Knowing my dad, he'll be pretty angry and hurt, and would likely immediately confront my grandma. 

2) Try to convince my grandma to write my parents back in (without mentioning it to them). When she first told me, I tried my best to convince her to change her mind, but she refused to listen. I could always try again though, and voice my concerns more coherently. 

3) Keep my grandmas secret. If I go with this option, I fully intend to evenly split the inheritance I receive with my parents (I don't actually know if I can legally do that or if she could put a clause in her will preventing that, so I'll probably make a post in r/legaladvice later). My parents would find out that I knew about them being cut out, and I'm concerned that if I go with this option they'll feel like I betrayed them. 

So, I guess what I wanted to ask you lovely people is: 

1) Which option (if any) should I go with? 

2) If I do end up with half of her assets, do you think it would be disrespectful of me to go against her wishes and share my inheritance with my parents? 

I love my parents and my grandma both very much, and I really just want to find the best possible solution for all of them. 

Thanks for reading, and please let me know if there's anything I can clarify. I was intentionally vague on details to avoid being identified.

We used to hang out all the time but now it’s very rare that we do. She always says she’s busy and at first I understood since life gets to you all the time but after about 6months or so it gets a bit harder to believe her that she can’t hang out for a little bit at least once. And she won’t say anything about hanging out until I mention something about it and most of the time won’t come through with it. There’s also been several times where she won’t reply to me so I ask my other friends if they’ve talked to her and they’ll message her and she’ll reply immediately to them and then reply to me. Or it’ll pass through the entire day and won’t really say anything until I say something about it. I’ve tried downright almost everything to let her know that I value our friendship a lot and that she means a lot to me. But when I ask her for a small favor she’ll always push it off until I stop asking and we just both forget about it. But when I’m busy and I don’t respond that seems like when she’ll be the most interested in me. I really do try and give her space but it seems like when I do give her that space she just takes it and leaves me behind and forgets about me. I really enjoy the times when I do get to spend some time and the small talks we get and she’ll say she loves talking to me as well and other nice things as well but actions really do speak louder than words.

However, i’m really bad at holding grudges and in a few hours i’ll forgive her only to have something happen again.

I was kind of a big fuck up when I was younger. I got myself into numerous legal predicaments the worst of which was a felony at the age of 23. This got dismissed because I completed the required sentence of probation/community service, however it still hasn't me because it's on my record.. I can't even drive for Uber because of this.

Tried telling her to go back but she refuses to. Uni life is over-bearing with projects and uncooperative teammates. My gf and my mum doesnt seem to get along so im always caught right smack in the fucking middle. Both stubborn and refuse to give way. Mum is biased towards my sister but she refuses to admit it when i bring it up to her. Honestly pretty tired of everything now and recently i've been having thoughts to cut off from everyone and start afresh elsewhere. Even played out scenarios of how to do it in my head. Each time i do it, i get emotional and teary but it feels right. Am i overthinking this situation? Should i really cut ties or should i get some other form of help?",31Dec2019,1
400,"I've recently found that I feel little to no satisfaction from anything I accomplish. I try to do new things like once a week but I always feel like if I can do said thing, anyone can so why should I be content with what I've done? Or if it's not something that can be easily done, I don't put in nearly enough effort to warrant me being able to be in such a position. 

For example I think I've always done well in academics, but I feel like I don't deserve it since I never studied for anything while others do, causing me to feel guilt that I can be in such a position with what feels like no effort while I can see others struggle and end up worse off. This same line of thinking also applies to various hobbies and activities, making it harder to enjoy doing them for me.

I was curious if anyone else has felt this way, and if so what you've done to get these thoughts out of your head. Sorry if this comes off as first world problem-y, but this has been on my mind for a while and I figured I would ask.",31Dec2019,1
402,"i moved into an old place at the end of July. my upstairs neighbors seemed okay but admittedly they were loud. We talked and they said ""just.bang on the celiling if we are too loud."" I said ""could i get a text # to justcommunicate at times?"" They said ""No"".

I tried not to care anything about their tv muisc or anything else. but the tv in the bedroom over mine kept me up at night. So I would start banging (like they said to.) This didn't work at first, then finally started getting them to turn down the bedroom tv.  This also turned them towards mutual resentment.

Tonight I banged, and they got pissed and came down and we had it out at my front door.  She talked about me smoking pot in my apt (smoming is prohibited in my rental sgreement) but I am in a pot legal state. My ypstairs neighbors have also smoked pot in their apt, with me.

In the midst or this I was told their tv is at volume 1 and mute is the only other option.  She told me I moved i to an old apt and to deal or leave.  

I have never had a tenant complaint against me in 22 years of living out of my parents.  I want to reconcile with them.  I agree they should be able to habe their rv on at night in their bedroom. I hear itclear as day though. I almost so not believe their vilume iseasier dor me to hear diwn here than it is for them in the room.

404,"If you were alone for the holidays, how would you feel if a friend reached out / wanted to go do something with you? I'm unsure if my friend brings up being alone for the new year as a sign of wanting to go do something or if it's stating as a matter of fact.

Yesterday, a friend of mine said his family (scatter across the states) and his SO (for work) are out of town and won't see them until Friday. I'm a ""planner"" according to my own friends, who are more reserved than I, and the onus feels like its on me to suggest something, indirectly. I kinda tire of being the initiator, as we're both reserved, I get told a lot that he appreciates me attempting to get him out of his shell ""thanks for the invite but... (I'm busy/got plans/not feeling up to it/maybe next time).""' After he told me, he said he was going to get some fried chicken + cookies (which seems like comfort food, the dude is a former gymnast)

He usually doesn't mention things he'll be up to do barring trips to exotic lands like Bali/Vanuatu/etc. and I always kinda feel like he is just putting up with me to some extent since we're quiet but he puts his headphones away and walks on over to me when at a 24hr to chitchat and whatnot, rather than leave them in (like he used to do initially, so he has warmed up to me). I dunno if I should suggest doing something, only if he'd like to, since I myself have no plans (and my immediate family flies in on the 1st) and plan to treat it like any other day. I've been invited to some small parties with cousins and I've done a few but barring the host, I wouldn't know anyone else and I generally feel uncomfortable with a large number of strangers.

tl;dr: my friend has both his fiancé + family out of town for New Years. Wondering if are hinting they want to do something with me, but I kinda 'tire' of always being the one on to suggest to do shit together (innocuous shit like play pool, grab a bite). Only reason I ask despite the declines is a LPT (I can't link it) to ""keep inviting that friend who always says no"". Is it too much to follow up a day later?",31Dec2019,1

 Her bf is in prison whilst she’s in community service for the same crime idk what it is and he does call Her often in the shop but she also checks out other dudes sometimes and fancied another guy in the shop (who called her all sorts to me because of her hygiene) but has poor hygiene BO and looks like a hard drug user. ’m A guy.

406,"I've been promoted to sales manager at our local branch and tonight I came into work and everyone knew. I got some congrats and it was all very sweet. Being on the 8-3am shift, I always work with the same people on the same shift- no one else wants it. This girl that I work with is a newbie who's been there for about four months. She's really nice and doesn't seem to play mind games or anything.. Anyways, she told me congratulations in the lunch room and then began to cry, not sob but her face got funny for a minute and she apologized. I didn't say anything because I was kind of surprised and then she said ""I don't have enough time."" And congratulated me again and began her shift.

What does that mean?? I don't know where to begin on what to make of it. I was too afraid to ask her when I left but does that mean she's dying or something? Or that she's leaving work? What doesn't she have time for?

408,"I’m concerned for my 1 year old niece and 4 year old nephew and want to call CPS on my sister  but they all live with me. 

Over the last several years my sister has been living with me off and on and has not held a job for over 3years. She has a drinking problem and while living with me she stole money from me and other stuff that I suspect she may have sold. She suffered from postpartum depression after having my nephew and since we don’t have a large family I’ve done everything I can to help. If it was just her I would have cut her off long ago. 

She met a man about a year ago while still living with me and got pregnant with a baby she lost the baby and got pregnant again (her now 1 year old daughter) by the same man. She moved out of town to be with him, he left her and she ended up in a shelter. She wanted to move back in with me and I told her no, she was too toxic and I didn’t trust her in my home. 

However I told her my nephew was welcome and that I would be willing to take temporary guardianship of him while she figure things out (she was still pregnant with her daughter at the time). She refused and to this day she blames me for allowing her and her son to be in the shelter. 

Fast forward several months, I’ve allowed her back in my home because she said she had uterine cancer. She said she was required to get 9 weeks of radiation and I wanted to give her an opportunity to get the treatment she needed. With the news she shared she really seemed to have turned over a new leaf and trying to do better. Now I’m off half a mind thinking she has lied about the cancer. Since living with me, she won’t let me go to the doctors with her or and refuses to fill out FMLA paperwork that would safeguard my job should I need to leave due to emergency related to her diagnosis.

Also, she is still drinking, stealing (liquor and clothing from stores now), and she is now neglecting and abusing her children. I have recently been home on break from work for the holidays and I witnessed that she doesn’t feed her 4 year old until the afternoon because she’s hungover. I am convinced it’s been going on for a while because he just acted like not eating anything until the 1pm was normal. I just also witnessed her hitting the 4 year old in mouth, head, etc. when she gets really drunk and then in the next moment she’s hugging in him and playing. I’m guessing because she feels bad for hitting him? 

He’s been hitting himself in the head and self harming and I couldn’t figure out why until I observed this behavior. I believe this is the reason he’s doing it. She also yells and screams at both her children all the time because they want to play like normal children and she doesn’t want to del with them. I have suggested placing them in daycare/preschool and she refuses to look into programs.  With my own bills I can’t afford to place both her children in daycare and I’ve told her this. 

I try to talk to her about getting professional mental  help she’s convinced she already knows what’s wrong and doesn’t believe that a psychiatrist would help. To top it all off, I just found out she’s pregnant after having found about her “uterine cancer” . I’m so angry that she would even think to have unprotected sex knowing she could get pregnant while I’m trying to help her and her children. 

IF she has cancer I can’t help someone who is actively not trying to help themselves.  At this point, I just want my niece and nephew to be okay. I want to get someone involved but we don’t have family that would be able to help. My nephew’s Father might be able to help but my niece has a different Father and he hasn’t really been in the picture and refused to sign the birth certificate. 

I’m now wanting to call CPS but I’m not sure how this will play out with them in my house. Does anyone have any suggestions?",31Dec2019,1

410,"Hello, I need some advice on what to do when I'm getting ghosted on.

Story: I and my (ex)girlfriend broke up last month and she claims that she would never forget me. She also says that her and I should only be friends. That's what happened, of course. We talked and shared memes until she decided to disappear off of our main platform of communication. I see her online, posting images, texting, and some other stuff I do not know about. We are not on a friendly term, only neutral terms with each other, so I understand that she's taking her time, but she always seems to ignore me. Such as, if I come online, she goes offline instantly. And it hurts me, that a now-friend of mine is trying to get away from me for a unknown reason that I clearly have no idea about, if that's the case.

So, what do I do when I get ghosted on? I never been ghosted before by a relationship I've been in yet, so this is a first for me.",31Dec2019,1

412,"I (20M) have a friend who always wants to be right. We sometimes have discussions about the stupidest things ever. And when an argument emerges, he wants to be correct, regardless if he actually is (or at least he _thinks_ he is correct). When we're in an argument, it has always one of four outcomes:    
1 I realize he is actually correct after looking it up.    
2 I realize he is not correct after looking it up, but because it isn't a peer-reviewed scientific research paper, he doesn't accept the proof and puts it down for not being reliable.    
3 I sarcastically agree with him because I can't look things up now and I just want the argument to get over with (we're going nowhere at that point)    
4 We're (or at least he is) going home salty because the argument was on the way home and we were forced to split.    

I have talked to my brother about this and he's been to therapy, so he could help me a lot. This is how I'm able to make compromises. I've tried to mitigate potential arguments and it's working (playing things off as a joke and stuff). But sometimes it can't be played off as a joke because I just want to live like that.

For instance, he tells me that:    
- I can't name my DnD attack a beam because the attack is a thick ray, thus have to call it a ""Pillar""    
- The word ignorant is *always* meant in a negative way.    
An onion ""spits"" in your face, it's not the gasses that make you cry (the only argument I convinced him of was false, an onion does in fact have gasses and it required another person)    
- I can't have massive steel doors as prison doors in my DnD campaign because that's illogical (we have magic, gods and people changing shape, and that's the illogical thing?)    
- In a user manual I can't explain something visual because nobody is reading a manual in that way. It has to be written functionally (we stopped writing the manual because of this)    
Sometimes I think to myself ""Fuck off, why do you want me to live like one of your servants, let me be myself"", which is a bit harsh but it's the way I feel sometimes.

I do realize I paint him in a really bad way, besides this he's a really great guy and a good friend. These arguments just keep me up at night because they're mostly just stupid and I'm the one who always has to compromise and shut down the argument.

I have noticed that with other friends from school it's us vs the problem. One of us says eventually ""Welp, talking isn't going to help, let's look it up"", and we look it up. If we can't find it, we simply drop the thing we argued about and move on.
I want to do the same, but he keeps on going and on and convincing me that I'm wrong and he is right. It feels like a me vs him (and I have already told him that, but he doesn't seem to have it tried yet. He told me to listen better which I'm trying to do, but it's hard when all you hear is ""I'm right and you're wrong""). I'm very happy that we're doing 2 completely different bachelor programs (I do computer science and he does biological engineering) because I don't want to argue about my study with him.

Sorry for the long post, you're awesome if you read all of it.

TLDR; I have a friend who always wants to be right if he thinks he is right, whether he factually is or not and I'm the one who has to make compromises to stop arguing.

Does anyone have advice to handle these situations properly or am I overreacting?    
Any advice is greatly appreciated.",31Dec2019,1
413,"I am 20 yrs old (f). My entire life I have felt that I have consistently experienced at least 6 different personalities that I have written off as intense mood/attitude swings that cause me to act as different people. That sounds really confusing, and sorta like i’m trying to sound like I have multiple personality disorder, but I know my situation is entirely different because my experience does not match any description of MPD. I have confirmed this tonight because it is almost 1 am and my situation has prompted me to research and access if the internet has any insight as to what my problem is, if any. My attempt at describing how I feel in a google search engine has pretty much suggested BPD. Of course I understand google is a dangerous way to try and diagnose yourself, which is why I wasn’t fully interested in what it had to say, but then I remembered: My mother, for maybe a year or two, has non stop been trying to showcase her knowledge of BPD and practically diagnose the disorder on anyone who phrases something weird. Her “knowledge” (realistically a bunch of random facts that have been mixed up and sporadically spit back out) was gathered from a book she had been reading. Her findings from this book (I don’t know the title) have been mainly directed toward my aunts husband as she believes he has BPD. However, during my google search for answers, I remembered some of the only times my mother has bought books to read that were educational in a psychological or therapeutic sphere, were because of me. So, does my mother too suspect BPD? Have I just now realized what everyone already presumed to be true? If I go to speak to a professional will they think that BPD is not the conclusion because it is I that has brought it up and suggested to be the diagnosis? Pretty much tonight has brought me full circle to why my mother bought the book and it’s making me feel very upset in a lot of different ways. I guess it could all be a coincidence, but if I still feel upset and confused, how am I supposed to bring this up to someone who is actually capable of diagnosis without them thinking I am a hypochondriac and therefore it could not possibly be the answer? Apologies if none of that made sense.",31Dec2019,1

She's the only one i can go to in hard times, or so it feels. Last year, she moved a few towns over, we've kept in contact and visited and such, but the visits have always been in a group. That is, up until this past one. I invited her over, picked her up, and we decided to play some xbox for a bit, then watch Netflix. A few minutes in, she's sitting on my bed, I'm laying behind her, it's not intimate. Then she lays back onto me. After a while, i put an arm around her, then the other. Before long, we're cuddling, clothes on, nothing sexual, but it goes on for around two hours straight. When she's about to go, she propped herself up, looking down at me, and we stared into each other's eyes for a while. I leaned in, and we kissed for maybe 15 seconds. Afterward, she says ""sunshine, i don't want you to get attached like that"" and sets her head on my chest. We stay silent like that for a while, and then i take her home.

423,"So I have this guy I went out on a second date with he was cool and had dope vibes I ended up letting something happened on that second date sexually like eating my vagina and I felt bad about that because we aren’t together and it’s a hoe status to me when u let a guy you not committed to eat you out.. he said he’ll never judge me based off that because he doesn’t look at me like an sex object because he knows I’m more then that.

  Long story short he text me about how good my vagina taste I guess it was a turn off because I felt bad to begin with.. so I didn’t text him back when he was expressing his feelings to me which was a bit rude on my end I admit bout I was grieving over my mom n feeling like a hoe all at the same time so it slipped my mind


  He text me today and said what happened I didn’t hear back from you all that I didn’t tell him I was uncomfortable about him telling me about my vagina because Its something I feel bad about. it isn’t him at all it’s me who judging myself for that so instead of telling him straight I told him I’m not ready to be in a relationship with him 100% until I’m ready which is true and I want to take things slowly he was kinda moving to fast and growing feelings 

But long story short he treated me with care and did some things I don’t think guys nowadays would do for a woman and especially a guy who will wait for a girl because she want to remain a virgin until marriage. He said he don’t want sex but he enjoys eating pussy so I’m in good hands he always drive two hours to see me 

But today it turned out that we ended things I feel bipolar I told him I want to take things slowly and now that he unfriends me on everything I feel bad because he went out his way for me and I doubt another guy would respect me to a point like this 


He unfriended me on social media and I want to text his phone but I don’t want to seem crazy after saying I’m not ready to be in a relationship 100% and want to take it slow then text him of why he left 


I understand he’s a good guy for me but I don’t rush relationships I want to take it slowly a step at a time. 

Did I make the wrong decision now I realize I messed up with a potential good man and I’m in my late 20s and never had a serious relationship so at this point I need to find that relationship and actually settle down but Im used to be being free and doing whatever I want and I know notice I get with him I’ll have to change my ways of being free which I don’t do much but text other ppl who ain’t shit to me or flirt of boredom I need to change and grow. 


Should I text his phone and try to get back on the same page or just leave it well enough alone? But I’ll have to start over looking for a man who would treat me like him and not judge me. I guess I’m still trying to keep my options open before I settle but why when it’s a guy infront of me treating me right and I’m looking over him.

Where I’m a going wrong? It’s 3am I’m not sure if he blocked me from his phone as well but i didn’t try yet I’m waiting for an appropriate time tomorrow to try and contact him. 


Ps: he mention in the text after we argued a little “I don’t need a woman to be happy I’m happy on my own if it was up to me I’ll just choose friends with benefits but I’m trying to give u the benefit of doubt because I don’t look at u like a piece of ass” I felt some way about that 

So again what should I do? Should I completely just let it go or try to work things out and be sure this is what I want? I’m confused and kinda hurt because I now realize that it doesn’t get any easier meeting a man accepting me as an 27 yrs old virgin and telling him I’m waiting for the right man and looking forward to a marriage before sex honestly I never got this treatment from no guy who’s willing to just accept me for a virgin and keeping to myself without forcing me.",31Dec2019,1

I'm in my late thirties and moved from Vancouver to Calgary about 6 months ago.  When I was living in Vancouver the real estate market became unaffordable. So I looked at all the options and bought a place in Calgary.  Smaller city in western Canada and very livable. Summer here was great and work kept me busy but 6 months later and the novelty of a new city is wearing off.  Anyone out there who has moved from larger more lively city to a quieter city in your 30s solo... how did you rebuild your social network?
Hopefully someone has gone through this and has some good insight. 
Thanks

426,"I'm F15 and basically, when I feel too full, I make myself throw up. I can't stand feeling full. I've done this for just over two years but I really want to try and recover. I feel like this would be easier if my parents knew, as they wouldn't push me to eat large amounts of food. 

I'm sure that they'd be supportive of me but what if they don't understand? what if their solutions are wrong and they accidentally make things worse?

I'd love advice on how and what to tell my parents, and even recovery advice if anyone has it :)",31Dec2019,1
427,"I’m not just throwing those terms around. I really mean that she’s a fascist. 

My mother is really hard to be around due to her extreme beliefs. It all started one day when she started dropping subtle hints about how much she admired Nazi Germany’s “organization and discipline” and it soon started to evolve into her blaming all the world’s problems on a secret Jewish conspiracy, which, somehow, nobody seems to know about except for a 60 year woman in middle America who has never had a job. 

I’ve been with my Jewish girlfriend for four years, I was a history major and a German language minor in college, and I have visited concentration camps and spoken with Holocaust survivors for my research. You could say that I am a bit of an authority on the subject. Despite this, my mother insists that Hitler was actually a hero who tried to stop the secret Jewish world takeover. 

She refuses to be in the same room as my girlfriend, and has referred to her as a “disgusting, vulgar, drug addled slimeball” to other family members. 

The rest of my family groans when I argue with her politics and dangerous beliefs, but I can’t help it. She constantly says the n-word, spouts horrible anti-LGBT propaganda, and even claims that Alex Jones is actually the comedian Bill Hicks. She’s serious about all these things. 

I’ve tried to reason with her, but she’s too stubborn and won’t budge. I’ve tried to cut contact with her, but my other family members still invite her to everything and I always wind up seeing her anyway. 

I still love her, and I’m convinced she has some kind of mental illness left unchecked. When I was younger, before she was a white nationalist, she was obsessed with being an overzealous evangelical and spouted all kinds of nonsense about how the Illuminati was real and that you could see Satan’s face in the smoke on 9/11. 

Anyone know what the best steps would be to de-radicalize her, or how to improve the relationship between my girlfriend (who I will be proposing to soon) and her? Preferably both, since I can’t really imagine one without the other. Thank you all.",31Dec2019,1

431,"Exactly 1 year ago today, I invited a co-worker to a new years party. She was super chill and was able to hold a conversation, so I assumed she would hit it off with my friends. However, she invited her boyfriend (who I did not know existed). They both were a perfect fit to the friend group, and eventually became regulars at our parties or weekly dinners. Then, at the end of January, her father died. It was devastating. Her mother has been in and out of jail or years, so her dad was the closest/only parental figure she had. She didn’t work for weeks, and when she did, it was for an hour at the most. I reached out to her, to see if there was anything I could do, maybe help her in some cleaning, or just be someone to talk too. I’ve experience my fair share of death, and figured I could be of some use. She accepted, and we spent the whole night talking about her dad and bf and sister. It turns out, her bf (who I grew to like and think of as a good enough guy) has cheated on her multiple times, and has abused her on multiple occasions. But they have been together for years, and she loves him. So I offer to be a line of support, a shoulder to cry on, someone to snag some lunch with if she was feeling lonely. It didn’t take long for her to take me up on my lunch offer, and the next day we were in my bed cuddling while we ate some sandwiches. We soon kissed, and expressed how much we enjoyed each other. We then spent every single day for the next 4 months together. Never going longer than a few hours not seeing the other person. We never did anything more than kiss (2 times total) and cuddle, but we both admitted we were completely in love. She refused to break up with her bf, or tell him we were spending time together, but since he was too busy with other girls or his hobbies, he never knew. Until one of my friends let it leak to him that we were attached at the hip. He promptly ended it with her, and she immediately ended it with me to try and win him back. She didn’t say anything, just blocked me on everything, and refused to tell anyone why. Just that we were done, and I have yet to hear from her in over 6 months. I have spent the last half a year trying to move on, but find it impossible. I loved to the other side of the state, but every time I see a female, or attempt to engage in any form of flirting, she comes to mind, and I end it with who ever I am talking too. She invades my mind, my body, and my soul. My friends all tell me to move on, but I can’t. It’s even worse if I drink. I end up a sobbing mess, unable to think about anything but her. Does anyone have any ideas on how to move on? I want to forget her, but can’t. I cry myself to sleep some nights at the thought of her embrace, and all I want is closure. If she tells me that she used me, then I guess I can accept that. But no communication at all is killing me.
TLDR: I fell in love and she left me. Now I can’t move on and it’s preventing me from being happy.",31Dec2019,1
432,"A friend and her child is travelling with me overseas and I have full responsibility in booking everything. With hotels I am struggling with what is fair in charging her with costs. I am seeking out cheaper accommodation (theory if I was travelling alone would I be willing to pay the full price of the room). Some rooms have 3 beds and I believe it is fair to go 2/3 her and 1/3 me in cost, as her and her child will be using 2/3 of the beds available. It is the rooms that have twin beds that I am struggling with do I use the 2/3 her, 1/3 me calculation due to the number of people using the room or do I use 50/50 calculations as she and her daughter will be only using 1 of the 2 beds. I have tried to ask, but all I get is you just tell me what I have to pay and when. 

I don't want to cheat her out of money and I feel that way with the 2/3 1/3 for a twin room but at the same time I feel like I am being cheated. This is because if I was alone I would be getting a smaller and sometimes cheaper room with 1 single bed.

If my call gets ignored by waiter at busy time on restraunt, it could be (and probably is) a simple mistake but I can't shake that feeling that they are purposely ignoring me because I look 'wimpy' or not worthy enough. I should just shake off this little incident, but I can't.

But I was a very dark kid. I’m not anymore, but I think until I was 12 I could be considered a psychopath. Torturing and killing animals was something I’d do. Not dissecting animals or anything super psychotic but grabbing frogs and throwing them as high as I could and then enjoying the process of slowly killing them as they hit the cement over and over. I’d shoot birds with a bb rifle. I was physically abusive to my sister as well although that’s probably more common little boy stuff. I wrote very morbid stories we had to send in which got me suspended and a talk from the principle. But I did fit in. I always saw myself as weird and I was known as funny, but I was also a dick and kind of a bully.

Maybe it’s just ‘toxic masculinity’ and not completely unheard of, but I always felt like kind of an outsider. I was humiliated and hurt a lot as a child, and not every really shown much love. Maybe it shaped my personality, but I am empathetic because I always see myself in others and understand other people now and I have a conscience, but at the same time I don’t think I can be myself.

439,"My son (14) told me earlier this year that he is gay, which to be honest I always suspected and I’m so happy that he felt he could trust me to tell me. I told him that I loved him and only wanted him to be happy and that I would always be here for him. 
He did not want to tell his father - and I respected him to not tell him either - I thought it best to come from my son when he was ready and did not want to break my sons trust. 
His father is a stereotypical “mans man” and I know he loves our son very much but he has always struggled to connect with him. I have tried many times to talk to my husband about how to approach our son - we have an older boy who is again the stereotypical jock - popular with the ladies, a real bro code kind of guy ( who btw also guessed his brothers sexual orientation and 100 % supports and lives him).    I’m positive that my husband had an idea about our youngest , we have joked between the two of us before that I need to get a good first gay Mardi Gras outfit ready for one day... but then this past weekend my son asked me to tell my husband , he couldn’t but I think he just wanted him to know but could tell him. Since I told him my husband has been distant with both my son and I. I don’t know if it’s because I knew and didn’t tell him or if he is having a hard time accepting it finally but he’s cut himself off from us. I finally tonight told him that he needs to please stop behaving this way because I have reached that point of frustration - I feel he has pushed me away so fine - I’m so far away I’m afraid I might not come back. I have never made it a secret that my kids will always come first. if he wants me to choose I will - and it won’t be him - as much as I love him - and I do - my kids didn’t ask to be here and it’s my job to raise them and live them unconditionally. I don’t do conditions and I can’t be with anyone who wants to have them. Having said this I am needing advice before I say something I can’t take back.

442,"Here's the summary:

I'm 32, I'm now working a boring dead-end job, I earn just enough to pay the bills and food, and that's about it. I'm wondering if I shouldn't go back to live with my parents because should I get laid off or something happen, I'm in the street.

I tried to attain three different diplomas, marketing, nursing and plumbing. I failed all three of them, I studied hard but I'm a bit slow and dumb when it comes to comprehension and learning, I also got laid off at previous job that required a bit of thinking, I can do the simple tasks but more complicated stuff is not something I would trust myself with. I always dreamt about writing books, I did so for over ten years and took classes too. But I do have some sense of self-critic, a decade of training and writing every evening is just plain bad, I had to gave up, it was disheartening to witness what I could not do. 

I never had a girlfriend or even friends, I have trouble communicating. I can do jokes and sarcasm pretty well, but that's it. Whenever I try to have a deeper conversation or talk about a precise subject, I bore the other people and they just leave at the first occasion. I followed advice to make friens like going to clubs I like and social clues, but to no avail.

I also went to therapy for 7 years for the same issues, it felt good talking about it, but I'm not sure it helped either.

Now, every morning when I look into the mirror, the only thing that awaits me is a boring job, with no friends or dreams or people to look forward too, and there's barely anything that brings me joy. 

And I wonder, what's the fucking point if despite my efforts, I still live like this?",31Dec2019,1
443,"Myself and my ex broke up 5 years ago. And have stayed in contact regularly throughout. Our breakup was tumulus, and we did go through a 7 month period of zero contact with one another. He left me for another woman, and dated her for a few years. Most of the time he complained about her (classic MO) and a few times he did cheat on her. I was guilty of thinking “she deserved it” 

Two years ago he told me they broke up. He goes out with his guy friends and hits on women, tells me about all the women who hit on him. And over the course of two years we have gone on multiple dates and even slept together. I no longer have contact with our mutual friend, and never felt the need to clarify or “fact check” *shrug* 

Last night I found out that they had never broken up, and in actuality he proposed. 

The question is — do I tell his new fiancé, that her us and-to-be has lied and cheated on her for nearly the entirety of their relationship, and has lied about them even being together for the last two years? 

Or do I just tell him he’s a piece of shit, and let her continue on in a state of blinded bliss?

449,"So, to give some context here: my parents are well into their 50's at this point (both are 54-55 I believe) and drink heavily in the late evenings. I've been witnessing their fights since I was rather young, both have aggressive behavior issues (but mainly my mother) and take it out on each other or me indirectly. They drink around 2-3 or more bottles of beer as well as 1-2 shots in the evenings, this in turn causes them to become insufferable assholes. They start fighting over menial things, which progressively becomes either a shouting match or a sling of calling each other names. Most recently my mother gained a job working at our local Fred Meyers in the deli section, it has so far been working out for her despite having long hours in the day. Tonight, however, things got a bit more turbulent, as my father starting accusing my mother of having a supposed affair with one of her coworkers as she had given him her phone # when she normally never does that, yet she claims this isn't the case as she only gave it to him to have him text her the schedule (since her boss doesn't like her, I wonder why /s) that, and as she claims 'he's gay'. This to me is a very serious accusation, one that could possibly break up a marriage, but one that I kinda expected to be made at some point with how far these two have gone in their arguments over time. I fear that things may escalate to a point where their relationship may breakdown all the way, even though it hasn't happened now despite all the names and even an alleged attempt to seriously hurt my father (he claims she tried to choke him out, I didn't see this of course since I was hiding in my room due to how bad these two were fighting).

I was awake but I pretended to be asleep, I obviously was weirded out when he did it, I didn’t know any better and ignored him. Fast forward to a few years later, I remembered and realized how wrong it was for a father to do that to his own child. Maybe he just saw something?? On my butt?? I’m not sure if I should justify what he did.

Fast forward to a few years again, I looked through my mom’s messages with my aunt. I know I shouldn’t have done that because she should have her privacy, but I couldn’t help it.

The messages were about my aunt being worried for my dad. She told mom about the weird things she noticed with my dad, like how he was slowly sneaking into her room, slowly pulling her panties down. She was awake but was pretending to be asleep. She also talked about how her mother (my grandma) noticed dad’s “stalker tendencies” etc etc. 

I’m worried. I never thought of dad that way since he’s a hardcore Christian, he’s my dad and it’s just a little weird and concerning to find all of this out. 

He still has his stalker tendencies up until today, I once saw him when I walked out of my room and saw him in the hallway, no lights, it was completely dark. He quickly turned the lights on and pretended to look at the bookshelf. I knew he was probably listening to my grandma/me (since our rooms were along the hallway).

I figured that I didn't need to be ""friends"" with people I don't know or barely have an idea of who they are and that every important birthday I'll be able to remember it. And the same with the other two. My question is how can or is it possible to live without an instant messaging app in current day society? At the moment I just call any friend I want to know about how they are doing because for me it is better to call someone and have 3 quality minutes of talking than 3 hours of messages. It's just my point of view and want to know if it's even possible to leave the instant messaging bubble even from a laboral perspective",31Dec2019,1

Things got out of line after that. She touched my junk and placed my hand on her breast, all in a half-joking manner, and in full view of my fiance. We all laughed at the foolishness but my fiance was getting visibly uncomfortable. Now the friend and I are on the floor, in a blanket, watching a movie. Fiance is on the couch. I'm holding friend's hand, and we're encouraging fiance to hold my hand too. She declines. This leads to me touching the friend under the blanket, over her pants. It ends there, but after the movie we all crash in the living room. I spend maybe five minutes caressing her arms and such, seeking reciprocation. I did not get any, so that was my sign to stop my advances. This whole event transpired while extremely drunk. I have since come clean about my mistake and my fiance is willing to stay together.

460,"As the title suggest I just finished my last final about two weeks ago. Very happy. First day, I cleaned everything out. Move furniture around and a lot more. Second day, finalize some cleaning, and enjoyed the day.  Thursday, had a docs appointment, came back and enjoyed my afternoon and did some laundry. Friday  work, Saturday work. Sunday enjoy my day with my wife.  Next weeks is Christmas week. Monday finished some shopping/wrapping. Holidays/work till Monday(today). 

Now I know that in some respect I have kept myself busy, but today (Monday) I couldn't get anything done. 

I felt like I wanted to do this, or that and when I finally got to it an other problem arised and I couldn't focus. Needless to say, I told myself I was going to exercise, which I haven't but will once I finish this post because I know this is an issue I have to work on. 

Things I have to get done is:  
Resume update, Job search. 

Workout, Cook and Eat clean. 

Clean. And put away some hobby stuff who's boxes are taking up too much space.  Doesn't help that when I clean I get rid of junk which is time consuming because I have to make sure that whatever byproduct of it is not clutter in itself. 

(Just remembered) I left clothes in the washer. Like F\*\*\* .

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I feel everything is coming at me at 100mph and I cannot focus. Part of me thinks it is due to the fact that I slept very late last night, but idk this is not the first time.  Hell I forgot I was hungry and didn't realize that and ate bad (which is ok, losing weight is a marathon). I just want the holidays to be over because I really feel they are getting in the way.

I'm a 14 year old boy. (My Father and Step Mother are not married yet.) So my ""Step cousin"" Isn't even marriage related to me yet.

Anyways. She stayed the night along with her little sister (13) for two days. Almost the entire time she ignored her actual cousin (My step Sis) and her sis to hang out with me. We hung out together almost the entire time, we were maybe separated an hour or two in the total of the two days. We had not met but once and briefly before this.  
We watched movies, youtube, listened to music, and used the ""Monkey"" app. It was a lot of fun..If you overlook the entire two days.  
She and I cuddled up against each other 85% of the time, we consistently ""booped"" each other (touching each others noses) and sometimes she'd get in my face pushing her nose and forehead against mine just looking at me for a bit. Instead of sleeping in my comfy bed, we slept \*right\* next to each other every night.  
I like her, in fact ever since she left I cannot get my mind of her.

She is so fun to hang out with and..she's hella cute. She's called me cute, vice versa.  
I talked to my brother (17) and he said it would never happen so I should get over it, he also said that my parents and step sis all think we like each other and talked about it.  
Later my Dad even asked me what I thought of her and that if we ever wanted to hang he's sure he could set it up.

But earlier this year, i went to a music festival and she was part of the group while he was back at home since he isnt much into the music. And ever since that event we became friends and getting more and more closer to each other as we were going to parties and music events together (some with just her and i). 

Now we talk all day everyday and we’ve been #1 friends with each other on snapchat for over 2 months. And she even told me she talks to me more than her actual boyfriend. Now she’s coming to me with all her relationship arguments about how her bf hates that she goes to all these events and parties rather than spending time with him. And she tells me that she’s always scared to do things due to how her bf will react to it

I view her as a really close friend of mine and i really enjoy being with her but i don’t know what to tell her or what to even say or do about her whole situation with the relationship aspect. I honestly just want her to be happy in the end because i do care about her :(

470," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ on email replies and said it in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. Sometimes she will ask me something related to jobs etc then when is she whatever is ya she will abruptly reply ‘did yer’ in what seems a snotty/sarcastic way 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

471,"(I posted this on the intrusivethoughts subreddit, but I think this is a better place to get advice)
Im going to say now, I have no idea how reddit works. Ive never made an account on here, and I never have really used this platform. I hope this is the right subreddit to talk about this, because if not, I’ll look like a fool. Anyways, I’m a 15 year old girl who’s currently a sophomore in high-school. Reddit might not be the place for me to be asking this sort of question, but I tried Quora and you can’t give a description. Right off the bat I’m going to say that my spelling isn’t great, and I repeat myself a lot. It’s ADHD, and it makes me look like a fool. Don’t correct me, please. I’m having sexual thoughts about my teachers. Yeah, might seem like I’m just a horny teen. I’ve been having them since 7th grade, and I don’t know where they’ve been coming from, or why. They drive me insane on the daily, and they make me feel disgusting. I’ve never wanted these thoughts, and nor would I ever have any type of sexual relationship with a teacher. The first time I had these thoughts was in my english class in 7th grade. The english teacher (also another girl) was talking about something in the board, and I was sketching in my notebook. All of a sudden I get a random thought about pushing her against the wall and making out with her. I sat there and thought, “Weird. I don’t like girls, and I definitely don’t like my teacher. Just a weird thought, I guess.” and brushed it off as if it didn’t happen. Then it started getting worse, the thoughts would get more extreme to the point where it would be sexual intercourse, and not just with one teacher. I continued to brush off these thoughts as weird and just my hormones acting up, but they’ve been going on for years and to this day I still have them. They make me feel disgusting and absolutely filthy. I’m not attracted to girls romantically or sexually, but have them about my same sex teachers. I’m not romantically or sexually attracted to any of my teachers but continue to have these thoughts. They’ve gotten to the point where I think about it with my fellow classmates, whom I would never actually do anything with. I feel revolted at myself for having these thoughts and I don’t know how to get help. Which leads me here, on Reddit, at 5:33 AM. I have a therapist, and I tell her a lot of stuff, but this is one of the things I have yet to tell. I don’t know if this is my mind playing tricks on me because of my hormones, or this is something serious that I need to get help for. I would really appreciate it if anyone had any advice for me, at all. I’m going to leave it at that. I’m not going to reveal anything more about myself than I already have. I know some people on this website can be dicks, so please just be nice and ignore this post if you don’t have anything kind to say. I know I’m a teen who’s probably being dramatic, but I’m seriously looking for help. Cheesy thing to mention, but this is a serious topic and the fact that I have to go on Reddit for help is kinda low for me. If you read this all I appreciate your time, and hope you had a good day.

I’m a pretty practical person, I don’t like to put to much pressure on relationships or commitments, so she didn’t actually have any with me. I talked with my bestie and it turns out that’s what ended her last relationship, everything was going great and she just ended it. Thing is she doesn’t really want to break, she just wants to go back to how it was before. Wish would have been fine by me if she had said it before, but now it hurts coming out of the blue. Should I try to go back to how things were with her? I have to see her anyway, we have the same best friend and she lives with her.

So I started saying to my best friend oh my god hit me if I fall for him jokingly but after maybe a month of hanging out with him in class only we never talked outside of school he started  dropping hints like holding my hand under the table letting me sit next to him like REALLY small stuff but I took it bigger then it was, one day I had a jokingly fight with him telling him not to sit next to the other girl and to sit next to me and he actually listens to me and moved and sat next to me just a lot of dumb stuff like that so I decided ok I’ve never told a guy I’ve liked them before why not now ? So on the last day of our class together he and I were sitting with his friend and then the bell rang and I told him to hang around for a bit but he said he’s gotta go quickly so I said alright I have him a handshake and I I didn’t let go and said I need to tell you something and he said what And I kept saying it with my eyes and saying I like and repeating it but he didn’t get it so I just blurted our I LIKE YOU OK  and he said “oh all good “ and I was like what ? He said allg again and backed away and I was like does that make things awkward now ? And he said no and we haven’t spoken since then we look at eachother in the hallway but still don’t speak

Not dating, just talking. She never told me about this, I accidentally stumbled apon it when I was looking at her phone to play some music. Sure I was PISSED that she didn’t tell me but I brushed it off. She’s a single mom, she would’ve told me when she’s ready. Anyways she did, turns out he’s an asshole who cares about himself, and himself only but she still talks to him. I try and talk her out of it but she tells me I’m being “stupid” and that “it doesn’t matter”. I wouldn’t matter if he wasn’t an asshole. I couldn’t care less about her dating world, I’m just worried about her, which I shouldn’t be. So I accidentally stumbled across it again when she asked me to check a message from her friends. I didn’t talk to her this time. I thought she was over the other guy so again, thought nothing. Just today I saw that she was texting A MARRIED MAN. MARRIED. HE IS MARRIED. It makes me fume because my dad used to do that and she’d be heartbroken, but now she’s texting married guys. No, not just sexual jokes and friendly talks. Full on “Spank me” shit. I tried to exit out and just chill but there’s more and more. She’s been texting multiple married guys the same things. I don’t wanna y’all to her cause she’ll accuse me of stalking her. I see her so much differently but I can’t. I just HATE her now. What makes it okay for her to do it? I couldn’t care less if she was fucking some single, of age, nice guy. I couldn’t care less as long as he’s okay, not married and consenting which even then I don’t even have to think about bc it’s none of my business but this is just grossing me out. Don’t tell me it’s none of my business because if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be tearing me up. Do I tell her?? Do I not tell her?? Do I tell the guy or do I not? I don’t know anymore please help!

Backstory:

I’m a teen. My parents are divorced. My mom is married and my dad has a girlfriend and they both have a child. My mom and stepdad love making jokes insulting me. Not in a cruel way or to torture me as they do love me, but just a way to annoy me I guess. Idk why but nowadays it seems to hurt more. Everytime I want them to buy something, my stepdad would bring up my results from my exam a few months back (it’s kinda important but not life destroying important). And it kinda hurts. They sometimes call me hopeless, stupid, and other things too. They’ve done it for quite a while now, but I’ve sorta realised how hurtful it is. Maybe it’s because of me being a teen or maybe I’m right.

The Main Event:

I was like doing chores and my stepdad made a joke that I just found offensive and I just said it’s not funny and that it kinda hurts and stuff. Both of them were silent for a while. Then I sat down and started talking with my mom and she asked “How’d your father feel about your results?” and I’m like “He said it’s ok but do better in SPM”. And she’s like “WOW. Your dad didn’t talk about you shifting huh? How unusual. He’s probably just hanging out with his SECOND SON” and I got like offended and shit. I just went to my room. I didn’t really wanna talk about it. So I just stayed in my room. Lying on the floor. Not crying, just in thought. Why? That was the question running through my mind. I’m a bit confused and I don’t know what to do

So Redditors, please help. Am I stupid for thinking this? Do you think I’m right? Am I just going through a phase? What should I do?",31Dec2019,1

Anytime I’m hanging out with someone I can’t shake the feeling that they feel like they’re superior to me as a person because of this even though I know this most likely isn’t the case at all, it’s gotten to the point where I’m having rash and aggressive thoughts about people that care about me and I don’t know how to shake it. I’d like to confront people about this but it’s hard for me to be confrontational, is there any way I can go about this without coming off as an asshole or too abrasive? Or would I be in the right to sound more abrasive since this is a genuine concern of mine?

488,"I don’t really know how to talk to my parents about this so I’m here trying to see if someone can give me advice on what to do. Sorry for ranting, I guess I’m also trying to come to terms with what happened.  
I have family abroad and specifically one uncle that has been giving me weird vibes the last two times I’ve visited them. This uncle is married to my mothers sister. My mom and her sister and very close so this is what is making me unsure about how to come about this for I don’t want to ruin the family and overall this isn’t a topic my parents or anyone culturally has brought up to me on how to handle it. (I am 20F) 

The second to last time I visited, my uncle always wanted to hold my hand and he’d kiss my hand and always say he missed me and that i should visit more often. He never held my hand when my mom or her sister (his wife)  were in the room. I found it odd but given I visit every couple of years i thought it was fine for him to say he missed me. He also put his hand on my thigh a little around the halfway point so it was weird but wasn’t like oh he’s trying to touch me inappropriately (again was trying to tell myself that he’s my uncle and he doesn’t mean any harm). 
This last time I visited them, I tried to not be as close to him. He kept always wanting to hold my hand again and I’d let it be but sometimes just be like “oh sorry it’s too warm” or i’d rearrange myself so my hands were full. My mom and her sister generally rode in one taxi and me and him would sit in another. (3 passenger rule so we had to ride in 2 taxis). He’d always hold my hand and talk about how he thinks about me all the time and misses me. I started getting uncomfortable and I kept staying quiet and not really talking hoping he’d just stop talking. Toward the end of my visit, he asked for a hug. Usually I hug my dad and stuff and it’s not weird so I was like okay, sure it’s just a hug. He kissed my cheek, then nuzzled and kissed my neck and while doing so he was holding me really tight and one of this hands went on my breast. It was very quick but i pushed him away and said I was too warm and i need space. I got very uncomfortable for my mom was sleeping in the room over. He never does this when anyone else is there. Before I left to catch my flight, my mom and aunt left to go pick up some last minute snacks for me leaving me alone with him. He asked for another hug and I kept procrastinating for I don’t know how to handle this situation other than try my best to avoid him. He asked repeatedly and I said okay fine. He wanted a hug but stood weirdly away from the window and where someone could see us. I kept and seems like I still am trying to convince myself he wasn’t trying to be sexual or anything so I took him if he wanted a hug he should just come to the middle of the room where the fan was on bc it was hot. He was hesitant but gave me a hug and it was once again uncomfortable tight and I pushed away saying I need to go shower. 

I guess I really just don’t know how to approach this with my mom and don’t know if this is considered creepy and is worth telling my mom. I don’t have a lot of close family I can ask for advice for this situation so I guess I’m here.",31Dec2019,1

491,"I was born in 2002. When I was a kid, I used to watch the Monster Energy AMA Supercross races with my dad. Every time I asked him when I could get one of motorcycles myself, he told me I'd get one for my 10th birthday. Unfortunately, that never happened.

You see, back in the good old days, my family was rolling. My dad had a drywall construction business called ""Z-Rock"", my mom worked as an assistant in a dentist's office during the day, and as a waitress at a fancy Italian restaurant in our neighborhood at night. We were what they call ""blue-collar"" (I don't actually know what that means though), pulling in 6 figures a year, being able to afford the most expensive cable/DirecTV package, going on frequent outings and trips, etc.

When I was 6, we moved into a new city, that has a much tougher job market, to be closer to family. It wasn't bad though, cause my dad used to fly back to our old city to do drywall work, and we were doing just as good as before. But when I was 8, my dad stopped working construction jobs and got into smoking weed and ice within a year, growing weed in our yard even. My parents divorced when I was 9, and all my mom can do here is HOA office jobs that give her less than $20/hour.  I do love my parents, for everything they have done for me and provided me with all these years, and I'm thankful we're doing as good as we are now, knowing it could be worse.

However, I've always had a desire to bring myself back into those ""good old days"" when I'm an adult, and get my own kid a motorcycle (or something of that value) for their 10th birthday. When I see kids riding around on quads and motorcycles, or showing off other expensive toys/stuff, I think to myself ""*that* is what I want to be able to provide *my* kids with some day, the way my parents used to"".

Only thing is, sometimes I just feel like that's impossible. Everyone tells me I'll be stuck with $10/hour minimum wage work, how groceries and bills and everything is super expensive. It makes me feel like I won't be in prosperity until I'm like 70 years old, if at all. They say no one will care about you out there, and you'll be stuck on your own hopelessly.

I've already decided to return to my former city to get a business associate's in science degree, and have been practicing investing on a stock market simulator based on real info, and plan to start doing it for real when I reach 18 years old. But that's all I really have right now.

493,"A while ago my boyfriend &amp; I of 13 months broke up. It was a pretty nasty breakup. Very messy. Just a little insight on our relationship - he moved in with me on the first month. We got along really well until the last few months when we were arguing all the time. I guess this was because we were seeing eachother 24/7. I ended up breaking up with him as I just needed time apart. We were both mentally unstable &amp; I guess this caused a lot of chaos both in the relationship &amp; after. 


I spoke to one friend about this, she knew everything that was going on with us. Even the personal things because I trusted her with my all. She was with me through all the stages of the breakup... The sadness, the anger and the moving on. I said a lot of hateful things about him which I regret, but in the time of the moment when I was angry, I just vented to her without thinking at all. 

After a few months of having him blocked on everything, I unblocked him to try talk things through. We both kind of found our self love during the time we weren't talking. This was great. Our conversation went smooth &amp; we decided to catch up as friends. We caught up quite a lot just as friends. He told me that he never moved on from me &amp; that he really missed me but he thought it was good we both had a break. We had quite an emotional talk &amp; we both ended up cuddling &amp; I stayed the night at his. 

The next morning when I woke up I saw that my friend was messaging him, the one that helped me through the break up. I was kinda confused, why would my bestfriend be messaging my ex boyfriend. Why did her contact name have hearts. I asked him about it &amp; he told me that they had a 'thing.' He didn't know how close her &amp; I were &amp; basically used her as a rebound. He showed me a few messages and she was all over him. She was talking about dating etc etc. We had a deep chat about this &amp; he said he would easily cut her off for me any day. He didn't exactly like her, but she was obsessed with him. I was a bit upset by the whole situation, especially the fact that we were getting closer &amp; better than ever. Our relationship was truly healing &amp; we were both stable enough to actually make it work. 

For a while I didn't message my friend, but he ended up telling her about him &amp; I. She was extremley angry. Anyways, I just got home &amp; he is out with his family for new years. Where I live, it is already Jan 1st. My whole new years has turned to complete shit. She screenshotted everything I said about him &amp; sent it to him. This is on snapchat, so it tells you when someone screenshots. He hasn't texted me for a while, he hasn't been online for a while &amp; I'm not sure if he has seen the screenshots or not. 

What do I do? Finally, when everything starts to get better I find out that my bestfriend betrayed me but is also trying to get with him by making him try to hate me. I am so worried.

498,"Ok, so backstory. My husband and I were coming home late one night and scratched my neighbors car. It happened. We were at fault 100%. We didn't have insurance at the time (we do now, as we learned our lesson from this), so in order for him not to take us to court, we had to pay for the full repair cost, which was $1200. I think that's way too much for a scratch, but whatever. So we paid the only money we had at the time, which was about 200 ish, promising to pay the remainder by the end of the month and signed a promise to pay with our signatures and his documenting this. As collateral as he waited for us to pay the rest, I let him hold on to my wedding ring. He IMMEDIATELY pawned it, getting $200 for it (Originally a $3,000 ring). I was upset, as he wasn't supposed to pawn it, only hold it as collateral until we paid him the remainder at the end of the month. (Which we did, and we signed another paper stating it was paid in full.) So his car is fixed now and my ring is in a pawn shop somewhere. He said we could buy it back from pawn with the receipt, but he hasn't given me the receipt or even told me what pawn shop it was. I've knocked on his door countless times to see if he has the receipt yet, but no one ever answers, and I've told him when I'm home, so he should be able to drop it by then. It's been 2 months and I'm beginning to fear my precious ring is gone for good. What should I do?",31Dec2019,1

But there is a guy at my gym who noticed the clothes I wore at the gym and asked me where I bought them, I dont mind people learning from one another, so I told him. Then the next workout he bought almost identical clothes. Then I noticed he started watching my workouts and then started doing exactly what I do. Then I noticed he started timing his gym sessions for the same time as me (he even told me this). He isn't attracted to me, he has a gf, but the amount of attention he pays to me makes me feel so uncomfortable 

There are a lot more little things like that he does, and over time its really affected me. last night after meeting in the gym, I was so irritated by him I actually couldn't sleep because of it (crazy right). I notice this type behaviour really affects me, I appreciate its a relatively childish mentality, but it still really affects me and I am not sure how to overcome it. 

I come from a really harsh childhood, so I am not sure if having to figure out everything out myself as a child, has made me a little resentful when people just steal from me like that.

Basically it’s just as the title says. 
I’m only 18 years old and me and my girlfriend have been together for a little over a year now.  

I’m in a foreign country on vacation and I happened to go into a massage parlor one night while I was out just cuz I had a bunch of time to kill. I didn’t think that the happy ending massages were even legal where I am so I definitely didn’t think that was what was going to happen when I walked in there. Anyway, I got aroused during the massage because the lady kept rubbing up against me, and then she asked me if I wanted a happy ending handjob and, in the state I was in, I stupidly said yes. 

afterwards I immediately felt so much guilt about it. I don’t know why I did this, I never thought I would cheat on my girlfriend I love her so much. 

I don’t know what to do about it. 
I want to be honest and just tell her I fucked up and just hope for the best, but I also don’t want to risk this relationship being over. This is my first long term relationship and i love this girl more than anything in the world. I don’t know what came over me, but I was just being stupid and horny and I fucked up. 

I will never ever do anything like this ever again I know that for sure, but I have no idea what to do
I just feel like I made such a rash decision and we’re both very young and this issue is way over my head and I really don’t think she would be able to forgive me, I don’t know. I just feel so overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do. I feel so terrible.",31Dec2019,1

504,"I, 21F, have been with my husband, 22M, over a span of 5 years, married for 8 months. Now, that being said, since we met when I was 15, we’ve had a few conversations about my questioning interest in women throughout the years, but as he has been my first and only sexual relationship, I do not know if I would be sexually interested in them. 

I’ve told my husband that I’m at the very least queer - as the discussions we’ve had in the past point to a very minor female attraction, and I’m androgynous in appearance, but a couple weeks ago, we were out at a bar and I met someone that made this same-sex attraction reignite.

We went to an event the bar was hosting with loads of heavy music, aggressive behavior, etc. We planned mostly on being on our own, specifically because I’m a lightweight and he’s anti-social in large groups. At the beginning of the night, I made eye contact with this girl that stuck out to me more than anyone, she said excuse me and went by and that was the end of that. It was a couple hours before I saw her again, and a couple drinks later for me, and that’s when it clicked she was alone. After some hesitation from my husband, I walk my drunk ass over there, confess I’m drunk off my ass and that she’s really pretty, and then we laugh about how my husband says you don’t talk to strangers in bars. We exchange numbers and bump into each other a few more times, my husband starts referring to her as my lady friend, and that really gave me butterflies. 

We didn’t maintain contact beyond that, I normally keep to myself when I’m not drinking, so that was a bit out of character. But since then, I can’t help but wonder if me being slightly hung up on the fact that I actually found her attractive, in person, is something worth talking about with my husband. No, I don’t plan on leaving him for a woman, as I am attracted to him. But I’ve never had an interaction with the same sex that’s made me feel that way before, at least in person... Advice?

Also - I figure it’s worth noting my husband is not interested in bringing another person into the bedroom with us, in case that’s a potential suggestion from anyone!",31Dec2019,1

On the other hand, there would be no one to walk my dog if I did decide to go. My mom will stay at home with some of her friends but they will be busy drinking and partying, so no one is going to really take care of my dog. The last 6 or 7 years I have always stayed at home to take care of my dog, since she's scared of fireworks and hides in the corners of the house. My mom says she'll take care of her, but I KNOW she won't. It would be a great leap of faith I'd have to take.

If I went, I'd have to get back home somehow. Good luck with that shortly after 12. Taking a cab will be quite costly since the party is taking place on the other side of town.

Essentially I’m on the hook to do an additional job for the next four months. I’ve done the job before, but only over summer (two months). It involves leaving work mid-day three times a week and making up the hours at my main job by staying later. It also requires me to be very strict with my schedule and deal with people in a near-retail sense, and do public speaking. I hate it, I’ve done it before, I hate it, and I’m trying to figure out a way to get out of the mindset of hating it.

This isn’t a sob post. A lot of people work multiple jobs, I’m aware. I have this job because I didn’t know how to say no. I have a ton of anxiety about it and am really angry with myself for not being able to say no, and to start off 2020 with four months of this.

She’s done this in the past where she’d spread rumors about me (like me throwing used underwear at people, eating glass off the floor, and throwing up in people’s shirts) causing me to get in trouble multiple times because I wouldn’t do something for her and she keeps doing this and I don’t want anymore issues with this!

517,"So a little back ground, I am a 30 year old male. I have a three year old son, who I raised as a stay at home dad 5 days out the week. 

We have one of the strongest bonds and he has so much love for me. I raised him, took him to ever drs appointment, zoos, fairs, mususmes, etc. I was his main primary care taker.

Me and his mother split up back in the beginning of the year. Her father kept calling the police on me multiple times, trying to get me arrested multiple times. I never once got arrested or in trouble.

 Ee had schedule 50 50 parenting time schedule but it wasnt court ordered. One day as I was picking my son up her father attacked me. They than said I was the aggressor. And called the cops. 

Cops come do a report says nothing going happen. Or come from this it's a family dispute and it will get sent to the prosecutor's office.... nothing ever came out of it. Never heard back. No one got in trouble. 

But here where my life changed forever. 

The next day they go down to the court house and file for a ppo against me saying all types of things that I abuse her. Beat her, beat our child, beat our dogs, etc. All types of crazy allegations. Her dad moves into her house and is now living with her.

Her lawyers and then are trying to take my son from me for good. Saying I'm crazy and unstable.

But my stories are consistent and and hers are not. 

She held our son from me for 40 days until our court date. Her dad has money and is paying for her lawyers. He is pushing the agenda and telling her what to do. 

I got a lawyer I fought the ppo but with the lawyer I had andhe told me that there is no custody order, if we fight the ppo the judge wont grant custody time because it's a ppo hearing not a custody hearing.  

My ex was offering me every other weekend with my kid. My lawyer said keep the ppo take the time because you wont see your kid for a while as court dates are backed up 6 months. 

So I took there deal. Keep the ppo on me for 6 months I get to see my kid again every other weekend until custody hear. 6 month later.

3 months pass and she files for temporary custody order and child support. The whole time we went together I was giving her $250 a month of food and whatever. 

They made up a false income for me, and now charging me $760 a month for child support. I had no say in any of it. My lawyer just let it happen, didnt try to stop them. Than they said we will give you Wednesday now with you every other weekend and took away my phone time with him. 

I fired my lawyer the next day, he was not in my best interest, in fact these deals hes getting me to see my son. Is below what the court orders. I'm getting less than what the judges starting orders are.

I'm supposed to get my son for 6 nights month not 4 nights. 

Every night matters when it come to child support. They are trying make me pay as much as I can. 

I dont have alot of money and my lawyer bill is around 2000k a month. We still have to go to mediation to come to an agreement.

I find a really good lawyer but she is $400 an hour.
I hire her and within days my case was turning around. My ex and her lawyer was getting shut down. 

Subpoenas were issues we are catching them in lies etc.

We go to mediation and the mediator like man you  got screwed by your other lawyer. That when i learn I been getting less than minimal. 

My ex trying get full custody and I'm asking for 50 50
But where I live they believe in father having 50 50. 

The mediator told me the judge been giving single fathers with children age 3, 10 days a month. That's the avg ruling

So the mediator started us at 10 day, my ex said no, she literally said no to every offer and than offers me to have our son only 6 days. 

We asked if we could work toward 50 50 and she said no. 

So here is my offer I get my son 6 days a month, he has to be picked up dropped of at day care at 8 am. I said why cant I watch him. Why does he have to go to day care at  8am. She said because I want him to. She literally arguing with the court  over a few hours of me having him while he at day care not evan in her care. I get 3 week vacations with him and every year we switch holidays,

This is not in the best interest of my son and I keep saying that. My son tells me everytime I get him he misses me he loves me, he wants to live with me not mommy. Its hurting my son not to see me.

She is offering me less than what the judge is ordering. I can fight her on this and go in front of a judge. But she renewed the ppo. Which Is a problem. I never violated it. But she renewed it to use it as a weapon to keep my son from me. 

She is still accusing me of false allegations with no evidence.

 So my lawyer and the mediator told me that if I fight this the judge might not give me 10 days, he might just say no we keeping you at every other weekend and that's my schedule. 

This is the time I'm gettin offer for my son. 

It's not fair. Only seeing him 1/4 of his life. I want to fight it. My lawyer told me it could cost me up to 20 more grand. I dont have any more money and idk what to do. I feel force to take a deal I dont want. 

I want to say fuck it and fight it all. Let the judge decide. But is it worth the risk?

I honestly dont know what to do. I was leaning to accept the plea so my son does see me more. But it's not what I accept and I shouldnt accept it. Its bullshit. 

They also kept reminding me that I am a male and they give rights to woman first so I'm lucky to get what I get. But i feel they just trying make me agree to this deal. 

Any advice would help sorry so long. I just dont know if i should risk it all or not call there bluff. Get my son back

What my lawyer and mediator said to do was to accept this. And work on getting 50 50 over time and told me i could re apply for 50 50 when he turn 5 which is in 2 years and the judge awards 50 50 to 5 year olds and i wont have the ppo on me than. So she wont be able to use it against me.",31Dec2019,1
518,"Hello!  In my first highschool day when I was meeting  people a nerd dude came up to me and he said a weird joke and ran away. After that he did it again like 3 times.  I met with him (i'm a guy). and i thought i can introduce him to my other friends in the school. They didnt spend time with him and they excluded him cause he couldnt even make a sentences sometimes. The dude was spending too much time and texting too much to me and I decided to see him as my friend. I included him many of my experiences and in my projects. we are friends like from 4 years to now, but for the last 3 months, im feeling like he is trying to have a competition deeply inside to me, trying to beat me in dialogues and then also I realized that he is stealing my thoughts. I can give an example, He is liking what i liked on instagram pages also following profiles, watching my series, my music taste, even the country i wanna study in. I always treated helpful to my friends but this guy is not helping me in any situations, trying to put a wall to my life and beat me in dialogues. What should i do?

521,"So some random girl on this site was talking about how she went on a date with an unattractive guy she rejected that had been chasing after her and he didn't want to meet up with her again. A lot of people were telling her that she's a catfish and that she looks worse in person than her pictures.

Maybe they could be right, but how would they know that? These people were saying this as FACT and said that they were telling her the truth. They weren't at the date, so they don't know if she said or did something that put him off, or if she was acting arrogant, or if they didn't have chemistry, or if he had vengeful intentions for setting up the date etc.

It was weird to me. How would they know that she doesn't look like her pictures or is uglier in real life if they've never seen her in person? I understand giving it as a possible reason, but to be presenting it as fact and saying ""this is the truth"" I found strange. Can anyone explain why these people were doing that?",31Dec2019,1

 school this september. There's a girl in my class that I like, and I talk to her a lot along with a few other people. Lately she's been making a lot of ""I want to die"" jokes and at first I wasn't sure what to think cause I've been through a smiliar phase when I didn't quite understand what a mental illness was.
I don't know her very well, cause we've only known each other for a few months, and we don't have all of our classes togheter. She's been posting very unsettling stuff on her instagram lately, that she is incredibly lonely, that she's been in a toxic relationship for 4 years ( I think we might have talked about it once but I'm not sure), that 'her demons' make her do horrible things and that she's too scared to commit suicide but she wants to. 
It all makes me very anxious but I'm not sure what to do. She mentioned that she's been talking to our school counselor, and I told her that she can text and talk to me whenever she needs to, when she showed up to the last day of school before christmas break crying.
I care about her but I have a little bit of trouble expressing emotions myself, I'm not diagnosed with anything, I just have a hard time bringing up serious things like this, and I don't what what the right moment would be to do that.

531,"Okay so I meet this guy online, he was really nice and we had very similar interests. He is 18 and doesn’t live that far away from me. I told him I was 18 as well when we first meet and that I was from Sweden. 

After a while of talking we got pretty close and I started to fall in love with him. He did as well and he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend. I immediately said yes and it was great.
I told him some very personal stuff that I haven’t told anyone else. I feel like I can trust him.
We talk pretty much every night and sometimes fall asleep together in discord calls so we can wake up together.

I love him a lot. More than I have ever loved anyone else before.

But there is one big problem.

I’m actually 14.

And look I get that it’s really weird for a 14 year old and 18 year old to be together. We are in very different stages I guess in life. And even though a 4 year difference isn’t that much it’s a lot since I’m so young.

I want to tell him but I’m pretty sure he will be sad and probably mad at me for not telling him earlier.  But there’s also a part of that doesn’t want to tell him and just wait until I’m 18 and then tell him. Which I know is pretty bad idea.

He’s always going on about wanting to be an astronaut some day, and it’s been his childhood dream that he’s kept for years. He wants to attend MIT to obtain his masters and then wants to commission as an Air Force officer to be a pilot and get into Test Pilot School.

He is always alone in school and I’m literally his only friend that he has. I’ve been trying to push him into going out and meeting girls and other people. I have been constantly telling him that he’s going to regret not going to parties, meeting new people, and missing out the college experience when he’s older and that he should come with me. He never listens and I keep telling him to loosen up a bit. I told him that MIT has an acceptance rate of 4% and NASA only hires every 4 years for astronauts and the odds of that are astronomically low (12 in 18500).

539,"Coming from my heart, a little backstory: I've been interested in this girl for a while, and a lot of things in her life aligned with mine - from her interests, to what she wants to do in the future, down to the type of music. I asked her out yesterday and most probably have been rejected as she's replying to my texts through social media(where the last text was about a movie that just came out) and not through the SMS(where the last text was me asking her to come to an event we could attend after New Years).

What I'm getting at is that I've realized that whenever I am getting involved with a girl, I imagine myself to be different than who I am. Like I imagine myself to be funnier than who I currently am, smarter than I currently am, and tougher than I currently am and hence behave those ways. In my head, I think that if i was this improved version of myself I would totally be in my first(possibly last :) ) relationship. Getting (possibly) rejected makes me realize this even more and I don't know how to approach this mindset. 

For example, I started working out over a year ago after my first rejection and I like the confidence I have been developing from working out, but sometimes my personality shifts to the shy, introverted person who I was before. I had thought that if i got more fit I would be a lot happier and possibly in a relationship, but I'm not as happy as I thought I would be and I'm not in a relationship.

Is this normal? How can I change this terrible way of thinking.

I don’t really know what I did but I know it’s coming to the end. I think he’s ghosting. I was falling in love...

I struggle with OCD and depression. The last 4 months (before I met him) this newer bout of depression started. I’ve been struggling really hard to keep myself together. There are other life things that are going on that had made things a little ruff right now. I had been suicidal in the past, however I am not right now. 

I have made the decision that I need to be on anti depressants something that I have resisted for years but this depressive episode and spike in my ocd are continuously getting worse. I’m looking for advice on how I can try and keep a positive mind. Also how can I get over someone I was in love with but out of no where wants to end it. Thirdly, if anyone has been on anti depressants if they have any advice for me.

546,"I am on my way out of a job where two female coworkers have recently been promoted. Honestly, good for them -- I have nothing against them professionally, and they have good work ethics. 


My problems feel more personal, I know it sounds petty, but I feel like they're both treating me like an asshole for no reason. Let's call one H, and the other G. H and G were recently promoted slightly above the other shift workers, but are not managers. Basically we're on the same level but inner store politics dictates that they're slightly above me since my department is under the umbrella of theirs. I actually liked them before this too, and they encouraged me to apply for the job, so I'm not really sure what's going on except...


what's been happening is like the adult version of mean girls. When I first got the job, H &amp; G were friendly and welcoming.  Lately whenever I say hello, they both flat out ignore me. Every time I make a mistake, it's like it's the end of the world -- H outright mocks me to any male colleague who happens to be standing nearby, and G sends me death glares and then tells the manager. Now, I do admit responsibility for my mistakes. But G lurks in my department and then tries to micromanage me when my direct manager, L, isn't around, and L has been out sick recently. 



The unfortunate undercurrent is that I'd been mutually flirty with the head male manager, back when I worked in the other department, *before* he was my manager. We don't flirt anymore, we're just friendly and professional, but every time I talk to him both H &amp; G glare at me, talk over me, try to get me in trouble, and tell him flat out ""RR didn't listen to you! She did what she wanted!"" Most recently this was over a display I made, tbh it was aesthetically terrible, but G made it seem like I'd deliberately defied the manager's schematic and *ran* to tell him. Then she stood in the doorway of his office, blocking me from entering, and had a tantrum over it. Every time I tried to say something she would shoot me down and make it seem like I didn't exist. 

Meanwhile, when I went to clock out, I decided to tell the male manager in person for some reason. H was in his office too, and once she saw me she started OTT flirting with him. 

Every time I ask for help, G mocks me and is rude and sarcastic. H says ""I'm going to tell (male manager) you don't want to work!"" 

Please help. 


Other detail: I am in my 30s but look about 15 years younger with babyface. I am super friendly, and when I'm sad my male colleagues do things like bring me mini chocolates, tell me jokes, etc. If I need a heavy box lifted, they'll offer to carry it, etc.  I do have female colleagues I get along really well with, mostly from my old department, so I forgot how mean some women can be I guess.",31Dec2019,1

I decided not to since me and him had only just became friends again and I wanted to get to know him again. Shortly after a few weeks of being his friend I had built up all my obsession for him and I would draw pictures of me and him having a ""happy ending"" I showed him a few and he didn't think much of it. 

Then on December 10th at school I asked to talk to him. I told him that I was hurting myself because I felt like he was friends with me out of petty and I kept having panic attacks because of the past relationship me and him had . He said it would be better if me and him weren't friends.

I ran away crying and tryed to jump of the school bridge .at are school we have 2 layers and  the 2nd layer has 2 bridges going to plazas .

Teachers stoped me and I spent last lesson crying.
When I went home i told my mum I was fine.but I really wasn't. That night I planned to overdoese in the school toilets again and just lock myself in their till I died. I told my cousin about it and he told my uncle to tell my parents.

I had found out he had a girlfriend and that's why he stop being friends with me because he knew how obsessed i was over him and he knew I would hurt people to be with him.

The sad thing is I asked her for advice on how to ask him about before coming to r/advice . 

I had plans to either kill him or his girlfriend either irl or in my mind. It felt like to be normal again hr had to be gone and I had to start fresh .

566,"My wife and I are 29 and have been married for 5 years and have a beautiful child together.

Recently we were discussing some frustrations I was having with our sex life when she told me that she was raped her freshmen year of college. She broke down and said I was the first person she ever told this to. My heart broke as I listened to her story about some heartless piece of shit raping my wife at her first college party after she made out with him (only relevant because she said it made her feel like she brought it on herself.)

After she finished telling me what had happened to her, I told her I was so sorry, I told her how much she means me to me, that it wasn’t her fault in any way what happened to her and asked if there was anything I could do to help her heal. All she told me was that I need to stop making her feel guilty when she doesn’t want to have sex or seem sexually interested in me because it makes her feel powerless like it did when she was raped. I have since completely stopped any of that behavior.

Something to note is my wife has often had inexplicable pelvic pain during or after sex. She has fears of being alone almost anywhere along with a few other things that after researching the psychological effects of rape have begun to help me understand the causes of all this. 

I want to know from people who have been in either of our shoes, what, if anything, can I do to help her heal. How can I make sure that she always feels comfortable with me and make damn sure I never remind her of the guy that hurt her so badly? Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",31Dec2019,1

I decided I would go with IGCSEs for graduation, and taking the subjects Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English(First Language) and Computer Science.

However, I was planning to buy the books for these from the Oxford University Press, but they are ludicrously expensive for a person in India.

On an unrelated note, do universities discriminate for IGCSE or homeschooled students?

570,"So I’m 20 years old two years out of high school. Since finishing, the friendships I had during high school (including the ones I thought I would have forever) have all drifted to the point that I wouldn’t even call them friends anymore. I know that keeping the friends you have in high school once you leave is commonly difficult and rare but I thought what my friends and I had was more than that.
Some of my friends have shown during the two years out of school a few toxic traits that have basically demonstrated the fact that they don’t care for me as much as they did or really care about the friendship at all anymore. It really hurts and it hurt to the point that I even told my (former) best friend not to contact me until I’m ready to re connect because her actions were causing such a strain on my mental health (to be clear she never reached out anyway... the only reason she reached out the last time was because I asked her if I did anything to hurt her and to make her stop caring which she then continued to make up some bullshit lie about why we are not close anymore)
Going into 2020 I’m really trying to work on my mental health and I want to disconnect from my former friends as having them around or being reminded of how we once were literally makes me depressed.
I struggle to make friends because I have social anxiety so I can’t even disconnect from my former friends and be content because I have other people to lean on. I literally have no friends right now apart from my partner (light of my life &lt;3 ) and as I said it’s literally making my mental health shit.
I know it’s best to cut my friends out for now until I can reconnect when I am better mentally and when I can be friends with them without feeling shit about what once was. I know they were all together for NYE (thanks to the all so great social media) which I can’t be salty at because I literally told one of them to not contact me. I can’t help but want to check their social media’s (especially now because I know they are together all having fun) and to see what they are doing EVEN THO IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SHIT. I don’t want to block anyone because I feel like that’s too extreme and I do eventually want to reconnect. I just want to stop caring going into 2020 but it’s so hard!! Does anyone have any advice for me to be able to disconnect and stop caring about what they are doing and of they are hanging out without me whilst I work on my mental health? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Grrrghyhhhhhhhh",31Dec2019,1

So me and my girlfriend have been together for over 4 years and basically have the same friends. We moved out of town a while ago and this new years eve all of us (around 20 people) come together again to celebrate the new year and the birthday of 2 people.

577,"I'm 17, and my cousin is 20.

She and I never buy each other gifts because we instead always get money from our aunts (aka I get money from her mom/my aunt and she gets money from my mom/her aunt). We also live 3-4 hours away from each other, so because of that, we have never seen each other either on our birthdays, we just text happy birthday. Although I’ve known her my whole life, I have somewhat started getting closer to her since April, so I was thinking of coming to her birthday with a bus I can take (takes almost 5 hours but it'll be worth it).

Although I have money, I don't want to give her money because she already has a job, so it's not like she needs a little money from me. It'll be much more personal of course if it's a gift I bought and not just money I gave her. I find that lazy. I was thinking of buying maybe clothes for her, like pants or a shirt. However, I find that it would be really awkward buying girl clothes as I'm a guy, and well if I buy online, I'm going to have to explain to my parents why I bought it and I think that would be too awkward for me to explain, the reason being that I don't think my parents would like that I bought a gift for my cousin, as I've never done it before, and I've never bought a gift either for a family member before. I've only bought a gift occassionally if it's for a friend, however that's only rarely, and I even asked one of my friends if I was going to buy him a gift and he said he appreciated it, but he didn't want a gift. 

As for budget, I think I can go up to 60$ but I'm afraid that hell will break loose in the family then, as everyone will think I'm fucking crazy (though I think everyone already thinks that, but they're going to think I'm even crazier) for spending 60$ on a gift for someone who's not even my girlfriend (I've never been in a relationship before either). She also has a boyfriend already so he might also get pissed at me. The thing is though, I don't have a crush on my cousin at all. I think about her a lot, yes, but I don't have a crush on her. But if you think 60$ is too much I can go up to 30-40$ for a gift.

TL;DR What should I buy my cousin for her birthday? Her birthday is in less than two months, and she and I have never bought each other a present. I'm 17, and my cousin is 20. I can go for a budget on 30-60$.",31Dec2019,1

""This past semester has been the most difficult I have been through and this was reflected in my poor academic progress in all my classes. Unfortunately, I did not put in the effort needed for the material in class, and my attendance was poor due to not feeling motivated or engaged with the coursework and resolving to just study the material myself. I know now that I should have reached out earlier to my professors as they showed me, they were more than willing to provide guidance. I felt embarrassed and distraught to be so lost which spiraled into my situation because I did not want to admit I needed any help. The gravity of my situation eventually caused me to become depressed and I distanced myself further from friends, family, and advisors for about 3-4 weeks. Eventually, I reached out to some old friends and asked how they came to be satisfied and motivated in their current fields, I sought out my course advisor and professors, who while offering the best they could through make-up tests and homework they informed me my chances were slim. My inability to act quickly is entirely my fault, and this caused me to receive poor grades. I know now I can adapt swiftly when times get rough and I feel like I’m left alone to shoulder the burden.

During this Fall semester, I discovered a degree and career path I am finally excited to pursue. I realized neither Computer Science nor Economics were the right major for me. If admitted I plan to change my major from Economics to English with a minor in Math and Economics, I am confident that I am finally working towards a clear future for myself. I am more determined than ever to earn the bachelor's degree I have worked towards since my high school days. 

As shown in my academic history I have been very successful in keeping my grades high. I was able to with 17 credits and a combined 3.6 GPA. While my GPA has suffered greatly this past academic year, I know I can excel like I once did, but in a very out of character manner I allowed myself to lose hope in improving too quickly. I am now motivated to earn my Bachelors in English. Although this is the 3rd time I have failed to achieve the standards set for me, I know my plan for my academic future will make this the last time I am ever found lacking as a student.

Going into the spring 2020 semester, I have a plan to visit the Writing Center no less than 2 times a week, once for a personal appointment with a tutor at least once to work on class materials and activities but with close guidance rather than attempt independent study which has not worked well for me. I also plan to report to my academic advisor every Friday to review and discuss my weekly performance in order to quickly address any shortcomings and build on any successes. As for my Economics courses I will allot 2 hours weekly to meet with my professors during office hours to review the syllabus as the semester progresses and formulate study plans to build upon, eventually creating a habit I will not break. I will also adopt this practice to a lesser extent for my English classes to clear up any misunderstandings that may arise in the syllabus. Since I have found a career path to work towards with the help of my professors and especially my advisor, I know I can no longer afford to become lazy or discouraged with my work, as the only one I will really hurt is myself

I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter and it’s my hope that you will see from previous good standing that I can perform as expected. I genuinely regret my actions and apologize for not meeting my obligations as a Great Dane. I am ready to take responsibility for my failures and I am prepared to do what it takes sincerely hope you will consider readmitting me.""",31Dec2019,1

583,Ever since I gave birth a little over a year and a half ago I have had bladder problems. I feel like I have to pee most of the time and it becomes very urgent to even if i literally just peed. I feel like I need to pee even right after I pee. I can’t even comfortably lay in bed because I just feel like I need to pee and am getting up every minute. It’s extremely hard to go on car rides because just after a short period of time I need to pee really bad and we don’t want to stop at a gas station every little bit. Right now even i’m just laying in bed feeling like I need to pee bad when in the last 30 minutes i’ve probably gotten up to go to the bathroom 15-20 times. I will start counting how much i pee a day but i wouldn’t be surprised if it was 100 times or more seeing as how in just 30 mins I have to pee that many times. I have been taking medicine that is supposed to help and make me pee less and not have to pee after but it isn’t working all that well. It’s also ruining my sex life as when his penis hits against my bladder (which like sticks out more than it should for some reason it didn’t used to) and then i feel like i need to pee and it hurts and then he will keep going and it just hurts badly because he’s pressing against my bladder than i then feel like i have to pee. I used to be able to just have regular sex and live a more regular life but this is really bringing me down. I already have a lot of other problems but this is the hardest to deal with. It honestly makes me have suicidal thoughts because I don’t see why I’m alive just to have to pee ALL THE FUCKING TIME. all i do is irritate people with how much bathroom stops i have to make and all that. my boyfriend does not understand and he thinks i’m just not attracted to him anymore and that’s why i’m having problems with sex. i try to explain but he thinks i’m like lying and he doesn’t understand. Is there a type of surgery I can get to fix this? Or what can I do? Someone please tell me what I can do to fix this i’m literally desperate. I often cry because of this and I think it’s a horrible way of life it’s become a huge problem and I don’t know what to do. Please and thank you,31Dec2019,1

So, me(19F) signed a lease and moved in with my friend(20f), and was supposed to be there for a year. Since we signed the lease, my roommate has always been at least a month late getting me rent, and she still owes me money from November, and the money she owes keeps rising. Not to mention her girlfriend has been living at our apartment since their FIRST DATE!

I have not been at the apartment much, been staying with my boyfriend because my roommate and her gf are incredibly disrespectful and show no initiative to pay me back, and her gf doesnt pay for anything, and neither of them ever cleaned or did anything. 

Forward to now- This has been going on since August, and I am getting realllly sick of it, plus she has been getting more and more mean with me, and has been taking advantage of how much money i make for my age. So this past weekend I moved all of my shit out and in with my boyfriend, and she said she would sign me the paper to break the lease, and now she is backing out. She said she isnt gonna pay half and break the lease, she wont sign me off of it, and her gf wont sign the lease to get on it, so I am at a loss of what I can do. I could get all the evidence I have together if I had to take this to small claims court or something, but I am trying to avoid that.

592,"Not really sure why, but when it comes to happy or sad concepts and things involving other people, I cannot feel the appropriate way that I'm supposed to or would like. Instead, it's more of a subtle desire TO feel those things, but it's not the actual feeling itself.

For example, the typical person could hear about a kid dying of cancer, or a veteran coming home to see their kids, or a family divorcing and splitting up, or a loved one dying, or anything like that... and I don't feel a thing. Someone I've known for a long time could come up to me and tell me that their mother has died, and I couldn't react appropriately. Like, I just don't feel the sadness. I might try to ""mimic"" the appropriate response, or just generally try to express what I do actually feel (such as following their statement up with a question), but I don't feel the pain or sadness they do, even if they're crying their eyes out and hugging me.

It's not that I don't want to feel these things, it's just that these emotions are typically an uncontrolled factor that you can't really generate, and I just... can't. I feel like it would be way better for me to engage with people around me if I HAD the appropriate reactions, but I just... don't.

On a bonus note, when I was way younger, I did have some traces of feelings, but only with certain personal issues. Like, if we had to get rid of my cat, or if I saw a video of a dog being put down, it would hurt me internally. Now, I can watch a video of a dog owner comforting their pet as the thing happens, and I don't feel any legitimate thing out of it anymore. It's like I died spiritually.",31Dec2019,1
593,"So my brother just turned 21. He has his 3rd baby on the way by his second baby momma. He has been at my house for a week because she kicked him out. He has been staying with us for a week now. No vehicle. No job. 

I can't stand him for many reasons and I also try and think of everyone as perfect that doesnt need ""fixed"" and now I'm faced with this challenge of not constantly wishing my brother would get a reality check or get his whooped or get some fuckin help. 

For starters he has ADHD. So he is high energy and annoying as hell. 

He constantly talks about women and hoes. Either in a sexual manner or just disrespectful saying women are stupid/crazy. When he is actually the stupid ass crazy one. We got back from vacation and I literally had to tell him ""we don't fuckin care"" because I was tired of him telling me and my bf about all his hoes. 

He was in foster care &amp; boot camps a lot growing up. Because of domestic violence against our parents. Life at home was actually much better when he was away, which is sad to say. 

He is a prick with a capitol P. If he doesnt get his way, he is quick to attack people verbally and burn every bridge he has built. He just did that with his new baby momma, after telling us a few days ago he almost had her convinced to let him move back in with her. 

I wouldnt have even let him come but only did because it was christmas eve. 

We left for vacation on thursday night and before we left we deep cleaned the house so we can come home to a clean house. I came home to a sink full of dishes on sunday night. Told him to do them. He didnt. Monday afternoon come home said something. Didnt do them. Last night before hed I said something. Woke up, they're still fucking there. If I come home and he hasnt at least washed his own dishes he accumulated while we were away I'm going to kick him out.

595,"Let me start off by saying that my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now and by the time of this situation, we will have been together about a year and a half.  My parents like him and trust him.  

Every year the seniors at my high school rent out a motel and go down the shore after prom for three nights.  There are always drugs and alcohol.  Months ago, I asked my parents if I could go to the motel with my friends this year, as I am a senior, and reluctantly they said yes. While I totally want to go to the motel for a little while, My boyfriend and I agreed that the idea of partying for three nights is not appealing.  We decided that we would rather rent out an Airbnb close by so we wouldn’t have to pay a fortune and could still have fun in the daytime.  As we were looking for an Airbnb, we stumbled across the most magnificent Airbnb one could even lay eyes on.  It could have come right out of a movie.  And the cost of that Airbnb per night is less than half of the shitty motel down the shore. The only catch would be that it’s an hour away from the original motel.  We decided that we would rather spend time at that Airbnb than the motel altogether, but after talking to my mom, she advised that we stay at the motel one night and the Airbnb the other two nights.  At this point, I was shocked she said yes to the Airbnb.  While my boyf and I would be 18 by the time of the prom, it’s out of character for my mom to so readily allow something like that.  Still, she said yes and we discussed it with regularity for weeks just so I could ensure she was not going to change her mind.  She seemed perfectly ok with it.  Today, months after my mom agreed to let us go, my parents confronted me and said they are not comfortable with me and my boyfriend spending two nights in an Airbnb together. They said to cancel the trip and that they would rethink allowing me to go to the after prom at all.  This all came out of nowhere.  At this point, I’m hurt because I had already been told I could go and anxious because this is an experience I have been looking forward to all of high school.  I’m an effort to compromise, I told them that my boyf and I could invite more friends so it wouldn’t be just us alone and that we could stay there only one night as opposed to two, but they seem dead-set against it.  When prom rolls around, I could lie that I’m staying at the motel when I go to the Airbnb, but my parents track my phone and will probably figure it out.  How should I go about convincing my parents and/or getting my way?  Also, am I being irrational for thinking this is a good idea in the first place?",31Dec2019,1

Our...friendship has been on and off. If I’m being completely honest I wish I never met him so I want to leave him back in 2019 that’s where we started our friendship and that’s where it will end. He’s brought so much change to me mostly bad. It was very toxic. Not the friendship you think.

598,"Hi everyone! 

I am engaged to a man from the US. We spent the past few christmases with his family and had an amazing time. His mom is so sweet. Such a good person. My fiancé and I are getting married in June 2020 in Montreal (we're both men if that matters), and both of our families (mine, from France, his, from OK) are coming to celebrate with us. 

The thing is I never had a real mother figure in my life because my mother was always uncomfortable around me and was twisted in many ways. She bullied my siblings and I when we were kids and severed all ties with us when we became adults, which probably was for the best anyway. Nobody speaks to her or visits her anymore. It does feel like a void sometimes. I don't want my biological mother to be my ""mom"" though, it's just that this box is empty for me. 

My future mother in law calls my fiancé and I her ""boys"" and her ""sons"". Never in a creepy way, it was always very sweet. She is very good to me, and I feel very grateful to count her as a family member. When we're with her, I am 100% myself and it feels natural and good. I told her how I felt about her when we left and it made her cry happy tears. 

For now, I call her by her first name. I asked my fiancé if there was another name I could call her and he said ""what about Mom?"". Apparently, her former son in law (married to her daughter, before they got divorced) used to call her mom and she would love it. 

I don't think I'm ready to call her mom, though, or would ever be ready to do so. I think it's cute and all, but my relationship with my mother was always stressful and difficult, and I would prefer not to go there. I'm not sure why, it just feels like mom is not the right word. 

I would love to find a name to call her that would signal that she is my mother in law and that I love very much. I am sure she would be thrilled if I called her by an affectionate name instead of her first name. I'd love it if you could give me suggestions? Thanks you guys!",31Dec2019,1

I'm starting to see patterns in her relationships. Her ex boyfriends all hated this habit of her. Right now she, as a 30 year old with one child, is madly in love with a guy that is also showing signs of irritation to her habit. They are in a relationship for now but I don't know how long it will be. It would be very painful for her and my nephew to see this end. How can I tell/warn her about her part in this?

603,"First of all English is not my first language so sorry for any errors.

So there is this girl i really like even tho we havent even met in real life yet(i tried but she is not ready yet) but we call eachother quite often and she sends me videos, voice messages and pictures of herself.We constantly talk every day about a lot of stuff wich includes personal stuff. I'm quite dense when it comes to stuff like this but i truly think she likes me aswell but she still has strong feelings for her ex, she told me that it was not a healthy relationship at all but i did not ask for the details because i want her to talk about it whenever she feels comfortable.

She told me that she needs time for herself to deal with her life and that i should just try to surpress my emotions. This is very hard, they just slip out sometimes and that seems to really upset her wich in turn upsets me. I tought that i could maybe make it easier for her to heal but this proved impossible and she does not want this either. Sometimes she says stuff that normal friends would never say to eachother and other times she goes off on me telling me we have nothing and i am nothing to her right now. i'm really confused.

I have been really thinking about my situation and how kind of pathetic it all seems. Why do i feel this way? I went out the other night just to see if my feelings are for her or if i just wanted attention but talking to those girls really was not the same at all. Before i talked to her i was super anti-relationships and actively turned people down for dates and such but that all came crashing down on me and with the situation i am in i feel really pathetic. I haven't eaten something proper in like 4 days, i lost 3 kg and everytime i do eat something i get sick.

I asked her if she even wanted to forget about her ex and she could give me no answer. I tried surpressing my toughts but every day i think about why i like her so much while i know she can't like me back right now. And whenever i think that i should just give her time i think about how long it will take for her to heal if ever and i will be stuck here with my emotions and i truly do not know how i will deal with that.

There are a million toughts going trough my head every day and i don't know wich one is the best thing to do. Do i push trough this and hope that one day my feelings will be answered? Am i just kidding myself in thinking she likes me? Is it best to just try to distance myself from her and try to heal my own feelings? I think about these things and more 24/7 and its killing me.

604,"So my “friend” who I have a crush on. He would piss me off and that leads me to delete his Snapchat. And stop texting him for days. Then he would text me after like weeks of weeks of no contact. Just saying hi. That grinds my gears because I’m trying to forget him and get a break. So I say hi back then he asks how am I. Then I say how I am. He’s just starting a dumb conversation. That was the most interactive HES ever been. But the other days go by he’s dry as the desert. So that makes me confused. Sure he could’ve m been tired that day and the other one in a good mood. 
After he finds out that  deleted his snap he would tel me to add him back (he knows I will) so I do. This has happened 7 times already and he gave it back to me. The amount of times he did it boggles my mind that he even put the effort.  
I’m just his back burner. I deserve better. He only texts me when he needs something now. I’m not happy in this relationship. I told him that I feel like shit when I talk to him and he just said okay.

612,"Bothered by my boyfriends dog:(

I hate that I even think this, but I get sensory overload by my boyfriends dog. He had her when I met him and lives in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. She stays in a (large) cage while he’s gone to work. There’s no way she could be left out for that time. Sometimes he comes home and she’s forced her way out, destroyed his trash and drug everything across his bed. I didn’t wanna sleep there knowing she could have been covered in piss on the covers. The landlord doesn’t know she’s here, so he hasn’t paid the fee (broke server surviving week by week thing). Therefore she doesn’t get walked as much as needed because he doesn’t wanna get in trouble. And she is FULL of energy. Every time I show up he has to literally hold her down because she is shaking trying to get at me. He is embarrassed by it I can tell, but she is just not trained and doesn’t listen well. In the middle of the night she will lick and lick and lick to the point that I can’t go back to sleep because I’m hyper focused on it. And she chews her nails making them pop and I just cringe. She will bring each piece of dog food and chew it one by one RIGHT next to his bed at 3 am. 

Also, the dog hair is such a problem. In the bed and all over the floor. I know it’s uncontrollable and natural but I feel like I can’t walk around without socks. I don’t wanna sleep with my shirt off in his bed. I think about it all on the pillows and covers I use. And peeing is horrifying because I see her hairs on it and know she drinks out of it, so it makes me not even want to sit down. If the lid is closed, she will try opening it meaning the seat will loudly slam multiple times at 4 am until my bf says something. I just want to scream. I cannot live with an animal like that inside who isn’t controllable. I hate that I feel disgust when I am around her because I would never want to hurt his feelings by telling him this. He didn’t train her well and expects for her to learn how to calm down now. I do pet her and try to talk to her, but she has always stared into your soul and will not look away even at 2:30 am I am just annoyed... I want to not feel this way. I have told him that I don’t want animals inside if we ever lived together, but I’d never say “me or the dog”. I just don’t know what will happen. I have prayed for forgiveness for feeling this way towards her. I want to change and not be annoyed.

Why do I do??? I can’t make him pay for the fee and obedience training when he doesn’t have money to make rent. I don’t wanna come off rude I just need advice please.",31Dec2019,1
613,"Sorry if this is long, but I need to tell someone and get some advice and perspective. 

I am a young professional pursuing further training in my field. I met and fell in love with someone that is trying to make art work for him, but it has been a struggle for him. We got married in a courthouse ceremony this year, before he met my family, partly to help my professional situation. He moved into my rented room, but had some pets that came with him. Not ideal, but I didn’t want to ask him to give up his fur babies. In the few months he’s been here, it’s been a bit unstable because he has tried to devote himself to freelance work, especially since he had to return home for a month. He hasn’t been able to contribute as much as I would have liked, but this is partly due to the circumstances. 

My family just brought him on our family vacation with us, trying to make him feel like a part of us. This was also their first time meeting him. The first day they came down seemed okay, but when they came to my place, they were disappointed that it wasn’t as clean as they would have thought. They disapproved of all the animals there because we are renting a room with a landlord that has been a good friend of ours. Throughout the vacation, they have been cordial to his face, but to me they kept making jibes about how he’s been sitting at home playing games instead of working, they don’t like him because he’s not as social and not spending time with the family, that he looks dumb and they are embarrassed that he’s with me, and that he’s just using me. We may have skipped breakfast a few times because we were not hungry, but my mom took it as a personal attack that we don’t spend time with them. He did not grow up on the environment I did, and is just experiencing a lot of etiquette things for the first time. He’s tried to get them to like him, but he’s never going to be good enough for them because they only see him as a bum. 

Last night, when I went off with my parents alone, things finally boiled over. They told me to send him away, annul our marriage, or find a way to pay them back for everything they’ve done for me because they don’t support me being with him, even though our marriage will help me pursue better career paths. I spoke to him privately after and he had already applied to jobs that night because I had told him I needed some more support than he was giving. However, he intends to continue pursuing art as it’s what he’s passionate about. I just don’t know that he’ll be able to make a career out of it, and thus my parents would be right about him having no real aspirations for himself. 

I love this man, but I also love my parents, and it’s tearing me apart that he’s not what they approve of for me. I have tried hard to make everyone happy, but my mom told me she’d rather die than see me be with him. I’m at a loss. He makes me happy, had already has a job interview to make more money to help support us. But my parents will likely never approve of us because he is set on pursuing something they don’t value, and which he may never be successful in. What can I do?",31Dec2019,1

Kid (11)

So my brother in law is in town visiting and he has been playing lots of Fortnite on mobile. He got his xbox taken away a while back cause he did the classic rack up $700 in Vbucks on mommy’s credit card...

After hanging out with the kid for a bit I figured hey if your not active and your gonna spend all day being on your phone might as well go all the way and go full geek. 

Decided to give him my old gtx 970 and I started peicing together the parts. We got in a few hiccups with the cpu cooler and what not and it took 2 days to build it... technically like 5 hours total having to drill and make some mods...

The whole time the kid is just bratting out and expecting me to do everything. Everytime I look away and look at him he is rolling his eyes etc...

I called him out.... “listen man when I was your age I had nobody to help me build my first and it took me forever... and I did it when I was 8. Your 11 and you don’t know how to download chrome cast... here’s the computer I did most of the work for you now spend the rest of the night googling and YouTubing where the cables go...

621," 

My BF and I are both in our 50's. When we met 18 months ago, he told me that he had a 17-year-old son in another country. He met his son’s mother while she was in the states on a business trip from another country. After a whirlwind weekend together, they started a long-distance relationship. She was married when they met, in the process of a divorce. She told a sad story of a bad marriage and a very difficult foreign divorce process. He was sympathetic and continued to communicate with her. They met in person for the second time when she came to the states again, and she became pregnant during that visit.

He and the mother continued a long-distance relationship, through her divorce, and until the child was about 7 years old. They saw each other in person only a couple of times a year. The laws in her country considered her ex-husband to be the legal father of the child, so my BF spent about 6 years, spending thousands upon thousands of dollars, in litigation to establish paternity. 

Not long after paternity was finally established, she broke off their relationship as a couple. Since then, he has faithfully communicated with them both and made support payments to the mother, provided additional help when she was between jobs, paid for twice yearly trips to and from south america to have time with his son, and done everything possible to create a bond with him. He has kept things cordial with the mother and allowed her to basically dictate all decisions, even when they significantly impact his financial obligation (eg. sending their son to an expensive private school). 

Fast forward to last year, when my boyfriend and I met. At that time, he told me that after 17 years of being single-mindedly focused on bonding with his son, he was ready to date again. The boy was on the cusp of graduating from high school and becoming a legal adult, and my BF felt like it was finally time to focus on himself for the first time in almost two decades.

While I respect his dedication to his son, and I am totally on board with him continuing to help through his son’s college years, I am not so keen on him continuing to have a direct financial relationship with the boy’s mother after their son is of legal age. Am I wrong to want him to transition the mother out of these transactions, and to think that my BF should move toward helping his son directly, instead of through the mother?

My boyfriend says he loves me and wants a future with me. I can see having a forever relationship with him. We are very compatible, and I respect his doing the right thing for his son all these years. However, at this point, I am not willing to move things beyond a dating relationship as long as he is still financially intertwined with his son’s mother. 

I see the wisdom in combining our resources to enable us to have a comfortable retirement with travel and disposable income. But when I think of another 5 years of status quo, it's not acceptable to me. At this point, he lives in a run-down home and despite the fact that he is a good paying career, he has to Uber on the side to make ends meet so that he can meet the financial expectations of the mother.

I have no desire to impose my will on anyone, so I have kept my mouth shut. He does know that I feel that he should be moving toward transitioning mom out of his financial interactions with his son. Should I just end things with him? How can I talk to him about this in a productive way?",31Dec2019,1

I've recently been diagnosed with a heart issue that is operable but carries risks. Since I've known, it's caused me to mentally spiral down a drain where I think about my own death, the death of my parents or close friends, my girlfriend, how death is inevitable, etc. My parents are both ageing and nearing the last decade of their life. I've never experienced this feeling before- life suddenly seems so fragile and touch-and-go. I'm not ready to die and and I'm not ready to let go of any of my loved ones yet. Thinking about this distracts me from work and keeps me up at night. The past few days I've probably averaged 2-3 hours of sleep. I used to have no problems sleeping and I would be a generally happy and satisfied person- now, I have to surround myself with people and activities to keep my mind from wandering, and when I'm left alone to my thoughts it can get bad. I'm not suicidal at all- in fact the opposite!

Me and my mom have gotten really close and I have the most respect for her. I understand why she did what she did. The thing is, my aunt has always been spiteful to my mom. They’ve always had a toxic relationship. And although I love my aunt very much, she’s always tried to create trouble where it’s not needed (example: if my mom were hiding things from my grandparents she’d run and tell them) My grandparents have started to pick up on this and have called her out multiple times. One of the things she has done that I couldn’t forgive is give “evidence” from my moms past to my ex-stepdad in court to give him motive to take my little sister away from my mom and her older sisters who we are all 21-22 and live on our own. Although I know it’s not really solid evidence at all, I knew it just wasn’t right of her to do that. My little sister needs my mom, my mom is really stable and a good mom to her. I’m so proud of my mom when it comes to her raising my little sister. Now her custodial rights could be in jeopardy as he can afford better lawyers than she can. However he works long hours and she’s with strange people or doesn’t eat when she is living with him. He even bought a cat, knowing my little sister is very allergic and has asthma. My mom doesn’t like that where as my mom is now married to a great man, is a stay at home mom because she takes care of my twin sister who is battling stage 4 colon cancer (we’re only 22). So she has so much time for this little girl. 

So I pretty much had been avoiding my aunt because I’ve been upset with her. On Christmas Day (yes 6 days ago) my grandpa called her as she was Christmas baby because he was upset she didn’t show up to our Christmas or even answered their birthday calls. She answered and started talking about my mom and then mentioned my sister who has done nothing to her. And then she mentioned me. Having horrible things to say for no reason. Through out all the fighting I still tried to convince everyone to give her a chance. But when she mentioned me, I’ve never done anything that she was implying. That I’m a slut basically and that she knows my ‘secrets’ but I’ve only ever had one boyfriend of 3 years. I waited until I was an adult to have sex with him and he is the one and only person I’ve ever even kissed. And I live with him now and we are planning to be married soon. We both finished school, he’s a firefighter, I’m an esthetician. I got upset and blew up on her. I said things I should’ve never said to her. I just wish I kept quiet. It hurt me so bad when she was speaking on me that I let myself say those horrible things. 

I’m not proud of myself. I really miss her. But I feel like I’m betraying my mom, sisters and even myself if I were to talk to her again. I know people say you don’t have to forgive family, toxic people are still toxic people, but I never wanted her to think badly of me. I have prayed and asked God what can I do. Every time I ask I just cry. I can’t forgive myself. I should’ve listened to the holy spirit and just kept my mouth shut. I just miss her so much and I miss my uncle who is dead. So I have no pieces of her. Her daughters don’t want anything to do with her so I really worry about her and who she surrounds herself with. I feel like if I talk to her again my whole family will judge me. I’m crying as I write this now. I’m so scared as life is very short and I’ve had too many deaths (my uncles who hit me the hardest) this year that I don’t want to be petty and miss out on opportunities with her. But I’m sure if she’s had negative things to say about me then she’s already made up her mind about me.

628,"Sorry typing this badly as I can hardly see my migraine is so bad. I’ve had the flu for about 4 days now. Can’t eat, can’t breathe, coughing constantly. It’s just a horrible, horrible flu. My daughter is 2 and I’m not with her father. He looks after her one night a week. He had her last night. I woke up this morning and flu worse than the last few days. I messaged her father straight away and said he will have to look after our daughter tonight as I physically cannot do it. I’ve never been so unwell before. He said he has NYE plans tonight so he’ll be bringing her back as normal. 

I’ve had to cancel plans so many times to look after our little one on days he couldn’t manage it. I pay all her nursery fees, I let him and his family look after her on extra days when they check in advance it’s okay. I do everything. He can’t even have her for an extra night. 

Anyway my ex’s mother just came and dropped my little daughter off. She watched me struggle over to the door and have a huge coughing fit as soon as the cold air from outside hit me. She handed me my daughter wished me a happy NY and then got back in her car and drove off. I’m so angry I’m so unwell and I feel so bad to my little daughter. 

I have nobody else to call on for help and I can barely breathe or move round the house. I just needed some rest.

630,"Title doesn't quite tell the whole store. My girlfriends parents went through a very messy divorce about 6mo. Ago due to infidelity by her mother. Her dad is military and got transferred several states away at about the same time. For new years, we made the trek out to see him in his new place for the first time, and were surprised to find out that he had been dating another woman for almost 4 months. 

The issue lies not in the fact that her father moved on, but in the way things were found out. We were not made aware of the existence of this person, or her teenage daughter, until 24 hours before they arrived. They arrived on the womans birthday, and during a holiday period, and my girlfriend's dad kicked her out of her room so that the kid would have a place to stay. 

To aggravate the situation, last night I heard her dad and his new girlfriend having sex in the (very small) house, but I havent found a way to tell my girlfriend that in a location where we aren't surrounded by other people. 

My main questions are this: 
Are my girlfriend and I justified in being upset? We feel like a trap of social convention was sprung on us. 
Are we justified in just throwing our stuff in the car and leaving, despite the inevitable family drama ripple effect? 
What can be done to make the best of this?

635,"Today, my own sister slapped me twice just because I said things she doesn't like. And what makes it worse is that tonight is the new year eve.

At first it was my mom scolding me for my answer ""I don't know"". She said i shouldn't answer so irresponsible like that and mention how me and my sister lack of soft skills. My sister who was doing her make up got upset, she told my mom that has nothing to do with her. But then when my mom left, she started to go on and on with stupid life lessons and acted like ""she knows all"". I told her to stop since it disturbed me, plus she also said that the whole thing my mom was taking about has nothing to do with her. After that, she said I am a ""bad person"" yes, A BAD PERSON and I am stupid and I don't know anything and that's why she has to teach me. Then my sister threatened me she would beat me up if I continue to talk ""disrespectful"" like that. I was shocked, I don't know why she could think that she has the right to beat me up? And so I asked her if she would threaten everyone the same when they said the thing like I did. At that time, I was sitting one the floor, my sister stood right in front of me and point me right in the face, she said: ""Because I am your sister so I have the right to beat you if you disrespect me."" I was really angry when she acted arrogant and I talked back. Well, she only waited for that and the slapped me, I stood up and pushed her away but she slapped me again.

When that happened, my parents must have heard the sound and they stopped my sister. They asked my sister why she did that and she just said because I was not ""good"".

I am very sad and disappointed. I cried right after. I have never once thought that my own sister who is related with me by blood could do that to me. I saw her talking to her friend on the phone before she went out for the count down, she laughed, tried to act cute like a girl in her early teen, but she cannot treat her sister nicer and she called herself a ""decent person"" everyday. (My sister actually called herself a decent person not because I was being extra sarcastic)

What should I do now? I cannot just stop talking to her, we share the same home plus when this relationship gets worse my parents will be heartbroken. I don't want my parents sad.

Earlier this year during my final semester of grade 12 I completely stopped going to school due to numerous things in my life giving me pretty heavy depression. I am the type of person who doesn't get the best of grades but has never skipped a single class unless I was sick or had a doctor's appointment or other stuff like that. Because I stopped going I didn't end up graduating. I do plan to eventually do some online classes and finish up highschool but after that things are just... blank. I don't know really know where to go. I live in a tiny town I hate filled with people I also hate. I want to see the world and live in all different kinds of places but I only work part time and make crumbs, escaping this place feels impossible. I want to live a good, happy life but everything just seems black. My mother is forcing me to go into post secondary as soon as I finish my online courses but I don't know if I want to do that. I don't have any desire to go to university and if I did I have no idea what I would even do there. I've been trying really hard to figure it out because university is expensive so I want to have it figured out before spending the money but I don't know, the desire just isn't there. I don't want to go back to school, the environment has only ever been a negative experience for me.

I dream a lot, I have a lot of things I want to do. Most times though if those dreams aren't shut down in my own head then they're shut down by someone around me. I've lost all motivation to pursue any of them, I just don't care anymore. But I WANT to care, which is just so confusing. I have zero motivation for anything and I hate it, I want to do things but I can never force myself to do those things and I hate it so damn much. I don't know what do about it, what to do about anything. It feels like life has hit a dead end, that I'll never be able to do what I want, that I'll never be happy with what I do or who I am. I don't want life to be this way but I have no idea what to do about it.

We've had our differences and we've both had our moments, but I'm finally becoming close with them again (although I was never really distant from my mom) and it feels like the missing puzzle piece to my life which I've slowly been rebuilding after some really horrific events. Basically though, ever since I was maybe 11, my mom has been telling me secretly that I'm her favorite kid. I have an older brother who means the absolute world to me. He's one of the sweetest, funniest, most considerate and genuine people I've ever met and I can't even imagine how I could be viewed as better than him. I think that I practice a healthy amount of self love but when you're referred to as a favorite over your literal childhood role model, the person you've always looked up to, it feels...like you're a fraud. It feels like she just doesn't understand that I'm very unaccomplished compared to him. He worked his ass off to get into NYU and is now making a living off of what he loves and is in a healthy relationship with lots of friends and a good social life. And don't get me wrong, I improve every day--I just got my undergrad in psychology which is my passion and I work hard at that, and I have some friends although I'm much shyer and more introverted than him, and of course I have some strengths that he doesn't (and vice versa), but I still feel guilty being referred to as a ""favorite"" over him. I feel like I'm lying somehow. Ever since she started saying that I feel so guilty whenever I'm around him. Of course I would never tell him, that would just hurt everyone, but it's such a burden to carry and I can only really ever talk about it in therapy. It's a secret that's killing me which might sound melodramatic but it REALLY damages a kid's development to be told that they're the favorite, it usually results in them having a lot of guilt and low self esteem as they feel they're at fault. I've spoken to her about it but she won't listen and insists that it's harmless because every parent she knows has secret favorites and she loves both of us very much so that's all that matters.

669,"As I take my last bite of chocolate cake of 2019, I plan to lose weight (again) in 2020. 

Some may laugh at this: thinking of the common ""new years resolution"" stereotype: where people say they'll lose weight, go for about 2 months and then give up entirely. But i'd like to think i'm different as I have gone to the gym in the past and was seeing considerable progress.

The problem? Between my impatience and gradually increasing busy schedule of college, work, etc. I either didn't have the time and if I did, it was the last thing I wanted to do. But seeing myself start 2019 at 70kg and ending the year at 90kg, I knew I couldn't put it off anymore.

Planning ahead here: going to go to the gym 4 times a week and intruding the treadmill everyday as opposed to just cardio days. But a big factor in weight loss is dieting: I've cut of lot of things that are REALLY unhealthy (use to eat a bag of 5 doughnuts once a week) and plan to drink exclusively water, which is pretty much what I do now. But there is one problem...my diet is still pretty bad.

And the main problem is...I can't eat vegetables. That may sound stupidly fussy, but i'm being serious: any attempt to eat vegetables results in me either throwing up or my throat closing up when attempting to force myself to eat it. It is so bizarre: I know it's good for me and I want to eat it...but I can't do it. I'm in my 20 and watching me eat vegetables is like the shittiest episode of fear factor.

It seems to be a ""I burnt my hand on the stove before"" effect: it look disgusting, smell disgusting and tastes disgusting when I first ate it, that when I go to try it again my mind goes: ""well, it looks and smells just as bad as before, why would it taste any different?"" and thus said symptoms happen. Fruit isn't a problem, but that's a double edged sword because of how many fruit contains lots of sugar.

I know it's possible for me to still lose weight with my diet; iv'e done it before; that plus gym was how I weighed 70kg at the start of the year. But I know I could see quicker and better results if I could just conquer this (for lack of a better word) phobia and eat the right things. My diet is carbs and meat (thinking about going Quorn; it's a meat substitute that's I actually like and is better for me) and that's also partly because there's not much else I can eat if I continue to cut myself off from the fruit and veg food groups.

TLDR: Want to lose weight but diet isn't great. Fruit is fine but attempting to eat veg makes me either throw up or close my throat instinctively. I know this is stupid and want to change, but don't know how: can anyone please help me?",31Dec2019,1
670,I worked on a successful project in which I was the only female on the team. We all got a small bonus for our hard work. In the meeting that my (new) boss gave me the bonus he mentioned that everyone else “got a bit more money” because they worked on a particular part that simply doesn’t apply to my position. I was too shocked at the moment to say anything but the more I think about it the more pissed off I get. Is this normal? I can’t help but feel that the reason I didn’t get the same amount is because I am a female.,31Dec2019,1

I have to stay here in this dreadful office for 11 hours though with no one here..( it's a bad area around here too so I'm paranoid) I don't think it's fair. I'm struggling significantly with my mental health. I have to be here at 7:30 am until 6 pm but I came in the office late a few times and got here at 9 am cause I barely get sleep from my nightmares and hallucinations. Today I came in late (I'm not doing anything but answering phones and sitting here for 11 hours and answering phones to angry patients that want to see the doctor but can't because he won't have another doctor cover for him when he's gone on vacation) but my boss was here before me (he's supposed to be on his vacation still) and he is angry and had a ""talk"" with me about why I'm late and hired here.

674,"Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

This may be my one and only post I'll ever make. I just feel like the Internet can give me better advice and help than anyone else at this point.

I've gone through a lot of stuff that I can't understand really.

I've lost the most beautiful person I've ever known like some years ago (6 years now I think). She was my best friend and my only friend when I had none. I've never been the popular kid in school or anything like this. I learned what mobbing is since I was 6 I think. When I was 10 I got in the same class with this one person (I will just call her GIL from now).

She liked me from the beginning (as a friend) and we eventually become BFFs real quick. Like the mf A-Team. We tried to hang out a lot, but as we got older I had to change classes. We were not bothered by that. Still hang out a lot, still were BFFs.

I left school some time after, and started to work as a salesman. And from one day to another, she never wrote back. Unfollowed me like everywhere u could imagine. I tried to contact her, but I never got an answer. I've tried real hard, because I loved her, but never had the balls to tell her. Then some day, I got a message on IG from her boyfriend to leave her alone...thought I wanna die knowing she got a guy who was not me...

Some months later, I started dating a Girl. Lets call her (GF). I fellt good about the relationship I was trying to build with GF and we started to be a real couple. 4 years ahead we are still together.

Now the bad part: I love GF, i adore her...but GIL never went outa my mind over all these years. I never felt like GF would be ""more right"" for me than GIL if you can follow me with that one.

GF never was that kind of girl, that would party hard or anything, she was vegetarian and cared about everyone. But over all these years I realized, that she is getting more and more of a real bitch. She never cheated or anything, she never would I mean she really loves me. BUT since 1,5 years she is really going out alot with her female friends (I consider them alcoholics cause most of them drink each day like 10 beer and stuff like that, so real extreme).

I love her, but I don't love her in the way I always loved GIL?!

I argue with GF a lot about her drinking like a hole and going out a lot. She is taking time for everyone but not me. Her family also hates me for beeing someone who cares about saying the truth always... They are a family that is controled by women and if I as a man try to say something I'm not allowed to... But I don't let myself be silenced when something bothers me soooooo they hate me like big time!

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I want to be left alone from everyone. Over the years I actually got famous in some way. I now know a lot of people and have a lot of friends. But as I write this, nobody is here with me selebrating the new decade... not even my GF she is out getting drunk with her girls again.

My best friend is going out with someone else and none of my +15 close friends considered to ask me going out or just to hang out together tonight. SO I just sit alone infront of my computer now and will eventually go out alone in a pub I know in town. Just somewhere where nobody knows me, to maybe find company.

&amp;#x200B;

The decade will end pretty soon and I now start to think of everything that doesn't work out for me. Bad job, GF i love but GIL I still want more than anything else who is not in my distance to reach her. And over all Friends who don't seem to be interested into me as a person...or just who forgot that I exist.

I don't know what to do from now on. I don't know how to handle my feelings, my life and myself...

Depression kicks in since Christmas, and I can only tell I don't wish anyone that feeling of beeing alone when you're not alone per se.",31Dec2019,1
675,"This year has been tough. It started with a break up. My first heartbreak from a man who I loved and thought would spend the rest of my life with. It’s been tough to get back on my feet and I still don’t feel like myself. Although it’s been tough I’ve had some blessing, started my dream career, my mom received a kidney transplant and a few other things but the breakup is still weighing me down. I just feel lonely, feel like I won’t find love again. I lost hope. I recklessly gave my heart to a man who didn’t know how to love me and I’m still paying for it. God did I love him but after 2 years he never said I love you. He treated me great but I guess he never felt that way. I was so blind I thought he would get there, I put more Energy into the relationship hoping he would fall in love. It was stupid and I learned a lot but gosh my heart is still hurting. As the new year comings I am DREADING it. I need my heart to stop hurting, I need to move on. I need to find hope but I’m struggling.

679,"One of my work resolutions in 2020 (besides not get fired :P) is to be less emotionally affected by negative interactions or negative people. I'm 25 years old and I work in a male-dominated profession. 

Some of my coworkers have terrible social skills (in my opinion) and sometimes say things that come off as rude, discouraging, or disrespectful (even if that was not their intention). This affects me way more than I would like. Perhaps it's because of the power differential where I feel like as one of the more younger/junior people on the team I feel powerless, or maybe it's because of gender, but I've realized that I let it get in my head way too much, to the point where it affects my life outside of work.

682,"I feel that my friend, let's call her Susan, is using and/or taking advantage of me. Here's why:

1. I often take Susan up to our family cottage, which is a good 2 hours north of the city. We split the cost of food and we buy our own alcohol. I drive because she doesn't have one. On the drive back to the city, I stop for gas. I expect her to pitch in to pay for the gas, but the last couple of times she hasn't. When I asked her to pitch in for gas, she was astounded and said, ""Why? You were going to go to the cottage anyway."" She gets free use of our cottage, has ""free"" transportation (I paid for the car (and there's no need for a rental car), pay for insurance and maintenance, etc.), so I feel the least she can do is pitch in for gas. She doesn't buy anything special (like a treat or bottle of wine, etc.) for us to share.
2. When Susan goes out of town for several days, she'll call me to ask if I could take care of her two cats. I have my own set of keys to her apartment for this reason. So, every couple of days I take time out of my day, drive to her apartment and check on the cats: provide them with food and fresh water, clean the litter boxes, clean up cat vomit, and spend a little time with them. She doesn't call to say thank you, she doesn't do anything to show her appreciation (for example, give me a bottle of wine, take me to lunch, etc.).

Am I being petty or am I wrong to expect something in return for the things I do for her? She doesn't go out of her way to do anything for me. Is it time for me to drop Susan as a ""friend""?",31Dec2019,1

685,"Girlfriend (20F) of over three months broke up with me (22M) over phone. Need support/advice on moving on please

It was over a dumb argument. I was watching friends. Rachel and Ross break up episode (btw her name is also Rachel and my name starts with an r). On FaceTime I was telling my girlfriend that cheaters are terrible people. She said she thinks cheating is terrible but cheaters aren’t necessarily bad people. This caught me off guard because that’s not how she sounded before. I asked her why she’s talking like that. I messed up and asked has she ever cheated on anyone/would she ever cheat on me telling her I don’t understand why she’d defend cheaters and that usually cheaters are the ones doing the defending. But I made it clear to her that I trust her and know she won’t cheat on me and that I was just thrown off guard.  But today she said she doesn’t think either of us have fully moved on from our past bad relationships and broke up with me on the phone. 

She was wrong I’ve been over being cheated on and I did trust her. I have adhd and my first reactions arent always the best. But I never insulted her. She didn’t give me a chance  to reply. Short phone call.

I sent her some texts saying I love her and she’ll do great in life blah blah, no insults or guilting. But I’m broken. I wish we coulda broken up in person. But she hasn’t replied when I asked if I can come drop her stuff off and say bye in person. I’m not gonna go uninvited but I really need closure.

She was so kind to me. She was beautiful. Cooked for me, paid for my food when she knew I was low on money. We were so perfect. I never felt this way from a relationship. Everything seemed great we constantly talked about how much we loved each other and how perfect our relationship is. She gave me my first Christmas gift a couple day’s ago because my family never celebrated Christmas. I’m not that attractive. I’m a bit out of shape. But she was beautiful and still loved me.

My best friend has never been great at making plans (family issues that get in the way, strict parents, etc). We’ve known each other since 6th grade (we’re first years in college now), and are super close. The problem is that she hardly contacts me anymore. I know she cares deeply about me, but in September she stopped responding to me mid convo, fast forward to the beginning of December, I reached out and just told her how I was feeling and that I missed her, and she just said hey love you, a lot has been going on, but can we hangout soon. A week or so later we talked again and she said she was busy and may not be able to hang out, I said ok. Last week I texted her asking if we could FaceTime before Sunday just to quickly catch up— no response. Last night I sent her “:(.” And.... Nothing. 
I don’t want to be told to drop her, because although I understand where that advice is coming from, I value our friendship and I know that she does too, but I quite literally can’t comprehend why she won’t respond, even just to say, “hey I can’t talk now, sorry.” So yea I guess I’m just looking for some hope?

691,"Male here.

Basically, my friends have a friend that is my sworn enemy, they like him and have fun with him, while he insults me all the time, most of the time he insults my family, the way how I look, but my friends don't seem to care about it and are laughing from his jokes that are all based on me behind my back.

Even I never met him personally, my friends did, and I know he doesn't live very far from the city I live in.

When we play games, we talk on discord, but my friends also play with him quite some time, and I always just leave the channel when he joins, In fear of hearing another insult. So, my friends have decided to create a special channel for me, that my enemy couldn't enter, but I and my friends could.

But today, happened something that killed me inside. They removed this channel to, as one of my friends said, ""Face my weaknesses"" I tried to explain it to my friend, that I hate this person and no matter what I won't become friends with my enemy, but my friend didn't do anything and instead he now calls me ""Paranoid"" like it's my name.

Every time I enter the channel to talk, my ""friend"" says ""What's up, Paranoid?"" or ""Hello, Paranoid!"" and I can't stand this.

I am very weak mentally, and I can't take the insults ""on my chest"" 

Now, I can't play with my friends because this asshole always joins when I just want to have fun.

I don't have any other friends rather than them, so if they turn against me, my social life will be completely dead.

Sometimes, occasions where I mess up real bad, I have the intense craving for someone to be there for a hug or a good cry. It's honestly fine, but I just feel a little disappointed that everytime I fall, I have to get back up myself.

So ive been required to withdraw from university twice now. i'm currently upgrading my highschool classes and planning on going back next year to finish my degree but... im scared to face my academic advisor since i feel like such a failure lol. can anyone tell me how bad this looks on my transcript?!! thanks for reading guys",31Dec2019,1
703,"So I fucked up. I didn’t go to college. I was really smart in high school, well that’s kinda a lie I was pretty average with 3.67 GPA so I had a good future ahead of me. However school gave me incredibly bad anxiety, as school got harder I would stay up all night doing assignments and homework. I use to be the “gifted” kid and now I was struggling. The only time I got attention was when I did well in school so if I did bad or was average I would obsess over it. I had a therapist at the time who told me my behavior was incredibly unhealthy and took a long time for me to understand missing one assignment wouldn’t be the death of me. Well I decided to become a hairstylist and that I didn’t want to go to college. I didn’t want that type of pressure and I’m in the alternative scene so i though perfect I can become a hairstylist which is easy and I can still look “different” without any issues. Well fast forward to when I’m 19 and I just didn’t want to be a hairstylist anymore. I saw the over saturation and abundance of girls just like me. How many girls didn’t have a job and found a second job anyways like working in factories/hot topic/or any other common job while having loans to pay back for hair school.

I’m 20 now and feel like the clock is going to run out soon. I still don’t want to go to college because I’m incredibly intimidated and have no idea what I would be interested in. So my question is what should I do? What jobs do you guys have that didn’t require a lot of school if any? Or if you think I should go to college any advice? What are you guys studying and hoping to work as?",31Dec2019,1
704,"I graduated this year with a BBA in Econ and Im starting to research the Masters &amp; PhD programs that I would qualify for. I also have an AA in Social Science and I know that I dont have enough math courses (or skills) to pursue a Masters or PhD in Econ. Im not really sure if I really want to backtrack and spend time taking additional math courses that wont count towards the next degree. 

Some other programs that I have looked into are for Behavioral Economics, Public Service, Public Policy, and Health Research. I always wanted to work for the BLS or the Fed but now im leaning more towards Healthcare because of the unexpected economic changes that will impact our lives as more baby boomers retire and life expectancy continues to increase. I have ideas and want to help shape the healthcare industry through this dynamic time. 

Can anyone out there provide any guidance with choosing my Masters and/or PhD program?

708,"My life is a mess right now. I quit my job last minute to help my sister and father after some surgeries. My sister is pretty abusive and I knew I could not live there long term but they needed my help. I found out through this ordeal that my boyfriend was cheating on me, so I had no place to live and no job.  So I moved back home until my sister's treatment of my father got too much. I said something on his behalf, got beat up and left.

Then I realized that my previous employer is giving me terrible reviews which is preventing me from getting work.  One very angry former colleague was screenshot I my Facebook posts and texts to her trying to prove that I was crazy throughout this difficult year. She sent those to leadership. So I'm having trouble finding work and scared she will ruin my career. 

The only room I can afford is in a condo with roommates. I'm finding out that some of the roomates may use drugs. If they get caught, that could end my career with children. 

There is nothing else I can afford right now, as immloving off of savings nd money I make from food delivery apps. There is one other room in the home of a mother with four children. Her husband is overcoming an addiction to heroin and should be gone for the time I'm there, but who knows. It also sounds like an unpredictable living arrangement.  I plan to continue searching for work and am taking a college class to go back to school. I need a quiet place to study and keep looking.

I literally do not know what to do. I can't afford any more than this and I can't find work. Does anybody have any ideas on what I should do? Out of the 2 places, where should I live?  Most of all, how do I not be resentful for all of this? I am a good person and I think the lesson of the year is to not fall on other people swords. I may have left my work early, but I don't deserve to be treated that way. I was an amazing worker. I'm really tired of unstable people and I just want my life to be better again.

711,"This year has been chaotic for me and it’s all stemmed from my friend (let’s call her Amy) 

So me and Amy have been friends for over 6 years now. And I’ve helped her out with everything. She deals with a lot of mental health issues and so does her mum. So I was often around hers for days and weeks on end helping her and her family out. I essentially became the unpaid maid and nanny to her youngest sister. And I never asked for anything in return.

Amy was in a long term relationship with a guy (we’ll call him mark) for just over two years. She decided to cheat on him with 2 guys (at the same time) for just over 6 months. I knew all of this and kept it secret as I was (foolishly) fucking one of the guys (we’ll call him jack) 

Amy eventually started to get hurt by the guy she was seeing and told me and jack about it. We told her to stay away from him and that we would keep her secret. But she kept going back to the point where I felt so angry and sad and worried that she had gone behind everyone’s backs again and still saw this guy even though he nearly killed her. I then told mark (her boyfriend) what was going on because she was going to land up getting herself either extremely injured or killed. 

That all came out in March. And for the next 6 months I tried to help mark and Amy repair they’re relationship and they both still loved each other and didn’t want to leave. 

While all this was happening I was having my own issues with jack who turned into a cunt but that’s another story, as well as dealing with college and home issues as well as Amy’s family issues. I was emotionally strained. But I never stopped helping her out or her family. 

After everything came out friends started to leave Amy and because I stood beside her they also left me. Which hurt a lot as my best friend of 8 years left because he hated how Amy treated me and couldn’t stand to watch me get hurt.

About 3 months ago mark couldn’t continue his relationship with Amy as he just couldn’t trust her and it made them both unhappy. Me and mark became good friends over this year so I was one of the people he told before hand and to get advice from. 

After they broke up Amy’s behaviour changed towards me

She never wanted to meet me or had time for me but she met all of her other friends so I was a bit hurt. So me and mark started to hang out more. As we were both in need of a close good friends as we both deal with really bad mental health

But Amy didn’t like that and threw many accusations out way 

And I tried to explain to her that she never saw me and the only two friends I had were her and mark. (I deal with trust issues and social anxiety so I find if difficult to make friends) and I found out recently that she’s actively avoiding me and is afraid of me

It just feels like a stab to the heart given everything I’ve done for her.

Any advice would be great

718,"So my parents are divorced. It was a nasty one, and for the last 14 years since they've been \*still\* spreading rumors about the other and more importantly, for 10 of those 14 years, they used my older sister and I as weapons against the other. 

Anyway, ever since I got into high school I finally told them to stop their shit and so far it's been nothing other than surface level name calling and again, still extra drama that tells me that neither of them got over this fucking divorce after 14 years. It's annoying as shit so I finally talked to my dad about it (I used to live with my mom but then I moved 2 states away to be with my dad) and he tells me that he hears these rumors from my mom about stuff that I tell her about my life, which she then twists and makes her look like a better parent when it really couldn't be further from the truth.

I want her to stop. Because my dad has slowed down on this shit after he remarried while my mom has been married for the better part of 5 years and is still spreading rumors throughout her family about me, my dad, and his parenting. I've told her already that I don't appreciate it, but that was like a year ago, so I want to make a really firm statement and remind her that she's not as important as she thinks she is, and to keep my dad, stepmom, and stepbrother out of her mouth for good.

721,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.
I was babysitting my fathers partners kids, and her oldest daughter was with me. We had a few drinks and kissed, we are not step siblings, as our parents have not married. But it still felt wrong, we were about to do more but we decided it was fucked up. We’ve both sworn nothing happened. I have not told anyone, and neither has she. I know she won’t, as her mother is disappointed in her enough for her behaviour with boys and her mother would accuse her of trying to split my father and her up. And I have the advantage, her mother favours me almost, and because of her daughters mistakes with men, her mother would believe when I say she came on to me, which she did.

But I can’t shake the feeling they know, or they’ve been told, and it’s making me so anxious, I know I can deny it or tell them she hit on me, as I would be telling the truth, and Ik that makes me seem like a manipulative piece of shit, but I know I won’t have to say that as I’m 100% certain she won’t tell parents. But I still can’t shake the feeling and it’s making me so anxious, the thought of it makes me feel like a humongous weight pushing down on my chest. Luckily she lives with her father 2 and a bit hours away and we will rarely see eachother, and we continued the evening like nothing happened, so I know we have both adopted the story of nothing happened, it still makes me feel horribly anxious.

I really don’t like being dependent on them, since I’ve spent most of my life just sitting in my room doing nothing. It’s so lonely and depressing. I don’t want my parents to see me that way, but it’s also the way I feel like I need to live because I have no self esteem and I have serious trust issues when it comes to getting close to people. I don’t even really know how to make and keep friends in the first place, and I feel like being here isn’t helping me at all.

725,"So... my mom has been cheating on my dad since i was around grade 7, one time we were at a part and my aunt video called my mom to greet us a happy new year and a merry christmas ?this happend around 3-4 years ago(?)) My dad saw the text which read ""hey hon, how are you?"" Fast forward to present. Then they ended up fighting, my mom is working abroad and told us thay she will be back here on January of 2020, later did we know she was home on December 23 (2019), we didnt know this until 25th of December. My dad found out that she was with her ""male mistress"" (i dont know the term for a male who took anothers wife) now he told me (in our native language so this will be quite hard to translate) ""son, your mom has moved to here ""male mistress""(as from before i dont know the term) so im asking you, is it okay if i bring a girl here? Also im packing up your mothers stuff, if you want to go with her i will also pack up your school certificates and other stuff"" i just stayed silent because i dont know what to say.

727,"I have a friend that just isn’t putting in the effort in our friendship anymore. Every time I talk to her about it she makes an excuse and I just accept the excuse, but I’m tired of that. Should I keep trying and straight up confront her about putting in more effort or should I just stop trying?

Background- I’m a High school senior and she graduated last year and is currently in college. I was super close to her and all that stuff and I thought she thought the same too, but lately she’s been putting in way more effort to hang out with another High school senior who 8’m also close with. And she’s been texting and calling and hanging out with her everyday, but hasn’t been making the same attempts with me.  Now you may be thinking this is just good ol’ jealousy (and I will admit, I am jealous, but I mostly try to keep that all to myself), but every time I text her she either never responds or just doesn’t carry the conversation, every time she says she’ll call back she never does, and she never even asks to hang out anymore, and if she does all the plans are last second and I don’t end up going.

I’m contemplating just ending it because it’s just really tiring to be the one putting in all the effort, and it just really, really hurts to see her happier with someone else. Whenever I do confront her about it I just take the excuses she gives me cause I suck at questioning and being assertive in the moment (I do question what she tells me but thats after the conversation)

So what should I do? Keep trying to improve the relationship? Straight up end it? Three strikes you’re out? Could really use some help rn

I know anxiety is an overused word, but I struggle not to have panic attacks. I also struggle standing up for myself at times (both things I am working on).

Essentially I’m on the hook to do an additional job for the next four months. I’ve done the job before, but only over summer (two months). It involves leaving work mid-day three times a week and making up the hours at my main job by staying later. It also requires me to be very strict with my schedule and deal with people in a near-retail sense, and do public speaking. I hate it, I’ve done it before, I hate it, and I’m trying to figure out a way to get out of the mindset of hating it.

This isn’t a sob post. A lot of people work multiple jobs, I’m aware. I have this job because I didn’t know how to say no. I have a ton of anxiety about it and am really angry with myself for not being able to say no, and to start off 2020 with four months of this.

732,"So this is my first advice post, so forgive me for formatting, and lack of detail. I'm just at my wit's end. I lost sleep over this bullshit.
TLDR at the end- but try and skim through please. If really appreciate it. 


Me (24F) and my boyfriend of six years (34) are currently sharing a car. We have had a lot of bullshit come up in recent years that have been prolonging the car getting fixed/ getting a new/second one. We are also moving very very soon. We are running out of time, but plan to get this damn oil leak fix by next week finally. 
My dad works in parts, at a car dealership. He recommended I bring it in on my day off (yesterday) so his buddy could take a look at it and give me a parts quote. 

Long story short- this turned into a fucking Dr.Phil session. I asked for a damn parts quote, not a life lesson on finances. Both of them, mind you. Getting the finger from a stranger, and my dad at the same time. This fucker even tried to get religious on me, and I cannot stand that shit.

Fast forward to 7pm, everyone is home. I call dad to let him know I will be looking elsewhere to get this done. And this started an EPIC 4 hour, argument, and I mean ARGUING, how we did when I was a kid when I got grounded for trying to cover up a bad grade. 

This somehow turned into my dad pointing fingers at my boyfriend. How he should be stepping up to take care of the car, and how he should be more cautious of my safety. How he things I'm going to start smoking cigs because of him, that he thinks he drinks too much and doesn't want me to turn into my mom. (Which I'll admit, our first three years together we drank A LOT. but we have absolutely better ourselves since then, TOGETHER. Like a strong couple should.) Pressing on me that I deserve better.

First- they have no idea how much of a saint my man is. Idk what I'd do without him... I never drive the car alone. He takes care of me, the house, my cat. He's replaced the majority of the small-ish things in my car. (Serpentine belt, battery, lights etc.) Him and I have come a long, stressful way in this life, and this new year we can finally say we grabbed life in the balls and said 'fuck you'. We got this, we've only gone forward rather than backwards. We both have never been this happy honestly. 

I understand dad is being a dad. I'm his only daughter. And he's done a lot for me of course. And my boyfriend. 
But this is an A &amp; B relationship, not A B and C. 
We cooled off for an hour, and I called back to apologize, cause that's my dad and I'd die if anything happened to him after that terrible argument. But now he expects my boyfriend to call him soon, to have a man to man talk. That they've already had before. And for what?? A fucking parts quote??


Am I over reacting? I lost sleep over this shit, and my dad is ever so stubborn. I know he won't change how he feels, but it put a strain on him and my boyfriends relationship now.  And ours. We were really fucking close.

I need some advice for some of my OCD issues I’ve been facing for quite some time. For example, I have a hard time wearing certain clothing, certain colors, and even my glasses. I relate these things to bad events, or that a bad event is going to happen. For instance, I wore a pair of khakis and found out I had been cheated on, when I try to beat the OCD and wear them again, I found out the cheating was 100x worse than I thought and had more bad news. For my glasses, I got broken up with when I started wearing them. I tried to rewear them and got into a huge fight with my s.o. Last, I will not wear certain colors if I’m like oh that day this happened so I can’t wear blue or that specific sweater because I found this out or something like that. I have other things too but thought this could get the convo started. Please any advice? It sounds silly but it makes getting dressed so hard and my anxiety skyrocket. I had to throw those khakis away (I liked them I just was so terrified because bad stuff kept happening I had only wore them twice for instance).

Edit: Other things that bother me like I can’t delete apps even if I don’t use them. I hate downloading new ones even if it makes my life easier. If I absolutely have to I’ll download it and delete or download another one and delete that too (something about 2 means that I like reset? Idk guys plz help this sounds not good!!)

766,"Hi, I'm a 17 year old high-school student currently working a job as a dishwasher at the local bar and grill here in town. I was pretty excited to start my job, initially. But, over-time, like all other jobs, that, ""newness,"" fades and I'm increasingly dissatisfied with work.

I'm one of the fastest and best dishwashers from everybody's feedback, but I'm extremely unhappy with my job. I work about 4 days a week from 5PM to 12AM. Yeah, it's only a 7 hour shift for 4 days a week, but I just find myself not even enjoying the money I get out of it anymore.

I'm the least materialistic person you'll meet. I don't spend any money and money brings me no joy. So money doesn't really make me satisfied with what I'm doing at work. I try to find ways to motivate myself such as, ""Oh, I'm helping out the restaurant to serve people with food and drinks because they need dishes for that!"" or, ""Oh, at-least there's people here to talk to!"" but It's hard to think that when your caught up in the monotonous and repetitive slave work of just mindlessly washing dishes. Now, don't get me wrong, I am grateful. Because I do know there are kids in third-world countries doing ACTUAL slave work up to 16 hours or more a day.

But working these types of low-end American jobs brings me to the realization that I HAVE to either go to college, trade school, or do something that I will enjoy doing instead of HATE doing.

779,"Just a short preface, I have a very bad relationship with my parents because they put me through years of abuse, they deny abuse, and use me any way they can.

So I work in a church as a janitor. My youngest brother is getting married this week, and the 2 families are doing a rehearsal dinner at the church on Thursday. My mom reserved the part of the building they would be using. The way reserving the building (or parts of the building) works is somebody is supposed to get a key to the building, then return the key to a drop box after the event. A part of reserving the building is cleaning up after yourself. There's even a 'responsibilities for using the church' paper taped up in the kitchen, which will be part of what my parents will be using.

So, my mom has told me that she wants me to let people into the building, and that they will intentionally leave the building a mess so my coworker and I will have extra work to do ""for job security"".

I just clean, and I don't really mind letting people into the building, but I'm not alright with my mom trying to pull strings with her connections and using me to get into the building. Apparently, she did not get a key to the building, so I texted her the number of the administration guy and told her to call him to make sure she got a key. I also texted her a picture of the 'responsibilities for using the church' paper that's taped up in the kitchen and told her to check #3 &amp; #4, which say to vacuum and take out the trash.

I talked to my coworker (also a janitor) and asked what she does when people want into the building. She said that she ignores them for the most part, except for people that she knows work in the building, because it's her responsibility to clean, and not to let people in. Her reasoning is because anybody that needs into the building will already have a key and won't need her to let them in.

I've already given my mom the number of the guy who can make sure she gets a key. I don't want to let her into the building if she's clearly stated she's going to intentionally screw me and my coworker over by trashing the place. What should I do?",31Dec2019,1

Alright, this probably isnt the place to post this, but here it goes. I've been contemplating getting a small rifle. I have a lot of trouble connecting with my conservative friends and co-workers. Lately, I've been promising them I'm going to purchase a gun and go out shooting/hunting with them. Honestly, I think firing off a few cheap rounds might help me blow off some steam, as I'm constantly stressed.

Now, I'm a snowflake(pro-gun control, gender police, accommodating of other races/faiths, you know... all that radical stuff us libtards do). All of my liberal friends think me owning a firearm is insane, because unlike my conservative friends, they know about my issues with depression and suicidal thoughts. They're vehemently against me making this purchase, and are already acting weird and distant around me because of this. I'm thinking of buying a small Ruger 10/22 rifle, not a handgun or something I would be a serious risk to myself with.

I know the decision to buy a gun is mine alone, but it's been tearing me apart the last few months and I can't come to a decision. Any advice would help.",31Dec2019,1

Starting out with architecture she found out that it just wasn’t for her at the end of the semester then switched over to civil engineering and again finding out that wasn’t for her with the only reason for her joining civil engineering is because it pays you a lot of money even though she hates doing math and calculations. Now as we move into the 2020 spring semester she switched majors into law which will hopefully be the one for her as she always had a thing for reading and has good memory. Yesterday she confessed to me how she’s so tired of not being able to do what she wants due to her overwhelming attachment to her family, first she wants to be able to give herself a good title so her parents can have something proud to tell their friends since reputation is something they care about so much, secondly she wants to pull them out of their current financial situation, they are drowning in debt and falling deeper as they try to borrow more money from friends and other family in order to pay for the house, third she is so tired of living up to people’s expectations, everyone sees her as the smart genius woman who’s always so bright and happy in everyone’s life but in actuality she is someone so broken and tired, everytime people come up to her telling her how she’s so smart, how she’s so happy all the time, how she managed to get scholarships at this and this college she would feel so devastated because that’s not where she’s at right now. Receiving a scholarship is one thing but keeping it is another. Her GPA has dropped to where she had to pull herself out of academic probation and right now she’s still struggling to pull herself out in order to be accepted into the college department for law (i forgot how they called it). All of this is so devastating for her because she feels as if all her 17 years in grade school, all her hard work in high school had come to nothing. When she came into civil engineering, she didn’t feel motivated to do anything, to even come to class and she told me how she realized later that saying that she wasn’t feeling motivated was actually an excuse for her not feeling passionate about school anymore which is so mortifying for her because school was everything to her, she was the one person genuinely excited to go to school but now she feels like such a disappointment to everyone and to herself. She lost her scholarship and in order to pay for it she has worked so much whenever she can, working the holidays, working double shifts whenever she is able and even working on her own birthday. Not just me but everyone of her friends beg her to take a break but she just won’t because she can’t with the situation she’s in. She’s so tired and pushed to her limit and i’m so worried for her. Already, she’s gotten into 2 car accidents that totaled both cars because she was falling asleep behind the wheel. I don’t know what to say to her to help her in this situation or what I can even do because Im just a kid in his senior year of highschool so all I can do is wait and hope for the best that a major in Law is for her.",31Dec2019,1

Or just stay home and get stoned like I do most nights of the week.

787,"On Friday, this friend of my boyfriend and myself (22f) was throwing a ""party"" at this bar for his birthday. Originally we planned on not going due to a clashing crowd but in the end my boyfriend and I met up with our friend. We met at about 4:30 to grab a quick drink and to play a couple games of pool. Once people started showing up at 7 the plan was to head home.I'm a drink and a half into the evening and everyone who showed up was being civil with one another. We decided to stay. 

At this bar, they have two drink size options. I got shorts. I was trying to get tipsy but definitely not drunk. I had a total of 3 drinks and one shot. I had stopped drinking by about 8. Or so my boyfriend had told me because I don't remember a damn thing past 7:30. Nor did I remember what happened for me to wake up in the hospital.

Now of course, I know what you're thinking. ""You were drunk, you blacked out."" Now I'd take that answer any other day. I rarely drink to get drunk, there's not much I enjoy about it to be honest; but it eases my social anxiety. So I sip my drinks. To the point where they're watered down from the ice. 

So my boyfriend stayed at the bar while I got a ride home. I left any time between 10:30 and 11. My friend had brought me into my house and even layed me in bed. When I woke up in the hospital I was told that I was found banging on one of my neighbor's door in my underwear, telling them I was home and I just wanted to go inside. Of course they took me away, luckily in an ambulance and not a police car. 

So if you haven't figured out my issue yet, I have no fucking idea how I blacked out between 8pm and 6 the next morning. From 3 drinks and a shot? It just doesn't sound plausible to me. How could I lose what..11 hours? I might just be paranoid but could I have been drugged? Are paramedics required to tell you if you have been? I don't know, like I said it might just be paranoia but I've had such a feeling of uncomfortably since. 

And yes, I've quit drinking.",31Dec2019,3

She's getting a lot more into pseudoscience than ever before, too. My partner is an organic chemistry professor, and he's tried to explain that no, GMOs are not going to make us all mutants, but she's believing the pseudoscience over a PhD.

805,"Hello,

My mothers lives in rural southwest VA, alone.  She is physically and mentally unwell, and is on welfare.  My dad went to prison a few years back and afterwards my mother began taking in strays.  She's not the brightest and now she has somewhere between 30 - 50 cats.  They are actively breeding, destroying her house, pissing off the neighbors, and draining the small amount of money she has.

I need to get her out of the house--she is not able to take care of the animals and has finally agreed to separate from all but 5 of them.  I live in Richmond, 5 hours away, and am having a very hard time helping her.  My family and I have called every shelter, organization, charity, etc. in the state and no one can help us.  I can get all the females spayed for a reduced rate, but this does not solve the problem.  We need to get her into gov't housing or to live with a relative, but the cats need somewhere to go.  They're impossible to adopt out, because who the heck needs an adult unvaccinated cat?  

Many relatives are threatening a mass DIY euthanasia.  I'm willing to euthanize if it's done through a vet, but otherwise it's a nonstarter.    

In the meantime the cats are actively reproducing, the numbers are growing, the house is becoming more uninhabitable, and the cost is going up while her health is quickly declining.  

I tried to help for a while but it was too frustrating.  Now I have some free time and it would be amazing to be able to figure something out so we can all move on with our lives.  

Is there anything that can even be done?

810,"I just started thinking now that we only have one chance at life. Were so used to think “next time” or ill get another chance.”  I realized that when it comes to things like a career there is no “next time. You either try to do it or you dont and then you die. The thing is I want to become a full time youtube gamer and i feel i have to commit to be able to do it. Before i thought “i would never be famous” or “it would never work out.” Now im thinking “ill never know if i wont commit and i only live once so i need to take risks.”
My best plan I have is to go to a trade school, get a job that will pay well, try to live on my own (or hopefully my family will move to a house that can have a room perfect for private recording. We do plan on moving soon. Plus they dont mind me living with then as long as i pay rent), and work full time while also building a channel. Im not sure if im being too optimistic but i really feel with time and hard work I can do it. Ive seen channels that started 3 years ago (not too long in my opinion) that have a good amount of subs. I could be one of those channels. I just have to be patient and work hard. I also think that i will get subs because everyone is drawn to someone. You the reader has had at least one freind. They chose YOU out of anyone around them because you have something they like. It could be that your very nice and sweet, very bold, very sarcastic and smartass. I have something.

This year we talked very little and I didn’t really pursue any interaction. Yesterday I texted her for advice about something and made a joke that we should try to talk again (which we haven’t done in like 4 months). She said sure and we talked. Now she is very outgoing and crazy (in a good way) so we talked about what she should have for breakfast and she went on and on about putting makeup on and blah blah blah. Then we somehow got into talking about her current “bf”, who is more of an FWB, and how she’s really not happy with him. And this was something she hasn’t told anyone else yet. So I talked her through what I think she could do and how to handle him. So this was really private in my opinion so I found it odd that I’m the first one she’s talked to about this. And finally we were kinda goofing around, talked about weird kinks (idk why), and then out of pure curiosity, I randomly asked if she ever had a different hair style. She has pretty long hair and it’s always curly and I just blurted it out for no reason. She then sent me like 7 pics of herself AND 2 booty pics, cause she was just swiping through her phone I guess. I then sent her some picture of myself and my brother and the first thing she said was that I was cute, which was pretty surprising to me. Then when we were about to hang up, she said she’d definitely call me back soon. Which I found odd cause we haven’t talked for like 4 months.
I mean I guess I’m wondering if you think she’s trying to “say” something to me? Or I’m just overthinking this?

TLDR: Called my ex, talked about her current BF and how she’s unhappy with him (I’m the only one who knows, sent me booty pics, called me cute, and said she wants to talk soon, even though we haven’t for months. Weird vibes?

I finally had sex with him and got comfortable with it and realized how much I liked it, and started to figure out things I liked, and then it's like he stopped wanting to have sex with me as often and stopped trying.

We only have sex like once every couple of weeks no matter how much I try for more, he just always seems disinterested. We only have sex in the missionary position and it doesn't really last that long, and I don't always finish - sometimes neither of us do. We don't talk about sex either, and it's not that *I* don't want too it's *him.* 

I guess my question is, what do I do? I want to explore sex more but how do I get him on the same page?

I had a really long phone conversation with him while he was waiting for the paramedics last night where I told him about a tiny bit of my mental health history so he knew I understood, which he seemed to appreciate.  I'm going to the hospital on my lunch break to try to encourage them to keep him as an inpatient for a little while, because I doubt he'll seek help for himself when he gets out. I really want the best for him but I don't know what I can do. I don't feel like it will really hit me until I see him in hospital, but I'm devastated. Any advice is appreciated.",31Dec2019,1

829,"I sit here again on a roller coaster that this man provides to my life and my children’s life.
Right now in order to keep him calm I have given up child support and now he is coming in for more custody as we have a 40/60 split I have the 60. I’ve posted about this before and I’ve often gotten responses like “50/50 is best” and “what’s the big deal”.
Many years ago this arrangement was made by a judge, I spent my life savings trying to change it I ran out of money and got a legal ruling to allow the children to have mental health counselling as he would not agree to their mental health help, and I got a few orders to keep him at bay, away from my work, etc. He has an anger problem, he is emotionally abusing my children (my teenager has a bed wetting problem due to trauma) he will put fear into them religiously about “end times” to a point one of my children was running away from school to find me, right now I’m dealing with talking them down about bad spirits making things come to life that’s the newest subject they have been forced to hear. Their father tells them grim scary stories of the Middle East, he is extremely racist and shows them YouTube videos of be headings and war crimes that they are forced to watch. He will tell them he is going to put “Mommy in jail” and that my father, their grandfather who helps us is the devil and will die soon. He has made comments eluding to what stressed out men do when they have to pay child support- “kill them selves or worse....the children”.
My youngest will not see a counsellor now because she is not allowed to “keep secrets” from her father, this list will go on for days, my assistance that I need is how in the hell do I prove any of this, our laws are so lenient in my country and I’ve seen the court system it’s so very generic and sad. And here I am once again with a pile of paperwork that he was put together asking for more custody and a permanent legal reduction in child support. They are not filed with the courts, as he wants to do this privately probably because child support is law in my country, so legally I have no obligation to even read them, this roller coaster is ridiculous how do I stop it as he won’t let up.
Also we are not divorced due to him not agreeing to the previous custody arrangement and signs everything “your husband still”
If I could run away I would, but I’m a stable parent with a job and a duty to make sure my kids have some kind of relationship with their father but at what cost?

831,"I eat at the same chain of restaurant fairly often during work and with the family.  

They are a franchise a step above fast food and I generally love their food.  Some locations are not as consistent in the dining experience; customer service, quality of preparation, cleanliness of the restaurant, and overall hospitality.  This especially effects me because the one closest to my primary office is the worst.  

I visit weekly and get the impression there's some poor managers.  Interestingly, I have been there when someone from corporate was on site and it felt like I walked into a whole new world that day.  He was sitting in a booth with the owner at a table and the owner was stuffing envelopes with what I think were responses/coupons regarding poor surveys.  This positive vibe ended by my next visit.  

Every visit, I am given a receipt with a code to enter a survey.  I never give my information for contact and I select the option ""do not contact me.""  I have been as direct and honest as I can be, but I wonder if I'm having a positive effect on anything.  I don't want to hurt anyone, or get people who have no control over the situation punished.  I honestly would love to see this place improve up to the standard of other locations.  I also worry that since I'm a regular they may catch on that I'm giving them bad survey results.  My order is somewhat specific and the receipt could be tied into the results.  I don't want to end up enemies with the people.

834,"Now wait a second before you call me an insensitive prude. Hear me out first then feel free to call me out. My friend has always been really great as a person and friend and I love them so dearly so not being around/being involved is not an option. This friend has been through a few long term relationships and all end in about the same way. (Always big drama that involves every one of their acquaintances, friends and family in on the current events). They’ve been in and out of schools and jobs and is very much a free spirited wanderer and recently self proclaimed introvert. The reason I say self proclaimed is that this is the friend that whenever we talk is always telling me what their other friends a-z thought about their discussion on the same topic with them. Friend is constantly traveling to see these many friends which I find great as it makes them a very good and hard working friend in my view. My struggle is that I am very much introverted and keep a lot of my struggles to myself and just deal very differently (not the issue as we are all different in many ways) but I do find it annoying when people have to go around to so many people for council on their problems, at times I would be with this friend and they would end up spending half the time on the phone with at least three different people trying to catch them up on the recent drama they (my friend) is experiencing. Fine, I just feel less inclined to share my thoughts or shoulder as it is diluted in a sea of others. Again, wasn’t an issue as I don’t take my help/advice as gold anyways. That all being a bit of backstory to the brewing frustration. More recently my friend has had themselves diagnosed with ptsd after a member of their church died by murder/suicide and a person from school (not a friend of my friend, just a fellow student) died by suicide in the same year. These are people she had never mentioned before is close friends or even as people she knew but maybe she really did know them, I might just be too cynical. More recently (much after ptsd diagnosis) my friends grandma also died who she was suddenly very close with and I do feel a lot of sympathy for this loss. Other factors in her diagnosis are childhood traumas. Now...I have been through a lot of similar struggles and we often relate and are solid in encouraging each other through hard times. They have absolutely been there for me and are often times the first person I call when shit hits the fan so I really do feel a bit gross that I’m being so belittling of their pain. I do absolutely feel for their grief and sadness over certain situations but I just feel it’s going so far as to be a bit attention seeking. I don’t know if it’s really just a difference in how people deal with things that I’m so different from them and that’s what stresses me out or if their need to constantly talk about and share the issues with anyone and everyone in any situation for any reason is something I could/should bring up honestly as a concern that they are dwelling on their struggles rather than moving forward. The most recent and kind of last straw was it being brought up to my grandpa. They had never met but found a way to put it into the conversation during a very brief meeting and a five minute conversation when I brought this friend to Christmas with my family. (The friend proceeded to tell me on the drive home how invasive his questioning of the ptsd was and I mentioned to her that if I meet people willing to put this kind of person information out in a conversation I assume they are open to talking about it). This had not been a quick and sudden action, this has been how my friend acts since I met them six or more years ago. 
The reason I bring this up as something I struggle with is I don’t know if I just keep supporting, believing and encouraging them through all of it and keep my cynical mouth shut or if I bring these concerns up to them at all. I don’t know much about ptsd but I also suspect it has become the new mental disorder since depression is now so commonly thrown around as so many people struggle with it. Is there something to ptsd that I should know to be more sensitive to? Is there a character type that just heals better with this kind of mass broadcast of their struggles?",31Dec2019,1

840,"Hi, 

Happy New year everyone 

I see people living somewhat fine. Yet, we are in an expensive country that pays salary very low. People literally surviving paycheck to paycheck and no way to save up. I am investing my time and myself here for a better future but then, everyone is caution me of how expensive it is and how economically bad the situation. I personally dont want to leave as I cannot move elsewhere that I settled here for now and in process of paperwork, but again, I am having anxiety of “what  if” 

How do I deal with those thoughts and fears? 

Its like an entrepreneur investing everything in a business that in a risk of fail.  What if I failed? 

I know many countries are expensive and people could be doing horribly living on minimum wage. The same is true for Latin America. 
I can imagine someone being well paid in Singapore but its too expensive to survive so either way his/her salary are gone as well. 
The same could also be true to someone in Japan where even if the wages are high, the living conditions are equally high as well. 

Here, we are expecting a salary of $500 per month and deal with all the costs. While it could sound like a joke. Taking into consideration housing, food, transportation, and other expenses, its the economical level in this country.

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",31Dec2019,1
852,"
I am looking for advice, so please read the whole thing. Warning: it may be lengthy!


I have had many crushes in my life, as I am sure many of you have as well. I have never actually been able to carry a convo with any of them, and I was always super intimidated to talk to them, and scared about being judged by them.

So I have this crush at work. I am 17 so this job isn’t *the* job I will have forever, so if we do end up dating (unlikely, but what I am striving for) it won’t ruin work for me. 


Anyways, I would like to start by saying that she is sorta new. She started at the beginning of december I believe. I really didn’t think much of her. When she started we never spoke a word to each other. Never. Until literally yesterday. I was hanging out in the back since it was a slow day, and she came in and actually spoke to me, just talking about the weather. I was surprised and stunned since this is unusual for me. I have never had a girl that has come up to me and spark a convo. Well, it wasn’t really a convo, more like a quick chat that I could’ve kept going but she caught me off guard and I didn’t have much to say. 

When she spoke to me, I instantly crushed on her. I don’t know what it was about her, but I just did. I spoke to her a few other times that day, but nothing big. Today however, we spoke *a lot*. And it wasn’t just me starting the convos either, she was too! She came up to me a few times today and started talking and what not. We haven’t talked about anything outside of work yet, but we did talk a lot! I don’t know what it was, but I wasn’t scared at all! In fact, I felt very comfortable talking with her (Might be the fact that she ping ponged back too).

The thing about this is I am very reserved and shy at work. I don’t talk with others that much, but I am somewhat talkative to her. I feel like she is gonna start telling her other coworkers that I talk to her a lot and they’re gonna tell her that I don’t talk to anyone and then she’s gonna put two and two together.

Where do I go from here? How do I keep this ball rolling? What signs/cues should I pick up on if she is into me?",31Dec2019,1

854,"I realize I mentioned during Thanksgiving that I would like to move out in 6 months time, you could say my mind is a little bit racing back and forth on what kind of decisions I need to make.

To start off, the reason I would like to move out is because I fear I will lose grasp on my own well being. My parents, I feel, fear me moving out, or fear me implementing some sort of space. When I mentioned to my mom that I need space, while I do not blame her, she mentioned someone in her past told her that and it was a bad experience, and that it traumatized her. She told me she could not help me, that I'm the angriest child out of all, and trying to get me out of Buddhism and into Christrianity, I'm convinced that this is not healthy anymore. I do not blame my parents, but I am convinced this isn't a healthy relationship

Choosing a career, my mind races back and forth. I need room to explore what I think, but I can't. I feel judged, smothered, blamed, and overall unstable. On top of expressing my political beliefs, which I believe was a mistake, I fear that it is difficult to think or be alone without indulging in sensuality, the type which I have been exposed to addiction (i.e video games or fast food). I would rather be studying philosophy, learning how to bake, pursuing music and composing. I try to, but fear sets in and it no longer feels satisfying. For example, I remember an instance where my mother called what I'm doing weird. I was doing a self help exercise on finding out what kinds of people I dislike working with and I thought it was really clever. Being away for about a year has given me the realization that I am in control, that I have freedom to cultivate and implement my beliefs or ways of doing things, which have worked quite well for me. But ever since x moved on to live with y in z, I had no choice but to move down, I felt. I am grateful that x was supportive of my decision to move out and house me. During that time I was pursuing college and was doing great with a good GPA. I felt extremely proud of myself for going out of my way to complete the course with an A-.

But among all things, I fear that I will choose a career that won't be right for me, based on the circumstances of trying to 'escape'. I fear that I will hurt my parents, family, and ultimately everyone in the process for becoming distant and sheltered into my mind.

I've taken steps to work specifically night shift at Grocery Store, signed up with a personal trainer for 6 months - in the presopisition to alleviate my core body strength and mind, got in contact and have been talking with a counselor, and I've made sure to achieve distance without scaring my mother, by going on hikes, but I fear this has turned into a form of escape and I no longer feel it as a form of release, as it felt like in. Homestate. In Homestate I felt like I could attain space much easier, but being here with my parents it's harder, perhaps because I have changed so much since the last time I saw them. I fear that they can say or do what they want to me because they have paid for so many things, house me, and I'm only working a part time shift. It's very easy to feel like I'm the one that is toxic and ungrateful, which I have thought to myself to be true multiple times.

I apologise if there were any emotions caused by this. I would not like to think of this as 'this is a crummy situation' but more of 'this isn't healthy for me or my parents. For our relationship- to continue living like this.' I try and have a contructive reasonable outlook on the future, but I fear that living with my parents will become an obstacle of what I think is best for me. I fear this was a mistake to move down, and that it will only get worse if I don't do something now. I am truly grateful for the car and the financial support they have given me, but I cannot tolerate knowing they will actively fight against my beliefs on what I want to do in the future, I feel.

Thank you for being so supportive, I feel relieved to hear that someone in the family is supportive of my decision to empower myself the way I want to!",31Dec2019,1

First off, how is life treating you? I have not been doing too well, 
with grades and stress, involving my complete lack of social skills and ADD (which is causing a bit of dyslexia, so don't mind if there are any typos). We haven’t really talked in awhile, but I want to catch up with you. We have known each other for several years, and you’ve probably gotten a bad image of me. I wouldn’t blame you if you did, but I want to say at least that I've changed myself. I wrote this letter for a reason, and that is because I hate expressing my feelings through speech. Go to your yearbook and find my signature. You remember when I said that you were my favorite? That was an understatement. For the past couple of years, I've noticed things about you that I like. Okay, fine, I have a thing for you.  I miss you. Everything about you. Your laugh let me know that you were alright, your smile put me at ease. You made me feel like humans weren't all bad, how you got past the wreckage of our world to see the beauty of life. I've tried to find someone, but I guess what my mind was doing was trying to find someone like you, but no one gives as much meaning or good to life as you do. You and I have a lot in common with our interests, but I feel like you see me in a bad way. I want to show you the good side of (me). the sweet, tender side, who doesn't fire back, and doesn't think for himself, who likes being around people, and wants to be wanted. When (her previous boyfriend) said that you weren't together anymore, I felt bad because I liked to see you happy. I want to ask you out, but I'm afraid that you're going to see me as a total self-centered jerk and say no. I don’t know, I've learned not to expect. I feel like, since I am barely in contact with anyone, I'm being too forward. If you say that I'm not right for you, I'll just wish you well and accept the fact that no one can replace you, and let someone else be happy for a turn.

If something happens to me then he's agreed to take care of me if I wanted him to, and I live in Wales so I don't have to worry about healthcare costs since we have the NHS. If something happens to him or he loses his job then we've agreed to decide what to do by looking at our options at that point. So it might mean the relationship ending or we might be able to figure something else out. There isn't a definite plan for this since there's too many variables so we'll just figure it out if it comes to that.

How does all of this sound? I feel like I've covered the important things but I just wanted to make sure in case I missed something.",31Dec2019,1
858,"I’m (32F) trying hard to let go of someone (28M, FWB under 1 year) and am seeking advice. 

He has a girlfriend now. I suppose He had a better connection with her, it doesn’t help she’s a lot skinnier and prettier. He isn’t shallow, so I don’t know how much those facts matter. Obviously I have my own self esteem issues which doesn’t help. 

Before anyone says to stop obsessing, I’m not. I’m very good at walking away from these kinds of situations. Ignoring and moving on. But there’s something inside me that isn’t letting me let go. He’s very open to continuing to being friends.I’ve expressed a few times that I probably can’t, he also understands that. He’s a good guy, and I considered him a best friend. 

I just don’t want to subconsciously block other potentially amazing relationships coming into my life because I can’t let go of someone who doesn’t want to be with me romantically. 

I’ve tried blocking him, but I feel guilty after a few days. He isn’t a bad guy. I’m just sad, and it’s been a few months. I don’t want to go into a new year like this. I just wish he could see that I am worth it. How is it fair that I felt such a great connection, even as friends, but it’s not enough? It’s really a painful situation. 

I just want some help and advice on how to stop hurting over it so often. I actively try to put myself out there. I have all of the stupid dating apps, I just have zero desire.

859,"So 6 months ago I had money to buy a decent ford explore but me and my boyfriend had just moved from a another city and I had acciendently packed my drivers license so at the time I let him put it in his name with the intent of putting it in mine later but it was going to be temporary because I wanted to buy another car at some point then I was going to let him have the explore.

I have a kid I don't want us to be stuck at home because I'm carless now. I feel so stupid. I'm young and I honestly just made a huge mistake and now I don't know what to do. 

I really want to destroy that fucking car but I know it's a bad idea. I would just take him to court but I later found out he was already in debt and behind in child support so I know he wouldn't pay the money so that I can get a new car.

861,"Backstory: My first puppy love was my high school ex. We dated before either one of us had a car so my mom would drive to pick him up and let him come over to hang out at our house. He would check my text messages every time we saw each other.  It would make me mad but I wasn’t hiding anything so I brushed it off. One day I asked to see his phone while he was going through mine and it turns out he was cheating on me. We broke up and he wasn’t very nice afterwards. My mother stayed in contact with him. He began calling and texting my mom asking for advice and help. I told her it bothered me but she didn’t care. Eventually, she let him move into our house for some years, even when I began seeing someone new. At this point my ex had starting calling her “mom”. It made me sick to my stomach. My then boyfriend would be over all while my ex was living there. I referred to him as my God brother so that I wouldn’t have to explain the weird situation. He was always breaking things and the room he was in would stink. My ex had already moved on and had a child by this time. He confessed to my mom at some point that he thought me and him would end up together and that I would have been the one who had his child. My mom has been helping him financially for years and invites him to family holidays. I’m not sure if my entire family realizes he’s my ex when he comes to holidays or if they’ve forgotten how we know each other in the first place. My mom got married and now my step dad also treats my ex like a son. The only person who seems to understand my frustration is my new step sister. My step dad told my step sister I should just get over it even though I never got a chance to heal because he’s never left the picture. My step sister has heard how my ex talks about the money my mom and step dad have given him and she doesn’t like it. Not to mention, my ex tried hitting on my step sister and my step dad supposedly encouraged it (just to add to how weird all of this is). My mom has forced me to have my ex in my life and she acts as if he’s her son and I should be okay with it. I absolutely hate it. My ex has even “told” on me to my mom when I didn’t respond to his voicemail as if I’m required to and he apparently calls her more than I do. My mom has also told me she is irritated every time she talks to me and I wonder if she feels the same way when she talks to my ex, but I doubt she does. She has chosen him over respect for me and it hurts. We are not related and dated briefly in high school which ended due to him cheating on me. I haven’t looked at him in that way since and we really don’t get along, not even as friends. My mom just feels bad for him, but what about how I feel... Am I wrong for wanting their relationship to end? I know it won’t, but I don’t feel I’m in the wrong for wanting it to. I would never invite him to my own wedding or future family gatherings and I can see my mom getting upset about it. What do y’all think? Has anyone else gone through this? Should I just ignore it and continue not including him in my personal life or  perhaps avoid certain family get togethers if he’s going to be there even if my mom gets upset about it?

Side note: I’m in my 20’s (he’s older than me, maybe 30 I’m not sure) and if she hadn’t kept him around I would have 0 contact with him. The fact my step dad is now in on it too makes it even worse. 

Also, just want to point out one of my mother’s ex boyfriends tried contacting me to be part of an event he was putting together and I ignored his message out of respect for my mother (he cheated on her). Unfortunately she can’t say the same for me.",31Dec2019,1
862,"I posted this exact post on r/mentalhealth but received no advice/comments at all yet. I'm anxious about it. 


Recently, maybe the past few weeks or month, I really don't know how long it's been, I have had a huge loss of appetite. I haven't felt excessively hungry like I should. It's either that or I don't notice it or I forget about it. Dispite knowing I need to eat and take care of myself, I often don't eat unless we go out, which is not often at all; or my parents cook something, which also is not very often because of a few family things that they're busy with. When I am given food though, I do eat most to all of it. Which is usually a lot. Rarely I'll take the initiative to eat something but it's probably just something small like a single piece of bread, milk, or some hodgepodge throw together mess of different small snacks. I just don't feel motivated to at all.


Various times in the past I have struggled with this same issue for long periods of time. My parents had to force me to eat by making me plan out meals, threatening to take away my phone until after I've eaten, ect. This has been an off and on struggle for maybe a year or two now.


I don't think anything severe is going on with me mentally. But sometimes I am quite harsh with myself about my weight. Dispite the fact that I am within average rage of weight for my age and height (I'm fourteen and tall). I don't believe that it is enough to cause an eating disorder though. I think that the reason for this is merely because I don't feel motivated to. I don't know why I don't feel motivated to but I don't think it's consciously because of my body.

Though, sometimes, not often at all, I do actively try to not eat much because I feel like it'll make me gain weight/make my stomach look larger. But those times it's mostly just when I was about to eat carbs. I know that they make my stomach poke out more than I'd like. 


I also looked up some symptoms of anorexia (I know that anorexia is not the only eating disorder) and do feel like I am more sensitive to cold, feel weaker than usual, and have been down/moody. And obviously the other things that I have stated in this post.

Maybe it isn't necessarily an eating disorder though because although the eating factor is the main thing, I don't feel motivated to do anything else either. Nothing is seemingly wrong with anything else that has been going on so I'm unsure of the real cause of this. 


Thank you for reading this. Any advice/answers would be greatly appreciated.",31Dec2019,1

                    First off, how is life treating you? I have not been doing too well, with grades and stress, involving my complete lack of social skills and ADD (which is causing a bit of dyslexia, so don't mind if there are any typos). We haven’t really talked in awhile, but I want to catch up with you. We have known each other for several years, and you’ve probably gotten a bad image of me. I wouldn’t blame you if you did, but I want to say at least that I've changed myself. I wrote this letter for a reason, and that is because I hate expressing my feelings through speech. Go to your yearbook and find my signature. You remember when I said that you were my favorite? That was an understatement. For the past couple of years, I've noticed things about you that I like. Okay, fine, I have a thing for you.  I miss you. Everything about you. Your laugh let me know that you were alright, your smile put me at ease. You made me feel like humans weren't all bad, how you got past the wreckage of our world to see the beauty of life. I've tried to find someone, but I guess what my mind was doing was trying to find someone like you, but no one gives as much meaning or good to life as you do. You and I have a lot in common with our interests, but I feel like you see me in a bad way. I want to show you the good side of (me). the sweet, tender side, who doesn't fire back, and doesn't think for himself, who likes being around people, and wants to be wanted. When (her ex) told me that you weren't together anymore, I felt bad because I liked to see you happy. I didn't know if this was true, but if it is, I want to ask you out. I'm afraid that if I do this, you're going to see me as a total self-centered jerk and say no. I don’t know, I've learned not to expect. I feel like, since I am barely in contact with anyone, I'm being too forward. If you say that I'm not right for you, I'll just wish you well and accept the fact that no one can replace you, and let someone else be happy for a turn.

864,"So I'm in a weird spot right now. I have plenty of friends but no close ones. Now i seek some guidance from you how to be part of a close group of friends again and get back socializing. Just some general things I could do. I am somehow unable to think clearly on the matter.

*Some background*: I was bullied when I was young but got over it and made good close friends. However not being bullied made me attention seeking pathological liar (not even kidding I was bad), probably because I was afraid that if I was not relevant I would be cast aside. Years back me and couple of my friends noticed this and I started to shy away from being in the center of attention to get rid of these habits. This has resulted in me distancing myself from my once close friends because I'm afraid that I'll be that hurtful person again. I'm beginning to feel that I'm losing basic social skills because I'm afraid to act naturally. I get invitations from some friends to do some stuff (hobbies etc.) but I have no one except my parents and siblings to talk about ""real stuff"".  I don't attend parties and gatherings that I'm not directly invited to anymore because I don't want be that person. I know that I'm welcome but I also know that if I'm not there it's not a loss to them. My best group of friends from childhood and early adulthood live in another region so I feel like I don't have the means to be close with them. There have been also some situations this fall that have complicated those relationships. My work buddies are of different nature and I don't really feel that close to them. My closest friends from my current city have either moved away of have found new friends from their work and hobbies. I've never had more friends yet I have never been more lonely and out of focus with my life. I really love the city and work I currently have and am tied to these work/city situations for couple of more years. So moving or changing workplace is not somehing I would really want to consider. I'm also really bad at being spontaneus.I would like to be that person who some one would call and share their feelings with but I honestly don't know how to get there. 

* Should I just start of fresh with new hobbies and try to get friends that way or should I try to get in better terms with my current friends? 
* If you've been in this position how did you get out of this?

865,"Hey there. I'm a young dude (17) who is currently single. While I'm no Casanova, I certainly wouldn't have a problem when it comes to finding a girlfriend if I tried hard enough. The thing is, I am on the very edge of being aromantic. I am the type of person who is happily single, but it gets really lonely every now and then (every month or so), and I usually feel almost cripplingly sad during these periods.

I used to be in a relationship, but I broke up with her. She was cute, smart, handy, all around an amazing girl that made my life quite a bit nicer. The reason we broke up is that there simply wasn't enough contact. I was absolutely happy with meeting up every couple of weeks, but that wasn't enough for her. The relationship ended because she deserved much better than a guy who she would meet so sporadically.

I'm a guy who is happy to go on a date rarely. I wouldn't want any more commitment, honestly. But it's making me quite sad that there seem to be no girls with such mindset.

So there I am. I remain single because I don't want to hurt a girl who'd honestly love me. But that doesn't mean I'm happy. I'd love to be in a strong loving relationship with a girl whom I could seldom meet, because that is genuinly enough for me to truly love somebody.

So what do you think I should do? Any feedback would be appreciated :)",31Dec2019,1

870,"Firstly, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I \[M21\] am in my 3rd year of college.  I came into school with 3 of my friends 2 years ago, and we lived under one roof. We were pretty tight-knit friends for at least a year before college started, and were excited to live and start college together.  We also became good friends with two more individuals during college who didn't live with us, but slowly got incorporated into our social group.

First-year was wonderful and I really had a good time with them for the most part. To be honest, though, I didn't really study as well as I could have, and the field we were looking to go into required high grades--which I did not get the first year.  I probably got the lowest grades out of the entire group. In the past, I never really shared my grades for as long as I can remember, good or bad, just because I always considered them to be private. The rest of my group of friends never really did that, so some of them would be kind of annoying when I wouldn't tell them my grades. 

In general, as first-year passed, while it was good, I do feel like there was a general lack of respect towards me at times, from certain individuals. They constantly took jabs at me for jokes, but honestly, it was okay because we made fun of each other a lot in the group--although I did feel like I was singled out the most.  I kind of just ignored it and let it happen, trying more to focus on the good parts of the whole situation because they were really good guys overall and I realized I probably have some really annoying habits that they had to deal with too. I feel like I did have some social anxiety though, so that became bothersome at times when certain jokes were made. I definitely have been told I am an oversensitive guy so maybe this was just me being that.

Nonetheless, we started the second year still living together. This year was honestly riddled with anxiety for me. Some of the dudes in the group (both who I lived with, and outside the house) were making certain comments about my grades continuously, and these comments started the summer before the school year even started. At times, I thought maybe I was being over-sensitive, but some of the comments just didn't make sense--they were things that **only** I should have known. I continued to investigate and began to realize that they had definitely gone to a length to find out my grades. Based on the comments, I suspected one of the dudes in our group who I didn't live with had somehow got onto my computer and checked my grades. The same dude had checked my grades in the first year while he was borrowing my computer, so of course, that's who I would suspect.  As the year passed, hearing these comments throughout the year got to my head. There were times where it was killing my focus, and my mental health was garbage overall (albeit I hid it well). I got pretty annoyed about the entire situation and kind of just told them near the end of the year that if anyone did that (went and accessed my grades), I would move out of the house. Low and behold, as the school year ended, I found some proof (**or so I thought**) that someone had gotten access to that information. I was pretty pissed overall that they had done that, not because my grades were low (really who cares about that at this point), but more so that they went behind my back and accessed private information, knowing I didn't really want anyone to know.

After that, I essentially went out of my way to avoid them for a few days because I was just pissed. Although I had just mentally forgave them and moved on with the entire situation, I realized that this dumb situation clearly had an effect on my focus and I needed to take a break from them.  I spoke to them after that, and I told them I was going to move out of the house just so I could focus more, not really discussing the whole grades thing with them. I don't feel like they thought much about it and we both seemed to have moved on well. I will say that I held my reservations against some of them because I was still pissed that they went and accessed my private information like that. I feel like I was pretty cold to them at times and made some rude comments while speaking to some of them. As I started my 3rd year, I still hung out with these guys, but less. I did feel like my mental health had really improved over the last few months as well. My hope was that they apologize and come clean about whatever it was that happened. 

Now the issue at hand: One of the nights when I was at their house hanging out, I made a rude/snarky comment and they asked me to explain myself, after which I kind of just got up and left...As I started walking I noticed I didn't have my phone and realized I had probably dropped it there. I went back and got it and then I went home. As soon as I got home, one of the guys (who honestly had the least to do with the entire situation and I love like a brother) called me and asked me I had been recording them (as in, I left my phone there on purpose and recorded their conversation). Honestly, I thought it was a joke and straight-up laughed and said ""no..what the hell?"" and I thought they were just playing around trying to stress me out for no reason (they do this). When he messaged me about the same issue soon after, I realized that they really thought I recorded them and that lowkey got me pressed to know what the heck they were talking about. Was it about me, or the whole grade thing from the year prior? I felt pissed talking to him but honestly, I couldn't really tell if they were joking or not. Anyway, I decided to destress about the entire thing and watch a movie. After all that, and this is like 2 hours later into the night, as I got ready to go to sleep, I messaged the same dude and made a joke about the situation. I was hoping to lighten the mood but I didn't realize how tense the situation was in the other house, and looking back I should've held my tongue for a while. In response to my comment, they called me and snapped. We started going back and forth and in the end, and I brought up the grades situation. They said they didn't know anything and basically said I was being delusional. I was taken back pretty quick by this and apologized to them about being so rude to them for so long over something that they said didn't even happen. After this, I feel like one of the guys pretty much cut me off, while the other doesn't really want anything to do with me. One of the guys I apologized personally too but I have yet to apologize to a few of the guys personally about the entire situation, specifically the ones who kind of cut me off. 

It's been about 2 months since this happened and I'm kind of lost as to how to recover from the entire thing. Right now, I'm honestly not sure what exactly they're mad at. Is it the fact that I treated them poorly for months over something they didn't do? or was the joke I made super offensive? Do they honestly think I recorded them or did they use that in order to get me to tell them about the grades thing? I think maybe its a combination of things, but I am still confused. I'm also confused as to whether they broke some boundaries and actually checked my grades or not. After they told me they didn't, I kind of just believed it. From the very few people I spoke to for advice, they advised me that I'm being naive, too quick to believe them, and it's pretty clear that something happened (based on the comments the guys were making during 2nd year, how they were acting, etc.). They think I should just cut them off and move on. For me, I'm still wondering what exactly happened with that whole situation and honestly just want the truth. If something did happen, I wish they would just tell me the truth so we could apologize to each other for whatever we did and move on with the entire situation. I still hang out with them now, but I feel pretty bad being around them knowing I treated them badly for something they may not have done. And honestly, I rather not cut them off because I still feel like they're a really good company that I have had some good times with, despite this bad spell. 

If anyone could give me some advice on how to move on with the entire situation, that would be helpful. And of course, while typing this I could've subconsciously twisted the truth in some way. Feel free to ask any questions for clarification as I know for a fact that I've left out details for the sake of anonymity. 

Add-on: In 2nd year they played a joke on me and had me convinced that they had installed a camera in my room. While I walked in and out of my room trying to figure out where this ""camera"" was, I noticed them whispering things and thought they were talking about where the camera was. I left my phone in the living room to record what they were saying and they ended up realizing. This was the reason that they jumped to the conclusion that I was recording them now...To be honest, I can't really blame them for thinking about what they did because it did seem super suspicious and clearly I had done it before. In my defense, however, when I recorded in 2nd year, it was a completely different situation (was in my own house, trying to figure out **where a camera in my room had been placed*****--kind of serious tbh,*** plus I feel like we all knew it was for jokes).",31Dec2019,1

I’m posting this for advice on dealing with self esteem issues related to my height. I try to build self esteem by staying in shape, lifting heavy, running, taking pride in my job and my team, and getting difficult projects built on time. 

I know people have been telling me that height is just one factor in dating, and I think I’m handsome, but I worry height is going to trump anything I do on paper. I have other insecurities as well, but I think they all are based on my perception of my height as being inferior.

I excel in the business world, my managers manager is even shorter than I am he is a sob nobody messes with. However, I just feel I’m going to be judged by women no matter how great of a catch I am. Mainly because I think they don’t want to have short kids and will view me as genetically inferior. Not that I want to be with those women anyways, although I’m worried at my height it is about 90% of women that will reject me.

873,"I (26 F) was living with my mom and aunt who both have terminal cancer. I had previously been living on my own, but moved back in to help them transition while we found the right blend of nurses and housekeepers. I had tried moving out last year, but that fell through after I was left on a curb bruised and battered as I watched my car drive off with all of my belongings packed in the backseat/trunk. I suffered from minor brain damage that left with missing memories and made it difficult to remember how to so simple day-to-day tasks like feeding myself, cleaning, maintaining hygiene. 

I was excited when my boyfriend  (28 M) of two years (now fiancé) asked me to move in with him and his younger sister (23 F). I have been successful in my recovery, but still get frustrated that certain tasks that should be habitual take a lot of mental focus to get done. 

I work from home and they both work long hours outside of the home, so it made sense that I would do the majority of the housework, since I am the one around and it helps me to practice basic skills that I lost, but will need if I ever have children.

I don’t mind being the only one that deep cleans the house, but some things are getting out of hand for example: I spent over an hour scrubbing the bathroom cleaning up period blood in the side or the toilet, the floor, the rug and the vanity, picking up used feminine products that had adhered to the outside of the trash can, toothpaste all over the mirror and counter, make-up stains of the walls, and the basic stuff. When I was done, I put my towel in the bathroom and a set of clothes to change into after I showered the grime off from cleaning the bathroom. I went outside for 5-10 minutes with my dog so she could pee and came back to find her in the shower. She spent over an hour in the shower using up all the hot water, then spent an additional 30-45 minutes in the bathroom after that and promptly left for a date without saying a word. When I went into the bathroom afterwards my towel had been used, the clothes I set out were wet, there was make-up, hair products etc. thrown all over the bathroom. Several times I have put laundry in the dryer and have gone to bed only to find it on the floor the next morning with her clothes half in the open dryer and half all over the laundry room. She takes 2-3 30-60 min showers a day and lights and TVs are left on constantly which has doubled our utilities, and expects her brother to cover the increase because she can’t afford her part of the bills. I am woken up frequently by her guests arriving at 1-3am, loud television sounds, doors slamming etc. 

We have had talks about these problems and she keeps saying she will work on these issues but hasn’t. My fiancé keeps telling me that their mom was really nit picky, so his sister won’t do anything she is told only the things she wants to do. I just want to find some type of common ground and mutual respect within the household. 

TLDR: After minor brain injury I moved in with my fiancé and his younger adult sister who has no sense of personal responsibility. I am tired of picking up her messes and just plain tired because she is loud and I can’t sleep.",31Dec2019,1

876,"So a few hours ago, I realized I lost my Apple Pencil. It wasn’t until I checked my most recent project that I realize it’s been lost for a month (yes, I haven’t opened its case in a month). My house is very small, so I thought it would be easy to find then Pencil, however, after 2 hours of searching, I haven’t found it.

Using a net doesn’t work because it too, got stuck. I want to ask my father (I’m 16 years old) to retrieve the pen, but I know he’ll be mad if he lifts open the couch and the pen isn’t there. I don’t know for sure if the pencil is behind there, and he’ll come back home in 2 hours. I’m too scared to follow my gut and waste his time, but I need to find the pencil for a project I’ll be doing. What should I do??? How can I know for sure that the pen is there???",31Dec2019,1

I've only babysat for this family twice before, so would it be inappropriate to wear my sweatpants, no makeup, hair up, etc(look like i do right before bed)? when i get home i will be going straight to bed. like i know i will be so super tired i might even sleep on the couch when i get home.",31Dec2019,1

Sister that is nearly 17 is just a living nightmare. She’s screams and shouts and swears all the time. My parents bought the new iPhone but told her not to download Snapchat on it since she had past situations on it. She downloaded it, when my mum asked if she had it, she denied. Finally admit with remorse, they told her to delete it, but obviously she didn’t. I don’t really care about that since it’s between her and my parents but it’s how she treats everyone. She keeps shouting at my parents, threatens to call social services, shouts at everyone how she hates and all and can’t wait to leave the house. I’ve had weight and insecurity issues for a while and she has to remind me all the time how ugly and fat I am. My mum took her phone away and the only thing she told her was ‘I don’t even consider you my mother any more’. She’s just incredibly rude, when people ask how many sibling I have, I say 3.

885," I think I’ll just block them, but I want to make sure this person doesn’t have bad intentions. 

Someone at 3:39 called me today, and I thought it was my mom or something, sometimes she uses her friends phone, but I don’t know their number so I tend to accidentally answer random people whom live near here. And when I answered a voice that was a women’s was saying hello, hello?, hello?,hello?,(they did NOT sound like scam likely)and I didn’t say anything first I was going to say hi, because I thought it was my mom, but the voice wasn’t familiar so I shut it off. I was also going to say wrong number but I changed my mind, because they might record my voice and use it.

I decided to search them up Incase their wanted or anything , and of course as I expected no result. They called another 3 times but I didn’t answer. And I was Looking at my other calls and I noticed on December 14 in the morning the number called me, but it was a missed call. This obviously scared me since that means they called me before. Also their state was 24 minutes away from mine, we live around the same place. 

I can’t really say their number, at least I don’t think I can on reddit but it started with a 973. Who is this? Should I block them? 

They can just be scam likely, but if they were why call before too? And they really didn’t give me the scam likely vibe either, thus why I have my doubts about it being scam likely. And the fact they only live 24 minutes away gives me chills, considering I have anxiety. 

I might just block them, but what if it’s someone important calling? And I KNOW FOR SURE it’s not my friends 100%. My friends and family would tell me ahead of time, and none of them sounded like the lady who was speaking on the phone. 

I’m really lost, and afraid. It can’t be anyone important like a cop, or firefighter, or someone in a hospital, or vet, or my therepist. If it was then they would of probably came to my house, and tell me what they wanted to say already. I’m kind of concerned if it’s a nurse or someone calling to say someone crucial to me died. I really hope not, but they would again told me ahead of time. 

Also keep in mind I’m only 13, so choices I have might me limited. I can tell my parents, but I’m sure it’s not someone I know.",31Dec2019,1

887,"Hello, I’m on mobile so excuse the messy formatting and English is not my first language so sorry for mistake.

Recently me and a close friends have gone through a rough patch after quite an awkward situation between the both of us a few weeks back. Because of this communication between us has broken down and we became distant for a few days and stopped talking.

2 weeks ago I reached out to her asking if she wanted to meet up and she told me she was unable to because she was ill. I said that was fine, wished her good health and moved on with my day and thought nothing of it. It wasn’t until a mutual friend of mine asked me if I’d seen her story (which it seems that I’m blocked from viewing now) that I discovered she was available that night and went out without me. While it hurt me at first, I brushed it off as I didn’t want to cause any drama.

Fast forward to the holiday season, again I ask if she wants to do anything for Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, etc and again I’m met with a whole range of excuses. Again, I thought nothing of this, however, I recently discovered that we post in the same subreddits after I found a post which sounded very like her, down the the description and the way she types (it’s very distinct). 

I then decided to investigate further and become 100% certain it’s her. However, as I look at her profile I discover that that she’s been lying to me this whole time and has in fact been avoiding me. It hurts me so much that she’s doing this and I’m not sure what to do as she is a close friend of mine.

Do I have the right to be upset or am I to blame for basically stalking her and finding out stuff I probably shouldn’t have know? What do I do? Should I confront her or stay quiet and pretend I don’t know???",31Dec2019,1
888,"Well, this is a very humbling experience.  I'm a graduate of an Ivy League law school in my late 20's.  I went to law school because I really didn't have a set out path in undergrad.  I wanted to finish once I was already there, but I realize law doesn't fit my personality at all.

My sister is in med school, and I've worked with a lot of doctors over the years, even representing some as an attorney in insurance cases.  I really want to pursue medicine, and I actually already have a lot of the pre-requisites already completed.  All I have left are organic chemistry and physics.

The only thing that makes sense logistically and financially at this point is to move back in with my parents and take the courses at my local community college.  I feel like I want to do it.

But this really is an incredibly humbling experience.  I really want to chase my dream of becoming a doctor, but it does feel weird to be going to community college next week after all I've done the last ten years.

There's just so much that has happened to her in the past, like having to see her mother (my grandma) get abused by her dad (my grandpa) in her childhood, having my dad cheat on her with his current wife (the worst human being I've ever met) and then breaking up with her and hitting her with me in the room, then having a couple of failed relationships (I know this since I remember phone calls between her and them and also discussions that she'd have with my grandma; she has never spoken to me about this part of her life), and, if I'm not insane, a failed marriage before she met my father (around 5 years ago I found a marriage certificate with her name on it and some other guy's name, which I couldn't memorize \~ I know for a fact it wasn't my father because they were never married; I also couldn't ask her about it). She's also been unable to find a job in 9 years or so (she's so frustrated that she can't give me what she thinks I deserve; I always tell her it's no problem and she should focus on her well-being instead), she really has no friends other than me (which sounds quite silly but it's sort of true), and she won't go along with my grandparents either.

I can’t bump, set, block, serve, hit, or do my approach properly anymore. My coach thinks it’ll be a good way for me to get back into playing, but I am completely terrified. It’s a small room with one net ( so I can’t pepper or practice on the side in general ) They only play games and more than half the players are 6’2” guys so its obviously going to be really difficult.

892,"So this guy lives on the top floor and I on the 1st floor of the same building.We've been casual fucking since 2 years now but off late its kind of graduated to cuddling and cooking together but far from anything official.And as it turns out,he has some 4-5 flourishing weed plants growing on the building terrace that nobody except him visits.He has also put up flower bushes and what not in an attempt to camouflage the pot.And needless to say he smokes quite a bit.I myself only engage in it very rarely and recreationally just about once in 2 weeks.Also I have a full time job and a younger sister so I practically barely get any time for any of this.He has a part time job and its the last semester of his masters degree going on which he has sort of lost interest in off late(doesn't read up much and his thesis is pending and also has stopped socialising with college friends).So about a month ago,he got into this good internship in a neighbouring city but abandoned it within a week saying he'd rather stay here in peace and the permanent job prospects there aren't great anyway.Since then I can barely see him sober.He just is always at least a little high and a little hazy and absent.I've told him repeatedly how he needs to start at least trying to quit and focus more and I've stopped smoking up with him completely so as to not encourage it.But nothing.He says he understands and that he is in control but I honestly can't see it.Last week he was visiting his family for the holidays and had left me with keys to his place and the terrace to check up on the fish and the plants.And I hadn't been on the terrace in a while and so when I did,and I saw all those plants and the sheer amounts of pot over there made me absolutely freak out.And I know for sure 100% that he doesn't sell and smokes all his homegrown stash himself and so that was all I could think of and I feeaked out even more.And I googled how to kill plants instantly and it said concentrated salt water dehydrates plants and so I went and purchased half a kg if salt and mixed it in water and dumped it in specifically the canabis plant pots.Now he is back and I told him what I did and he is absolutely super mad and I've apologised and I accept that its not my place to dictate what he does with his life and I crossed a line and I agree with all of it and I told him I really can't do anything about it anymore and it was just a 10 minute lapse of judgement and I dont want to control his life.But he really is upset and he says and I quote ""I never thought I'd have to watch my back from you, it wasn't just trust.

At home, he never wants to come to my room to spend time with me. He always wants to be in the room with his mom. He's either in his room or in his mom's room. But he never wants to spend time with me.

He was very sheltered growing up. He never really had any friends and he didn't socialize too much. He never wanted to go outside to play with other kids. He would be in the house watching cartoons or playing video games. This behavior carried on with him all the way to high school. He would go to school and come home. He never hung out with anyone or dated. He was always by himself.

I always gave him a hard time growing up about not socializing and having friends. I would always ask him, ""Why are you always by yourself? Why are you always alone? Who do you hang out with in school? I don't want you to keep sitting in this house all day."" He would always get irritated when I would question him about this. I just didn't want him to end up being alone and isolated.

However, he recently expressed to us that he struggled with Social Anxiety his entire life, and that was the reason for his lack of friends and social life. He told us that social situations and being around people always made him uncomfortable. He kept it to himself for so long because he was too ashamed to admit it to anyone.

He's currently taking a break from college to get his head straight. He started therapy to work on his Social Anxiety. He just started his first job in a cafe that he's been working at for the past 4 months. He says that he gets along very well with his coworkers and manager. He is working on getting his driver's license. He is taking private lessons at a driving school.

He's been trying to become more independent and fix his life. He has apologized to his mom and I for not getting a job and everything sooner in his life. He told us that he felt bad for being a burden to us, and that fear was holding him back from getting a job and driving, not laziness.

I'm proud of him for admitting this and trying to fix it, but he never wants to spend time with me now. I ask him if he wants me to take him to work and his driving lessons, but he doesn't want to. He would rather go himself via bus or Uber/Lyft. He never wants to hang out with me. I kind of miss his brother being at home because he always wanted to hang out.

902,"Hello, first and foremost, I wish all of you a very great new year; this year for me has definitely been a hassle, but it's been also full of surprises and realizations, enlightment and the such.

And it has also been a year of continious free falling;

As the title suggests, I've finally (as someone with ADHD) found what I want to do in my life, and I've also found a hobby I actually do find myself drifting towards other than my dreams some times, and it has taken me a very long time to find it; before, my flame (dreams) would be ignited by any kind of aspiration just for it to vanish within a day (they were fake dreams); Now that I've found the real one, I have a very big problem ahead:

Throughout the two years I've spent bettering myself up (I left university as the semester started, almost two years ago, completely dropped out of it), I found out that I am:

\-Addicted to Video Games - Pc Stay - Continious state of hyper focus (Competetive, high pensive games)

Now this is bad to a point, because it still allows me to continue with my dreams, but it interrupts most of my \*working on dream\* sessions; now I've found a workaround for this, as I've found a hobby which is Streaming, but neither of this two hobbies (one the video games/other the streaming) are being worked on, for reasons you'll understand in the next points.

\-I found myself unable to concentrate; TL:DR, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, and to be honest even though it's left me a little confused, it has also given me a lot of motivation; Now my dreams are at a real high mark, and I really have a need to reach them; ANYWHO, I've found a workaround, which is Pills (Not aderall), and I've found the greatest method for my slightly distracted brain to learn as fast and as effictient as possible (tastes bad to tell y'all, but I've got superpowers).

\-The problem with pills is that I don't eat as much, but I've found myself being able to eat nowadays anyways, so I'm working on that on my own, although the lack of food and energy does interrupt me from all of my activities all together;

Now comes the rollercoaster:

\-I'm also seriously addicted (or 'dependant\` for weed warriors) to Marijuana; In my eyes, which are they eyes of an addict (I make a habit out of everything in existence) the substance is addictive and not only is it addictive, the addiction goes underway because everyone thinks otherwise about it.

This is a huge problem because, everytime I'm trying to produce (Yes I wanna be a Music Producer, and an artist/ Right now I'm hanging from the line of my love for 3D Modelling and Computer Science, which are what helped me get into university since I didn't finish highschool, but they both I've realized are not things I wanna do in my life, fully) I run out of motivation, ENTIRELY. And I know it's because of weed, and, when I get a hit for motivation, the lack of dopamine itself makes it so I don't even wanna even sit down and practice any longer.

Still I find myself in front of that thing every few hours, I get 3 to 4 bong rips in the morning, and 4 bong rips in the afternoon (YES entire bong rips of what I would say is good weed) so I now it's killing me, mainly because you would fall asleep if it actually hit you, you'd fall asleep from the second bong rip, but I don't, and I just run out of motivation,

So far I've tried leaving it (individually without my other addictions being dealt with at the same time) so far 4 times and those 4 times I've came back immediately.

\-And I'm also addicted to PORN and this also kills my energy, and dream fuel, pretty quickly and efficiently. I even feel guilty when jerking off, for I know my dreams are dying, the porn I'm watching is degrading and I should be helping out my brain not just making it stare at the shit i watch. Still I jerk off at least twice a day; it's hard, and I need some help because I can't sleep otherwise.

Those few points are the ones that I feel are stopping me.

Even then I know that I can make it if I tried and in this post I'm just trying to ask for advice in how to leave it all, so I can get 100% of my dream fuel; What to start doing to progress faster, and how has everyone done after they get rid of their demons, did y'all reach your goals? How have you been?

I wanna be clean, and this post is me giving myself that little push I need.",31Dec2019,1

They both receive housing assistance and food stamps, and still every time I see them, they  want something. I sometimes snuck in the backdoor to avoid bumping into either of them. Over the past year, I've probably given out around $200-300 between the two of them, plus rides. I know I brought this upon myself by allowing it, but I try to be a nice person, and I could afford. Enough's enough though, and two months ago, he asks me for $100 for some tool he could use to help him find a job as a mechanic. I told him, sorry, I can't give you money any more. I don't need you to pay me back for any  of the money  over the year, but I can't do any more. A week later I had a similar encounter with the  female. Sorry. This hasn't really worked, and they both still request money and/or rides every time they see me....I now just say ""no, sorry"" and keep walking. Ugh, what can I do to make them get the picture?",31Dec2019,1
904,"I don’t want to be alone during New Years, and would rather go out and meet people.

One of my friends(not someone I really know but kind of know) is throwing a party, to know more information I have to ask him.

I don’t think I’m “cool” enough to ask or go, and am worried I will be turned down.

Is there a specific way I should ask for the information? Or would it be better to just stay in?",31Dec2019,1

It's new years so I assume they're going to be up pretty late, maybe even have something special arranged for midnight.

I don't wanna spend 5 hours there, 1 or 2 tops, really just 1 at most is preferred. 

How do I do that without being an ass?

FWIW, I'll be having a ride in and out. Should I maybe just pin it on ""oh shit my ride is here"" or should I let them know ahead of time I'll be leaving early?",31Dec2019,1

907,"This morning, while cleaning the snow off of my dad's 2019 GTI Volkswagen Golf, I had scratched it pretty bad using a cleaning tool. Like it was MESSY, and there were a lot of them. He LOVES this car and would have put my head on a pike if he found out. However, they weren't really deep scratches. I managed to get rid of all of them with toothpaste and a lot of scrubbing. There are still a few tiny chips that I can't get rid of, but I don't think those were from me. Now, the issue I'm having is deciding whether or not I should come clean to him and tell him I scratched it but cleaned it up. Thoughts?",31Dec2019,1
908,"I’ll be 18 soon and my parents still treat me like a kid. I know I’m not fully grown, but I think it’s a bit ridiculous. For example, my mom won’t let me walk to the bus stop in the morning by myself, she won’t let me walk ANY where by myself. I don’t have a lock on my door, which is a problem all in itself. My parents wouldn’t let me walk by myself in the museum the other day. They treat me like I’m some dumb little kid, but the thing is I’ll be in college in less than a year, and I’ve never really been allowed the opportunity to be independent and alone. Eventually I’ll be walking on campus all by myself, I’ll be living on my own, and now I feel like I’m not prepared for the experience. I think they treat me like this because I’m this small, fairly petite girl that still is obsessed with Disney and stuff, so they still view me as their little kid. Anytime I bring up to my parents that it’s time to let me breathe a little bit, they shut me down. 

How can I approach the conversation maturely in a way that will really make them hear me out? How can I get them to finally start viewing me as a young woman and not a little girl?",31Dec2019,1
909,"Hey there. For some reason this is extremely hard for me to write but it’s been giving me panic attacks for months and I just really wish I could find some closure. So it requires a bit of backstory. 

TL;DR- my tattoo artists verbally harassed my friend and I (who are both confident that we had done nothing wrong), making us feel scared for our safety. Turns out, this wasn’t the first time. 

I’m currently 21, and female. A few years back I got a tattoo from a very talented artist. He was working about a 5 hour drive away from my hometown so I drove there, sat for my thigh piece for another 5, stayed in a motel for the night, and went home. It was painful but I made it through without issues, and a few friends of mine came along and chatted with me casually throughout the process. A few times they left to get snacks or something and nothing out of the ordinary occurred. It was a great tattoo. As I said, this guy was an extremely talented and fairly well-known artist, and very soon after that I began considering going back to him some time for an addition to the piece. 

So he moved quite far away, but I found out recently that he would be back in the first city that he had tattooed in for a little while. So I booked an appointment in October and drove back down for the addition i had in mind, this time with another friend of mine, who was very kind to me throughout this entire experience. (I also want you all to be aware that between these two pieces I’ve had multiple tattoos done by various artists and never had a negative experience). 

So we get there and the guy keeps taking phone calls and seems a bit upset, but is super nice to us and seems very excited to do this tattoo. I think the sketch he did looked fantastic and he told me a price which I happily agreed to and paid upfront in cash. I had expected to pay more (plus a tip of course) but I didn’t say anything as he seemed quite content asking for the price that he had asked me for. He even offered less but I went with his first request. 

He starts the tattoo, and I’ll admit that it was very painful. Sitting through it was not easy but I stayed as still as possible while taking the least amount of breaks possible. We were starting to make good process and my friend and I were chatting and sometimes the artist would chime in and he seemed cool. I will also mention that another dude was chilling in the shop and chatting with us, and at times a woman and her young child came in and hung out. 

So my friend had mentioned earlier that she may head out and take a nap in the car since we had left super early in the day to make the appointment on time (he had actually changed it last minute to the next day and much earlier than expected even though I already paid a down-payment for the other date we had agreed on). I told my friend that if she wanted to head out to the car to nap, or go get a snack she could do so and she said she may do that soon. Suddenly, the artist raises his voice so much that my friend and I both think he’s joking when he very aggressively yells at her to fucking get out of his shop if she didn’t want to be there. He keeps yelling until she leaves as she and I awkwardly laugh, thinking it’s some weird joke. 

The artist then continues to rant about how my friend was a huge bitch and how he had never had to do that in 10 years of tattooing (he repeated this phrase while using various numbers of years which I found strange). I felt uncomfortable and didn’t say anything. The one dude who had been chilling comes in and asks where my friend went and the artist relays the events and talks about how awful my friend was. The guy looks at me with concern and I just shrug as I begin to realize that something really wasn’t right. I knew my friend hadn’t done anything wrong. We chatted a bit but for the most part we were silent, particularly up to the point that I told her she was welcome to go take a nap if she wanted. It was confusing as hell.

I’ve been abused and I’m a petite, pacifistic, 114 lb girl so hearing a fully-grown man covered in tattoos yell like that whilst tattooing a huge piece on me was extremely scary and confusing. I was scared of angering him so at that point I stifled every urge I had to squirm under the pain of the needles. He kept saying how much better I was doing now that my friend was gone and how she was making it worse somehow. I started crying and tried for a good 15 minutes to keep it hidden, but eventually he kept trying to talk to me and apologize for “being a jackass” (which I later found out he had done to my friend while I was in the bathroom, despite neither of us noticing any hostility before then). So when I tried to respond, my crying became evident. He seemed stressed and tried to calm me down and apologize to me. I assured him that it was okay and that I am just sensitive and once I start crying it’s hard to stop. He kept trying to hug me and I tried to refuse but he eventually got me to and I felt so uncomfortable. He offered to apologize to my friend and let her back in and when I went out to get her, I immediately fell into her arms sobbing. At some point around this time, the other guy began pulling the artist out of the shop at regular intervals to have a talk with him. She told me she had no idea he was actually angry and was really confused. She said of course she would come back in because she didn’t want to leave me alone with him after that. He half-apologized to her and she asked what she had done wrong and he ignored her and continued to tattoo me. I wish I had left at that point. 

Things seem fine after that and we made more progress. After a while though, he gradually began mumbling under his breath about how it’s all my fault that this tattoo is gonna be unfinished and he won’t get to see his son and how he gave this to me half-priced and should charge me more since he was taking his time on it (he had never mentioned to me that he gave me any sort of discount, nor did I ask for one. I paid him exactly what he had asked me for before any of this happened. Also, the first part of my tattoo, which was smaller than this one, had taken 6 hours. He had planned to meet his son at 6 and scheduled our appt at noon, then didn’t even start it until 1 so I have no idea how he expected it to be done so quickly. I’m not great with pain but I know I’m not THAT bad. Most of the excess time it took him was due to him taking angry phone calls, making me cry, or that dude pulling him outside to talk to him). I tried to ignore it because I am quite hard of hearing and wasn’t sure until confirming it with my friend later that I was correct in what I thought I had heard. After a while of this, he just suddenly starts yelling loudly at me and saying how he doesn’t want to finish my tattoo and how he lost so much money on it and had to cancel his next tattoo appointment to finish this one (which doesn’t make sense considering the timeline of when he planned to meet his son and all that). He yells at me while still tattooing me about how I am the worst client he has ever had and about how my friend is a bitch and to leave and I did my best to stay calm so I said “even like this the tattoo looks great, thank you” while doing my best to hold back tears. He responds “I know it does, ‘cause I fuckin did it.” He also tells something about how there’s “cameras that caught the whole thing,” which was extra confusing. 

And finally I get up to leave. He then tells me to sit back down so he can finish it and I hesitated and apologized telling him that I thought he wanted me to leave. I guess he took that as me not wanting to finish the tattoo because he then yelled once more at me to get out then, before suddenly trying to regain composure and walking towards me (which scared me half to death) to shake my hand and say “thank you” and I responded shakily thanking him as well. As me and my friend began to leave, we heard him start yelling again about how I should think before getting a tattoo next time. (Meanwhile the other guy and the mother desperately tried to get the young child outside and distract him with sidewalk chalk). I begin crying right outside the shop and am unable to walk for some reason until my friend reassures me and tells me she understands but that we need to get to the car quickly because she was afraid that he might hurt us. 

We make it to the car and I profusely apologize to my friend. I told her that I always do proper research before seeing a tattoo artist and that if he had been anything like that for the first session I never would’ve come back. She told me it wasn’t my fault. Soon we see that the other guy from the shop had followed us to the car (holding the kid) and asked if I was okay, to which I apologized and said I’m just sensitive. He apologized and began defending the artist, saying that he was just having a bad day and that apparently his ex-wife wasn’t letting him see his son or something so he took it out on me. He also let me know that this has happened before, and that the reason he legally had to be in the shop with the artist was to make sure that he didn’t have another outburst like this. He said that he’s a really talented artist so they keep him around despite the outbursts. I told him I understood and we quickly left, and pulled into a gas station a few miles away to collect our thoughts. My friend immediately wrote down the series of events on her phone. 

The tattoo was left mostly lined and partially colored/shaded. It looks fine, save for a few careless scribbles from when he got angry I think. I will have another artist finish it some day I guess, when I can afford it. I had minor bruises and scratched from his grip on me when his outburst happened, which I took photos of I believe that night or the next. Healing process was painful, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

This all happened in October and I am still struggling emotionally whenever the memory makes its way back into my mind. I know that I am a sensitive person but I am also confident that this wasn’t normal or appropriate for any sort of business or service- even tattooing, despite the stigma that it sometimes receives.

I blocked him on all social media for fear of him trying to contact me again. Yet I still feel as though I do not have closure on this and I keep having intense flashbacks to that day that often keep me from sleeping. I just want to know what to do. My money is long-gone and that’s fine, but I wish there was a way to keep the same thing from happening to others without him knowing that I’m going public about it. I’ve considered suing but I don’t know the first thing about law, and it’s been so long that I doubt anything could be done, even if I had a case back in October. (No I am not asking for legal advice, I just figured I would mention that it had crossed my mind). I just want to stop feeling this way, please help me. 


I apologize for any typos. I don’t want to reread it because I’m dumb and everything makes me sad lol. Also I am in therapy and am very open in therapy so that’s one step that I have taken for my own mental health. I still fear that others will be hurt by him. And I am still in pain. Less pain, thanks to therapy, but I think I need more than that sometimes. I am sorry if I sound overly dramatic. As I’ve stated, I am very sensitive so to a different person maybe this wouldn’t have been upsetting at all, but I can’t lie about how I feel.",31Dec2019,1
910,"My (ex) boyfriend and I were together for nearly 2 years and friends prior to that for over a year. I'm only in high school yet had very deep feelings for him. I couldn't deal with the mistreatment and arguing anymore so I decided to initiate the breakup. We broke up in November. He agreed it was best and we went our separate ways I guess. I still love him so much but I know I had to leave for my own mental health. He took the breakup fine, told me he was over me the next day after the breakup and that he didn't care anymore. We still hang out with our 2 other friends as a group. We always end up sitting close next to each other and listening to music on the same earbuds, his seemingly face lights up when he sees me, and I catch him staring at me in class constantly. He's ended up confiding in me that he's lonely and started just going to sleep earlier because he has no reason to stay up anymore. I miss him so much it physically hurts. We also still snapchat constantly I see him daily in school. About 3 weeks after the breakup I asked if he wanted to make it a break and work on things rather than an indefinite breakup and he declined. I didn't mind and took it as my ""closure"" that things were really over and tried to move on. I don't know what to do, I want to remain friends with him but there's still a part of me yearning to talk and beg for him back. I know I can't heal by going back to what hurt me, but he was my first boyfriend and we lasted quite a while. It's hard to even imagine moving on. Any advice? Should I try for him back?

TLDR; I am taking my first breakup very hard and miss him. It's been a little over a month and we still communicate but part of me feels like he misses me too. What do I do?",31Dec2019,1
911,"To start off this will be a long post, and I’ve already contacted a health service to see what they can do but it may take a while for them to respond because it’s currently the holiday season. I kind of know these delusions aren’t real and they’re crazy but I’ve been thinking about them since I was 5 years old, and right now I’m 18. 

I feel like none of my thoughts are private, and that people know everything I do every day. It feels really hard to explain so I can only really give examples. People ask how my day has been or what I have done today, but they already know, I could lie to them and they’ll say ‘that sound nice’ but they know, they just don’t want me to know that they know, even though it’s clear that I do know what they’re up to because they know why I’m thinking.

Even though people already know what I’m up to (just living my daily life) I feel uncomfortable telling them about it because they already know, they just play along because they don’t want me to suspect anything. 

**EXAMPLE** : You know when you’re packing your bags for school/university, and you see something small (like a hair band) which you usually take with you but you decide that today you don’t need it? ON THAT VERY SAME DAY SOMEONE ASKS ME IF I HAVE A SPARE HAIR BAND. They already knew that I didn’t have it and they decided to ask me if I had one just to make me squirm. 

**EXAMPLE 2** : I normally listen to music with my ear buds when walking somewhere because I’ve always loved music (obviously most other people also do so whatever). Even if the music is on the lowest possible volume, it’s like other people can also hear the music. I always take the earbuds out to test if I can hear the music from far away and obviously I can’t, so I put the buds back in and continue to listen. But this method is unreliable because they could pause the music when I take my earbuds out so I think everything is okay but then make the music audible for everyone else when I put my earbuds back in so that I can’t suspect anything, well I do suspect it. 
Using Bluetooth headphones makes me paranoid because what if everyone connected to my phone and could hear my music?

**EXAMPLE 3** : I have some posters in my room, in which the subjects of the posters seem to be looking out. I’m paranoid that the person who sold me the posters put cameras in the eyes of the subject so they can all watch me. I don’t want to take them down because then they’ll know that I suspect something (even though they already do because I’m typing this out and thinking about it). Also the smoke alarm in my room has a flashing green LED to show it’s working, but someone could’ve easily put a camera in it and just have told me that it’s normal. Even things like my curtains worry me. I can’t see out of my curtains when they are closed, but there’s nothing saying that people from outside can’t see in. 

I walk as fast as possible everywhere I go because if someone is following me then I can lose them and I’m scared to leave my room at night sometimes because I feel like there’s this malevolent force behind me so I’d have to sprint to the kitchen and then back to my room and lock the door just in time. 

Even typing this up on reddit feels dangerous because it feels like you all already KNEW I was typing this up and knew what I was going to say because why wouldn’t you? I feel like I’m mostly typing this for release because of course someone could just comment and say ‘nobody can hear your thoughts and nobody is watching you’ but of course they’d say that, why would they say anything different? 

I do use social media and stuff but I get the same feeling you may get if you believe that someone is talking about you behind your back. They have a secret ‘group chat’ about me - kind of feeling. Like a joke that everyone is in on but you. 

I don’t know why they want to watch me, and I don’t even know who ‘they’ are but I known that they know that I suspect something but they want to keep acting oblivious so that I don’t do something about it idk. 

I’m not sure when I’ll get an appointment to speak to someone but I’m scared to tell them through my own words because I know they’ll deliberately misinterpret my words and put me in a hospital or some shit, and I’m a university student I have work to do",31Dec2019,1

913,"I'm writing a story about some guy who finds a laptop with people's memories on it. While testing things like deleting memory files to see if they correspond with people's memories in real life, he looks into this girl named Emileen's memory folder. The reason why is because she's schizophrenic and might have interesting memories to look at. The problem is I don't want to be offensive to schizophrenic people by writing some cliche bullshit that doesn't portray it correctly. I'll just give you the passage and if you know mental health or you or someone you know has schizophrenia, you could tell me if this depiction is right/wrong/offensive/should be changed:

**""** *He told me to look into this girl named Emileen’s memory. Emileen is schizophrenic. I was genuinely half-interested in this idea. The first memory of hers I checked out was a particular one in first grade.*

*I remember when we were somewhat friends in elementary school. She was smart, friendly, and used to help me out with assignments. I have a specific memory of her where we were supposed to be drawing a picture. I was drawing Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario fighting. But she was drawing something strange. She was drawing a picture of these hands pressing against a square on the page - much like the cover of this post. I asked her why she was drawing creepy hands. I didn’t say creepy. To be honest, they were well-drawn.*

*As a response, she told me there were these creatures that lived inside of screens that would talk to her. She said they appeared on computer screens, iPad screens, and TV screens. By the way, the iPad was only released 6 months prior to this point in time. Anyway, she said the screens would just turn blue and then some shadow-creatures would come into frame and communicate with her. At the time, I thought she was crazy. But I’ve become more mature and understanding about the mental situation since then. I didn’t know where to find that memory in her perspective.*

*I think she forgot it though. Though it could be lost in many other memories. These short sentences are making browsing these memories sound quick and easy but they’re hard to sort through. I couldn’t find it in her memories so I got a better idea. I found it in her folder in my “Of” folder. I rewatched the whole thing in her perspective. She glanced over to my drawing - a drawing I’m still embarrassed of.*

*“What are you drawing?” my 1st grade self asked her*

*“Oh, uh… it’s these hands that come from the screen,” she told me.*

*“What do you mean? Is that from a video game or movie?”*

*“No, they’re the hands of these black shadow type thingys. They live inside every screen I see; my dad’s iPad, the school’s computers, and even that,” she pointed at the projector screen. My first grade self glanced up at the screen and saw nothing. But then she looked at the screen and stared at it for half a minute. My eyes widened as I gazed at the monitor to see it; Two hands emerged from the bottom of the projector screen. They were pitch black. The hands were glitching out too. They were made of pixels. And some pixels were out of place.*

*“Do they go on THAT screen?” my first grade self asked, pointing at the projector.*

*“Yeah, but you can’t see them. I’m the only one who can see them,” she said. Emileen looked back at the screen where the whole head emerged. The creature was tall and thin. It’s eyes were white. They glared into Emileen’s eyes. I heard one of them speak. It’s voice was coarse and in a filter that sounded like it glitched out the audio.*

“BE A GOOD GIRL!” it shouted in a hushed whisper. I closed the tab. That memory had put perspective on things. It felt weird, knowing what she was seeing that day. I almost wanted to see more. Maybe the creatures from Emileen’s schizophrenia were only there because she believed they were real. **""**

914,"So there is this girl in my school. We talked a little few times, and I asked about her name  but she always responds with like: ""It's not important"", ""I know yours and that's enough"" or makes a joke about it. I found out her name somehow, but I'm pretending like I don't know it yet.(Because I want her to say it). I have been thinking about texting her and saying something about the name.

After a while though, he gradually began mumbling under his breath about how it’s all my fault that this tattoo is gonna be unfinished and he won’t get to see his son and how he gave this to me half-priced and should charge me more since he was taking his time on it (he had never mentioned to me that he gave me any sort of discount, nor did I ask for one. I paid him exactly what he had asked me for before any of this happened. Also, the first part of my tattoo, which was smaller than this one, had taken 6 hours. He had planned to meet his son at 6 and scheduled our appt at noon, then didn’t even start it until 1 so I have no idea how he expected it to be done so quickly. I’m not great with pain but I know I’m not THAT bad. Most of the excess time it took him was due to him taking angry phone calls, making me cry, or that dude pulling him outside to talk to him). I tried to ignore it because I am quite hard of hearing and wasn’t sure until confirming it with my friend later that I was correct in what I thought I had heard. After a while of this, he just suddenly starts yelling loudly at me and saying how he doesn’t want to finish my tattoo and how he lost so much money on it and had to cancel his next tattoo appointment to finish this one (which doesn’t make sense considering the timeline of when he planned to meet his son and all that). He yells at me while still tattooing me about how I am the worst client he has ever had and about how my friend is a bitch and to leave and I did my best to stay calm so I said “even like this the tattoo looks great, thank you” while doing my best to hold back tears. He responds “I know it does, ‘cause I fuckin did it.” He also tells something about how there’s “cameras that caught the whole thing,” which was extra confusing. 

And finally I get up to leave. He then tells me to sit back down so he can finish it and I hesitated and apologized telling him that I thought he wanted me to leave. I guess he took that as me not wanting to finish the tattoo because he then yelled once more at me to get out then, before suddenly trying to regain composure and walking towards me (which scared me half to death) to shake my hand and say “thank you” and I responded shakily thanking him as well. As me and my friend began to leave, we heard him start yelling again about how I should think before getting a tattoo next time. (Meanwhile the other guy and the mother desperately tried to get the young child outside and distract him with sidewalk chalk). I begin crying right outside the shop and am unable to walk for some reason until my friend reassures me and tells me she understands but that we need to get to the car quickly because she was afraid that he might hurt us. 

We make it to the car and I profusely apologize to my friend. I told her that I always do proper research before seeing a tattoo artist and that if he had been anything like that for the first session I never would’ve come back. She told me it wasn’t my fault. Soon we see that the other guy from the shop had followed us to the car (holding the kid) and asked if I was okay, to which I apologized and said I’m just sensitive. He apologized and began defending the artist, saying that he was just having a bad day and that apparently his ex-wife wasn’t letting him see his son or something so he took it out on me. He also let me know that this has happened before, and that the reason he legally had to be in the shop with the artist was to make sure that he didn’t have another outburst like this. He said that he’s a really talented artist so they keep him around despite the outbursts. I told him I understood and we quickly left, and pulled into a gas station a few miles away to collect our thoughts. My friend immediately wrote down the series of events on her phone. 

The tattoo was left mostly lined and partially colored/shaded. It looks fine, save for a few careless scribbles from when he got angry I think. I will have another artist finish it some day I guess, when I can afford it. I had minor bruises and scratched from his grip on me when his outburst happened, which I took photos of I believe that night or the next. Healing process was painful, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

This all happened in October and I am still struggling emotionally whenever the memory makes its way back into my mind. I know that I am a sensitive person but I am also confident that this wasn’t normal or appropriate for any sort of business or service- even tattooing, despite the stigma that it sometimes receives.

I blocked him on all social media for fear of him trying to contact me again. Yet I still feel as though I do not have closure on this and I keep having intense flashbacks to that day that often keep me from sleeping. I just want to know what to do. My money is long-gone and that’s fine, but I wish there was a way to keep the same thing from happening to others without him knowing that I’m going public about it. I’ve considered suing but I don’t know the first thing about law, and it’s been so long that I doubt anything could be done, even if I had a case back in October. (No I am not asking for legal advice, I just figured I would mention that it had crossed my mind). I just want to stop feeling this way, please help me. 


I apologize for any typos. I don’t want to reread it because I’m dumb and everything makes me sad lol. Also I am in therapy and am very open in therapy so that’s one step that I have taken for my own mental health. I still fear that others will be hurt by him. And I am still in pain. Less pain, thanks to therapy, but I think I need more than that sometimes. I am sorry if I sound overly dramatic. As I’ve stated, I am very sensitive so to a different person maybe this wouldn’t have been upsetting at all, but I can’t lie about how I feel.",31Dec2019,1

919,"I feel this weird obligation to respond to people I meet on dating site even if I’m no longer interested in them. Specifically, this guy and I were chatting on tinder and I kinda thought he was boring, but he was also really nice so I decided to see where it would go. After messaging for the entire day he asked for my number so I gave it to him. And then he just continued to text me throughout all hours of the day. The only reason I wouldn’t hear from him would be because he was asleep. He also does whatever he has to to keep the convo going, he can’t just let it die down for a while, he’ll ask me multiple time over the course of 2-3 hours what I’m doing, and he’ll share the most boring pieces of info (like that he’s taking a shower while he’s texting me or that he’s arranging old clothing to donate to goodwill). He also apologizes too much and he just seems really needy. We have only been talking for 2 days so on one hand I feel like I have the freedom to stop responding to him and it wouldn’t make me a jerk (especially since we never made any plans), but on the other hand I want to be considerate and respectful. A part of me (possibly my inner critic) is telling me that it would be very cold of me to just stop responding to him and that since he’s so nice I should just tell him why I’m not interested. 
What do you guys think?  

Should I tell him why I’m not interested anymore after only two days of texting and no plans made, or would that be worse than just moving on?",31Dec2019,1

921,"So I have a situation including a toxic person, my best friends other best friend (I'll call best friend Sam and their best friend Ollie) and Ollie is toxic (but sam doesn't see it because they are somewhat like me in a way and knows when someone's being toxic to someone else but not towards themselves) so basically Ollie has been talking about very dodgy topics (about depressive topics that is) and I rarely see my best friend in real life and we get along great and call almost everyday! but when the Ollie is invited I'll try to talk to sam but Ollie keeps on getting their attention again before I can even utter 6 words to Sam. ollie is also very very manipulative by dragging sam away from every friend they have to the point where sam rarely even talked to me and her other best friend (I'm not very selfish and I give friends space I basically never get jealous I'm not lying either cause rn I'm really concerned for sam but don't wanna mess up anything) once I didn't hear from sam in a week which was unusual but I brushed it off and said I'm just overthinking again. But this has now gone on for 4 months now and I don't want sam to get hurt. Well they are getting hurt I've noticed sam has gotten increasingly more unhappy as time goes on, and I'm starting to hurt watching them get hurt. I'm worried but have no clue what to do. But don't want to ruin anything we have cause I've never had someone like sam in my life and they've helped me through a lot so losing them would be awful to me but I'm more concerned for sam than for me. Ollie has snapped at other people shouted horrible thing towards others and is always making scenes I mean he'll I'm not even their friend let alone acquaintance and they make me feel intense anxiety. Like should I do something? Say something? Or should I not say anything about it and just wait for this to all blow over and hope we don't float apart somehow?

922,"Throwaway (sorry!). Bit of background, my gf and I met at medical school, and live not too far from each other back at home. Been together for over 2 years now. She recently graduated as a doctor however I had to resit the year as I failed an exam (sucks I know). Now initially i didn't tell anyone as i was sad and embarrassed etc but now iv fully come to terms with it and happy to talk about it. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, and at home with my gf celebrating a relative's birthday where some family friends were there. I mentioned I was resitting as did my gf, and my mum overheard my gf saying this and got annoyed about it. Since then she has been off with my gf and at christmas I said I wanted to spend a few hours in the evening with my gf. Well all hell broke loose and a huge arguement ensued, apparently my gf betrayed the family by telling people that I failed (even though I'm very happy for people to know about me failing and resitting, I'm not ashamed!) And my gf came to pick me up on boxing day where my parents had a huge rant at her and made out she was a terrible person, said things about her upbringing etc all of which I felt were totally uncalled for. 
So that was last week and since then noone wants to make any headway, I spoke to my dad to apologise about causing all of this, but they want my gf to apologise and she has flat out refused (which I support her with, as in my view she hasn't done anything wrong) 

Anyway sorry for the essay, any advice would be greatly appreciated, and happy new year everyone! Hope 2020 is great for you all :)",31Dec2019,1
923,"So at age 19, I was prescribed risperidone, and novel antipsychotic and fluoxetine, and SSRI for anxiety and autism-related aggression and irritability. My psychiatrist at the time said that he recommended it. Here is what he said....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You have ***so much to lose*** *if you do not take care of your mental health. Your professional life, relationships, leisure, and self-esteem can all come crackling down and it can lead to self-harm, assault, homicide, and or suicide. I strongly recommend that you go on these medications for the sake of your safety.*

So I complied with my psychiatrist for the past four years and while the medications did help, it gave me nasty side effects like anhedonia, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, tremors, nausea, dizziness, amnesia, gynecomastia, and lightheadedness. At the start I was on 16 mg of risperidone and 60 mg of fluoxetine, the highest FDA recommended doses of medciines. So back in May of 2019, I started my taper off these medications under the guidance of my psychiatric physician assistant. I should be done in Feburary of 2020.",31Dec2019,1

Not a single soul wished me happy birthday. My parents are too embarrassed of me because I am fat and constantly reminding me of this (on a daily basis). I see on social media in this 2 week christmas break in university, people going out and meeting their friends while I have none to hang out with. Every day I feel like I am insignificant. I try to make friends and they all basically leave me and make other friends. Why should I stay alive? Even in public school I was the one who was constantly in the principles office for getting beat up or bullied, There have been times in middle school where kids would create a circle around me and essentially throw me around and hit me. I thought things would get better in highschool, but I just felt more and more isolated. Then I thought things would get better in university and now I'm in such a dark place which I don't think I can ever get out of. Why is this happening to me? Am I such a bad person that noone is willing to be tight with me? Can I improve myself? Why should I stay alive, if the rest of my life I will be this unhappy, why not just end it? I can already see my future, I will die alone with no one by my side, so why not just save time and just do it now? I'm just an overweight guy with no friends, that is all I am and every will be.

933,"I plan to move to Canada next year to be with my boyfriend and there's not a lot of job offers what I studied for in NY, Web Development, and if there are, I'm not really qualified and I'm not interested in strictly coding. There are little to no opportunities for what I studied for plus the money is eh. I think the average wage is $55-$60k. So when I move, I'll have to wait to get my PR which is 6 months - 1 year. In that time I can go to college and learn Electrical which is 1 year then you do paid apprenticeship for 3 years. The money is good...really good and the job demand is high. I want to do what's best for my future. If I go back to college after I move, my tuition will be \~$10k vs $5k if I wait to get my PR which is 1 year. In that time, I can probably earn back the money in a month or two if I get an apprenticeship...the problem is...I'm a women. A women in her early-mid 20s in a male dominated field. I've always been a technical type of person so I'll probably enjoy playing with wires but at the same time, a job isn't guaranteed. Do I switch careers? Do I invest an additional $5k to start a new career earlier? I looked at apprenticeship but not a lot of companies are looking to sponsor; or at least I havent seen any. I also have 4.5years of experience in bookkeeping and administrative assistant work that has a decent amount of job opportunities but I dont want to be stuck in an office my whole life. I need advice.


I got to thinking and I could consider working in Detroit but I'll have to wait to get my PR even though Im an American citizen because leaving the country will affect getting my PR while the application is in process. What's holding me back is that 6 months- 1 year wait. I don't know if I should just save my time and money and just go into the web development field because I struggled to get a job in NY even when I applied for the most basic job offer, I didn't get it. I can do both design and development but i dont know if I can do an office job forever. Im not saying I dont enjoy coding/design but I get bored easily. I love hands on things. If I wait for me PR, I'll be sitting on my ass for 6mon-1yr doing remote assistant work. The question is, should I invest $10k in electrical school or wait to get my PR, apply for jobs and see where I go. If no job offers come my way then I can go to college for electrical for $5k. My struggle is making the wrong decision and regretting it. Im hesitant about electrical too because not a lot of opportunities for a first year apprentice but i can always make some calls.

So I have a huge problem(at least for me) - I have phone addiction. Because of it I have minor health problems that I can fix, but the addiction keeps stopping me. I try my hardest to do sports, talk to people, not eat while using my phone, but it just doesnt help - after a week I just give up. So because of that I started to feel useless, annoying, I started to be rude to others, not listen to my parents. If I get a chance to get away from my phone, I try to use the chance. At least 10 minutes. But I do want to enjoy some time playing video games. I want to control myself.

Both parties have liability insurance as well. After the collision my sister got fired from her job, because her boss bought the car and is now upset.

948,"Hello, with the start of 2020 here I want to make a change in my life, put bluntly, find a reason to live. The problem is, I guess I just don’t really know how to change, so I was wondering if this sub had any advice.

To start with, my mentality is pretty screwed. Is all there is to life studying hard, working hard, getting a partner, maybe having a family and having fun/having fun with friends? Of course, not everyone is like that but it seems to be pretty common. If I can’t establish relationships, or be too apathetic to have fun then what’s the point? 

I was a pretty normal kid, hell I’m only 15 so I’m still technically a child, albeit much older. I had a good group of friends, worked hard and got good test scores to land me into an all-girls higher education secondary school, which is where the trouble began.

I guess I didn’t really fit in, or maybe I just became a little too self-concious, because even though at first I tried to socialise I never really made any friends. Nobody bullied me, but I wasn’t close to anyone and was kinda just there. I’m a little more tomboyish than most girls but even still, I tried my best to make friends, I guess it just didn’t work out.

Over time this led to me isolating myself more and more out of jealously of those with friends and just general sadness. Eventually, I got a reputation as a weirdo and got teased by most of my classmates by the time year 8 rolled around. I was desperate for friends, even hanging with the outcast group in our year for a bit, but I guess I’m stuck in this awkward place between too weird for everyone else and too normal for the outcasts.

Even if I moved schools now or just went anywhere and tried to make friends it wouldn’t help, I just went from being extroverted to antisocial really, nobodies fault but mine. I’m 15 now (pretty young I know lol) but it’s been this way for a few years now. School really isn’t the be all and end all of everything and I can go friendless through it but I guess the isolated attitude I adopted because of it is here to stay.

I have low grades too, some of the lowest in the year lol, but I think it’s mainly because I don’t revise. I don’t want to revise for pointless tests as well as the big GSCE’s next year, and even if I did revise I’m not really someone who cares about being at the top. I mean, even if I passed my GCSE’s with flying colors there’s really nothing to work for.

I used to have ambitions, but I kinda forgot about them over time and don’t really care anymore. My interests are pretty nerdy and I think I wanted to be an animator but over time I’ve lost interest in almost everything except for like a few anime series that are the only things making me happy right now, as edgy as it sounds haha

It’s gotten to the point where I just feel so apathetic towards everything there’s no point in trying. Everyday is the same, go school, sit alone, come home and play videogames, but, is that really living? Of course, I don’t want to be travelling the world each week but even a little bit of excitement or something different every now and then would brighten things up a bit. Our school/area barely has any clubs and this lifestyle will probably repeat if I go on this way, even if I do get a job I’ll probably just come back to the same lonely desk I’ve become so accustomed to these past years.

Even so, if I did manage to solve all of these problems and change myself, there’s always this underlying feeling of apathy to everything I do. To give an example, when I tried befriending the ‘outcasts’ we went shopping, and while I didn’t hate it, I didn’t enjoy it either. I used to love shopping and even though there was nothing to make it a bad experience, I just felt nothing, and that’s been the case for almost everything for a long time

I hold memories with my old friend group in primary school very dear to me, and maybe it’s because I keep comparing new memories to those, but I really can’t be too sure. Either way, something changed a long time ago and nothing has felt the same since

However, I really want to find a way out of this pit I put myself in, but I’m really not sure what to do, and even if I did know I probably wouldn’t have the energy to do it. If someone could talk some sense into me or just something, I’d be really grateful. 

I know it’s probably a little hard to take this seriously given my age and there are lot more serious issues on this sub but I’m getting really desperate to fix this, even so thank you for reading this far :)

Everyone ignores my requests or gives me partial info. Still, I thought I was doing a good job for the most part. I always would hit deadlines or communicate why I couldn’t. 

I was so excited for this job. Last Friday, I was called into a meeting with my boss and HR. I was given a Performance Improvement Plan for a bunch of random stuff, not hitting deadlines, errors, forwarding my manager’s emails(?).  I have been in shock ever since.

Now everyday is a hell of documenting everything I do, every conversation, every interaction. The items are not accurate on the PIP. He stated one deadline in writing, but extended them verbally once I explained the situation. That extension is not on the PIP. It’s so clear he just wants to get rid of me.

One item involved errors on a report I wrote a month ago, when I had had the job for a month. I had never received that feedback before it appeared on the PIP. 

I have sent some documentation to HR. I will likely talk to them this week. 

But every day is hell. I can barely function. I’m not financially in a position where I can just quit. I assume I’ll be eligible for unemployment if I stick it out 30 days and inevitably get terminated for something random. But it’s day two and I can barely stand it. Maybe I still won’t qualify if I’m fired, I’m frankly not sure. I’m in California. I left a two year job for this as the company went out of business.

Would I even qualify for unemployment if I’m fired after the 30 days? If I survive the PIP, would I even want to keep working here? Is any of this worth my sanity?

If I quit now and don’t get unemployment, I will give up about $10,000 between current pay and  unemployment, assuming I can’t find a job in six months.

And yes, I’m applying for other jobs like crazy.",31Dec2019,1

957,"TW: drugs, depressing things  
Before I can ask for any advice, I need to give some background info to my situation.  

Background info:   
In Feb 2018 my house burned down, leaving me homeless/couch hopping from then until October 2018 when I moved in with a friend. In Jan 2019 he decided to take a job as a traveling CNA and I was forced to move in with my junkie of a mother and her junkie boyfriend or go back to being homeless again, so I moved in with her and agreed to pay 1/3 of the bills, which is honestly all I could afford to do. Basically they paid the rent and I paid all of the utilities and wifi, averaging about $250, not including paying for the furniture and appliances I was paying for monthly. My mom and I have never gotten along because of her drug habit and how she was using my as an ATM when I was living with her. 

They ended up getting so strung out that they went three whole months without paying any rent. By the time I found out it was too late to try and catch it up. I had to move out of town and lost the job I had at the time because of I couldn't afford to get back and forth to work. Then the people I was living with got kicked out because I was an illegal tenant. So, I was put back to square one. 

At this point my mom and her boyfriend had moved in with my aunt and uncle and I was homeless. Kind of fucked up that the ones who caused us to lose our place had a place to live and I didn't. Anyways, here comes the truly fucked up part. My aunt (well, not really my aunt but shes been with my uncle for 15 years) left my uncle (mom's brother) and started dating MY FATHER. Yes, my father. My mom, dad, ex-aunt/dads girlfriend, and my moms boyfriend are all living in the same house. Well, same property. My mom and her boyfriend live in the building. 

My dad talked my ex-aunt/his girlfriend into letting me move in. Now I live in the house with them while my mom and her  NEW boyfriend live in the building. Somewhere during this she left the junkie and got a new boyfriend. 

In October 2019 I got a job at walmart but ended up losing it because I had to take my father out of state to court because their car was broke down and I was scared they'd kick me out if I said no.   


So now I'm in a situation where I'm surrounded by meth heads, being in the middle of my mom and dad talking shit about each other, my mom treating me like shit constantly (ex. she baby sits my dog while I doordash or go stay at a friends house bc the meth heads are over right? she threatens to get rid of my dog while I am gone), my dad ignoring my existence (unless he's talking shit about my mom to me or trying to tell me I'm wrong) and I'm jobless. I keep trying to find a job but I've had no luck. I have been door dashing on the side to get by but it doesn't cover the bills.

959,"So I have been with my girlfriend now fiancée for about 2 years, we are young, we are both 18, we went through trials at the start, she wasn’t do so good in school so i helped her get into a school/program to get out of school quicker which is what I did before I met her,  I was 16 when we met and had my diploma and she didn’t, I started college early and work. I was making adult moves is what some would say. So I met this girl and we ended up getting attached and I saw how she was struggling so I helped her get into this program to switch her life around. The program was about a couple months long and she would live there which meant being separated and communication only through letters or a call every 2 weeks, months pass she graduates she is now 18 and so am I. I really love this girl and I popped the question and she said yes. But here’s where the problem comes into play. Her parents are very controlling, old school Spanish parents, before the program she gave them reasons to show that she wasn’t responsable and all that. Now that she’s out she applied to school and found work and she is now it fiancé. But her parents still treat her like a kid which is understandable, but she still has a curfew she can’t stay over at my house for the night, what I’m trying to say is her parents are controlling her life and not letting her make her own mistakes or her own achievements, this is a talk I had with my parents and they let me decide for myself and let me fall if I had to, but with her parents it’s different if she disobeys them, they put that idea in her head that if she does that they will disown her or punish her. She recently stayed over at my house against there decision and she got grounded and they won’t let her see me or go out with me and they say it’s because she is irresponsable. I don’t think there ever going to change and she sees that to but she doesn’t want to because well there her parents, I told her they are gonna continue to hurt our relationship if you keep letting them control it, and she agrees but is to scared to say anything. I feel like the only option is for her to move in with me and she builds her own life without her parents controlling it, because they will never let her go no matter what she does. I see that. What I’m asking is should I step in? Because they don’t know that what they are doing is hurting out relationship, she is stuck in two worlds whether to please her fiancé or her parents, and I feel like I need to talk to them because I know she won’t and even if she does they will shut her out, this is our only obstacle and it’s her controlling parents. I don’t know what to do because I’m the one who keeps getting the short end and because I love her I will keep doing it but I feel like I need to be the one to talk to her parents and tell them what they are doing is hurting our relationship and something  needs to change. She wants this but she is afraid to do it. They even said that the ring doesn’t mean anything to them it’s just a ring and I got greatly offended by that but like I said they don’t know what’s going on because I have been faking my smiles in front of them for too long and I need to talk to them because my fiancé won’t, yes we are young and engaged but we know what we want.

960,"Hello, so I’m going through so much stress and I have no idea what to do. I am 22 years old and I have never had a forgiven. My whole life I was sheltered and I never got to go out with friends at night, never had sleepovers, no parties until early university when I was 19 and had my first real night out. It’s been this way because my parents who are Guyanese frown on this behaviour. All they care about is money, the future, school and all of it ultimately leads to money again. I have sights on a good job and will need to do more schooling which they pay for as I already got my first degree and am now applying to my desired programs. I met a girl who is mixed half black and half white, and we began talking, hanging out everyday and eventually I fell for her. Its been about 4 months and I see her everyday and want her to be my girlfriend. She wants this too but the only thing stopping me from asking her is my parents. I even introduced her to them once as a friend and they liked her, however, they became suspicious of our relationship and questioned if its just friendship. I told them yes but it could be more because I care deeply about her. My parents are strongly against it and my mom said she would leave my family or commit suicide if I ever brought a black girl into the family although shes fine if I date another race, preferably Indian. My dad seemed a bit more relaxed but said he wants me to focus on the future so no girlfriends. Its killing me inside because I told this girl I want to be with her but my mom is scaring me. I made up my mind and said I am going to ask her because we don’t know what the future holds but I want to say I tried with this girl. But my mom brought up her hatred for the idea again and I get scared. Not only that but I would love to have someone who actually supports me other than just financially which is the only “Love” I know. I am depressed because of how alone I am but my mental health is ignored by my parents. I don’t know if I should tell them the family they are so scared will judge us does not have to know until/if it gets to be very serious with the girl and there is nothing wrong with casual dating to see if it leads anywhere. Please help.

Tldr; my parents wont allow me do date a mixed girl because she is black, my mom threatened leaving the family or committing suicide if I ever bring her into the family even though I’ve told this girl I want her to be my girlfriend.",31Dec2019,1

963,So im currently 16 and just found myself in a great new friend group. I've became best friends with this girl and we hit it off really well. I've started to fall in love with her about 2 months ago and still likes her. Recently her two friends have shown my screenshots of dms with her out of pity bc they thought i was being used. I confronted her about it and got it all cleared up. But her other friend whom I'm close tells me that she will eventually fall in love with me bc she is figuring herself out due to her past experience with her best friend that she still loves even though he's in a relationship. The main question i want help with is should I wait out for her or should i move on to other girls? Thank you all for reading this and im sorry if any part made u confused :),31Dec2019,1

965,"I'm 29. I haven't really accomplished anything in my life other than becoming an animal groomer. I've always been terrible in school, it's just hard for me to concentrate and I get bored easily. I have these grandiose goals of becoming a physician but, life keeps pushing me elsewhere. 

This August, I was diagnosed with stage 4 cirrhosis and end stage liver failure due to Carolis disease which is a genetic condition that I didn't know I had until I almost died in 2017. This disease has been detrimental to my health in every way since birth as it inhibits my ability to absorb all fat soluble vitamins. Now, looking back, it makes sense as to why I've always struggled in school and why I've had **so** many health problems throughout my life.

Within the last month I had a routine ultrasound to check my liver for any advance in disease and docs found a 2.6cm lesion inside one of my right ducts. Alarm bells are sounding in my doctor's minds and they're all very worried that I might have cancer. 

Now, instead of waiting for my liver to fail completely so that I can get a transplant and maybe have a normal life for the very first time, I might be completely disqualified from receiving a transplant and my time left on Earth might be severely limited. 

I got married to my absolute soul mate in 2017 right before I got severely ill. We met in 2016. There hasn't been a time since we got married that I've been healthy in the way that I was before 2017. At one point I was so weak I needed his help and my families help just to get out of bed and to the restroom. 

I haven't accomplished anything yet. I haven't got to spend a lot of time with the best person in the world and the love of my life. I don't have kids, I can't have kids. I'm so scared and depressed that my time is very quickly running out and there's nothing I can do about it but mourn the life I might never have. Mourn the life that I wanted to spend with my husband. He's only 27. He has many many years to go. I want to be with him through his years...now, I may not get the chance. And its absolutely breaking my heart.

How do I accept this? How do I get over the idea that I might not get to spend any healthy time with my husband, or buy our first house together or adopt children together or grow old together? 

Can anyone tell me what to do? What to think? How to feel? Right now I'm crushed and afraid and I don't know how to get past this and at least enjoy what time I have left.",31Dec2019,1

Then, I don't really know how to describe this, but it started to look as if it was filling up with air. Like after I zipped it up. It kind of inflated most in the back and when I lifted my arms up. I should add there was no wind or anything to contribute to it filling up with air, I was in a store. 

I'm not fat (I'm an average weight) but wearing a puffer coat filled up with air seems like it'd make me look heavier than I am. Are puffer coats supposed to be like this? Why do people wear them if they inflate with air when you zip them up? They look cute on other people, I don't get why this happened.

One of the main reasons I want to join is getting fit because I'm not very fit at all at the moment. I can run around in the context of a soccer or basketball game but I'm just not able to do laps.

974,"Hi r/advice. So I just found out from my \[19\] younger sister \[14\] that my younger brother \[17\] deals drugs to minors (13-14 year olds, kids rly), on the skatepark where he hangs out all the time. He's out on nye with his friends, I may have snooped in his room and found his stash of money/jewelry.

I have no problem of him smoking weed, even tho he's 17. I have a huge problem with him dealing that stuff, and definitely dealing it to kids. 

Our parents trust us like the angels we are, we're also quite open to them. So they'd never suspect a thing. They don't have a problem with us smoking (they were young once too), but yeah, dealing is something else.

On the one hand I don't want to say it and keep it secret because yaknow, not my problem, doesn't hurt me and I don't want to break the family (honestly wouldn't care if he'd go to some institution or whatever, reality hasn't hit him yet and he has to learn his lesson).

On the other hand, I feel like I should tell it. even tho he'd end up somewhere.

I really don't know reddit, and if I tell it, i don't have any evidence (other than about 500 euros cash in his drawers and a bunch of diamond stuff).

975,"Basically, I'm a writer. I've been doing it since high school, so maybe...five years now? Anyway, I mostly write shorts and the occasional chapter-length story on Wattpad. I have dabbled into scripts, somewhat, but it mostly involved my own characters.

So for next year, I want to try and branch into writing commissions. Partially to make money of my own, but also to help my family (mom, younger brother). I already have an idea of what I want to do, but the thing that's holding me back is how to price everything. From what I know, there are a few ways people do this for writing:

*Pay by Word-- Essentially, people just charge something along* *the lines of ""$1 per 100 words"" or something similar. I never check my word count, so I'm not too keen on this one.*

*Pay by Type-- This is what I'm thinking of doing. Since I write shorts and scripts (mostly shorts), I could charge one price for shorts and another for scripts. My main problem with this one is the scripts, since their mainly confined to my own characters. It'd mainly have to do with the characters used in the script and what they're usually like. It's minor, but it's still there for me.*

*Pay How You Want-- This one was a suggestion from my mom when I told her my plan. I just negotiate the price with whoever wants me to write for them. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this one, but I want to keep my options open.*

If I'm being honest, I'd be more for the second option, but I'm still not sure about it. I want to get started soon, so I'm just planning stuff for right now. If anything, I need advice on which is best to go for.",31Dec2019,1

When I was 12 I would hit animals but just like lightly spank them on the butt when they did something wrong but now I don't think that is right at all and won't do it again. If one of my brothers (Brother 1) animals runs away my brother (1) starts hitting that animal, like a good 6 times and they are hard hits. On Christmas morning he slammed my dog against the floor because the dog scared the puppy that we have and I went to the bathroom and punched the wall a few times and I bruised my hand and this brother is 10 years older than me so I have nothing to do. Also, the other night when I saw someone (some guy that lives in my house) in my house hitting the dog in the face and I got really mad and yelled and cursed at him and I went outside and stayed out in the 20 degree weather for 2 hours in basketball shorts until my brother (2) came outside and got me because it was too cold. Nobody hit a dog for 2 days until my brother (1) came home and I am scared of him hurting his dog because she runs away a lot and she won't learn to stop running away if my brother just keeps abusing her and I feel like its not her fault. We feed our dogs but my brother hits them. Today I brought a bat in my room just in case I see him hitting his dog because I will try to rack up the courage to hit him with it until I knock him out. Also, today I was outside for 2 hours doing push-ups, sit-ups and running so I can get stronger. I don't want my parents to get arrested because our house isn't exactly the cleanest place and it gets dirty easily because of how many dogs we have and we don't even have a yard for the dogs. and the house all of these people live in is in my parents name. Today I considered recording all the times my brothers hit the dogs so I can get them in trouble because I have honestly lost all respect for them from their past decisions, like being high all the time without a medical card, and hitting animals just because they are angry at them selves. I used to idolize my brother (1 and 2) but I was wrong and I want to become a new human and want to show that I can go through challenges and be a decent human without any help which I honestly haven't had any help except from outside people that aren't in my family. Also, my brother (1) hurt my arm for like a month and a half because I was mad at my mom and yelled at her because she never told me to clean but started yelling at me when she got home. I lied to the people at school and told them me and my brother were play wrestling and he actually knocked me out and I hit my arm against the ground and I looked it up and google said I fractured my shoulder but I don't count on google for my medical things but I did get hurt for 6 weeks and google said that's how long it takes for shoulders to heal. Thanks for listening if you are still here and thats probably not all he did but I have been writing this for 20 minutes and I can write 100 WPM and don't want to think about more stuff.

So pretty much I haven’t been  able to get this of my mind and i feel so guilty about it all the time. When I was younger around 10-11 and my sister 8 or 9 I remember her telling me at the pool that she watched porn and I remember knowing about it because I had some older really bad friends when I was 8 who introduced me to porn and used to have oral sex with me and used to use Omegle on my computer to pretty much just show each other on cam. They were in 7th or 8th grade and I was in 4th so to me all this was normal because I thought everyone did it. So when my sister told me I remember telling her we should talk about it later and when we got home I told her how I was able to nut because this was around the time that I had first cummed and I don’t know how it happened but we were both in bed and I was masturbatinng near her and she was watching porn and we tried oral sex but it just didn’t feel right. I remember just finishing masturbating  and kind of feeling disgusted with myself and my sister was acting like nothing happened she was pretty much acting normal and I kind of just wanted to leave.

Before the whole incident tho I remember maybe earlier tht year or a year before my sister and I were watching porn and it was a brother and sister movie and I remember wanting her to give me head but she said no and I’m not gonna lie I was dumb and kept on asking but eventually it kind of clicked in my head how fucked it was and I stopped immediately but she told me to show her my penis and I did but for like a second and then I just felt weird af. And now I just can’t take it off my mind and feel like such a piece of shit. To the point where like it just makes me fucking depressed and I can’t even joke around wit my sister without feeling guilty and disgusting.",31Dec2019,1

990,"Our relationship has been horrible recently. Shes been incredibly unstable and abusive. But a few days ago she.. Cheated on me. She messed around with a guy and masturbated with him and had a good time. She ADMITTED it.

She expressed severe regret. She cried for hours straight anf she was LOSING her mind. She says she still loves me. And i feel like i still love her. But i cant even think of her without panicking. I cant think of her without imagining her moaning to the voice of another man and getting off to it. Im really losing my  mind and i need advice. Thank you.",31Dec2019,1
