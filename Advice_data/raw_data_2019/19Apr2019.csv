0,"I'm at a point where I don't believe our relationship will work out. I'm feeling immense guilt about it because I know how deep her love is for me. 

I want to end it as soon as possible, to not lead her on, but I'm not sure when to do it.

Now onto the issue. I'd like to do it in person at her apartment but I'm not sure when I'lll get a chance. I don't get off work till late because of my shift this week. The last text she sent was literally ""I miss you"" and I feel absolutely terrible for not knowing how to respond or talk to her over text. if we have to delay the actual break up, I don't want to lie and say I miss her too. I'm at a loss",19Apr2019,3
1,"So in the title lol it basically sends the message but I’ll put in the story, so I’ve known this girl since middle school but we were you know just friends how kids were, then in high school that changed I really liked her but I never asked her out because well for one I was a bitch back in the day and also I was dealing with a lot of personal stuff and I was really poor and I didn’t want her to see that. Anyway I changed highschools and I never saw her again (this was in the middle of 9th grade) now outta nowhere like 1ish maybe 2 now I saw her on ig and we started talking and then we started to hangout ( now I should say at this time she had this bum ass bf so in my mind I respect his dumbass and I told myself ima just be friends with her) (I should also say at that time I really felt like I didn’t have feelings for her) so time goes on we become friends and stuff and outta nowhere she decides to move to a different state with her bum ass bf so I kinda laugh and tell her like be careful but in the same time I always wanted to leave Texas too so I couldn’t help but encourage someone to get out of there comfort zone. So while she’s gone I don’t think about her at all I’m just living my life, then she comes to visit so I pick her up and you know we hangout she visits everybody etc and she leaves. I’m still cool (I should say I always felt in the back of my mind I always knew just cuz I’ve never well felt so comfortable with a person like this ever) I still live my life without her in my head. But then one day outta nowhere she texts me how she’s sad and all dat and that her bf left her. So I kinda said I told you so lol cuz I did tell her lol, but anyway I’m like awww sucks sorry ( in my head I’m like hahahaha like dyin lmao) but anyway she comes back again to visit after a while this time was different tho when I picked her up from the airport and from us hanging out and all that normal stuff we do together, and I was cool no lie but when she left my heart broke I couldn’t get her out of my head.... so 2 weeks go by ( I should also say that I “been” with girls I just never get attached to no one Idk why I just don’t ) so I decided to call her and tell her how I feel lmao yo I bitched out I haven’t acted like a botch like this since 9th grade so I was like nah I gotta tell her... but I called her twice each on a different day she was busy, so I decided fucc it I’ll text her honestly so I did... she didn’t respond to me for like hours but she did and my heart broke even more but it wasn’t more of that she didn’t like me more of that it was bad timing than anything, since she just moved to a whole another state 16 hrs from me and she just broke up with her bf and all dat. So it was completely understandable what got me was that she’s like if she was gonna be in a relationship it would be polly (now I didn’t know what it was lmao so I googled it and it’s like a open relationship) and I ain’t even gon lie if anyone else said that I’d be like hyped like ok lmao but I couldn’t be in that with her I just like her too much but whatever. So ever since then I noticed that we stopped talking as much as we did which we didn’t talk that much anyway since she live kinda far. So I try to move on you know like I always do I’ve been rejected before I can handle it. But idk why it’s been couple of months now and for the life of me I just can’t get her out of my head. She’s on my thoughts all day like fuck ion know why and I can’t even talk to her like that I feel like it’s just awkward between us even tho !!! She said and I fucking quote “ we are adults it’s not awkward at all” so me the amazing dude I am said bet but of course somehow she makes it awkward by avoiding simple texts like stupid shit, like I sent her a music video of my friend that made a song with wiz and like just weird Mayne if y’all could just see/feel the vibe I felt smh. But everytime she pops in my mind I can’t get this feeling in my gut away everytime I just spark up and get high to numb the feeling so I can get on or end my day. I don’t want help to get her, I said what I said and she said what she said it’s fine I just want to get over her so every girl I’m with she doesn’t pop on my mind every god damn time. I might be in love I’m most likely not ( I don’t believe in love ). I just want to know any way besides drugs and alcohol to get her out of my mind it’s pissing me off that’s she’s living in my head when she most likely hasn’t even thought about me. If anything I guess I’ll just stay high 🤷🏽‍♂️",19Apr2019,1
3,"Hey guys... I haven’t posted before on this sub I think but I really do need advice right now. I'm in a situation where my roommate and I are beginning to hate each other and it's because of stuff that I do but can't really control. I get really pissy about small things sometimes when I'm really sad because it's what helped me steer away from self harm a while ago... I think the only thing that I can do to benefit our friendship (or salvage it, I know he doesnt really like me just like most of his/my friends) will severely harm my mental health. I can't pick a side and I just need advice. I think it's too late for him to ever want to be my friend and I don't really have anyone that cares about me at all (maybe my mom i guess) but it just fucking sucks to choose between such a good friend that he is vs. my mental health. He really doesn't deserve to be around someone as shitty as me at all and I hope in the future he can find someone better (literally anyone else), but for now I don't think my choice really affects whether he wants to be friends.",19Apr2019,0
4,"I have an upcoming drug test, anytime between the next 7-14 days. I am an occasional smoker, probably 3-5 times a month. The last time I smoked was a week ago.

This evening I took a take home drug test and tested negative, although the line was a little bit faint but it was definitely there. I have never taken a drug test before and don’t know much about them, but does this mean I will 100% pass the test in a week or so?

7,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde said bye on their way out to me smiling. I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",19Apr2019,0

Whenever I try to stand up for myself telling her to put her stuff out of my room she just threatens to punish me and take away the few belongings I have, at night I usually go to bed at around 9pm but because I have a tv in my room all day while I’m at school she watches it, she (9/10 times) refuses to turn it off at 9 like I ask EVERY NIGHT.

10,"So basically I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and I have been suggested to get a pet to help with that. My mom is in the middle of this idea. She kept saying ""i don't know"" ""We'll see"" but just recently she said yes after I decided to start showing more responsibility and keep up good grades. Well now she pulled the ""i don't know card"" again and I'm so hurt. She keeps saying ""what about the money for it "" ""what if it's aggressive"" ""What if it doesn't help you"" It's kind of annoying me because I've literally seen so much people talk about how pets have helped them not to mention I been begging her for months to get a job so I can be independent and not rely on her but she claims I don't need a job. How do I get her to say yes? I've done literally everything to prove to her I'm responsible to get a pet.

11,"Hi everyone. I just need advice about a situation that occurred at work. My job has some pretty tedious work involved and so I’m able to listen to music/podcasts a lot of the time and still get work done and focus. Sometimes I will watch/listen to videos as well. I noticed a higher up manager walk by my desk and was kicking myself since my phone was out and in front of me.

Today I was doing it as I normally do, still doing work and I got a call from my boss to come to his office. When I got there, he told me that he’d gotten word that I had been “spending a lot of time on my phone watching videos”. I obviously didn’t want to make excuses or try to deny this because it’s true, I do use my phone during work, but I did explain that I listen while I work but that it was still not an excuse and I should cut it out. He explained that if I feel like I have a lot of down time I need to be asking for more work and that upper management had noticed (meaning the manager who walked by my desk). 
I apologized and said it would stop and he seemed unbothered, more like he was told to say something.

I am beyond embarrassed and upset with myself. I have never gotten warned for anything and am a hard worker. I just feel like all of that has been thrown out the window because I was being stupid. I feel like I’m going to be watched now, by HR and the manager who reported it and the rest of the day at my desk I was just so uncomfortable and worried. I didn’t take my phone out again. I guess I just feel like it was presented to me as a huge problem and that I’ll be watched and I’m very nervous.

How can I move passed this feeling? I’m sure people get warnings all the time but my department is small and I just feel really upset about it. Most people listen to music and even use their phones, but obviously it was noticed that I was doing it. Should I stop listening to anything all together?",19Apr2019,1

14,"Hey guys, I \[M19\] woke up today with a text from my other best friend in our little triad of friendship saying ""call me when you can, P's father passed away"".

15,"Near the end of last year, i decided to stay at home for University and get the hour train journey there instead. This was because i was already used to getting it for college, also my best friend had died at the start of the year and i felt like i should stay close. When Uni started, i thought that i wasn’t really getting the full experience. My friend went to a separate uni and moved into accommodation, he always talked about how good it was and how much fun he’s having. Before, we would literally talk every day but now i go weeks without hearing from him. I ended up becoming really upset about this and the fact that i wasn’t making as much friendships as I thought i would. 

As the year went on, i ended up becoming really happy with staying at home and i brushed off the thought of moving. I started talking to my friends at home more and i went out alot.

I now don’t know if i should move there for second year as i cannot get accommodation anymore and i would have to get a house. I also don’t know if it is worth it anymore because it costs a lot and i would leave everything behind.

The other problem with staying is that some of my friends at home are moving to accommodation for their first year.

17,"Hello reddit, I've come to you today because I need some advice on how to proceed with the relationship between my Dad and I. If you like reading a lot than this post is for you, because I'll need to get you filled in. 

My Dad grew up in about the worst circumstances possible as a kid. Psycopathic mother, unbelievably abusive step father, too many children for either of them to afford, eating out of dumpsters, etc. Despite this, my Dad had a drive to get himself somewhere in life, became an Army Officer, and got himself a nice piece of the American Dream with my mother, myself and my little sister. Ever since he got promoted to Captain in '05, he's become... entitled. To everything. He works his 40 hours a week so that means he gets to come home and do shit nothing. Every day. He is also entitled to his family conforming to thinking, feeling and saying what would be deemed appropriate by him. Everyone is a soldier, in short. 

Now, this doesn't mean was is a bad person, or at least, he wasn't trying to be. He never laid a finger on anyone, he never cheated, never drank, never... well, did anything, except go to work, come home, and watch TV. 

My mom left him seven years ago when I was 16, which I'm sure I don't need to explain. He still isn't over it, talks about how much he hates her everyday, etc. 

My sister and I have never really fought him over... anything. We never had a rebellious teenager phase because it simply wasn't an option. We also weren't motivated to rebel because all things considered, life was good. We always had a roof over our head, we always had food on the table, and we just about always got anything we wanted within reason. We were spoiled, but only because the only way my Dad knew how to build a relationship with us is via the fact that he has money.

I moved out at 18 but when I was 20 had some really bad beats in life and had to move back in with him. However, because he was willing to have me live with him, I was able to get my life together, and am now moved out again, living with my GF, working full time while also training to become an IT Tech, and I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. Coincidentally, this also means that I am completely finacially independent of my father. He hasn't been taken this well.

For the last six months, he has done nothing but shit on my GF for made up reasons, and is overall questioning our relationship in a way that seems too obvious that he's just projecting his insecurities about his own failures. Still no excuse for what he is saying. I've always brushed it off, sheltered her from it, figured it's not worth creating animosity between them and that he'll come around if he sees that we are happy together after enough time. We are truly in love, have tons of goals and long term plans together and could absolutely picture marrying her. Still, all he does is talk shit, about me as well, even if I worked 80 hours a week crawling through sewers he would think I don't work hard enough. It's gotten to the point that I just can't take his BS anymore. What hasn't helped his attitude is that my sister's life just collapsed, and as of three weeks ago, she is now living with him after having been on her own for two years.

What broke the camel's back was a bag of Twizzlers. Sunday was the season premiere of Game of Thrones. The plan was to watch it at his house. Before I head over, he texts me, asking to grab a bag of Twizzlers for him, to which I oblige. My GF drops me off at his house (she doesn't watch it... yet) and I forget the bag of Twizzlers in the car. I go inside, realise this, call her, but her phone is on silent. He proceeds to lecture me like I'm a Freshmen who just failed Algebra: ""I'm very dissapointed"", ""You had one job"", ""It's really sad"". My response was, ""Fuck you, it's just a bag of Twizzlers."" Oh boy. He said a lot of things after that, but what I will highlight is, ""I am entitled to how I feel but you are not entitled to say fuck you to me"", ""This is not how I raised you"", and ""You are not welcome in my house until you apologize"".

Here's the thing: I'm not going to applogize. I meant what I said, and at this point, it feels like a great weight would be lifted from me if him and I were just done. It's also worth noting that I have idea what he means by ""I didn't raise you this way"". He didn't raise me, which I know sounds odd but hear me out. Yes, he made sure that there was a roof over my head and that there was food in table, but that's it. I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for that, but there is no raising there. To me, raising someone involves a lot of people that influence them in different ways. In terms of the most imfluential people in my life that made me who I am, he'd be lucky to be in the top 20.

The less fortunate circumstance in all this is my sister, who I love to death. She has to deal with him taking all his anger out on her, even if it's only verbal.

With that aside, I can't help but think that maybe I'm the asshole, my Dad went through a lot to get to the point where he had my sister and I, even if he hasn't had any profound relationship with us. To me, a financial relationship and an emotional one are very different. He seems to think that they are intertwined, and that because we have always had financial dependence of him that that constitutes an emotional dependence as well. But not only is that not the case, but the financial dependence is now no longer there either.

So reddit, what do you think? Given my financial independence, would it be better to have him understand that I have no interest in spending time with him any longer? Am I just an ungrateful, spoiled, stereotypical millennial asswipe? Is it worth giving a disingenuous apology in hopes he cools down so we can maintain this migraine of a relationship? He'll never let it go and be petty about it every single day until he dies, but I suppose that would be the case anyways.",19Apr2019,1
19,"I (23M) finished college back in December with a degree in history, and immediately got a job as a case manager at a law firm near my home town. During the interview and the first few weeks of this job, I was told that I'd be trained for at least 6 months before taking on a full work load, which I was told is about 80-90 cases at a given time. It has now been only 3 and a half months, and I have learned the following: 

* What I was initially told was an out and out lie; despite being here for only 3 and a half months, I currently have 120 cases assigned to me
* My entire department is severely overworked. Even with 120 files, I have one of the lightest loads in the office
* To that end, nobody in my department is on top of their workload. I'm not using a figure of speech here--literally *nobody* is fully caught up or on top of things.
* Nobody who works there wants to be there--out of the 15 people I started the job working with, 3 of them have left and 2 more are on their way out
* The managing attorney  cares *only* about how many cases we get out the door, and threatens to fire people regularly when they don't meet their quotas. 
* My direct supervisor will not have a 5 minute conversation with me about how to manage the absurdly high volume of work. (I will note here that my direct supervisor is one of the hardest working people in the office and I completely understand she is short on time. But at the same time, she ***is*** my direct supervisor, and 5 minutes to talk about how I can be more efficient at my job doesn't seem like a lot to ask.)

I put in more hours per week than anybody else in my department (barring my direct supervisor) in order to stay on top of my workload, but it's just not enough. I do still have somebody assigned to me as a trainer, and she is a great teacher and a joy to work with, but she has her own egregiously high workload and cannot give me the help I need to succeed here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so stuck. There's nothing anyone at the firm can do to alleviate my workload, and every time I think I've accomplished something, it turns out that I've screwed something up, or just jumped over one of nearly infinite hurdles. I don't know what to do. If I stay, there's no way to get this workload under control. And if I go, who the hell is going to hire  some dweeb with a bachelor's in history who quit his first job less than a year in?

Going with some friends is an option but if they aren’t committed to actually following through i would go alone. Or with my GF. I love mountains like in Canada above montana i’ve seen pictures.

21,"First time poster here. My sister continuously is taking items from my bedroom without consent. Context: We both are adolescents, me being slightly older.

A majority of the day, I am participating in extra-curricular activities, hence my bedroom is unsupervised for several hours while my sister is home. Most of the stuff that has been taken is petty (yearbooks, charging cables, novelties, etc...). Most recently, she took my older gaming laptop (very expensive). I brought it up to my parents but to my surprise, they defended her claiming ""she needs something to do homework with"". To add onto that, when she takes something, she is not borrowing it, she intends on keeping it as long as possible. She gets away with everything without repercussions which I find unacceptable. What should I do to prevent further theft because this has been a 2-year ordeal?

23,"Throwaway account here. I'm in a bit of a minor conundrum here. I am a content creator online, which contributes to a significant portion of my income. Some of my followers would like to send me mail, so I was planning on getting a P.O. Box that they can send me what they want to send.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem here is that nobody in my real life knows that I'm an online content creator, and that's because most of my friends/family kind of look down at that kind of work. And, well, my brother (who lives close by) is a mailman, and I'm worried about him finding out that I have a P.O. box. I'm not so much worried about him looking at the mail that goes to it because the people who send me mail won't put my last name on it, but I'm worried about him finding out about me simply having a P.O. box.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question here is, if I open a P.O. box in a different (but nearby) town that my brother does NOT work in, do I still have to worry about him finding out that there is a P.O. Box opened in my name? And if so, is there another way I can receive mail from my followers without worrying that my brother will find out about it? Thanks.",19Apr2019,2
24,"I want to start by saying I’m a 28 year old female. 

I started working immediately out of Highschool and my first job was waitressing at a pub. I did that for about a year. I worked for a very cruel woman who would literally make me cry every single day I came in because she would belittle me and generally just make me feel like I couldn’t do anything right. At one point she directly asked me if I was on drugs because I was so slow and stupid. At that point in my life I didn’t even drink let alone do drugs.  She also overheard and mocked me when I confided in a coworker...at the time I struggled with depression because of my difficult home life. I stuck it out as long as I did because I needed to be able to put it on a resume. What made me decide to leave was when the owner of a store in the same mall said he’s amazed I made it as long as I did because normally girls quit after two weeks. 

My job after that was a little better, I worked as a program assistant for a summer camp. Basically I did odd jobs but mostly was only allowed to clean and do dishes because the owner was insanely old fashioned and sexist. I wasn’t even allowed to mow the grass because apparently I’d break the lawn mower with vagina? I don’t know.  I eventually left because I got tired of being treated like a woman in the fifties for very little money. 

I worked in a buffet after that. Did it for two years. The job itself was ok and the pay was decent, but I started getting sexually harassed by a manager. He was horrible and he did it to anyone who looked under age. I’ve always looked 5-7 years younger than I am. I was about 22 at the time. Basically all young girls had the same experience as me and they were all afraid to say anything because he was also really good friends with the owner. The harassment got to the point where I said something to my direct manager about it. After that she started treating me differently. She would look for any excuse to get me in trouble. I went to use the restroom one day and she accused me of sneaking on my phone. She literally made me walk her down to my locker in the basement to prove to her I wasn’t on my phone and that it was in my locker where it’s supposed to be. There were many instances like this. Another coworker told me it’s because she had a huge crush on the manager harassing me and she was jealous. I had no idea what to do so I went to HR about it. Nothing changed so I quit and was told by HR that I was welcome back if I ever needed a job in the future. Years later I learned that the manager who was harassing me eventually was fired because he got a 17 year old girl pregnant. 

My job following that one I volunteered with a stipend as a teacher’s assistant because I was exploring a possible career path. Guys I poured my heart and soul into that job. I found my calling and my passion at that job. I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. When I first started I wasn’t given much direction. I wasn’t trained, I had basically zero guidance. I started out doing a lot of photo copies, grading, and projects for teachers.  After awhile though I started helping teachers more with “the problem children.” One teacher in particular had several very disruptive children. One was insanely ADHD and his medication made him violent and the other I’m fairly certain was bipolar. That’s just two examples. One of those students tried to throw a chair at the teacher one day and the other pushed a bookshelf over... it got bad sometimes. We had one little girl who wouldn’t stop biting people. Anyway that’s how I discovered I’m insanely good at working with difficult students. I would deescalate situations by recognizing triggers...calm children down that were having bad days or have them leave the room for a breather if it got to that point. The students I worked with showed a lot of improvement after I started working with them. For some reason I just had infinite patience and love for these kids. I loved my job every single day. The special education teacher would often assign me students to assist one on one and the guidance counselor had me tutor those more difficult students who were behind because she noticed I had developed a bond with them. I worked longer hours than was expected of me, I got to work early to prepare, i made my own schedule and was constantly busy or doing something. I never took a break. I always found jobs to do whether it was making copies or helping calm a student that was having a meltdown. I was constantly praised and told I was appreciated so so so much and then by the end of the year (the program I was volunteering for only had one year terms) I was told that if I had asked for a permanent job there I would not be hired because “I lacked initiative.... “I was utterly speechless. It’s been 5 years since then and I still feel wronged. Of all the things to complain about my job performance I 1000% disagree with that. I was completely heartbroken. 

Next job was pizza delivery. It was alright. I quit because I started going to college and the hours didn’t work. 

My job after that one I worked at a long term dog boarding facility. The woman/owner I worked for was completely insane. She made my first employer seem like a saint. Not only did she treat her employees like garbage, but she was also doing A LOT of things that were illegal. She would purposely change our hours on our paychecks because she didn’t want to pay us for full time or over time so she would just take off 10 hours and say it was a mistake and then pay the rest in cash under the table. She would threaten to subtract our hours on our paychecks because we “didn’t do something right.” We were not allowed to take breaks. At one point she said we couldn’t bring lunches to work anymore because it made us “sluggish.” She was also completely hysterical at times and would scream and yell at us. She called us morons and I was once again asked if I was on drugs because I can’t possibly be this stupid. She threatened to fire all of us daily for whatever reason she decided on that day to fixate on. If one of us forgot to wind the hose up she would have an absolute fit/tantrum and then threaten to fire us all because we were all incompetent idiots. She would also accept more money from customers so their pets would get special treatment like extra walks or something and none of those things would ever happen. I didn’t even know about that till after I quit. At this point I had zero self esteem and honestly started wondering if I had some sort of mental disability because I was basically reliving my first job experience x50. I only lasted four months and the girls I started working with had already quit. It was the longest four months of my life. Everyone was telling me to quit but before I started that job I told myself I wasn’t going to fail again. I was terrified of being let go. I was terrified of feeling like I failed. I tried so hard at that job because I was trying to over compensate for feeling like a failure at my previous job. 

I’m a good worker y’all. I genuinely care that I do a good job at every place of employment. I’m always on time, I’m reliable, I have a very flexible schedule, I’m not lazy, and I’m the kind of person who just wants to feel like i accomplished something at the end of the day. But I am so terrified of getting another job. I’m terrified of feeling like I failed again. Is this normal? Does everyone feel like this? Am I just a whiny person complaining about things most everyone deals with? Most days I really feel like something is wrong with me. I feel like I’m incompetent or stupid. I feel like if I try to get another job I’m just going to constantly feel like a failure. I don’t know what to do. 

I currently work for a friend at their family owned business but it’s for very little money. The only reason I stay is because it’s the most positive work experience I’ve ever had, but it’s not my dream job and it’s not what I’m going to college for. It’s getting me through school, but eventually I’m going to start my career and I’m legitimately terrified of it. I don’t know what to do.",19Apr2019,1
25,"My friend was bullied through high school, for the most part. The only way he survived was by being funny and being the “class-clown”. Now that we’ve graduated, he wants to be somebody that he can be proud of being.

26,"(Sorry for my English, it’s not my first language)

This year I moved to a new high school, it was absolutely terrifying, especially since everyone already knew each other.

But I found a great group of friends who are the funniest en sweetest girls, I adore them.

I also met another girl (let’s call her L) through them, they thought maybe we could get along well, and we did!

We had most classes together but she would always sit next to her other friend R, so I always felt like a third wheel. And L would only sit next to me when R was sick, had a different class etc.

L asked me once what my ethnicity was, I told her I am half Thai, half Dutch. And she found this really cool because her grandparents live in Thailand, we talked about our trips there and Thai food and the beautiful nature there.

But it starts to get really weird... She’s always talking about Thailand but ONLY when I’m around. It’s fine to like Thailand and love the culture, I think it’s really flattering she loves Thailand this much.

But she only talks about Thailand, Thai food and Asia kinds of topics when I’m around. She’ll just randomly sigh and go like “ugh I’m CRAVING pad thai!” and also refers to me as “a Thai” and not really by my name.

Sometimes I drop a hint here and there to some people that I grew up with a strict Thai mother and there is a little cultural difference. And she’ll laugh and go like “haha Thai people are so cool!”

More examples could be the time she randomly said out of nowhere “hey OP, you’re so cool,” and I would ask why, she would answer “because you’re Thai!”

And today I wore these ankle length white socks with the evian water logo sign but instead it just said “okay.”

I also wore this white and soft pink sweater and some soft blush for that Ultimate Soft Girly Look. And she immediately told me things like “those socks look sooo Asian” “it’s so cute!” I was flattered but also weirded out because how do my socks make me more Asian? I was already Asian to begin with but ok.

I genuinely think she means well but I’m scared if I get mad with her I’ll lose a friend :(

How do I deal with this of am I just overreacting?",19Apr2019,3
27," My mom and I have been having issues lately. Firstly, she is never home and my sister and I are being taken care of by my aunt. I keep finding out about my mom's lies from my aunt. Two days ago I found out she had a boyfriend and whenever she went out with 'friends' she was actually out with him. I don't mind her having a boyfriend, but I hate all the lies. Now she's lies about where she spent the rent money. She lies and says it was for her credit card bills, but I keep finding out she gambled it all away. Her addiction to gambling has gotten out of hand especially when she dipped into my sister's and my collage funds.
 Lately she's been acting like I'm garbage conpared to my sister. My sister is everything to me and I'll do anything for her to have it better than me. A while back my sister joined NJHS (basically a programme for smart kids). When my sister was going to thw award ceremony, my mother said ""she is more advanced than both of you."" This is particular hurt me because I couldn't do any of the stuff I wanted to do because we moved around a lot. Of course I'm happy for my sister, but it hurts when my mom points out what I didn't do during my middle school years. Maybe I'm overreacting, but those words still hurt. 
 Now time for the reason I'm asking for help. I'm about to become a freshman is highschool and I don't want my last few years at home to be absolute hell. I want to make good memories, not bad ones. I plan to join the US Marines and go to a university, so I wont see her very much. Currently we've been arguing a lot. And for simple things. Like where I left a few papers. I'm really getting sick of all the arguing. Please help me stop it.

29,"Hi! I have been always a A- and A+ student. Yes, I have good grades, but lately this high school semester has been SO difficult. I have a serious problem and it is that I stress out easily. I am a perfectionist too (sometimes) and sometimes, I have crisis of ""perfection""; if I did a project but I don't like it, I would do it again even if I don't have enought time to do it all over again. I would press myself. I DON'T like at all being that way since it affects me myself, and also my family because I worry them. Now, they don't even care about my grades and they prefered a F non-stressed instead of an A+ full of health issues.

Like I said, I don't like being like that. Sometimes I exaggerate. But I don't know what to do! I want so bad A's, but  at the same time I do not want some B's... Another thing. My high school is one of those that is very strict and recognized academically. Also for being one of the most stressed but also best of the country.

""Why you don't go to another school?"" Because where I live this is the best one and the other ones are not even good.

""Organize your time"" Believe me, my life is full of organization.

30,"     I feel like I’m dating Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and it’s seriously conflicting a lot of things inside of me. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year, we’re both 23 years old. When we first started dating everything was peachy. He had a ton of drive and motivation and a killer good job with work ethic that was attractive to me. 

He has had a dark past and bad habits like liquor and cocaine.  He quit the coke but liquor is still something he will turn too when he feels stress.  Weed is something that has been constant in his life and isn’t going away any time soon.  I wasn’t living with him and didn’t get to experience the full wrath of him out of pot until recently. Before it was rude texts telling me to leave him alone because he’s anxious and needs space that he always apologized for. 

Around a 2 months ago he begs me to move in with him. ‘Conveniently’ he loses his great paying job around that time (he quit, didn’t give his two weeks or anything) after I move in and I’m making more then him now, buying his groceries or he won’t be able to eat, supporting him or he would be fucked financially.  Honestly,      I didn’t mind supporting him for that little bit because I seriously loved him. 
But now that he doesn’t have a good job he doesn’t have money for weed. And when he doesn’t smoke I have noticed I have no idea who he is. He’s loud, he’s aggressive, and he’s mean. 
      
The tipping point was last weekend his cat scratching at his door at 8 am while he was in the bath was enough to set him off to the point of him screaming at me to get off my ass, him leaving the house for an hour straight walking and texting me simultaneously that he’s leaving me and it’s over and to get out. He came home and told me to my face that he was using me this whole time, that he would kill himself if he could but he cares about his mom too much. He made sure to tell me he didn’t care about me like that. And that I have always cared about him way more then he has me. 
I just cried.

An hour later he cooled off and told me he didn’t mean it. He felt bad, etc... and I bought him 50$ of weed and he was all smiles.  Probably 300$ of my own money spent on his weed habit since I’ve lived with him so far. 
 When he’s good he’s good, when he’s bad he’s really fucking bad. I can’t forget about the things he says when he isn’t high and he doesn’t understand that. 
I like him when he’s high, but I am paying to date this version of him and I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore.",19Apr2019,1

33,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her, she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit.

34,"My boyfriend and i are having a really hard time. his stepmom is super strict and makes him turn in his phone (hes 17 btw) and rarely lets him out of the house. we don’t go to the same school so texting is our primary communication. 
we’ve adapted to his stepmoms rules fine, but last week she took his phone outright and i havent had direct contact with him since. we’ve been talking through friends, but now that its easter break we can’t exactly do that anymore. im so stressed about this (not bc i dont trust him) because i miss him so much and idk how to occupy myself. im also worried he may start to lose feelings for me by never seeing/talking to me :((. We have tried letters, but 1) they’re slow and 2) we both ran out of stamps. We are both also unable to drive on our own so we can’t even meet up anywhere. 
I also feel like I should add that he isnt a bad kid and hasn’t done anything to provoke his stepmom. if he did something wrong or was even technically grounded I would understand, but he’s not. She is notoriously mean, especially to him, and it doesn’t surprise me that she did this, but I still am anxious and don’t have any other ideas on what to do to make sure this doesnt hurt us. I may be biased in saying that he isn’t a bad person, but I can say with certainty that he isn’t a mischief, on drugs, failing classes, or anything of the sorts.

Thank yall so much",19Apr2019,3
36,"

   Okay so this is my first post ever and it is way too long so please forgive me but I felt like I need to give background information for clarity.

    So some information first. I’m currently a junior in high school with a 4.0 GPA and a near 1400 SAT score on the second try. I’m also in several extracurriculars that I’m very passionate about. The main ones include several band programs (pep band, marching band, pit orchestra, concert band. I have a little more to say on this later) and an academic team that is going to state for the third year in a row. I volunteer every week (nothing extreme it’s just one hour on Sundays and the sporadic service project as I’m in my schools patriot chapter of NHS). I also take pretty much any advanced class I can get on my schedule no matter how hard (mostly because I enjoy the challenge).

  So the issue is that as a junior in high school now is the most important time to be focusing on colleges and preparing to apply. Especially if one wants to get into of the better ranked colleges (not like Harvard or anything but just better that the ones that my high school is currently pushing). I know this and I have made an effort to do activities that will increase my chances, look good on applications, and that I honestly enjoy doing. The problem is that my dad doesn’t think that what I do is enough. If it was only that then I wouldn’t have a problem. Even if it was a little more than that I still wouldn’t have a problem as my entire family, including myself, is very goal driven.

  The problem is that my dad wants to push me away from ANYTHING that he doesn’t deem worthy enough or that I can’t justify other than the excuse that I enjoy it and it helps me relax. This has ultimately cumulated into several fights between myself and him and others in my family. Just for reference, his requirements are that it must relate to my desired field of study/degree (which he actually made me decide when I was in middle school but I won’t go into details as that could easily make this post even longer) or it looks good on a college application i.e. leadership or community service. This pretty much only relates to a few things I do. For marching band I was a section leader (kind of like an unpaid staff member at our school) and I do a program at my local hospital exploring and learning about different aspects of the medical field (I’m wanting to go to school to become a psychiatrist).

   It’s gotten to the point that he told me he had to approve my next year’s class schedule and has been trying to pull me out of band even though I’ve been playing for 6-7 years and pretty much my entire social life is rooted in it as the people in there are essentially my second family and I don't know where I’d be right now if it weren’t for them and my sister. My dad has even told me that he doesn’t want me to be successful in some of the clubs I’m in as they take away time that I could be using to do stuff he approves of.

   I just don’t know what to do anymore. I know that he just wants the best for me and for me to be successful but it’s starting to come at a cost of my mental state and happiness.

37,"So basically I have a project for my business class that includes having to design a bristol board for the product that you chose and I agreed to be in a group with two people that I'm not that close with. Reason why I chose to be in a group instead of doing my own project? Because first, they asked me and I have trouble declining people and second, they knew I was away when the project was assigned so they probably pitied me for not being in a group and decided to ask me so I wouldn't feel left out. Whichever it was, I agreed to do it anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's crucial to note that I'm a very artistic person and when it comes to projects, I like to have things clean and neat and very eye-catching. All throughout my school years I've always had the best looking posters and projects so I'm use to being extra with my designs. Especially since it's my business class and the fact that we are advertising a product, the bristol board should at least be nice to get peoples' attentions. But the thing is, when we began to work on the board my group members didn't seem to care that the bristol board they chose was bent and used. They also didn't seem to mind that the lines they cut weren't straight or that using the hot glue gun wrongly would result in air bubbles and angled papers. I didn't want push myself too hard on them because they did offer me to join and they also agreed on the product that I suggested we should do. I also wanted to help them out and inform them on what would look nicer and what method would be easier as a way to help them improve but then I realized that doing so would seem arrogant and pushy on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not close with my group members at all. There are three of us in total and I only recently started talking more to one of them and the other person I literally met two days ago. I knew that I had to take initiative if I wanted the end product to look good because both of them seemed out of it and like they didn't even want to be there. My problem is that doing so and being a leader to two people I barely know and to two people who invited ME in the first place would look very conceited and assertive. They have great ideas which I really like but their output is terrible. I really did try my best to guide them without seeming too pushy but I'm afraid it's not working. The project is due in less than a week and the only way we could finish is if we meet up at someone's house in which I hoped wouldn't have to be my place due to the fact that they are already coming over to create the product we are advertising. One of them decided to bring the used bristol board home and said would work on it over the weekend before meeting up and I don't know what to do or how to think.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home, I texted them that I had found bristol board at my place that was new and unused that we could use for our project and that I have all the supplies to work on it. So I asked them if they wanted, I could work on it with the new board.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so guilty. More than guilty. I feel horrible. Dirty even. We have no time to meet up and discuss it and even if we did and decided to work on the board together, I know they wouldn't like the fact that I would be constantly over them telling them to be careful and to not get any glue on the pages and that certain colours look better than others and also there's the fact that I'm not close with them so I don't have the audacity to take over and tell them that their way is bad. I don't want them to see me as an arrogant person who knows what's right and what's not but it's impossible to show them how to make a project neat in such a small time span without sounding like a know-it-all.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted them that they just need to tell me their ideas and I'll be set but they haven't responded since and I'm afraid they won't respond at all.  I offered to do it myself and if they don't want me to then that is completely fine. I made sure that they have the final say because they are my group members and making rash decisions by myself isn't something I do. It was a selfish act and I guess I'm just writing this down because it helps with my restlessness.

I am having some issues with the way my girlfriend is thinking about herself. Basically, she is really anxious about the way she looks. She is constantly complaining about her figure or face not being good enough. It's an issue for me just because I can see how sad she can get while having one of these moments. I am there for her all the time but whatever I say she decides to ignore. Honestly, I don't know why she feels like she is not good enough as I have never been so attracted to a woman like her before. Both by the way she is and physically.

40,"TOILET CLEANING BASICS

Many people just hit the toilet with some cleaner and a toilet brush and call it a day. And while that does help, there’s much more to the toilet than meets the eye. Below you’ll find areas of the toilet that need to be scrubbed, as well as some common cleaning issues you may encounter. 
Toilet drain: Obviously, if your toilet overflows, you have a clogged drain. But you can avoid reaching this point by learning to recognize when a toilet drain needs cleaning. Pay close attention to how the water flushes. Does it seem slower or weaker than normal? Then it’s time to clean out the drain with a plunger.
Toilet mold: Toilet bowls are dank and dark places, which means they create ideal habitats for mold. This is especially true if you live in a humid climate. But some molds can be bad for your health, so you want to make sure you’re taking the proper steps to eliminate every spore. Additionally, a moldy toilet is no way to impress visitors.
Dirty toilet: No one wants to see or use a dirty toilet. And the bowl and drain aren’t the only parts you need to clean. Take the time to thoroughly clean the toilet seat, as well as the sides and tank. Be mindful of the cleaners you use in the toilet tank, though. Some can damage the inner workings of your commode—such as the flapper—so you’ll want to read over manufacturer’s instructions before choosing a scrubbing solution.
Toilet grout: The base of your toilet is sealed using grout. Grout is porous, meaning it stains easily. Scrub out stains with the help of a toothbrush and commercial or homemade grout cleaner. If you make your own solution, however, you want to be mindful of cleaning products that should never be mixed.
Cleaning the inside of a toilet bowl: Here’s where your toilet brush and cleaner come in. As with your toilet tank, you’ll need to read over your manufacturer’s instructions to be sure you’re not using chemicals that can damage your commode. Optionally, you can avoid unnatural products altogether, and make a DIY toilet cleaner.
TOILET BOWL STAIN REMOVAL

As with any household item that gets daily use, the toilet bowl is prone to discoloration. Here are two of the major types of stains you’ll have to look out for, as well as tips on removing them. 
Cleaning toilet bowl waterlines: Toilet bowl waterlines can be caused by mold or mildew, and we’ve got advice on cleaning that in the next section. However, stains can also be caused by hard water. You can purge your porcelain of hard water rings with your toilet brush and a simple mixture of borax and vinegar. For really stubborn stains, you may want to use a borax and vinegar paste and break out a heavy duty scrub brush.
Cleaning the toilet bowl lid: The toilet seat is also prone to staining, so make sure you don’t leave it out of your cleaning, especially the underside. Here again, check the manufacturer’s instructions before purchasing cleaners so you don’t damage the lid. You can remove toilet seat stains by applying baking soda to discolored areas and scrubbing with a damp sponge. Cleaning the toilet seat will take some effort regardless of whether you buy a product or make one yourself, so be prepared to put some work in.
WHAT IF YOUR TOILET BOWL IS CLOGGED?

A clogged toilet is not only messy, it’s gross. You’re going to want to tackle this problem before it gets out of hand. Here’s what you’ll need: 
Materials: Unsurprisingly, unclogging the toilet bowl can be messy. Gloves are never a bad idea here. You’ll also want to make sure you have plenty of absorbent materials on hand, like newspaper or old towels and rags.
Tools: Simple clogs can often be cleared out with a high-quality, ball-shaped plunger. If, after plunging, your toilet doesn’t flush on the first try, move on so you don’t overflow the toilet. At this point, you can use a snake to try to clear the drain. And if that doesn’t work, you may need to call the plumber.
Products: You won’t have any trouble finding commercial clog fighters at the grocery store. If you rent your home, however, you’ll need to read your lease before using these. Some landlords—especially those who manage historic buildings—strictly forbid certain products because they can damage older pipes.

As we’ve mentioned, mold is both disgusting and hazardous to your health. The following tips can help you keep your toilet sanitary and shining. 
Toilet mold removal: You can get rid of mold using a scrub brush and a simple solution of 1 cup bleach to a large bucket of water. Make sure you wear gloves, and turn on fans and open windows so the room is ventilated.
How to remove black mold: Not all black molds are toxic. However, you don’t want to risk working with those that are. Dangerous black mold should be removed by professionals, like ServiceMaster Clean.
Toilet mold caulk : If the caulk around your toilet base gets moldy, you can clean it with items easily found in kitchen. Either white vinegar or lemon juice will do the trick. Soak an old toothbrush in the vinegar or lemon juice, and scrub those spores.
In addition to having the toilet cleaning tips you need, Merry Maids also tackles commodes as part of their bathroom cleaning services. Contact your local branch, and we’ll take care of cleaning that bowl so you don’t have to.",19Apr2019,1
41,"I'm sorry if this is incoherent, I can't really think straight right now. 
If it helps, I'm a 16 year old girl. 
tl;dr at the bottom

So I decided it was a good idea to go on my dad's computer...stupid idea, I know. Basically I went on it because I happened to be walking by and I saw what looked like a chat room and it seemed suspicious...basically I ended up finding that my dad has been cheating on my mom for quite a while now. 

Now the problem lies in that I can't tell my dad I know because then he'd know I was snooping around on his computer, and I can't tell my mom because she has no job and it would probably break her heart (assuming she doesn't know, but I have some evidence that she might to some extent) so if she found out and tried to divorce, she'd have nothing. 

And I have two younger brothers and I feel like if I told her I would ruin the entire family. 

And then my dogs would have absolutely no idea what's going on and that honestly makes me the most worried. 

That's probably the least important thing honestly. 

I have no idea what to do. Should I tell my dad that I know? 

tl;dr: I decided to go on my dad's computer and found out he's been cheating on my mom for a very long time now, I can't tell him that I know because I wasn't supposed to be on his computer. I can't tell my mom because she has no job. I don't want my parents to get divorced but I also know this isn't right.",19Apr2019,3
42,"So about a month ago I began working on a team of rom hackers for a small project. I joined out of interest for the subject and because it was being created for a youtuber I enjoyed. 

I was quickly accepted into the team but there was another aspect I also cared about attached. Characters could be submitted as possibilities for the game. I was weary that my character would even get in as over 400 characters were added but I felt that since my bracket was small id have a chance.

The characters were chosen through vote and my character had made it through the preliminaries. I was in the top three pics. That night my character lost by a single vote. I was devastated that night but I still wanted to work on the hack.

For some reason however, whenever I get a notification about the hack on my phone or find the urge to work on it I just feel a rush of sadness over take me. Furthermore, when I think about or play the associated property I based my character on I feel the same anger and disappointment. I can't even listen to the soundtrack of the game anymore as it makes me upset listening to it.

Maybe I'm just being melodramatic but this feeling of rejection has really hit me. I really want to get back to working on the hack and listening to the property I love but I'm having so much trouble.",19Apr2019,1

47,"So I am hostess at a niceish restaurant in an expensive neighborhood in NYC. The clientele who i typically see tend to be a lot of wealthy families, and well off couples. So tonight I had a guy place a to go order. He came to pick it up, and he was really good looking- maybe in his mid 30s. Our eye contact was incredibly intense, and I could tell that he was interested in me. It isn’t uncommon that customers show their interest in me, but for some reason this guy just seemed different. Our chemistry was palpable, and I’m finding myself to be ridiculously curious about/ attracted to him. I’ve never had the desire to reach out to a customer until now. I have his cell, since he gave it to me so i could call when his order was ready. I can’t fight the desire to text or call him, but it seems risky. What if he has a family, and I made up the attraction? What if he comes and complains to my boss that one of his employees was unprofessional and tried to contact him personally? It seems risky but I can’t fight this incredible attraction/ urge. He also lives within walking distance, so this isn’t like a “I’ll never see him again” type of thing. What should I do?",19Apr2019,1

Now to the girlfriend part she just found out that her dog needs it's ovaries removed at a cost of £1000 to £2000 pounds.

51,"Good afternoon, this actually is one of my first posts on reddit, and I'm looking for some key advice at the moment. Its regarding a program I'm being excluded from based on my race.

Some background first:

I am a junior in high school and right now I am in a college-prep program that helps me prepare for my current classes, future classes, and even college. I sacrifice my saturdays and summer vacation to go to this program and have been doing so since my freshman year. This program has been great to me and I don't regret any second of it, they have given me countless opportunities and helped me with a lot. This program lets kids like me know about opportunities that we may not have known elsewhere, and things like going to Cornell University for SPLASH 4 times my freshman and sophomore year, where I took interesting and creative classes, become available to me. They have helped me with essay writing and next year will practically walk me through the college application. 

Today I received a message, I never have seen before, or would ever think of seeing. 

It goes as Follows
""Hey! I wanted to give you a heads up about a program we're encouraging some juniors to do (COAP). Unfortunately, we don't believe you're eligible because the grant for the program is thru a program that we're not affiliated with and is funded for students of color. .. . . .. "" (it goes on to say I can ignore the messages because its going to the group chat im in, just to long and unimportant to type)

So, I'm not mad at my program because of this, and frankly I don't really care about the program because it doesn't relate to my needs and would not really benefit me a lot. But I was wondering, isn't that racist? Maybe racist isn't the term, but maybe discriminatory? or exclusive? I mean if you just flip the term, and say ""only for whites"", that would be seen as racist? would it not?

I'm looking for second thoughts on this, maybe some clarification on the program, but how are they allowed to restrict whites from a program?

Honestly, in the end, maybe I'm just a white male and don't understand my full privilege just yet",19Apr2019,2
52,"Okay so. My man and I have been together for almost 2.5 years. We have also known each other for 11 years. We had sort of similar pasts and due to a weird family situation we were very close for a bit when our parents became roommates at a house when I was 8 and he was 10. That situation ended horribly and violently.

Years later we would catch up on Facebook every summer until one year we realized that we went to the same high school. Over that summer we became super close again, talking about all we had gone through because of our past and our situations at the time. He confided in me and I confided in him every dark part of our pasts. He became my bestfriend in a matter of months. By November we were in  a relationship in which he was practically my first everything. When we first started the relationship he was very clear that he needed me to like his church and that he was interested in a relationship for the long run. I didn't like the idea, because at the time I was 16. He was 18. But I went for it.

We have also had our issues. He has this strong fear of having people important to him leave. This happened with his mom leaving him as a kid, his grandfather dying, his bestfriend ditching him, and because of those things he was always afraid to lose me.

There were bumps in our relationship in which I got accused of cheating with one of my bestfriends of high school (he was a guy and my boyfriend can get jealous) but his sister was hanging out with us (she is the same age as me and we were close friends as well). In this situation a neighbor of his (a girl was a similar age of him and I'm guessing this was all due to jealousy) but she had texted my boyfriend saying that she saw me making out with my bestfriend. After that our relationship was rocky until he finally accepted that I did not actually cheat. In that whole ordeal I ended up pushing my bestfriend away. There were other instances of him getting jealous but none as bad as the first time.

Now its more or less him being needy. I am busy with school and work as well as he is. But I also have my friends and family that I hang out with occasionally. So my boyfriend and I see each other on the weekend and free times that we have during the weekend. He will drop hints saying that he doesn't have friends and that he needs friends. But I don't know what to do about that. He has friends, he just doesn't get involved and is a very introverted person. He also does not approve of any inappropriate fun. When he was younger than I am now he used to smoke and drink, but I am not allowed to in his eyes. I have to be a good girl.

So now it has gotten to the point where I would rather hang out with my friends and have fun. Without the worry of missing a text or not giving him attention. Not feeling tied down at a young age. Hell maybe I would even like to break a few hearts instead of be in a relationship. I do love him though. So very much. And I don't want to lose him completely, sometimes I just wonder if it would be better to just be bestfriends or even just friends. However, I've talked to him about friendship after a break up and he made it very clear that he didn't stand for the idea.

In the end I sit here wondering if I truly want to be single. Or if I want to stay with him so that I don't validate his fear of everyone that gets close to him leaving. And possibly losing my first love for good.

54,"So we’ve been together for like over 6 months, but I’m getting second thoughts. She’s not approving of me smoking weed, she doesn’t like any of my friends, and our relationship has been kinda rocky for like 3 months. I’m not really that physically attracted to her anymore. So it seems like we should break up, right? Well here’s where the problems come in. 
1. She’s been a part of my life for SO LONG and I’m terrified of change
2. I have a bunch of memorabilia of her around my apartment and it would feel really weird to take it down
3. I’m always desperately lonely when I’m not with someone. She’s not the ideal partner but she is a partner, and I always need that.
4. I’m obsessed with physical affection and getting used to living without that would be really hard
5. We go to the same college, and it’s EXTREMELY small. Like high school from a small town small. Everyone knows everyone and everyone knows us as that “perfect couple” and I would have to individually tell everyone that we weren’t together anymore which would be really hard
6. There’s still a part of me that loves her. It’s gonna hurt for me lose her. 
7. She loves me for me. I’ve never met someone like that. I know it’s gonna be years until I do again.
8. She’s close to my family and I’m close to hers, seeing them would be unavoidable.

I procrastinate, I'm forgetful, I have chronic IBS issues and social anxiety... I had this realization today that when I was waitressing or looking after kids, it never felt like work. I love being active and talking to people and being in a stimulating environment. I feel I'm at my best. At a desk job... not so much. I'm on a new medication now and I'm hoping it will help but I'm so worried I'm going to mess up this job somehow or just be plain miserable. I'm second guessing my entire decision to major in and work in the field because when I did, it was about achieving financial independence so I could move out of a toxic home situation. I am now financially independent... but my anxiety/depression spiraled out of control during both of my desk job internships (6 months, full time). I'm so scared I won't be able to live up to expectations. I was shocked I even got an offer because I felt like a mess all the time. I guess I'm good at communicating and sounding smart. But I feel like an anxious messy failure.

It’s gotten to the point that during college I dread going back to my hometown for breaks and do everything possible to avoid it. While at home I have a loving family and brothers who mean the world to me, just being in my hometown leads me to constantly reflect on all of the mistakes that I’ve done over the last few years and it simply eats away at me on the inside and it really taints the time I spend with them, with me feeling miserable by the time my break ends and I want to leave as soon as possible. The only times that I really feel happy with my entire family is when we go away on trips away from my hometown, or when we go back to my home country.

68,"TL;DR: I don’t meet the prerequisite for an IB Bio class and I’m not sure I can meet it before the end of the semester, should I beg the teacher who teaches the bio class if she can let me in it?

I am in high school. I wanna be in biomedical engineering, so obviously I need to have Bio classes and Physics classes. Unfortunately I need Chem classes too. I need a B or higher in both semesters of my Chemistry class to take that Bio class. Last semester I got a B. But, I just bombed a Chemistry quiz dropping my grade from a recoverable 83 to an 81. Our lowest test does get dropped, but only at the end of the semester. By then I will have done at least another quiz and and a test and some worksheets, so I’m not sure if that test dropping will even affect my grade.

Now, I do know the bio teacher and have a good relationship with her (had a 101 in her freshman bio class last year) and I think she knows I would be a good fit for the Bio class. 

With all that being said, I have 3 scenarios 
...

1. I don’t get an 84 or above even after my final and I try to beg the bio teacher to slide me in the class (kinda likely)

2. I get an 84 in the class BEFORE the final but the final drops me below a B (unlikely)

3. I get over an 84 and I keep it (very unlikely)

I know chem almost goes hand in hand with bio and careers in bio so I’m scared that I won’t be able to get in the class and it will hamper my chances of getting into a really good college since colleges like IB classes",19Apr2019,1
70,"Any advice on how to end a long friendship? I’ve realized recently that I my “best friend” is really draining. We met in college and she ended up moving multiple states away a couple of years ago so we only see eachother a few times a year now. 

We were close but recently I’m realizing that I don’t even get joy from talking with her anymore. When I see that she’s calling me I don’t even want to answer it because I know it will just be her complaining about her day and going on and on about everything in her life (mostly negative) while I’m acting super supportive and then she will kind of off-handedly asking me how I am at the end of the conversation but I don’t even go into much detail cause I feel like I’m just being a bother and she’s just waiting for her turn to speak. She complains about the same stuff over and over again and I’m just tired of it. I found out she’s spending the summer in my state a couple of hours away to work for the summer and I’m not even finding myself excited about it. I can just already envision the fights that will happen when I don’t go to visit her like every weekend because she will expect me to come see her all the time while she’s up but I’m not going to want to drive all that way all the time and I know she’s not going to be understanding about it. 

Her wedding is coming up in the fall and I’m supposed to be a maid of honor but idk. I’m putting off buying my dress because I’m not sure how the summer is going to go. There’s a lot of other things, too. We can’t even talk about a lot of stuff because we have very different views. She is very liberal and I’m more conservative but when she just “wants to have a talk” it ends up with her seeming very condemning of my thoughts and almost threatening to end our friendship because she “doesn’t know if she can be friends with someone who thinks that way.” Like she literally almost ended our friendship over the fact I voted for Trump.

It started with talking about Church, which lead to me telling them I didn't really believe in God as much as I do, and that I feel like I'm probably agnostic. My parents got pretty mad at that, and this isn't the first time they've gotten mad because I have a different opinion. They've told me it would be hard to love me if I wasn't straight (I'm pretty straight but it's still confusing for me as of now), and my mom told me I wouldn't be a full woman if I didn't have children. (I might just want to adopt, but ok mom). 

I don't know what to do. I feel like there's been a lot of tension with me and my parents. I feel really unloved and unwelcomed right now. My mom tells me to stop trying to brainwash my sister. It sounds fake but it's true, and I don't know what to do. They've given me so much that I can't imagine cutting them off, and of course, I still care about them. It's just been hard lately because I know they don't love me unconditionally. My mom thinks I'm going to suffer for not having faith, and she's told me she's really upset for me. I don't hate them, but I feel like they just don't love me anymore, and it's hard living in a house where it feels like no one loves me. What can I do to make our relationship better?",19Apr2019,1
73,"I rent the second floor of a 2 family home that also has a renovated attic where another tenant lives. For 7 months out of the year, my landlord lives in a room in the unfinished basement. I have only had quick glances into this room and all I remember seeing is a toilet in the dead center of the room. I did not know he would be living in the basement when I moved in here. He does lives in Florida for 4 months out of the year which is very nice because he's not constantly around. When he is here, he rarely leaves the premises. Laundry is in the basement I can't go down there to do laundry without him making small talk or asking something of me. I don't like the wash my undergarments around him. When he is not in his basement room, he is putzing around the property all day doing God knows what. Everyday when I get home from work, he is in the driveway and approaches me about something, whether it is to advance my car one inch further into the space (legit), asking if I will store his furniture he can't sell, asking me if he can enter to do some home improvement project, etc. I try to pretend to be on the phone every time I get home now so I have an excuse to avoid him. Anyways, here's my most recent dilemma. My upstairs neighbor does not have cable/internet hookups so the router is in my unit and we split the internet bill; the account is in my neighbor's name and she owns the router. My landlord just got back from Florida and is living in the basement again. Today, he asked me if we could split the internet bill when my neighbor moves out in 2 months, and I said that would be fine. He immediately asked me for the wifi password. I am inclined to say ""no"" because he is not yet paying for it and having 3 people using it will just slow it down. I told my neighbor about this and she said he asked her for the wifi yesterday and she told him ""no"" for the same reasons I gave. Apparently he thinks we don't communicate because why else would he go behind her back asking me for it when she already said no? 

I told my landlord ""no"" to the wifi and cited it's because the account is not in my name so that's not my call, and all he said was ""K. TY"". 

Two questions: AITA for not giving him the info? Should I move?",19Apr2019,2
74,"A brief background, I'm in my last year and last quarter of college so I feel like I should almost just ignore it, but I really don't want to have to do group work with this person again because I find it emotionally upsetting. 

I suspect that this person does not like me because I've been open about the fact that her male friend sexually assaulted me 3 years ago and I've never backed down from that even after her friend group harassed me online last year and tried to silence me. 

I never cause a problem with her in class or anything, I mostly avoid her. 

Well, today, we were doing testing on an app that we're creating in different groups. It was all on paper as this is the first prototype, so we had to draw each frame and have a person test the usability. 

We had someone volunteer while I was setting up, so that person was waiting when this girl (who I'll call Bully) comes up and says, ""I'm testing it first."" I said, ""Oh, well we already have someone waiting but you can go after her."" Bully glares and yells to my professor across the room, ""They just said I have to wait for someone else to go first. Is that true?"" And my professor pretty much said, ""I don't care."" 

So, she ended up going first. Right off the bat she was super aggressive about the layout of our app. Which is fine, it's critique, but it was over dumb shit and specifically directed at me. For instance, since it's all hand-drawn and it's a video streaming app, we only drew out a sample page of one movie. 

She immediately starts going, ""Why do I have to pick that movie. I don't want to pick that movie."" I responded, ""Well, it's just the assigned task we need to see you complete."" 

Bully (aggressive tone): ""Well, I don't want to pick that one, you should have more options. What if I want to see something else? Why does your app only have one movie?""

Me: ""It doesn't, it's just that that's the task and that's the only movie description that we sketched out."" 

She stopped after that but then told me we should have laid out her tasks for her. We did, on a paper right in front of her, but I guess she is 22 years old and can't read. Part of usability testing is to see if the participant can figure it out themselves, if they can't, we need to fix something. 

It wasn't that she ran into issues that bothers me, her tone the entire time was very, very aggressive. I don't know how else to describe it. She wasn't like that with anyone else and we didn't have any other participants act like that.

I've had her in critique groups before where she was practically ripping my work to shreds and I said, ""Well, the reason I did it that way was on the advice of the professor."" And she barked back, ""The Professor's word isn't *law*."" I changed my design based on Bully's harsh critique and ended up getting a low grade because my professor said I should have kept it how I had it. I don't know if that was intentional sabotage/bullying, but I suspect it was. 

With what happened today, even my partner, who is completely unrelated to the sexual assault issue and knew nothing about it caught on that this girl was being aggressive with me and remarked about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gone to my university before asking for no-contact orders so that I did not end up in the same classes as the people who harassed me last year but they declined to do it because I didn't press charges against my rapist. I have a trauma counselor who has offered to get in contact with my professors about keeping me separated from this girl before, but I felt weird about going through with it because I didn't want to put my professors in an uncomfortable position. 

I guess I could go through with it, but I run into the issue that literally everyone likes this girl. Everyone, because she is well-known, charismatic, and ""quirky."" I guess endearing to some people.

But, I just find her extremely, aggressive when she speaks to me and it makes me feel very uncomfortable. 

I also feel uncomfortable sticking up for myself to her face, because when they were harassing me last year online and I pointed out their hypocrisy or pointed out how awful they were being, they found some way to warp it and shut down the conversation by calling me and my friends random, conversation-ending names like ""nazi"" or ""abuser."" They called my male friends rapists for defending me.

77,"For some context, my mom has legal custody over me because my mom and dad hate each other. I love my mom, don't get me wrong, but she has messed up my life in so many ways I can't even fully explain. I'm depressed, suicidal, I have bad social anxiety because of her. She yelled at me for small things when I was a child, belittling me and telling me if I didn't change how I was I wouldn't be anything. I'm what most teachers would call a problem child, at least when I was in middle school. I was highly ADHD and was bullied constantly because I was the only white kid in an all Hispanic/black community. My mom would tackle these issues in the worst way possible, making a scene and embarrassing me and giving the kids more fuel. Last month was the final argument with my mom and me. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of our feelings were let out, and boy it was ugly. I told my mom how I felt, how I believe she only cared about me because she had to. She said some things and tried to victimize herself and say how I wasn't easy and I caused HER to be suicidal (Which I've seen, as a kid she tried to kill herself twice, scarring, I know.) It got bad where after years of depression, fighting myself and being on the verge of death twice, I finally told myself that I didn't want to keep living like this. I got my shoes and left. Eventually, the cops found me and asked what happened. I told them shit happened and told them I was on my way to a bridge, I was going to kill myself. An ambulance came and I was put into a hospital. I went to sleep to find not my mom, but my dad. I saw him on the weekends but we weren't really that close, he was just an escape from the nightmare that was my mom. After that, we convinced the doctor that it was just a flash of strong feelings and that I wasn't suicidal. Now a month later and I haven't seen my mom. My dad drives me 40 minutes twice a day to drive me to school. He has been nothing but supportive and I'm the least stressed than I have been in a while.

I want my dad has custody over me, transfer schools to where he lives and be done with my mom. I love my mom, and I don't want to completely disassociate myself from her, I just can't live with her. But I heard that if I was to move, she would have no more reason to live because my 17-year-old sister would move away for college and she wouldn't need to worry about me. She said she would kill herself if I moved away, and knowing her I feel confident she will. Now I have this choice, be happy with my dad, but live with the knowledge my mom is dead because of me?

I’m so screwed. I’ve made so many bad decisions by trusting the wrong people. I don’t know what the hell to do now but I feel like I have to do *something*. 


Basically ignorance was bliss up until a couple years ago. I struggled with drug addiction as a teen but ended up being able to quit my wild ways when I got the surprise of my life when I was 20. My boyfriend and I had become pregnant. His whole family and him confirmed that he was sterile. So we weren’t being safe. I’d like to blame my mother being the type to not allow me to go to sex ed classes as a kid but I probably knew better.

My boyfriend was excited and wanted to get married right away. I loved him, I believed he would take care of me and get me away from my controlling parents, so I married him. After that my relationship with my parents became trying to say the least. I always felt like we got along better when they had complete control over me.  Even when I was in the grips of my heroin addiction I felt more loved by them than anytime when I was doing well with my life. 

My husband and I got our own place. We struggled a lot, we went to counseling, had a crash course in managing our finances, started going to church to meet more people in our situation and leave partying behind. But we did it. He got a good job so I could stay home, we ended up getting pregnant again, and again, and again.  We had four kids when my husband checked out in the middle of 2017. I guess he ended up hating being a father/husband . He became abusive towards the kids, fooling around on me with different women. We even had CPS on us because of what he admitted to doing to our marriage counselor. My last ditch effort to save our marriage was unsuccessful.  I ended up going to therapy alone where I learned the pattern of behavior I was used to from him and my parents was toxic. But I had no way out.

I talked through it with my therapist wherein we came to the agreement that I would accept help from my parents to get away from him. We talked about how to keep boundaries in place with my parents so I wouldn’t fall into the trap of being dependent on them. 

Wellllll, that didn’t work. My husband went MIA when I left him. I had to get an entry level position job right away which didn’t even give me enough money to pay for childcare. My parents became certified through the state to watch my kids and as I found out a couple weeks ago, made more money than me doing it. They also bought my car out of repossession when my ex stopped making the payments on it and put it in their name. Opened a joint bank account because i couldn’t qualify for one on my own and let me rent a house they were property managers of for incredibly cheap despite being evicted out of my apartment when my husband left. All of which seemed like a great things at a time when I was struggling my hardest. 

I ended up doing well at my job. Things were going smoothly. I should have worked harder to become independent from them, but I just really thought things were going to be good now. After about a year of being separated I started dating again and going out when my ex had the kids every other weekend. But every time I did my parents shunned me for not being a good mom. They blamed me for the courts giving my ex any custody. And constantly berate me for not fighting harder to keep my kids full time so I could go “party” on the weekends. In actuality my ex did over 180 hours of counseling and my lawyer basically told me I was S.O.L. about the whole thing. Unless I wanted to appeal and spend another year in court with a different lawyer, which I couldn’t afford. I did my best to reassure them that I loved the kids and they were my first priority and took the almost weekly offenses in stride. 

Then last July I ended up reconnecting with an old boyfriend. I fell in love with him all over again, hard. He fell for me equally as hard. I introduced him to the kids after a couple of months and fell even harder when I saw the kind of dad he was to my kids. He started staying over more and more and we talked about getting married when my divorce was final. We ended up not being safe one night and I found out I was pregnant a few weeks later. We were both ecstatic . The kids were excited, even my parents liked him and were excited and thanked him for sticking around “despite me having 4 kids already.”  My ex was finally court ordered child support and took the kids an extra weekend a month. We came to an agreement on our decree and got our divorce underway. I ended up being able to take less hours at work so I could stay with the kids more and we talked about my boyfriend supporting us so I could be a stay at home mom while I went on maternity leave and got my real estate license. 

Then the bombshell. My wonderful boyfriend relapsed on hard drugs after 5 years of being sober. Maybe I should have left him? But he was honest about it and seemed sincere about getting help. I limited his contact around the kids. And every week he would detox for a couple days but by the weekend he would use again. For the past four months things have just been getting worse. Last week was a breaking point. The kids were at their dads and he stayed over. Long horrible story short he put his hands on me. He didn’t hurt me physically but he scared me enough for me to call the cops. He got arrested and I gave the cops his things, I knew it included some paraphernalia but I didn’t care. I was pissed and hurt and I didn’t want him coming back and asking for his stuff back. 

Now he’s out of jail and I’m just waiting to see if he’ll go to prison or get clean or do anything but let’s just say the outlook is not so good. He’s upset but says he understands why I did it and he’ll be better “soon”. I still love him very much and I know he still loves me. I guess I’m just waiting to see what’s going to happen. My parents are understandably angry. But now are controlling things more than ever. 

They’re threatening to file for guardianship of the kids and are talking with a lawyer about grandparents rights. They’re saying I’m unfit and threatening me everyday to have the kids taken away from me. If I work late or ask to go out with a friend so I can talk about things or even go to an appointment they video chat me to make sure I am where I say i am and with who I say I am with. They’re threatening to have me drug and alcohol tested because they “know” I’m not staying sober and I’m putting the babies life at risk. They keep saying I’m seeing my boyfriend and that I care about him more than I do the kids so I should just give them up. It’s absolutely killing me inside. 

I’m so unbelievably stressed out and staying calm and anxiety free in my 6th month of pregnancy is becoming nearly impossible.  I have 2 grand saved up but they won’t let me access it because it was in our shared bank account and they moved it to a separate one of theirs. They’re threatening to not even babysit for me anymore unless I start being grateful for everything they do for me. Which would leave my kids unable to get to school and me without a job and homeless in a couple months. 

I’m exhausted and sad. I don’t know what to do. I’m so tired of putting up with my parents abuse but unless I just put up and shut up I’m screwed. I can do it. But not for very long. And I need a plan in the short term and the long term to get through this and hopefully be free from all of this soon. I’m not going to give up. I love my kids more than anything. For now they seem to be coping okay. We’re all still in therapy and I have a family care worker that I can talk to on the phone whenever things get to be too much. I just can’t seem to think clearly enough to make a plan. 

Any advice or well wishes would be helpful. I have friends I can talk to but I feel like a burden when I just call and cry on the phone to them for hours. They have family and lives to deal with also. But I need help.

89,"Hi everyone,

I'm in high school and I'm very concerned about my friend (16F). She's been diagnosed with ADHD and BPD and she survived a suicide attempt last year. She's doing much better now, but has drifted away from our friend group and started doing a lot of drugs.

It started off with just edibles, and while still illegal, I brushed it off because the whole school has tried edibles at some point. Then she started hanging out with the ""drug kids"" and getting into more serious stuff, like LSD and coke. I've tried talking to her but she always claims she's fine, but I think it's going to get out of control really quickly. She already shows some dependency on weed, and I'm scared that she'll get addicted to something more serious.

A major part of the problem is the people who she surrounds herself with. She hangs out with people who are an easily accessible source of drugs, and started dating someone whose parents are totally okay with all drugs and even provide them for her sometimes. Recently she offered me some LSD, saying she thinks  I'd have fun. She's normalized it so much that she doesn't see it as the problem that it is.

I'm just lost and don't know what to do. I want to talk to someone who can help because I'm worried about her future, but I don't want to end up getting her in legal trouble. What can I do to help her if she doesn't accept that she needs help? I've talked to another friend about my concerns and she sees it too so I'm not imagining a problem where there isn't one. Any advice would be really really appreciated! 

TLDR: friend (16F) is using drugs like LSD and cocaine to help cope with mental illness and surrounds herself with people who fuel this habit. I'm concerned for her well-being and future, but she refuses to acknowledge that it's an issue",19Apr2019,2

94,"TLDR at the end

&amp;#x200B;

Before I start I need to say that last year I rented a room without a lease and the lease-holder told me he'd have me keep the lease when he leaves at the end of the year. But he ended up giving the whole apartment to his friends and I had to move, which was very sad because I loved it there. It was sunny and close to cute coffee places... Following that and other room renting experiences, my mom told me that I should rent the whole place next time and sublease other rooms. In the future, I want to live alone but for the moment I like living with people.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this place that has reasonable rent and was close to my workplace. I bought furniture to rent the rooms all-inclusive. I'm taking the medium-sized room, while I rent the smaller and larger rooms. They are similar amounts to the other rooms I saw in that neighbourhood. I pay only around 100 for rent but I pay the internet, heating, electricity and netflix (that they use a lot), it all comes to more than 400$ because it's a main floor and winter is freezing where I live. They take more showers than me (I'm not dirty! I just shower less in winter than in summer) and they've told me they like it really hot (around 20 min shower!). And in addition, I bought all the furniture and the appliances myself. I think that when you compare our rents it is reasonable (650 for the huge one, 490 for the smaller).

&amp;#x200B;

We had a meeting a few days ago where they demanded I be more transparent, and we're friends, so I shared with them the rent amount, how much it all cost me in terms of furniture and appliances and how much I pay for heating and electricity. In addition, my stepfather is my warrantor (before renting this place they did a credit check and since I'm a student and only work part-time). They are both from abroad and one of them will leave in a few months (doesn't know exactly when but for sure before the end of the next lease) and the other plans to stay for five years (maybe not in this apartment bu tin the city). I promised her that I would give her the lease when I leave. I have no intent on hurting them at all, I know what it feels like to be in that situation.

&amp;#x200B;

They seemed to agree but now one of them is requesting another meeting because she has more questions. It has been a bit tense lately and I hate it. I just want us to be friends. Maybe they feel that they are paying too much? But at the same time, they knew the price before agreeing to be here, so I don't know what to tell them. I am still paying the furniture; beds, side tables, floor lamps and bedding, in addition to everything that goes in an apartment like mugs and plates etc.) Their motivation to get on the lease is to be able to incorporate it for next year's taxes (I don't know how it's called in English) but honestly, I have never done that before when renting rooms...

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe there is something I am not seeing here so please tell me if I am being an asshole because they sure make me feel like it. I hope I am not coming off as too defensive and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this... Also, they might be mad for the chores division maybe. They expected me to do the garbage and recycling and I missed it. I told them before that I was in a lot of stress because of finals, in total 25 pages to write in a week and a half and I can barely take care of myself. I know that is not their problem but when I came back after midnight having spent the whole day at the library and I saw that the garbage was open, ready to get out and a table with the chores division was right next to it, I didn't like it. I couldn't actually take out the garbage because it needs to go to the back and I couldn't do that during the night. I wish they were more sympathetic. The next day I expressed this to one of my roommates (bad idea because she became very defensive) and she said that honestly, it is not much to do the garbage and recycling and that they both had cleaned the bathroom and kitchen right before. I don't know how to continue this, she's mad at me, and we don't talk.

TLDR: My roommates want to appear on the lease for tax reasons, and I do not agree because my step-father is the warrant, he is the only reason I got this place (because I work part-time and the credit check).

100,"I don't get on with my family at all, they're all close with each other but they've always rejected me. My mother especially is a problem for me, we've never had a mother daughter relationship and growing up she was physically abusive, as an adult I had to move home temporarily where the abuse escalated. We stay in touch, see each other maybe twice a year, to keep things civil. 

Recently my nanna died - we knew she didn't have long, and again we're not close so it doesn't upset me. I feel obliged to go to the funeral, particularly as it's around the time of mine and my mother's birthdays so we'd normally plan to see each other anyway. 

I'm dreading it because I'm no good at faking being upset and suck at showing appropriate responses to people in these situations, going to a funeral without being upset is tricky enough for me to begin with. That I'm going to have to comfort my mother is worse again. 

I also know from my grandads funeral a few years ago my family are going to be hard to deal with too, they stood around talking about me 'just standing around talking to no one' with no acknowledgement that this was because they snub me! It's just all together awkward.

102,"I broke my ring finger (non-dominant hand) really badly in December (full story's in the comments, if you're curious, but it's pretty bad and I wouldn't recommend reading it if you're squeamish). Initially, they said I'd have full use of my finger by June. But even after tons of PT, I have next to no use of that finger yet, and it's looking like recovery's going to take longer than expected. Apparently, the bone's not healing as well as they'd hoped, and I'll probably need another surgery before I can use my finger again.

It's been a rough few months- I had to delay a semester studying abroad, I haven't been able to play guitar, I've been working like mad all semester to keep on top of my classes in addition to work I missed after surgery in December. Although it's been hard, I think I've dealt with it pretty well for the most part, and I've been able to keep pretty positive. But this May it'll be six months since the initial injury, and I'm just tired of dealing with it. It's taken a lot of grit and a lot of bravery to get through the pain, the trauma, and the fear, but six months of not knowing what will happen next (when I'll have surgery, what the surgery will entail, etc) has left me tired, sad, and scared.

104,"I don't know what to do. 

My family is made up of entirely engineers. My mother is super old school and only really thinks engineer, doctor and dentist are good jobs.

The problem is I hate all of those. I hate math, science. That shit. So when I finally realized after a very dark summer for me that I loved art and wanted to do it for a living. My mother couldn't handle it. I mean this is a women who made me have a doctor hairstyle so that I would think like a doctor. Up until highschool I didn't know any jobs existed outside the ones she liked. I thought people made cartoons for free and for fun.  Anyway. 

Ever since she found about about what I want to do, she has been trying to waste as much time as possible so I won't be good enough to get into art school. When I wanted to drop out of physics it took me a month to get her to agree and in the end I had to go to night school for it. So that was months of wasted time. It took even longer for me to drop chemistry (she doesn't care about bio so thank God) 

I've held out and didn't crack for a while now. But I've had enough. The second she sniffs the sign of a test coming up for math or english she forces me to study and take up like 3 hours on a 30 minute concept.

The thing is I know exactly what she's doing. She's done it before when I did something she doesn't like. She is wasting my time when I should be practicing art and then when I apply to art school and get denied she's going to turn around and laugh at me and say she knew I wouldn't make it and it's making my blood boil. My hands are shaking and I just know I will lose my shit infront of her if I fail the application. 

I don't know what to do. She's destroying my life and killing my soul and then calling me crazy when I talk back. School has become a fucking trigger word for me.

120,"Hi guys I have no clue what to do rn so if y'all could tell me what you would do in this situation then that would be so great. (Srry this is so long)

So, there are 2 people involved in this:
Person X (female)
Person Y (female)

 
 Background info
 

So X and Y have been friends for a long long time, and have hung out with pretty much just each other ever since. I joined their friend group a few years ago, and we really vibed, ya know? 

But time has passed and we are really different people now, and probably not compatible matches as friends anymore. The chemistry and vibes are not the same anymore.

______________________________________________________

 
 Relationships
 

Person Y is a chill person and we're good w/ each other, but me and Person X are pretty much the only close friends she has at our school.

Person X... oh boy, I should have seen the MAJOR red flags throughout the years because she would always seem irritated to talk to me and even talked abt me behind my back once. She was always so angsty and just plain rude. Ofc, she was super nice when I met her, but her true colours showed later. 

______________________________________________________

 
 What's happened
 

Well, X's attitude and behaviour reached its peak when she got angry and resulted in her saying some terrible things to Y. Y told me abt it and we decided we would distance ourselves from her, and we just talk to each other during lunch and not much towards X. I don't talk to her anymore and cut off all ties. SuRpRiSinGly, she has started being nice again. 🤔

However, the 3 of us sit together at lunch and unfortunately we don't have any close mutual friends to move to another table with so we just have to stay there, with X. 

I just don't know what's going to happen because it seems as if this isn't going anywhere.

 
The real dilemma:
 

I want to sit w/ my other friends though, (I vibe w/ them rlly well), but that leaves Y with X which pretty much forces them to talk to each other and Y can't distance herself as much, which is what she wants.

Also, Y and I went to my friends' table, I don't think she would fit in w/ my friends bc again, we're all rlly different and talk abt different things. Plus, idk what'll happen w/ X bc we would basically be abandoning her.

I really don't know what's right or wrong now.

123,"Hello, I'm not sure what will come of this, nor do I expect anything. Read what you will, say what you think.

I am currently a 20, almost 21, year old in a very good college. My sister graduated from here as a teacher, my friend in the tech industry, and my family assures me that getting a degree is the most important thing. Which is now probably my main problem. 

I grew up with older parents, my father was an RF engineer, think TV/radio stations, and had his own company for a while, things were good, but business became bad because once you fix everything, with new parts, there's not much else to be done. My father ended up leaving us around my age of 8, but not before we spent a lot of time together, fixing things. This became my favorite pass time, and still is. My favorite place is either under the hood of a car, or in the mountains on a dirt bike, as were his. I graduated High School, 6th in the class, and went off to college with nearly a full ride. Last school year was the best, after being the chubby kid that everybody picked on, I hit the gym the summer before, coupled with running, and a vacation to my brothers in California, I gained the confidence I needed to succeed, and I did. As I applied too late for engineering school, and it was already full, I was a Mathematics major, with plans to transfer into engineering my second year. This previous summer, my father passed. My family is a peculiar one, and instead of gathering for a funeral, we rented a beach house, camped in the mountains, and I found my love for dirt bikes in the mountains. We then returned home, had our funeral, and went back to our lives. I found a good job, which my father would have been very interested in, and I was content with that, but struggling with the loss every day. I had it bad, nightmares, couldn't eat, the whole bit. Then one night I got a call from my mother, and the almost two year old pup I had gotten on the first day of summer my junior year had been hit by a car. So I texted my boss, told him I wouldn't make it the next day, went home, and he was still alive. I fell asleep there with him in my arms, his skull had been fractured, and woke to my mother wrapping him up. I dug a grave, made a makeshift headstone, and headed back to my college town. I went to work the next day, only to lose my job, which I wasn't even given a reason, nor would my boss even talk to me about. Then this year, I expect due to my mental stress, depression, whatever you want to call it, I could not perform in the classroom. I couldn't focus on my studies, I'm broke, when previously I had a ton of spare cash to do whatever I needed, and I'm stressed all to hell. I can't explain why, but something is eating at me, and I'll I can think about is how I've screwed everything up, how I lost my full ride to school, how I lost my job, and how there is nobody else I feel I can go to when things get hard, as my dog and my father are both gone, those who I depended on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I want to do, and I can't think of anything else. I want to be an engineer, of some sort, I do not care. I wish to create things, to fix things, to improve things. I have a passion for cars and bikes, and would love to race, but that is not realistic, and now the one thing I know I want to do, engineering, is so far out of my reach that it seems impossible. Due to my lack of performance in the classroom, I am no longer eligible for transfer to our engineering school, and am completely lost. I have been applying for jobs for the past three months, denied for every single one. although I haven't applied to fast food spots or things like that yet, it is extremely disheartening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do with myself, or my life, and I'm not sure why I typed all these things. I'm not sure of anything, and I'm not sure where to start. I need to figure out how to live my life, because I feel I am starting from scratch. My father was self made, his parents were poor, he was poor, but he made connections, they paid for a few classes he needed, and he was on the top of his business, known by most, loved by many, so how in the hell am I supposed to live up to that, when it seems I have failed in the places that were most important to succeed in?",19Apr2019,1

Is it a bad idea to get back together with a set expiration date?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* I posted this on other subs to get max amount of feedback\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Alright guys I have been juggling this in my mind for a while now and I think I am just going in circles at this point so I need outside opinions from people who are not involved in the situation (I want to hear people's opinions who don't know I or my ex girlfriend) because my friends are basically telling me opposing suggestions 50/50.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND: \[Apologies for the length\]

So my Ex and I met in college and were together for a little over 2 years. The 2 years were great and we genuinely loved each other. We became a big part of each others lives; my friends became her friends, her friends became my friends, and we met each others parents/family. Throughout the entire relationship my Ex was dealing with depression and it became a stressing point ( and really the only stressing point ) for the relationship. There were a few other minor bumps in the road but for the most part everything was perfect except for her depression. As time went on she began to struggle in school and eventually lost drive and dropped out. I tried to help out and be there for her as much as I could but it became apparent that I could do little and it was a matter of her wanting to helping herself. We stayed together for a short time afterwards but eventually the situation became unhealthy for me as well and we both agreed that what was best for both of us was to separate so she could focus on herself even though we both still had really strong feelings for each other and didn't really want to break up. It was at a point where we agreed that what was best for us was not the same as what we wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

So we break up but throughout the year that we were separated we would see each other about once every other month just because we basically had the same friend groups. I dealt with the break up better than she did and was able to come to terms with things and more or less moved on pretty quickly even though my emotions for her stayed pretty strong because I found comfort in the notion that she would be in a better place because of the breakup. Every now and again I would get a ""I miss you text"" from her or her friends would mention that she was asking about me. At one point she even asked to talk to me about our break up and I obliged to try and help her get some closure. I was of the mindset that even though I still loved her I needed to keep my distance so that she could focus on herself and she could start to try and move on from me.  I felt like I was the more emotionally in control one and I needed to stay strong for her and not give in and give her a reason to cave and make a mistake she would regret later. It might sound fucked up but I felt like I was a doctor making sure she took her medicine (which was for us to stay separated so she could focus on her depression and get her life back on track).

&amp;#x200B;

Now this went on for a bit until one day (about a month ago) I got a little drunk and decided that enough time had passed and that it wouldn't be a big deal if I text her something along the lines of, ""I hope everything is going well with you"". This was the first time that I ever really initiated contact with her since the breakup. Later that night she sends me a lengthy text saying stuff like ""she cant stop thinking about me and that she wants to get dinner but only if I'm ok with it."" Normally I would have been able to control and suppress my emotions but since I was drunk I agreed. The next day I text her asking her to make sure she had thought this through and that this dinner is something that she was sure was in her best interest, and she assured me she had thought a lot about it. So we go to dinner and it was really nice. It was awkward at first ( it was the first time we had been alone together in over a year) but eventually we both relaxed and caught up with each others lives and I find out that she is moving back home in 2 months to try and start over and dig herself out of her rut. We kept everything respectful throughout the dinner, gave each other a hug goodbye and we end the dinner after about 2 hours or so.  I felt really good after the dinner knowing that she was taking action by moving home to try and improve her situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point she is just stuck in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about her for the rest of the week, and I can only assume I was stuck in hers. Last week we end up going to he same music festival with different friend groups. Things just end up happening where we eventually end up in the same group of friends. We both are not sober and eventually end up making out and ended up spending the rest of the festival together separated from our friends. Everything just felt right as if we had never even broken up. We kind of just stayed in the moment wound up talking until 4 in the morning not really considering the repercussions.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in the situation where she wants to reconnect and basically get back together. But because she is leaving home in 2 months I worry that she is setting herself up to be really emotionally damaged at the end of all this when she eventually goes back home or even worse if she begins to doubt going back home at all because of me. I know I will be emotionally fine when she has to go back home but I seriously doubt she will be able to do the same. My worst fear is that she is blindly following her emotions and not really thinking about what is really best for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have one side of me saying to trust that she knows whats best for herself and get back together and enjoy the last bit of time we have together and another side of me saying that there is no way she is getting out of this situation in an emotionally better place at the end of two months and that I should just walk away to basically prevent her from hurting herself.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read all the way to the end I REALLY WANT TO FIRST STAY THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Second of all I just want to hear what you guys think I should do, because at this point my emotions are in a place where I am incapable of making a rational decision.",19Apr2019,1

Unfortunately, my job is going to be in the same city my parents live in. My parents raised me by rubbing all of their insecurities on me. I was never allowed to make friends. I was seriously bullied in school since I had crush on a guy (sparing the details here). I was scared to share it with my parents because they would hit me (since the bullying was a result of me having crush on a guy and I am not supposed to have a crush or a boyfriend). I was compared with cousins and am still being compared for not earning as much as they do. I am being forced to get married (arranged - after talking to the guy for only 5 minutes) though I told them I am not ready for a marriage. All of my cousins younger than me are married and have children. They always are worried about what others (huge family and some neighbors) would think if I did something or not. They only care about their image in the  society they live in. I have never been happy since I was a child. I don't know how to make friends. I am very shy. I am very sensitive. I can't take criticism. I am, usually, scared and that allows others (especially bosses) to pick on me. My mother finds something wrong in everything everyone ever says to her. My elder sister had a boyfriend. They forced her to break up with him and she married the guy of their choice but even after that my mother tries to control her life. She wants my sister's relationship with her husband to be defined by her. To keep them from forcing me to do this or that, I went to the extent of blackmailing them with suicide. Their answer was, 'You will spoil our image in the society'. After everything I have been through, I don't want to live with my parents though the job is in the same city. I told them I am looking for a place near my office which is quite far from my parents' house and would take 2 hours to travel to one way. They played the 'what will they say' card again. In spite of that, I have already booked a place near my office and paid the deposit. I don't know if I should go there straight or go to my parents' place first. I am afraid they might physically and emotionally restrain me from going if I went to my parents' house. Honesty, all I want is to live happily without thinking that some one make so much more money than me or someone has so much gold. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression. Thoughts of hurting myself have crossed my mind more than I can count. I don't have the courage to pull it though. Please advise.",19Apr2019,2
127,"Hello everyone. I have been considering investing in a bowler or derby hat, but I have some concerns. In this day and age, old fashioned hats are worn by and associated with less than satisfactory people, and I don’t want to be thought of as that. I am a relatively attractive young man, and I keep myself well groomed, and I intend only to wear the hat at appropriate events, such as a situation where I would be dressed in a three piece suit. However I would hate to appear pretentious or worse- weird. I turn 18 years old soon and I feel like it would be a nice thing to add to my wardrobe.

128,"I’m 22m. I work an unglamorous job at $17 an hour in the Midwest as an online customer support “specialist”. My job appears to have many opportunities for career advancement, but I’ve applied for two internal job openings and have been declined for both even though I’ve been here for a year and a half now. 

After high school, I started attending an 18 month graphic design &amp; web development program. I dropped out after the 3rd quarter and I hate myself for it. I would most likely have a significantly better paying job doing something I’m truly interested in and definitely wouldn’t be writing this reddit post, but here I am. My dream job is to be the creative director at a web/graphic design firm or even better, own the business myself.

Now, all I can help but feel is regret and disappointment in myself for not committing to my “dream”. I would love to go back to the program, but I just can’t because now I have bills to pay and have to afford food and a social life. When I first started, I still lived with my dad, worked part time, I was single and didn’t have a lot of responsibilities. I’ve done research on people who have managed to land web design/web development jobs without completing an accredited program or degree, but I just don’t know if I have the drive to be self taught.. I don’t even know where to start. 

I need help or advice from people who got a well paying job without going to school, maybe some tips on setting goals that I can work on everyday to get myself in the same position. Sitting at my desk at work fantasizing about winning the lottery just won’t cut it anymore. 

I doubt anybody even read this whole thing, but if you did, thank you.",19Apr2019,3
129,"I’m 14 currently and in high school, my grades are pretty good (As and Bs). I really enjoy using my computer to play video games on it such as CS:GO and Fortnite. The problem here is where my mom comes in, she bothers me about everything. I’m not allowed to play during the week which I understand because my mom and dad want my grades to be up but on the weekend I get 3 hours. 3 hours seems like a lot but when you’re having a good time it feels like 15 minutes. My mom (lets call her M) tends to complain about everything to everyone. Everything needs to be HER WAY. She gives me no respect even though I give her respect. On top of that I have a sister who is SUPER rude to M, my dad and myself. She has good grades but doesn’t help around the house at all and always gives shit to my parents. But my mom wont do anything about it, she “disciplines” me for having fun on my computer but doesn’t care what my sister does. My sister can talk back to M and all M does is just take it. But you know I’m smiling talking to my friends on discord playing a game and having an all around great time NOPE. She screams at me saying I don’t do anything other than play video games when that isn’t true at all. In fact I had a couple friends over today and she still screams at me. My dad understands why I like playing video games and just leaves me alone. As I said before M complains about everything, everything and everywhere. After she screams at me for having a good time I go to my room but its not over yet. M decides to bother my dad saying he is irresponsible (this isn’t true, anytime my mom isn’t home my dad lets me play but he will feed me and make sure I’m ok. Not to brag but I have the best dad in the world). Don’t get me wrong I love my mom but this happens too much and its unhealthy for me and my whole family. Hope someone can give me some good advice as to what I should do.",19Apr2019,2
130,"I am a senior in college and everything is falling apart. I don't even know where to begin. I am supposed to graduate in a month, but I haven't been to class in a week, I haven't been to one class (that I need to graduate) since the beginning of March. I was supposed to write a senior essay in my field this semester, but I haven't seen my professor who has been overseeing my work since mid-February, and I was supposed to present my essay at the end of March, but I did not show up to the presentation. There's almost no way for me to pass more than like 2 of my classes at this point, so I'm definitely not graduating.

A lot of this is the result of insomnia and depression. I stay up until 5-6 in the morning every day, so I sleep through my classes a lot. I've struggled with motivation my entire life. I've always had the mental ability to excel in life - I genuinely believe that if I gave even a 90% effort I could have graduated in 3 years with a 4.0 GPA. But I don't do the work and I don't go to class. This issue has plagued me my entire life, dating back to high school, where my underachieving led to me attending a much worse university than I could have (and I can't even graduate that ""worse university"").

This is my fifth year in college. I'm 23, turning 24 pretty soon. I have no money, I have no girlfriend (nor have I ever had one). I barely have any friends. My parents probably hate me for being such a disappointment. I can't even bring myself to tell anyone that I'm not gonna graduate. I've tried antidepressants but they only made me more lethargic and less motivated. I can't really afford to go to a therapist more than once every few months, and even that isn't very helpful. My parents are basically done with my shit, and I have no close friends. I'm truly lost, and I don't know where to turn.",19Apr2019,3
131,"Basically, this guy liked me and I liked him back. 
We knew this, and we kept talking but we never became anything really more then this for a while. The beginning of this school year, we started talking and calling a lot and texting. Then, it started to decrease. He never really initiated and seemed to not respond how he should. But then at the same time did things that showed he still had interest. I was getting sick of wondering what was happening, or if we were ever going to be anything. I got the courage to text him about it. He ended up telling me he lost feelings. I just feel like, maybe I waited to long? Or maybe I did something? Or was I not good enough? I don’t know. We were never dating but it still kinda hurt cause i’ve liked him for so long. He said he still wants to be friends, I agreed because I wanted to be on good terms. But us as “friends” is basically how it was when we stopped talking so much. I don’t know anymore. It really has been so long. Also, I can’t tell if I still like him or not. I kind of just feel nothing anymore. I wonder what we could’ve been.",19Apr2019,1
132,"I'm not sure what happened, but about a month ago I started to feel extreme guilt/worry over events that I cannot change.

These events can be small, meaningless events from my past, or even terrible crimes that have taken place in a different time period or place that I had no control over whatsoever. I can't stop feeling like I should have been there to save others, despite knowing that it would never be possible to. I know that even if I could, it'd still be impossible to save everyone in the world.

Of course, this worry has escalated into terribly vivid dreams that absolutely wreck my morning, however, I'll be completely fine the moment I force myself out of bed, but otherwise, I'm stuck in a fear-wridden, shaking mess. I lose the ability to breathe and there's sweat everywhere. I don't even have any recollection of the dreams, all I know is that when I wake up, I feel immense dread (with or without a prior dream). Then immediately after I'm out of bed, I'm able to reason my mind into accepting that some things are just always beyond our control and calm down.

Any suggestions on what to do in the mornings? Or more so, in general?",19Apr2019,4
133,"okay so basically, I was in a rush and when I went to the shared bathroom for a quick pee I didn’t wash my hands. I planned on coming back and getting my toothbrush and face wash and all that to wash up like anyone else does in the morning. When I didn’t wash my hands when I left the bathroom and the girl in there told me I needed to wash my hands before leaving...I told her I was just about to grab my other toiletries to clean up with. She then goes off about how I’m spreading germs everywhere and putting “vaginal fluid” on the door handles. When I told her I’m not messy enough to have “vaginal fluid” on my hands after urinating she told me “well then you’re not wiping correctly”.

Anyways long story short I told her I would make sure to wash my hands every time since it made her so uncomfortable.

Now I overheard her ranting to our other dorm mates about how I am endangering everyone’s health and she’s going to report me to our RA...

I assured I was going to be washing my hands EVERY TIME what else am I supposed to do????",19Apr2019,1
134,"How do I get over it when it wasn’t love?

Some background:
(Also sorry for formatting I’m on mobile)
I f(18) met this guy (20m) while working last summer. We immediately hit it off, but when summer ended and he went back to school we lost contact, we didn’t have a way to communicate. Eventually he reached out to me after getting my social media from one of my coworkers. We started hanging out around late October. We spent every weekend together sometimes more with school breaks. We’d take turns driving the hour and we’d spend well over 24 hours together sometimes. We had a lot in common and had the same general goals in life, pretty similar personalities so hanging out always just felt nice. It was pretty clear from the beginning this was going to be more than friends, we hooked up pretty early on. 
This went on for about six months. Everything was super great, I met his parents he met mine. We didn’t ever really talk about the future but we just kind of enjoyed spending time together. He never wanted to label things though, the longer we hung out the more this came to bother me. But other than that everything was really good, he was affectionate and we just hit it off really well. This wasn’t my first relationship but it felt a lot different than before, I was going out on real dates. Not to mention the sex was really good but he was also just a nice guy. He did a lot of genuinely nice things I thought I wanted in a partner. 

But about a month ago I stayed over at his apartment. I sent him a text while he was asleep, I don’t fully remember what it was, I think it was a cat gif honestly. I decided to just go in his phone and delete it before he saw it. And that’s when I found he was talking to another girl, being fairly affectionate. He hid her name under a coworkers, I know I shouldn’t have snooped but the last text between them was something that contained “baby😘” so I didn’t want to accuse him of something and have it turn out to be nothing. I woke him up, told him I knew and I left. We met up that night because he felt like he owed me a proper break up. We spent about 3 hours together and we both cried but at the end things were like they always had been. It was easy to slip back into the comfortable way we used to be. 

We’ve talked here and there since then. A few phone calls where I just cried to him for an hour, which in hindsight it stupid but he was all I really had at the time. Then one day I just felt better about it, i felt okay that we ended things. I never saw it going long term and I don’t think he did either. We were texting a few nights ago, and I told him that maybe the reason he lost interest was because it wasn’t love, it wasn’t ever that deep. I started to realize that everytime I called him baby it felt weird in my mouth. And I didn’t see a long term thing with us, I of course didn’t tell him this I just said maybe it was more companionship and lust than love. And he agreed. I felt content with that. But these past few days all I can think about it seeing him again. I don’t think it’s mutual, I think he is still seeing the other girl. We text here and there which in hindsight is probably why I’m missing him more. I know we won’t get back together, even though we weren’t official he still betrayed my trust and cheated (something I’ve dealt with before multiple times and he knew this). 

So I’m just wondering, is there anything I can do to get over this or is this one of those time heals all wounds things? I don’t have any friends really to turn to so I figured maybe strangers on the internet have some advice.",19Apr2019,2

I also don’t have any really good friends that I trust in the first place, so it’s even worse when it comes to stuff like that.

141,"I love my mum. I love her so much. But there are certain aspects to her personality that are terrible. I often think she may have Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). This is because she is outright rude, selfish, moody, self-righteous and extremely negative. She has a way of  everything into a negative light and it brings me and my sister (15F) down. She also gets all sad and grumpy if either of us say we won’t be with her for the day. She says she is lonely and has no one else but us. This is very frightening as I am unsure what will happen when we have both leave the family house?

I also worry about my little sister. My mum so cruel to her and treats her like sh*t. She bosses her around constantly, making her do a lot of chores with little free time. She also treats my sister as her crutch, relying on her as a friend and partner; which of course is fine but only up to a certain point. 

She refuses to help her self and always complains she cannot find friends or a partner. However, I know this is because she is negative and cruel to people. She thinks she is better than everyone else and always puts people down. 

Also, I have noticed traits of herself in me and I am trying extremely hard to change this. However, sometimes I cannot change and find myself being negative or being excessively mean to my wonderful partner. 

So my two questions are: how do I deal with someone who brings me and sister down and refuses to help herself, especially in the future? Also how do I change myself and personality? I don’t want to be a negative, stressful and cruel person!!

143,"Also posted in r/relationship_advice And r/dating advice

Sorry for the novel, I haven’t really got any advice on my other posts so I’m hoping to get something here, thanks in advance.

A little background first (some details will be slightly changed due to privacy, I also realize that this may make me seem a little fickle with girls) I (22m) am a very active member of my church. I have occasionally been a youth leader and I play in the worship band. During one of my youth leader stints (I don’t do it very often because I work full time and I’m a full time college student) I met this girl (20f we’ll call her A) who was also a youth leader. One night we started texting and hit it off immediately, we texted from about 5am to 3pm. We texted like that probably a few times a week and encouraged each other have advice and what not. Needless to say I started crushing on her a bit.

Around this time a new girl (21f we’ll call her B) joined the worship team. She’s super cool and friendly and because of this we texted a few times. I just saw her as a friend or acquaintance and nothing more.

But then out of nowhere this third girl (25f we’ll call her C) came into my life and it seemed like it was meant to be! Let me be clear on this, when I met C, I completely forgot about A and B. I’d still reply if they texted me and I’d talk to them in person at church but I didn’t think it’d be right or even fair to C if I was texting other girls. 

We dated for a good while and then out of the clear blue she decided to break up with me (I won’t discuss that here but you can look through my comments and get more info). So life went on and suddenly a few weeks after C broke up with me I started to have feeling for A again (unrequited as she’s hung up on a former boyfriend). Around the time that I started crushing on A again B started texting me fairly often. (It’s important to note that A and B are really good friends).

We talked quite a bit, probably a couple hours every other day, and I started to feel like I could trust her with anything. One day I casually asked if she had anyone in her life that she liked (it came up organically and flowed perfectly with the rest of the conversation). I knew for a fact that she was head over heals for one of my friends that also goes to church with us. She told me to guess to which I did and I was of course right. She then asked if I had anyone and I mentioned that I liked A and asked if she thought she would ever be interested in going out with me. She was honest and said probably not because she’s definitely still way hung up on this other guy. That’s fine, I’ll keep being her maybe someday she’ll come out of it. (It should be known that my friend that B likes once told me that he knows she’s interested in him but he’s not interested in her)

About a month later something weird happened. When I woke up it was like someone flipped a switch and I didn’t have feeing for A anymore. I wondered why that was but then it made sense when I was texting B and she made a joke and a chuckled and thought “man I love her.” 

It surprised me to say the least but I knew in my heart that it was the truth. But I also knew that she, like me, was going to try to wait it out and hope that something changed with my friend. As soon as I figured this out for me I wanted to ask her out, however I also knew that I would probably lose my friend if I did so I decided to wait. As of right now I’ve decided to wait a few months to ask her out (in person of course).

I’m both excited and nervous, but it’s so crazy to think that if we end up getting together something that got us closer to each other was being in love with the others best friends.

What do you guys think I should do? Should I ask her out? Or is this all a mistake? Again I understand that this probably makes me look like somewhat of a bad person relationally but I haven’t had many so I’m still trying to learn as I go.",19Apr2019,0

Basically the title. My Girlfriend of Ten Months is verbally and physically abused at home. This has caused her to have serious anxiety and health, and well-being problems. She is Seventeen and a Half Years Old and I barely turned Nineteen Years Old. Now I know legally our age is probably a concern but that is why I am asking here for advice. Her brother, mom, and sister call her ""bitch"", ""whore"", and other things constantly even though it is not true. She has trouble crying because she's not allowed to at home and breaks down. Her brother called her a bitch and whore for calling about car issues.. TMI?

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself Financially Stable. I have a job. Saved Six Thousand Dollars in Four Months, AFTER my Rent, Bills, Expenses, and Strict Budget Plan. (Not that great IMO, but decent for Nineteen Years Old.) Currently moving up the ladder in my job as well. We will both be going to the same College in Summer so distance won't be a problem. I am able to afford an Apartment on my own, but she is currently looking for a job as well to help out in the future. We live near Los Angeles btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know I will probably get advice saying it's a bad idea. This is why I am asking to understand what can be done. I really love her and I can't see her go through that every day. It hurts. Thank you so much for your time. I hope you have a wonderful day.

147,"The title says it all. Today I had my last exam of my undergraduate degree. The first FU I did was that I arrived at the exam location at the exact time, as in I came in and they said “You may start your exam.” I had my phone in my pocket and didn’t think much of it and started to write the exam immediately. Around 45’ left of the exam I needed to go to the washroom. I went in there with my phone in my pocket, second major fucked up. That was the first time ever that I did not have my phone under my chair in the exam room during my four year of undergrad. As you can imagine what was next, my phone went off but it vibrated instead of a sound. I installed an app recently to remind me to take birth control pill that I was prescribed a week ago. I usually turned off my notifications for everything but this one was new and I forgot. I took my phone out of my pocket and tried to turn the notifications off. I was scared that if they found the phone they will report me.  The proctor outside asked if I was on my phone. In panic mode I said no and tried to dispose the phone in the garbage can. I realized I fucked up big time. She took me back to the exam room and when I handed my paper in, they handed me my phone and I noticed they have a Student Incident report with my student number on it. I almost cried on the spot. The worst of it all was that this exam had 5 pages of cheat sheet and I had no reason to cheat at all. I knew this was all my fault. I shouldn’t have had my phone in my pocket. I shouldn’t have gone to the washroom with my phone. And even if it went off I should have left it be and never taken it out. I already knew that they will send me a Notice of Investigation. I sent an email to my prof explaining the situation immediately and asked to meet him in person.

I’m so scared. I knew I was stupid. I knew if I have a meeting with the Board no one will believe me. I knew that I will fail this course. I knew that I won’t be able to graduate and have to take another year. I don’t know how to explain this to my parents and friends. I even have a job lined up. I fucked up my entire university career because I was careless and stupid. My four years of university may have been destroyed. I don’t know what to do at this point other than waiting for the Notice of Investigation from the University and my professor.

&amp;#x200B;

 My family and I were never that close with each other. To this day, we don't ask each other how we are doing, give hugs, etc. My sisters never really talked to me or gave me advice. I guess we just never clicked. 

&amp;#x200B;

School wise, I never really cared about it. I remember when I would ask my mom for help on my homework, she would just yell at me. I would play video games for 10+ hours so my grades and attendance was horrible as I started skipping class. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started community college in 2014.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was pressuring me to do something with my life, as all I did was play video games all day. I haven't played like I used to since age 21. 

 

For some odd reason, I took some automotive classes (I even was part of a competition of 12 teams - placed third though)  then an accounting class, and some welding classes. I couldn't see myself doing that anymore. I mainly choose accounting because I thought it would be a good job for an introvert like myself and the money didn't seem bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I was on and off with college, would drop classes, take a few semesters off and repeat.. it just felt like nothing interested me. I would sit in my accounting class wondering why it didn't excite me anymore.  Is school even for me? How can I be find something I could spend hours learning something that excites me .. to find my passion. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2016, I began working at Walmart. I quickly earned the title of a hardworker, even customers would tell me I was a hard worker.  Being a fast stocker, there were often times where I was able to work 12-hour shifts since management liked my performance.  I ended up quiting in 2018 to work at a construction company.   After 8 months of that, I quit as it felt like I didn't belong, and I was starting to hate Mondays.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about going back to Walmart but part time. 

&amp;#x200B;

  I just wish I can find something I actually enjoy/love that's not minimum wage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Computer work feels like my old thing left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not exactly sure why I didn't start with computers in the beginning. I remember when my mom first bought the PC around age 8, I would tinker with it for hours trying to figure out how it worked. I even helped neighbors with there issues. Everyone says I'm good with computers.  Of course, I don't have certificates but recently I studied some CompTIA A+ material and so far it's stuff I already know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I not sure if I should return to take IT classes or join the Air Force/ Navy 

&amp;#x200B;

Studying vs actually working it is different.  Sometimes when I study something, it just doesn't interest me. I recall my Java professor being passionate about coding. You can just see it in his eyes and how he explained things. I at least want to feel something instead of having to memorize/understand a bunch of things with no fulfillment.   It's weird how I had laser focus on video games.. wish I can find something like that as a career.  I don't want to hate Mondays. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to think the military might be a good option. I mean, it might be good to finally leave this town and get to experience something entirely different + get out of my comfort zone.  Instead of being in my dungeon all the time. And being in a vicious cycle of trying to figure it out; before I waste even more time when this puzzle.   I'm thinking about the Air Force or Navy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sort of don't like the idea of still going to school while working a job I hate. And I worry about having to do interviews as I'm really awkward and quiet. I have like no personality.  Worst of all,  having a hard time finding a job and being 26-28 still at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do worry that the military might not be for me but at least I'll get to experience something really different, gain new skills and save money,  get benefits, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do take full responsibly of my actions of where I am in life.  I just want to have a stable career that I enjoy,  making decent money, have my own house and be independent.  

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR :  I feel like a failure. I tried college but nothing quite interested me. I'm trying to find something that I will enjoy but I worry about not enjoying it thus having to start all over with my major.  I fear never finding my passion.  I'm wondering if  I should try college again or just join the military at this point.

Any advice? I'll really appreciate it.",19Apr2019,1
150,"So I have very cultured and strict parents. I believe they love me,(not as much as my sisters) but they are so abusive verbally and mentally. Any suggestion I have is immediately shot down with a snarling mean comment. This hurts my confidence and free will and this happens for years (13/17 years of my life). They are workaholics so I never have relaxation or ME time to just play my game UNINTERRUPTED. Multiple times they yell at me when my mic is on shooting mean comments and at this point my friends pretend they didn’t hear it. My uncle recently lives with us as well. And he always hogs the tv when he’s home. 

Education is important, only a fool would rue it. But my parents care too much about the printed letters on a piece of paper then my actual development. They want my to get scholarships and shit too the point of saying they would send me away if I didn’t.
Their idea is that electronics are a distraction, and I don’t disagree. People do get addicted to games and electronics. But In my household electronic use is only allowed Friday-Sunday (exception of the cable TV). The very limitation I have to play fun games with friends is further limited because of the reasons above (uncle, work, school prep) 

My parents have little faith in me. My parents think I would become Kodak Black or something. They force me to handle the tech in church, because they think I will turn my back on God, they don’t like it when I hang with Black Americans only unless they are of African descent  (like me). So I prom is coming and my parents won’t let me go. I never go to parties and I cant get a job. Money is a problem also.

When I try to talk they refuse to listen to what I say. I accidentally raise my voice and I’m rewarded with a slap. I can’t try to negotiate or anything because they don’t care. All the care about is how rich I will become. Tbh thanks to them I have anxiety, no social life, losing faith in myself. Desperate for game time. Preoccupied and very skinny. What can I do at this point.

Im sure most female bodied persons have been catcalled in broad daylight by drunken men. Well I say female bodied because I am ftm and have been on “T” for five weeks. So of course in my head I feeling one way and this creepy guy is feeling another because of my “goodies” as he states several times in the 45 mins of harassment. 

But anyways I guess I should start from the beginning. Also I cant spell because Im a victim of auto correct and I cut it off because sometimes, you dont need her. But i was walking from my friends house.....at night....... because I cant say no. And Im crossing the street Ive crossed a million times. I see someone obviously not expecting to be harrassed. I was a good ten mins from him on that cross section and crossed waaaay before him. He must’ve ran tbh. 

Im listening to old Drake and he was behind me so I move over to let him pass, until I realize his lips are moving and hes keeping up with me. I had slowed down. I took my headphones out thinking he wanted directions or some shit. Nope. He wants my number. Now I know how yall feel when its yah dirty day because 😫😫😫

Anyway he kinda straight up asks me for my number, says I have a fat ass, the usual. Im like no. I forget the number one fucking rule. DONT SAY YOU LIKE GIRLS. Because I feel like this would make him realize “Oh okay” but NOPE. He asks if Ive ever “had one inside you” and he seen me “jigglin” from back there and shit. Like honestly what be goin through yall head when you tryna get someone off the street lmao. 

He played the mind game trick of trying to say I hurt his feelings. My response?
“Oh your pride’s hurt? Well Im uncomfortable, so I guess we’re both two hurt niggas tonight.” He almost walked away hgbbnnhvchbkkkhv. Crossed the street with me. He asks me how I pull girls because hes obviously struggling. I tell him its probably good to try in the daytime. I actually think this is great advice all bullshit aside. 

He doesnt. Oh well.

Like honestly I felt like he told me about his mtf sister that I should have said I was mtf and had a mandingo cock and he would have ran but I thought he would attack me then. I had mass over him tho I probably could have taken him tbh. But when ever I would accuse him of flirting hed deny it and than say something very sexual and Im just like this isnt cute. At all. In fact, any moisture I had between my legs has evaporated faster than you can say obama for president 2008.

Anyways my grandma doesnt like the fact that I like women so she thinks this is fine too😑 just like last time this happened. Well fuck my feelings then. So I never know how to get myself out of these things. Im going to try to get mace or something in the morning.

152,"I teach 8th grade in a public middle school. Because of this I dress conservatively and avoid low cut shirts and always make sure my tops cover my back side or I wear a cardigan. 

Today during a passing period another teacher came and asked if I was aware of some of my students taking pictures of me when I was turned around, (I wasn't) and seemed shocked I hadn't been told as an assistant principal - we will call him Mr. A- had been notified over a week ago that this was going on but when they called the student in and checked his phone they didn't find anything. At that, my stomach sank. I am always careful walking around my rooms as I understand middle school is...middle school. I schedule to speak to another assistant principal - we will call her Mrs. P-and she was shocked.  She immediately had the student called in to check his phone and he had taken a video that same day in the hallway while I was walking back from lunch and he just happened to be behind me, zoomed in to my butt. It serves mentioning this same student had an issue with harassing a young girl when he was in 6th grade.

Flash forward to the end of the day and I pop in to speak to my principal. I let him know the situation, which he had briefly been told about, and says the student will get 3 days suspension to start and he will look further into it. I mention that I felt it was disrespectful that I hadn't been informed when the rumors of this happening first started and he claims to ""see both sides "" and understand why Mr. A wouldn't say anything if nothing was found. (Mr. A is a notorious gossip so it is out of character for him to actually not talk). I tell him I was uncomfortable and did not want to student in class as I feel this was sexual harassment  - he took a video of my butt without my knowledge and showed other students. The principal asked if there was something else I felt they should be doing. I replied I felt he should be in AEP after he offered to remove him from my class and into another young, female teachers room. I told him that wouldn't fix the issue as the behavior occured in the hallway and I wouldn't want to put another teacher at risk of being violated. He also responded with a mini-speech about how the district was moving away from sending kids to AEP as much due to them ""coking back worse than they were and not learning anything."" The conversation ended with him saying right now it would just be suspension but he would look into it further if needed on Monday. It doesn't feel like the admin was/is concerned about how uncomfortable this truly made me feel. I do not even want to see this student in the hallway, let alone have him in my class for another month. I also mentioned I felt if it were a student he had done this to, it would have been a bigger issue.

So I guess I am wanting to know...
1. Am I right in feeling I should have been notified when these rumors started? 
2. Should the student be going to AEP (alternative school) or is a three day suspension enough for what I consider a repeat offender?

TL;DR: Middle school student took a video of my butt in the hallway; Admin had heard a week ago he may have been videoing/taking photos but didn't tell me/ principal leads me to believe he will only get a three day suspension.",19Apr2019,1

I didn't know what to do so I talked to my teacher about some old art toy thing I made earlier in the career that I could work more on it through the semester. She loved it and said I should work on that.
The thing is that while it's an okay idea in theory, I can't justify making it, or make it mean something or even become inspired by it in any creative way, I'm not even good at the technique.
 But I don't have anything else so I keep bringing 'advances' or whatever I find on the subject one day before revision. She loves it.
I keep saying that it's missing a main theme, a content, that the toys are merely a medium but she tells me it's good what I have so far. 
I have zero trust in her because of this, it feels like  she doesn't see what an awful job I'm making. I want to make something I feel proud of but I'm so tired  and I've lost sight of what I'm passionate about. I can't get into it anymore and I just want to stop thinking. It's making me feel awful.

I’ll start by saying that I’m not positive if this belongs here but I need help and I’m not sure where to find it. 
I used to be a great student all throughout elementary school, all A’s with little trouble. I was a bright child wanting to learn more and expanding my knowledge, knowing more than all of my classmates and excelling in all my classes. I was exited to leave elementary school when the time came, being exited to move schools and all, (1st-6th elementary, 7th-8th middle, 9th-12th high school) I was ready for a bigger challenge and to meet new people as well as start my real career as a middle schooler, with all that being said, my trouble begins.  
My 7th grade year turned out to be a disaster, starting strong but soon having all my grades diminish, receiving C’s and earning detentions as well as beginning to be disrespectful to teachers and authorities in my life.  This hit me hard, my life did a full 180, going from being an A student to barley receiving C’s and getting in trouble very often, My mom was probably the most disappointed, try to imagine having your sons grades and life in general hit rock bottom. This isn’t the end though, to make this shorter I’ll just say that 8th grade was almost exactly the same but in some cases a little worse. In fact, 8th grade was the year when I started to hang with the wrong group of people, I had trouble making friends and had low self esteem so these people seem to fit in with my lifestyle, not caring about school and vaping and shit like that(I know that’s not cool, please don’t mention it). I was never depressed, and I don’t think I ever will be depressed or sad but hanging around these people was a change,  I was almost happy again. 
This is the part I need help with. This year I began my freshman year of high school, I was even more exited to start high school than I was middle school. I was determined to do better because high school is what matters when deciding what college to attend, as well as the rest of my life. Just like 7th and 8th grade I started strong, A’s and B’s with the occasional C, feeling good and trying to separate myself from the people who were influential to my poor decision making. Towards the middle of the school year it happened, I plunged into everything I told myself I wouldn’t do. I started having little regard for my grades and decreasing my friend group to very little people, I didn’t care about homework and had a poor thought process. I stared smoking marijuana and began to hang out with the bad kids I used to hang out with. My grades dropped and I just didn’t care anymore. I am now close to ending the academic school year and I’m very worried for the years to come. I worry that next year will be the exact same as all my previous years and I fear for my future as a person and as a son who can make his parents proud, yet with all of this on my mind I still have absolutely no motivation to do well at school, I can’t push myself to do that one extra night of studying or actually do my homework. I used to be a kid that was exited for my future as an adult who would make a ton of money and have a beautiful life but I’m afraid with my motivation and grades that I won’t make it anywhere in life, dissatisfy everyone who raised me and become a failure to myself. 

Thank you if you made it to the end, I didn’t expect this to be so long but if you do read this please realize that I will take any advice you can give me. Also I wanted to mention, if you think this belongs elsewhere send me a dm and I’ll post it there :) Thanks!

I know everyone but haven’t talked to some of them. There is one 8th grader, who nobody likes, who sat down next to me one time and talked my ear off but I never talked to him. Today I was driving home from PT, to a house where my parents weren’t home, and I got a text from my brother that said “your friend is really hyper”. I wasn’t expecting anyone so I pulled over (in a neighborhood, so no one was around) and said “who”. My brother said “[name], and he’s on our couch.” Instantly I was thinking “wtf” because I don’t really know this kid so why is he on my sofa. When I got home, I opened the door and the kid jumped out from behind a shelf intending to scare me. He followed me around and when I told him “hey my mom says we can’t have you over because she hasn’t met you” which was BS but I didn’t want him there. He pouted and started talking like a toddler about how he didn’t wanna go. I then told him that my brothers and I are going to leave to go to a parish dinner, and he said “that’s ok! I’ll just stay here and pet your cats!” I got more stern then and basically told him “buddy you have to leave because I don’t want you here when I’m gone”. He got the message and put his shoes on, but not before asking if me and my little brothers were free tomorrow. He specifically wanted to hang out with my ELEVEN YEAR OLD brother who he had just met, and this kid is fourteen. Keep in mind I’ve only said about 5 words to this guy at school. After he left, my other brother told me that the kid had been very heavily flirting with him before I got there. Then my littlest brother told me that this guy banged on our door and window and shouted “is this cactipoke’s house????” My little brother opened the door to see what was up and the kid just came inside, kicked off his shoes, and sat on our couch. He also somehow knew that I had 2 cats. I don’t know how in the world he got my address and why he walked into my house hoping that I would want to hang out with him, but now he definitely knows where I live and what my brothers look like. I’m fairly sure that he’ll come to my house again and I am kind of scared. I don’t know what to do at school tomorrow because he’s in my study hall and he’ll try to talk to me. My parents are on my side (sort of angry and baffled), but should I go a step further and tell my advisor/teacher? Maybe they will talk to him? (sorry for long post)",19Apr2019,2

As of now, I'm stuck in a job that makes me absolutely miserable. I've always been a hard working and loyal guy, but this job has taken a toll on me mentally and physically, and just is not a good match for me.

That being said, the point of this post is I'm having a hard time finding something viable. I've scoured job sites, only to find work for yourself type jobs, (Uber, Lyft, etc). Any site I look on is riddled with them. Beyond that, there are the sales/commission jobs, and while some are real, like for bigger companies, most are for companies I've never heard of that have terrible reviews from past employees as well as the overall sketchyness of them. I do come across a post here and there that is interesting and worthwhile to save and look into, but not nearly enough. Besides the internet, I have tried newspapers from my area, but there aren't many options printed on there, (maybe 10) and after narrowing it down I come down to maybe just one. 
I'll add that I did not finish college, and have no vocational experience. I'm not looking for anything specific, although there may be things I'm interested in, overall I'm looking for a way to get options, real viable options.

I’m 21, and live in the US, I am scared for my life because there are heavy accusations made against me. Nothing legal has popped up yet, but my entire mood, personality, and life has been affected.

Here’s some background:

I attended this college party where everyone knew each other. I met X at this party, and we were good friends. Everyone seem to think we went as a couple or together. I had left the party early on my own.

Two weeks ago I noticed a lot of my friends stopped talking to me, I thought nothing of it because I was occupied with school. 

I was confronted by these guys harassing me about X, I was confused. I didn’t know them and they mentioned they overheard I raped her.

I immediately denied it and contacted one of my close buddies, he said he heard the rumor but didn’t believe it. 

X has been saying I raped her at the party and has multiple people to back up the claim that I left the party with her, very drunk.

I obviously didn’t. 

Now I tried confronting her about it, only to get shit thrown at me by groups of her sorority sisters. 

I want to try to control this before it spirals out of control, but I’m scared of the consequences.

X claims I raped her, but one problem with that is, i have 2 disorders, erectile dysfunction and micro penis.  I clearly couldn’t have done this. 

These two things have kept me very prune. I’m not a bad looking but but my entire confidence falls at the mention of sex.

I can very easily ask her to stop, if verify it was my penis, but publicly coming out with my issues would ruin me.

I don’t know what to do, I’m scared, depressed and can’t even write or think right right now!

182,"I (20F) was hired at a retail store 2 weeks ago and have been doing a pretty good job so far, however today was a bit warmer than usual so I tied my hair up as opposed to leaving it down like I always do.

Later in the day one of my managers came up to me and said I’m not allowed to have my helix piercing in while at work. It’s a very small gold hoop that hugs my ear near the top. I asked why and if I could replace it with a stud and she said it was company policy to only have one earring on each ear at the traditional location. 

This was odd to me, I’ve had a few retail jobs before and never encountered this. I was never told this before I took the job and honestly it kind of bugs me. This hoop was given to me by my grandmother and it’s a hassle to take out and put back in. It doesn’t have an easy latch, I don’t want the hole to close but I work almost every day. I try my best to leave it alone so it doesn’t get infected, but if I have to take it out every day for 6 hours it most likely will.

I actually had an appointment to get a second piercing set for Monday but it looks like I’ll have to cancel it because there’s no way it’ll be able to heal if I have to take it out daily. 

I was thinking of just constantly leaving my hair down so the one manager doesn’t notice, or should I bite the bullet and risk infection or a closed piercing? None of the other managers said anything to me. I’m not sure what to do. If anyone has experienced something like this please lmk

TLDR: one manager said I can’t wear my helix at work, others didn’t even notice it. my grandma gave me the ring and it’s difficult to take it off and put it back on. I’m not allowed to replace it with a stud either. I don’t want the hole to close or for it to get infected. what should i do?",19Apr2019,1

So now while this is not a proper diagnosis the therapist had worked with many patients. Some who’ve had Asperger and some schizophrenia and said that after getting to know me better and who I am as a person she believes I fall better into Asperger than schizophrenia.

Now this is kind of a big deal to me cause it would’ve never occurred to me that I was possibly autistic.

187,"So, there's this amazing underrated show I used to watch when I was a child and now that I'm watching it again, I completely LOVE it. It's brilliant despite being a child show! It's funny, it's got amazingly written characters and it's so politically incorrect that I doubt it'd be aired these days.

It's pretty much like one of those old 90's shows that used to make adult jokes that children wouldn't get but it was made in the 2000's, and it's amazing. There is an episode where the characters freak out because they think they've been attacked by terrorists, they're not afraid to be rude or insult each other, they don't censor boobs and even one of the main characters sometimes smokes and even has gotten letters from children saying ""please don't smoke it's gonna give you cancer"", totally sweet and adorable. 

But there's also literally no content about it in English and it kind of breaks my heart because I can't share it with my english speaking friends and because a lot of people are missing this little jewel! But I'm also afraid to translate it or something because I'm afraid that SJWs and experts in being offended will boycott the talented creators of this show that has put so much effort and love in it. 

My countrymen really don't care because we love politically incorrect stuff, but (american) cartoons and even adult shows have been toned down too much recently, to the point that something like this show would be completely destroyed by the public these days when it's never done anything wrong, even the smoke thing has been adressed as a bad thing the main nobody should do by the other characters. It reflects reality and it doesn't treat children like they were stupid or blind to real life, and it helps them to deal with important problems (negligence, alcoholic parents...) but it's also pretty funny to adults because of the jokes.

Should I just leave it untouched until someone else fucks it up translating it to English or should I show it to my english friends and tell them to shut up about it? I'm terrified because americans, their lack of free speech and their politically correct problems could harass the creators of my favorite show from my childhood, thank you.",19Apr2019,0
188,"Lilly and I have been friends for over 10 years. It's safe to say we've been through a lot of stuff together, but I think we have a bad friendship. 

Lilly just got a girlfriend and I'm really happy for her, but I had a sleepover with her a week ago just the two of us, and she spent the ENTIRE night texting her girlfriend. And, that same night, she told me she wants to invite her girlfriend (Lexi) to NY Pride with us. I say, ""I'm happy you have a girlfriend, but I thought we were going together?"" 

Lilly: Oh yeah we are, but since I want to go with Lexi, I'm trying to get you a blind date. 

Me: WHAT? I may have said once that I want a girlfriend, but on my own terms, not because you want to shove me off onto someone you know so you could make out with your girlfriend. I'll just not go.

(I really wanted to go though)

Continuing on about Lexi, she never shuts up about her. Never.

Also, Lilly always seems so focused on having a third person around. I don't know why, we've been fine just the two of us, I don't know why she is so dead set on being a trio. Like, last month, we were going to go the mall but we never got confirmation from our other mutual friend so she just started listing off people that we were kinda friends with and I was like, WOAH slow down! 

Also, she is really flaky. Two weeks ago she wanted to go up to this big mall a few towns over, something definitely no one goes to often enough to be all meh about. Not to mention she wanted to leave at 9:30 in the morning. So I wake up early, got dressed, got ready and waited for her to pick me up. Half an hour later (five minutes before we were going to leave) she texts me, ""hey so this whole thing we've been planning for weeks might be cancelled. but can we leave at 10?"" and I'm annoyed, but I say, ""Ok Lilly whatever"" she texts me an hour later, ""so I'm not fully ready yet, can we leave at 11:30?"" and I'm like, what. the. hell. that is THREE HOURS after we planned on leaving. I WAS READY 3 AND A HALF HOURS AGO. 

Not to mention Lilly can be really aggressive with certain things. She just went vegan like 4 weeks ago, and I'm not sure if it's a vegan thing or a Lilly thing, but she can get so frustrating about veganism. She calls me ""carcass consumer"" and yells at me every time I get a coffee with milk in it. Yikes. She says/does all sorts of ridiculous things to get me to become veganism, but gets really aggressive when I  say I just don't want to. I have nothing against vegans/vegetarians, but I really just can't afford to spend more money on protein rich plant based healthy meals.

I'm really sorry this is long, but I had to get this off my chest, and I really need advice on if this is a bad friendship and how to move forward from here.",19Apr2019,2

I’ve been a fan of a small YouTubed for years. His videos have helped me through a lot of stuff. He usually deals with something directly related to subconscious phenomena (important!). Recently, I had a dream where he was there, doing the thing he does in his videos. I was extremely excited because I’ve been trying to get that subconscious phenomena to work on me, and I haven’t been able to get it to work for years.


So, I start drafting a fake email. I write 50% my backstory, 20% what happened in the dream, and 30% just plain old “thank you”. I made sure not to keep the focus on him in the dream, just what happened in the dream (because hearing about yourself in someone else’s dream is weird). I start thinking to myself, “hey, since he focuses on subconscious stuff, he actually might be interested in what happens in a dream.” So, I start thinking about actually sending this email. I’ve always wanted to get in touch with him, so this might as well be an interesting first impression, right? Well, it’s 2am, I’m loopy, I’m thinking “it’s now or never”. I enter in his email and I press send.


A day later I try commenting on his videos. I sign out of my account, lo and behold, my comments aren’t there. He must have blocked me.


So, not terrible, right? He thinks this one person who emailed him is a stalker, and I can just use another account, yeah? Well, here’s the problem. Sometimes he does one on one meetings with clients, and I was hoping that one day in a few years I would be a client. Well, I’m an idiot, because I signed that email with my real first name and last initial. So no, that’s never going to happen.


I don’t want to send him an email explaining myself from another address because that WOULD be stalkerish. I’ve decided that it’s probably best to let the whole thing go and not bother him. I thought he would be okay talking about dreams (because that’s indirectly related to his videos), but I misjudged, and now he thinks I’m creepy. I meant to use the dream as a “thank you for allowing this subconscious phenomena to affect me for the first time in my life”, but apparently I wasn’t clear in my email. So my question is, how do I cope with the fact that someone I’ve looked up to for years probably hates me?",19Apr2019,0

She truly cannot figure out her life, moment to moment, every day, and it's killing her. At first it wasn't so bad. She was just unsure, but could be helped to know her options and make a decision. Now she is completely lost. She's been sooooo depressed, and has been cutting herself  because she truly hates herself. She feels so stupid because she can't do anything. Her life is crippled, and she's talking about suicide. She has lost faith in me because she feels I don't understand what she's going through, which I can't really. Which has left her feeling so alone and lost. She is extremely against pharmaceuticals so anti depressants and such are out the window. She just keeps repeating ""I don't know what to do"" over and over and over. She says she's miserable, and she can't live her life, and she ruins everything because she doesn't know what to do ever. I am absolutely lost in how to help her and it's messing me up too. I love her so much, and the anxiety of trying to help her and failing over and over has had some pretty drastic health changes. We are both losing weight and getting broken down from this and we're stumped. We've started seeing a therapist, but she doesn't ever know what to say, and gets upset so quickly that she's not making any progress. She feels it's just going to get worse and worse until she ends up killing herself. I am extremely desperate, and just have to see if anybody knows anything about what she's experiencing. 
A little about her. She was raised very sheltered. Home schooled her while life by her mom in the tiniest town ever. No friends, a couple bad decisions in her past, but she's a super good girl, so what would seem like not very bad to me, is bad enough to make her hate herself and feel stupid. We've been together almost 3 years, and her last relationship ended really badly, followed by her unintentionally letting a supposed friend take advantage of her sexually. About when this all started she was about 3 months into her new job working where I'm working, but the department she was in had a lot of uncertainty. I saw her every day become less and less sure, and less and less confident in herself. She eventually had to quit because she couldn't do it anymore. She would get so upset at work, then cut herself and cry all day.
I don't know what to expect from this. I'm just going there are some wise people on here with some decent advice, or at least recognition of her ailment.",19Apr2019,1
200,"A then 17F (Rebecca) was hired on at a retail store. She was in a long term relationship with another girl. They lived together, and Rebecca relied on her gf for transportation. A longtime employee 40M (Dustin) immediately became infatuated with the 17F. He began paying her an unsettling amount of unwavering constant attention. This consisted of telling her he would give her rides, asking her to move in with him, spend time with him, etc. 

After months of this behavior, Rebecca caved. She's broken up with her gf and now relies on Dustin as a sole source of independence in her life. She turned 18, lives with him, and since they work together she relies on him for transportation and spends all of her break periods with him. He monopolizes all of her time. He's begun isolating her and exhibiting really disturbing toxic controlling behavior. I'm concerned about how this relationship began and how Dustin has slowly cut Rebecca off from her friends, family and socializing with work colleagues. And now she's 18 so there's nothing illegal about the situation. :(  As a co-worker on the fringe of this and not close with either of them, how can I help Rebecca?",19Apr2019,2

I usually get myself to fall asleep by listening to a youtube video but as you can imagine when it's nighttime and I'm not sleeping it's pretty maddening, and even with the help of youtube it's hard to block out because it is medium loud.

When I get up and walk around, it's louder in some areas and barely audible in others, but it is present in the entire apartment.

I want to see if it's a technical issue that can be fixed, but I have zero idea who to call first to get it checked out. Do I need an electrician? A plumber? An exorcist? It seems like a very vague issue to come to management with but it's seriously messing with my quality of sleep and sanity.

208,"     Hi. My name is Rhiannon. I'm still in high school, and I really need help. In middle school, I believed I was bi. I had a boyfriend and I was happy. In 8th grade, I came out to my friends (not my family) as lesbian and I was still happy. But lately, I've been feeling really awful. I practice Jewish faith (nobody else in my family is) and I know that they're very accepting. My mom isn't inherently homophobic, and my dad is so he might hate me for it. My extended family is extremely religious, but also extremely kind and wouldn't reject me. 
     But that's the issue. I want them to reject me. I want them to hate me and shun me and send me to a conversion camp. I want to be forced to stay in a camp choking down bible verses until I can't breathe. I want everyone to hate me. I've always been comfortable with my sexuality, but as of late I've been feeling like there's something wrong with me. I've gone through some pretty intense shit (EDs) but I've never hated myself more. I don't hate gay people, so why do I hate myself for being gay?

 Just recently, there have been rumors at my old job about me saying how I am sleeping with another guy that is working there with my boyfriend. I have never seen this guy outside of that job and have no way in contacting him as we do not have eachother on social media and don't have each others numbers. My boyfriend is not telling me who told him this rumor and has been acting kinda weird since then.

I am against cheating, I have never cheated on someone before and never will. I love my boyfriend dearly and hope to have a future with him. This drama is causing me a lot of emotional stress and I am under the impression that he believes these rumors. A big reason I left this job was because of how much drama goes on there and the amount of stress it was giving me, and it shocks me that after 3 months of not being there I am still involved in drama.

215,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. So I'm a Video guy, I like film, photography, making edits etc. and this ""friend"" of mine makes music. I met him almost a year ago through a mutual friend who showed him my work. I'm 17 and he's 20. 

I thought he was cool at first but lately I've been seeing that he's kind of a dick. First off anytime we meet up and try to work on something (which btw is always me doing something for him, music videos etc) nothing gets done. I honestly have no explanation besides he's very disorganized and I don't think our chemistry mixes good. Since nothing gets done he becomes stressed and starts saying how we are lazy and tries to get me to drop what I'm doing and do a bunch of shit for him all at once. 

Its not just this , I tried starting a small business with him a few months back. We were screen printing clothes. He wouldn't listen to my ideas and pretty much we only did what he wanted. Keep in mind I did all the production and majority of the work, only reason why I complied is because by that point in time I had already ""invested"" $400.  

Also another thing, he stole some of my money. I ordered some supplies and had to return them. The refund came in and for some reason it ended up in his bank account. He used it to pay his bills without telling me. I needed the money at the time and he still never paid me back. 

The business ended up failing because of his ignorance and I lost motivation because everything I was doing wasn't even for me. I lost almost a grand. 

More shit has happened but you get the picture. 

So here's what's happened today , I'm making this video for him. Now I'm not gonna lie, I haven't put this video on priority because I have clients and people who are actually paying me for my work. I do all of his shit for free. The video is gonna be displayed when he performs, so he can get the crowd hyped up. Cool idea but the thing is when he asked me to make this video , he didn't have any gigs or shows lined up so there wasn't really a need for this video. 

He got a gig for tomorrow, keep in mind I have ALOT of work I do and him expecting me to do everything for him so fast despite me already telling him I have a bunch of work is kinda rude. As a matter of fact I told him I have a bunch of shit and his reply was ""Well do mine first then do everything else"" . 

Anyways , I work on the video, get it done and send it and he replies with how the video has flaws and how he can't let the people see this. It's not necessarily what he said, it's how he said it. If he would've been chill and said ""yo bro there's just a few tweaks I want you to make"" I wouldn't have a problem. But he's just too demanding with shit and he doesn't do shit for me. 

I think I'm gonna finish this video and start really distancing myself from him. 

Sure the guy supports me but he's being a dick , not respecting my time, and overall there's a gap in mindsets. I feel like he's also very manipulative and probably why I've been convinced to continue doing favors for him.",19Apr2019,2

221,"I’m going crazy, I really need some advice. 

I worked my ass off to get promoted from a starter support role. 65 hour weeks with a 45 minute commute each way, took on a project above my pay grade, etc. The promoted role was created because I showed them the need for it. 

My base only went up by $5,000 (50k to 55k) but my annual bonus rose from 11% to 30%. That’s what the best my boss (director of our team) said he could do. When I pushed for more it didn’t go well and he reacted negatively saying he had someone else willing to do it for $45,000 a year. Thinking back, I should have just told him to hire that person instead.

Fast forward to December of 2018 when they finally found someone for my old support role. Recent grad with one year experience. One day we were talking about bonuses and when payouts were etc (no details that would be against compliance) and then when we went back to our computers, I accidentally saw her calculate on her desktop calculator what 11% (bonus of old role, which I only know because I used to be on that team) of 62.5 was. 
The only thing I can possibly think of is that she was calculating bonus against her salary, which means she’s getting paid $7,500 more than me!! 
I shared this with a co worker I trust and she agreed my theory is the only thing that makes sense. But she told me TO NOT say anything because there’s no way I could explain it in a way that didn’t seem suspicious and like we had been discussing salaries.

In my year end review, he ended up saying he would raise my base to $65,000 without me having said anything, saying it was because of my performance.
But our company has restrictions on how big of raise can go through at once, so it’ll slowly be increased monthly by 5% until it reaches 65. 

Which means she’s STILL at a higher base than me. I am so so resentful. I worked so hard in my old role as well, I feel so cheated. She leaves early and complains about her job ALREADY. I was working so hard, weekends and evenings and was miserable, and got paid 50k vs her 62.5k. I wanted to quit the second I found out, but decided to wait til after my annual bonus was paid out. 

Yesterday I was approached by a manager on a different team about an opportunity, which I’m pursuing. It’ll be a pretty solid step up for me so I’m glad I didn’t up and quit after i found out. But I don’t want them to think they got away with it.

I really want to say something to my current boss, especially if I end up getting this new role.

It makes my husband and I, who live on the third floor, literally want to throw up the second the smell hits us. There is no way out of our apartment without smelling it.

All i ever wanted was to escape and finally i did and came here to live with them because my financial condition doesn't allow me to be on my own. Will be moving out after completion of my master's degree. 

It's funny how I have traits from both of them and they keep telling me that if they had a child, s/he would be exactly like me. They don't have a child and treat me like their child.

But now that we're living together they want to know every single thing about my friends and me. Won't lie, since I've never received such attention I liked it initially and most probably reinforced it, but now it seems like they're forever trying to know something and give opinions. I love them to pieces but, it really gets irritating sometimes. 

For instance, they wanted to know what my friends are doing on the weekend. I told them I don't know, because I didn't want to share that my friends plan to get drunk this weekend. They were like, ""oh but you should know, how come you don't ask, we always used to ask our friends, we were so well connected, you kids have so much technology but still..."" and it went on for about 30 minutes. Like, ok it's not much but this thing happening repeatedly just puts me on edge. Why do they want to know what my friends are doing? I feel angry and I've had anger issues in the past. I fear that I'll lash out on them which is the *last thing* I want to do. 

It feels like they have a lot of pent up parenthood and I just want to subtly help them realise boundaries. But have no clue how to. It's like I never had the need to be assertive about these things because no one bothered much about me. And now I'm lost.

So I encouraged her to make the decision to tell her family about it then move out either with me or get her own apartment.

238,"I'm hoping someone out here will get what I'm talking about and not think I'm crazy.

So here's the deal. Some people always feel the need to be around me. Sounds great, but not really. It always feels like these people want to be around me to try and either show off or intimidate me as if they really have something out for me.

These sort of people from time to time make vague rude comments aloud to me in the hallway, but when I ignore them they resort to shoving their presence down my throat by standing within an ears reach and laughing maniacally.

Often times their amusement has nothing to do with me, but they obviously try to use their situation to pretend that they are laughing at me. They do this so that if that situation is ever brought up then they can come out looking clean and I will look like an idiot.

They get away with making comments because I'm too afraid to look back and when I do look back, they know they have hooked me.

They choose conveniently close places to hang out when I go to class. They count on the fact that their presence will provoke me as it adds tension.

Where words are too scared to reach, body language will take over. It's like silent warfare. I'm constantly fighting my natural reaction and my ability to stay neutral as they are constantly firing their obnoxious behavior at me. It's draining. Ignoring it is difficult because really you have to acknowledge it in order to give tham the opposite of what they want.

They buy similar items of clothing and accessories to me and flaunt it in front of me and it gets worse when I ignore them.

Often times it is a single person trying to provoke me into doing something so that they can have a valid reason to hate me and spread that hate. Sometimes their friends may have no idea and are often unknowingly dragged along to various locations in hopes that if I lash out they will have witnesses.

I feel like ackowledging their behavior or telling others about it only encourages it. I can't get anyone to really understand because it's so subtle, but just enough to aggravate my anxiety pretty badly because it's a daily thing.

They don't even know who I am and have never talked with me so I assume it is a jealousy thing, but what do you think? I try my best to be as kind and inclusive as possible and can't think of any reason why they would choose me in particular No one else seems to share this same issue.

240,"I have this friend who I hook up with a lot on the DL. It’s been great, no commitment, a cool friendship, and fun physical stuff. Recently though, he said the L word to me, and when I didn’t say it back he got really upset. We have kind of a weird friends with benefits dynamic where we talk a lot about his problems and emotions, but not about mine, so it’s like I’m a therapist who also fucks him. I don’t mind the one sidedness at all because I am a pretty guarded person, and in this case especially I prefer to not get too close to him because of the delicate nature of the friends with benefits thing. It’s been great up until now that he’s been wanting me to be more emotional and open with him and to say that I love him back. It feels odd to say I love you to a person you’re messing around with, but it doesn’t feel weird to say that to a friend, and he’s both of those. I don’t think I can tell someone I love them platonically and also fuck them, even though I’m pretty good at separating the physical aspect from the emotional aspect.

244,"Little bit about myself... 23 Y/O, College student in business, relationship taken, part-time to full-time job.

I was quite happy with where my life was going, I am a part time realtor, full-time transaction coordinator for a big-end broker, and I go to college full-time(to an extent). I’ve been in the longest relationship I’ve ever been since to date but I feel like I’ve hit a well in life. I find myself asking about my future and what I’m going to do with the current status of my life.

This whole feeling started the end of March when I found out 1. I bombed two of midterms which are helpless at this point since I know I will fail. 2. Recent job demotion to making standard 3~5k now makes 1.5k~2k. My relationship is wonderful, I think that’s the only thing keeping me sane now days and avoiding depression. 

I feel like everything hit me at once, I constantly remind myself this is a temporary battle and you can beat the odds. But the disappointment inside me hits me harder... I’ve been in college for 6 going to 7 years, I swapped major from a Comp. Eng to Business Economics on my 5th year in college. I feel like work hasn’t progressed in terms of selling homes and closing deals. I also believe I may get fired from my full-time job which leaves me with heavily pressure.

I currently pay for my household internet and phone bills, I also pay for my car &amp; health insurance. On top of that, I just recently got braces which cost about $6K for two years.

I am financially OK. I never spent more than what I have. I feel like my life has taken a 180 turn in terms of progressing, which I believe is normal but I do find myself like 4/7 days in the weeks feeling like I should be doing better..

I’ve talked to multiple people about this issue and they tell me the same answer as in, time will heal all wounds. Just keep pushing your days through, you can do it. And there’s days where I can’t.. like today. 


Any advice will be heavily considered..

Small things like that. And he would always talk with me about nonsense and we would just hang out, but for the last five months, all he can do is yell about Trump. Every time I see him. Now he always acts cold, aggressive and so fucking angry.

He screams at me because I don’t agree with his views, but I’m never outward about my beliefs. I literally just sit there and take it because I feel like he’s going fucking senile, I haven’t seen him this aggressive since he was on meth honestly. And I don’t care about what he believes in, I’m just so tired of it being shoved down my throat.

I try to understand and listen where he's coming from and I ask him about his sources. I'll happily converse with him if he keeps his cool, but the other day he met some of my really close friends and was screaming about politics within five minutes of meeting them, when all we were talking about was traveling together and he was screaming,"" Well I guess I'm the racist old white guy, build a wall and kill them all"" at the top of his lungs inside my house in a very thin apartment complex. *It's fucking embarrassing at this point.*

For the last few months my boyfriend and I have been throwing around the idea of moving to Portland, it’s more affordable, we could live dead center in the city, I could basically walk to school and there are jobs everywhere.

(Also i would refer to my close friend as AA and the person/friend as BB)
I have a friend that i known for a while a bit more than half a year. We got really close really fast. And we even had something of a romance for about a month. Stuff happened and we didn't really talk for about a month. We starting speaking again recently. And they told me that they attempted suicide recently. Before we stopped talking they also tried committing suicide before. They didn't exactly have the best life. To protect the privacy as best i can but to give enough enough information. They didn't have the best childhood. Rape, abuse, and other dark stuff.  This is where i feel like a asshole. I feel like they are not being completely honest. When they told me most of what happened to them we were together. And i had my rose tinted glasses on. I'm not the best with people so everytime we had a bump i would ask my closest friend AA for advice. They always helped me out and give me great advice. And they are the only one that i told almost the whole story to. So after we and that BB broke up they told me they still wanted to be friends and i agreed. But for about month and a half BB were ghosting me. And i was sad and depressed for a bit and told AA how I felt and theh finally let it out. AA said that they didnt want to tell me when I was in a relationship with BB but she thinks i should now. That many things seemed off and contradictory. And 80 percent of what BB told me sounds to convent and reminds her of a late 90s teen drama. At first i thought AA was just overreacting but the more and more i thought about it, it seemed to be true. BB lives with a single parent and that parent means the world to them and they mean alot to their parent. When me and BB would hangout she seemed to be extremely manipulative with their parent. So i wouldn't be surprised if they were manipulative with me. There are also times that they lied to me but i never brought it up or challenged it(rose tinted glasses). And rethink and reviewing our message their story has a lot of contradictions and ""bumps"" that either make no sense or to ""convenient"" that it seems like a TV show. And since I started talking to them again the more and more contradictions and bumbs i see. But then again maybe they are telling the truth and I'm a asshole for not believing a friend. What should i do.

260,"I’ve been living w my “bff” from freshman year of college for 3 years now (were juniors, going to be seniors).  But it haven’t felt like it lately. Long story short we’ve had the same fight but a different situation. Her needing to always have her way. The first time was about dishes. I’d left them for a week (I know gross but I was busy w school work). Later she texted me about it (knowing I wasnt there saying it’s disgusting and I need to clean them - like no shit but I physically wasn’t there to do anything about it) and both sides misinterpreted and we had this huge fight. We ended up talking it out (what we actually meant, how we felt, etc) and things were fine. Then a month or so ago she randomly decided she wanted a cat and I said I didn’t want one in the apartment even tho she said it’d only be in her room. I don’t like them and hair, dirt, and litter can spread/smell. She didn’t need it so we fought about that too. Again, she mentioned this to me over the phone. We finally talked it out again and things were good again (she actually got the cat bc I was tired of fighting about it and then she fucking took it back 🙃). And most recently I admittedly burned a spatula onto a pan she bought a few months ago and most recently broke the lid to the trash. I cleaned the pan (I thought) and meant to replace both the spatula and lid. I didn’t replace the spatula bc we actually talked about it and she said it wasn’t a big deal, it was a $1 from Walmart that her ex bf got. And it’s only been a week since the trash can and I haven’t been to the store. But today she demands I replace everything randomly when she made everything seem like not a big deal. She said it was bugging her for a while but forgot to mention it (personally idk why you’d wait this long/how you could forget if it was bugging you). I’m not even mad about her asking me to replace stuff bc I am the one who broke it. But the thing is again, I thought I cleaned the pan (turns out there’s still some on the rim which I’m going to clean off, not completely broken like she told me) and the spat ula didn’t seem like a big deal and she’d known about the trash can for a week.

One day I was hanging out with some friends in an empty room with one of the vaults in it. We were doing work, goofing off and having a fun time. As a small joke, I pretend to leave and open up the vault door, standing in the small space between the boarded up area and the steel door frame. I scoot the door so it’s almost closed, and stand there, making jokes with my friends and looking at the metal on the inside of the door. 
Apparently the door was magnetic and the door and the frame got too close to one another, trapping me inside. It took me a second to register what happened. My chest and stomach were pressed to this metal door, my arms were trying to find something that would get me out. It was pitch black in there and I start pushing on the door as hard as I could, feeling myself start to panic. I could hear my friends start to realize what happen and freak out as well. There was a lot I thought about, but I kept telling the people in the room with me to get someone right now. I was in there for a little over five minutes and it took three people to get the door to open.

265,"Huh, I figured I'd try to ask for advice here.

I consider my dad a good guy (of course, he is my dad so I am biased). He's just very set in his ways. A little short-tempered and hotheaded, he's big into Fox News and conservatism which I respect even if I don't agree with it. My problem is that lately he seems to have taken to using slurs as part of edgy jokes made specifically to shock people. I know he sees this as just fun and games, and I play along and tell him to stop halfheartedly, but he doesn't seem to really understand that words can be offensive for a reason. He gets offended if I tell him something is offensive. He says the n-word. I told him to stop and he said ""If the blacks can say it to each other, why can't I say it?""

He also says ""f\*ggot"" and calls gay men ""f\*ggots"". This is particularly confusing because I am gay. And I'm pretty sure he knows that. I was watching a Korean show the other day and he called it ""The Gook Show"". I'm starting to think he is just trolling me at this point because he knows I am fairly liberal-minded and these words bother me. I'm not personally offended by them but my point of view is if something is unnecessary to say, why bother saying it?

In the past, he has been very defensive and he believes he is targeted as a white man. He thinks the #MeToo movement is an organized attack on white men. etc etc. So I have to be very careful when I ""call him out"" on things or else he will become defensive and shift into ""liberal censorship"" mode.

I love my father, his actions over the years have been great. He's just in a very strange edgy joke phase. Or maybe he's always liked these jokes and is only just now finding the opportunity to use them? I'm not sure what is going on, it seems like he's going out of his way to use slurs lately. I'm quite confused on how to approach this. We are on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and I don't want him to feel attacked or censored. Should I let this go? Am I the one being oversensitive here? What are your thoughts?",19Apr2019,1

I've always been around suicide. Its always been a part of my life. My grandpa commited suicide when i was super young and a friends dad did when i was in grade school.

She was self harming alot and always said she wanted to kill herself. At first, just to try to detur her, i would say ""if you do i do"" (i know thats a shitty thing to say but i was in middle school and didnt know any better) but the more i said it the more i meant it. And to top it all off i was constantly getting bullied so i thought fuck it why not. 

And since then ive always had that thought in the back of my mind that i should. Ive had my ups and downs obviously but lately it seems to be more downs than ups. My co-workers think i should talk to my doctor and see if he thinks im depressed or bi polar or something but im really bad at talking about this shit.

I had never really cared about The Aviation but this video seemed interesting.
Once I'm on I quickly realize something was odd, I was on that flight on the 8th of March.
I did a bit of research and I found out more about the flight. The odd thing is; the plane landed? I landed safely in Beijing, after this I did more digging on other topics. Things aren't right, mostly everything is the opposite of what I knew. I know this seems farfetched but I think I may be from a parallel universe or world, I don't know how true this is but apparently, scientists have discovered ""proof"" of this, that's all I've really researched as I got really freaked out.

After another poor result at my last competition, I finally realized that I think I need a change. I felt my biggest issue was being unprepared for the event. I stepped up my level of competition while making no real change to my training. So my plan was to train for a few weeks at a club with more fencers and a different coach over the summer to see how it works out for me. I’ve discussed this with my coach and he obviously doesn’t really think it’s what I should do. 

He feels my bigger issue is that I’m lonely and depressed and that is what has been putting a drag on the rest of my life. And he’s worried that I’m rushing into this decision to leave the club and my teammates and that I may regret it in the future. He thinks I'm taking the first option just because it sounds good instead of taking time to find the best one.

I do agree I’ve been feel very lonely and depressed on my own the past few months and I do think that is a large problem for me. But while I agree with what he was saying, he didn’t really offer an alternative solution to my problem. He’s also worried about the coach I was planning to work with over the summer. He thinks he won’t actually help my fencing improve. Again while I do understand what he’s saying, and agree to some extent, I feel any new perspective will be helpful to me. I’ve only ever worked with one coach.

I know that’s not a whole lot of detail in the grand scheme of things so if you have any questions, I’m happy to answer them. 

So am I rushing into this decision or is my coach just trying to keep me around.

I’m just a little lost right now and any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance.",19Apr2019,1
273,"So I met this guy on omegle, and it turned out we both like the exact same things (not very common interests at all, so I was elated), and he was kind and funny and more like a big brother than anything else. hes 6 years older than me (supposedly). and we were talking on discoed and I was like ""I hope you're not fake lol, this almost seems way too good to be true"" and he says this exact thing (copy and pasted from discord):

275,"This happened less than 10 minutes ago. It's 3 am right now, and I've been suffering from insomnia for the past week or so. I'm normally online, browsing. So I heard a noise outside. It sounded like a person. My bedroom is overlooking the front of the house, so I can easily check. I open the blind, and see this large frame, skinny guy. He has a hood on. And then I see him put on his mask, partially covering his nose. I also see something in his hand as he slowly approaches my sister's car. Her car is on the driveway btw. I bang on the window hard as fuck to show him my presence. He notices. He gets on his bike, which was hidden and then jolts onto another street. I tried to gravitate towards what just happened. I then go to the other side of the house barefoot. There is this unoccupied piece of land which like trees so I can't see from afar. I go only barefoot(left phone wasn't expecting anything). Noticed this car parked on the side. Some guy is outside of the car. Door is opened. Things were dark that I couldn't make out what kind of car, plus I was scared he was going to see me. I go inside. Put on my shoes. Grab my phone and a bat(just in case). Drive around the neighborhood(Guy left). Looking for anything suspicious. Didn't notice anything. And now I'm here typing this. Not sure if this is also related. But 30-60 minutes before the incident. I heard an alarm car go off.

&amp;#x200B;

Her car has been broken into once before like last year or something. At the time she was negligent on leaving her stuff in the car. And they took a bunch of bags and notebooks. The next several days after that she put around her car to return those notebook as they were important to her. The person I think eventually complied by chucking it into the unoccupied land though I think it was raining. It was just a mess. 

Either way, he's still out there. I would have loved to catch him. Any advice on a security system or something. I hate that how pro he seems about this. Like he's expecting a security camera. Maybe that was the getaway driver parked on the other side. I hope I scared them for a long time. Not sure how many more sleepless nights I can go through.",19Apr2019,2
277,"I'm mulling over a major life decision, and I'm hoping to get some internet strangers' outside perspectives.

I'm a 26-year-old American guy with a bachelor degree in psychology from a university in Florida. I spent a year living in Montréal (Canada) as an exchange student and on a working holiday visa. I loved living in the city, but I had to leave due to being too sick to work and lacking a realistic way to immigrate permanently. I moved to Southern California one year later, and I am now a civil servant doing mostly clerical work for about $38k/yr USD. I like it here in San Diego, but I miss a lot about living in Montréal. Plus, the cost of living here means that I Just rack up more and more debt every month.

I have thought of returning to school for another bachelor's degree in computer science to get a programming job. I have also thought about returning to Montréal. I recently discovered that it would be cheaper to do a second degree in Montréal than in my own backyard, and I visited last week and discovered that I could complete a graduate diploma for just $30k and a year of my time. I would receive a one-year work visa to stay in Canada if I graduate, and it would give me a realistic pathway to remain in Canada. I could also go on to earn a master degree in computer science (if I so desired).

I have been thinking non-stop that it is a no-brainer to pursue the graduate diploma; it would give me the education and experience to get into IT while giving me one more opportunity to stay in Montréal. Even if I decide to move back to California, I would have the education to perhaps get a job that would allow me to afford living here, right?

Yet, I've had my doubts these past few days. Should I rack up even more debt in hopes of getting a decent job? Should I abandon my secure civil service job in the hopes I can land a better one after a year? Should I leave SoCal weather behind for a place that snows for nearly half the damn year? Maybe I should just try to promote into an analyst position (about $50k/yr) and/or try to move up to Los Angeles instead.

Ultimately, I worry that I am trying to make a major life change because I am very unhappy with my life, and I know that most of what I am unhappy about is personal rather than career related. I just want some (hopefully unbiased) outside opinions.",19Apr2019,1
278,"I'm not too sure this is the best place to post, but it's the best I can find.

I'm not someone who has had a lot of friends. I didn't have much of a social life growing up, so I don't have many friends really. Due to certain reasons I don't want to specify, I actually had barely any friends. Most of my current friends are just people I play video games with, or people I know very well from school, church and work. However, lately I've been wanting to build up my social life and get some new friends.

There's certain people who I feel are really cool and I could be really good friends with, but I don't know how.

For instance, there's this one girl I know who's pretty cool and I want to be good friends with her. We talk occasionally and do text sometimes and I guess we're somewhat decent friends but due to a lack of common interest we don't have much to talk about. I want to be good friends with her, but I don't know how.

Or there's another guy I know. He's a really nice guy and I feel like we'd be good friends, but I just have no idea what to do about it.

On another similar topic, I'm also trying to figure out how to become good friends with a member of the opposite gender without coming off as being attracted to them.

I've had a really messed up social life in the past, and I'm just not a person who is very good at socializing.

279,"I am 22 year old student in computer science and I am very attracted to a girl since I first met her in 9th grade in high school
I thought  about her every day since I first saw her.
She had  a stable boyfriend in high school and she was very popular,while I was a skinny,introvert,bullied by others.
I liked everything about her personality,voice,hair,ears,eyes.
I still remember what she used to wear,everything she said and every little detail about her.
She sometimes used to defend me in high school(I know that dosen’t mean she liked me) and I felt like shit to be bullied in front of her.
Once she smiled at me once and I literally falled in love with her smile(best felling ever).
We hugged twice in highschool at her request( I don’t know why she did that,problaby she felt sorry she felt sorry for me)
We were never friends and never hung out or talked outside high school.
She invited me once to hang out with some of her friends and to skip a class but I refused because I was to shy around her.
Most problaby she never had a good opinion about me because I was a  terrible loser dealing with lots of problems at home and in school,while she was hot,popular,rich and always having fun.
A bad thing that I remember is that a classmate who tried to bully me because I was anorexic,asked her how my body looks on a scale from 1-10 and she said I am a 5(that crushed me).
She even called me ugly once for no reason,even though outside school many people told me that I am good lookinng.
I dealt with a terrible depression after highschool because of my family and my former classmates.
My education was derailed with two years because of my depression.
She leaved the town for college and this year she will finish college and problaby she will move back in town,while I will finish just my first year in college.
I never had a girlfriend,never went to a party,have just two friends,no friends circle,no friends in college,not rich personally(even though my family is rich)
It seems that I have nothing to offer to such a girl and it depresses because I feel like would sacrifice everthing for having a chance with her.
We didn’t kept contact after highschool and I don’t know much about her actual life.
I know just where she went for college and her facebook.
Sometimes I fantasize that I will get very rich,popular,fit and I will get a chance one day with her,but I don’t think that will ever happen.
People advised me to contact her on facebook but i am afraid:
1-She won’t remember me,even though we have spent 4 years in the same class
2-She will reject me because she has a relationship
3-She will be offended and humiliate me  because someone like me asks her out
4-She won’t even respond
It would mean the world for me to have a relationship with this girl,but it seems like my chances are 1 in a billion.
The idea of writing her on facebook seems pretty weird to me after I didn’t talk with her for 3 years.
In every scenario, I would be crushed,because I feel like she is the perfect girl for me.
I would sacrifice years of my life to just kiss her once.
My thoughts were that I will forget about her after highschool but I dont think I will ever stop crushing on her.",19Apr2019,2
280,"I am a MS2 at a NE medical school in the US. Unfortunately, I failed a course and then subsequently failed the retest. According to school policy, I will be demoted a year and repeat the same course I failed. This means that I cannot take my STEP 1 and have a six month break before I have to retake the failed course. After passing the failed course, I have another 6 month break before STEP 1. I am literally putting my life on hold for a course that runs close to 3 months, 4-6 hours a week.

I wouldn't call myself super smart, but I am slightly above average where I can study 2 days before the exam and get a C+-B+ range. I think this arrogance played a huge role in me failing this course (only student that failed). I had one week to prepare for this retest, but instead I chilled under I had 3 days remaining. Granted this course finished 2 months ago and I already forgotten the material, I definitely should have started earlier. I just do not know how. I have never really ""worked hard"" in my life besides for the 1 month I used to prepare for MCAT and the semi all nighters I pull before exams.

I seek your advice on what to do with my life at this point. Should I try to find a part-time job? Work on correcting my habits?

282,"In a nutshell, I have been at my current job for 3 years. I started as a temp and worked my way up to the Training/QA Supervisor. I genuinely enjoy my work but the pay is not good nor fair. I found out about a year ago the agents that report to me, make more than me. I know this because I present them with their yearly increases. I train these employees and teach them everything they know, so I don’t think it’s fair for them to get more pay. I have beyond more daily, monthly and yearly responsibilities than those who report to me, as they take phone calls all day. It has been bothering me extremely bad lately, to where it’s all I can think about. 

I’ve brought it up 2 times to my manager, who hasn’t done much of anything. The first time, I simply asked, how it could be? How a phone agent could make more than a supervisor? She agreed it was unfair and said she would talk to someone, but advised me she couldn’t make any promises. I took that with a grain of salt and didn’t hear anything again. Months later (2 weeks ago) I brought it up again to her when we were smoking. I told her how much it bothers me, and how it’s not fair. She asked me if I could hang in until June (raise time) and she could probably get me $1. At the time of this conversation, I thought of that as a win for me, well ‘that’s something’, I thought. Well, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that’s still not okay. I’m 150% sure I deserve more pay based on my performance, my boss has told me this as well. Even $1 more on the hour wouldn’t even put me in a close range to those who report to me. If they were to match me on what they are paying my phone agents, it would have to be several dollars more, $3 at least. However, I didn’t say or mention this to her.

I got irritated the more I sat on it and said screw it, and started applying for other jobs. I’ve gotten a few interview requests and the starting pay is $5, $6, and $7 more than what I’m currently making. I am fine with following through on the interviews and getting a new job; however, I would much prefer to stay at my current job. Like I said, I truly enjoy the work, and who I work with; they are like my family. I also realize that if I were to leave my current job, the company would be SOL for a trainer and QA supervisor as the company is very small and no one is prepared or skilled enough to fill the position. It’s hard to hire from the outside for my job, it just doesn’t seem to work (it’s been attempted before) I wouldn’t want to leave them like that, but I want to be paid fairly.

What I’m asking for is advice on how to approach this for the third time. I don’t want to sound entitled and I don’t want it to come off as I’m threatening my job. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to explain I have other offers I could take for more pay, and ask if their willing to match or at least significantly increase my pay (more than the previously spoke $1). I also can’t just quit or put in my 2 weeks without having another job completely lined up and ready to go, I have a 1 year old. I feel my job will be shocked to hear I was looking for employment elsewhere and think of me as a trader. Any advice would be appreciated! I really don’t know what to do.",19Apr2019,1

285,"For my whole life, my parents have been pretty overprotective and have never really given me much independence. Aside from school, I don't think I've ever been outside of earshot from at least one parent. I feel like I can't do anything without them asking questions about it, judging it. I have pretty bad anxiety because of it, and it pretty much controls my whole life, to the point where I just want to get as far away from my parents as I possibly can.

It's not that they do anything bad or go out of their way to deny my privacy... but I literally can't move an inch without them knowing. At least one parent is always home, so I feel like I have no escape. It makes me so paranoid. I'm using a throwaway account and private browser session here, despite that they don't check my computer or internet activity, and they probably don't even know what reddit is.

I'm generally super quiet and most people would say without a doubt that I'm introverted. But the reality is, and I've only realized this recently, it seems to stem from my parents. I'm so used to having everything I say or do be torn apart, analyzed, and being told how to do it better. When I'm alone, on the internet (pretty much all they don't monitor), or even rarely at school, I'm far more confident and outgoing. 

I have a few online friends, some I'm pretty close and personal with, but we don't talk super often. There's also age gaps, physical distance, and I often feel like I'm not important to them because they have their own real lives that I'm not part of. I've recently graduated high school, a few friends are still in HS, a few are a couple years older than me.

My parents constantly get frustrated with how quiet I am, and tend to get up in my face and threaten to monitor or restrict my internet access, sometimes they dare me to leave home. I've tried to talk to them about anxiety (they say it doesn't apply to me), tried to hint at the concerns I'm talking about here (they generally disregard it, bring up how they will get me anything I ever need), and I'm too afraid to push any further sicne I have no idea what they'll do. Usually things are fine, most of the time we get along fine, but sometimes it's like they want to make sure I have no self-reliance.

I really want to just take the nuclear option and move out, start my own life. A few friends have encouraged that path, one of my closest friends even suggested if I didn't do it now, I'd probably never leave them. But it seems like such a stupid decision that would make things worse. I have no job (too afraid to leave the house for one, parents always suggest volunteering instead, or say I'm not reliable/independent enough for a job), no car (though I recently got a license), no education beyond high school, not much money, no friends (two closest friends that I trust are ~7 hours and ~20 hours away, and both across a national border).

My parents get me basically anything I want (within reason), and I'm comfortable at home. I really want to be a software developer and I'm currently working on a few apps of my own, trying to get into contributing to open source, and want to eventaully make a game.... my parents are more than willing to cover any associated costs that come up. That makes it really hard to leave, I feel like I'd be throwing away my dream. But at the same time, I'm so miserable and frustrated here, and really want to get out of here. At times, it feels so toxic to stay, I feel like I'm constantly regressing.

TL;DR: Parents constantly involved with my life, making me extremely paranoid, anxious, and isolated. Want to just leave and start my own life, but have no money or place to go. Able to stay at home and work towards my dream career, and I get along with parents most of the time, but sometimes it drives me insane and I have no escape from it.",19Apr2019,3

That is why I hate that. I have to dedicate 10 hours of my day, doing something that  I don't like. This is really soul crushing.

If I pass all my current classes (7 classes earning 1 credit each) I will have 23 out of the 25 credits to graduate. Those two classes I failed are holding me down. Kentucky completely fucked my year up in December 2018 when they changed the graduation requirments. You used to only need 22 credits to graduate, with 4 Science credits, 4 Social Studies credits, 3 English and 3 Math credits. Now it's opposite with 3 Science, 3 Social Studies, 4 English and 4 Math. What the fuck, and why.

At the beginning of the year, they gave me English 4 and Geometry again, and said if I pass all of my classes, I'll have 23 credits (22 to graduate), and everything will be fine and peachy. 

Well...now they tell me last week of March that since requirments changed I still need to pass all of my classes and take an ADDITIONAL English credit and ADDITIONAL Math credit...with two months left of school.

It's an online credit recovery thing that I've been told isn't hard at all...most credits can be done in under a week if you try. I haven't even started on them...only the Math credit which is 60% done and I've worked maybe two days on it.

As of right now, I have about a month until graduation. Classes are getting harder, I'm on nerves end with this shit, very stressed I might fail. Done dropped $700 on graduate shit, class ring, ect.

I've started smoking and drinking because of it. I know some of it is on me, but for fucks sake I swear the schools have fucked up alot of my shit. I got prom in two days, and finals coming up in three weeks. I just don't know what to do anymore. All this for a piece of paper that says ""fuck you, go make money to try and live"".

It's confusing and hard to follow but...any advice?",19Apr2019,1
298,"Hey guys, I have been dating my bf for 5 years now. We had our ups and downs but very happy now. So, I thought for a while its jealousy but I love that girl she has a pure heart, so I've no issues with her.  But my mind tells me that he deserves better and I should get out of the picture and that she will make him happy. He has never shown interest in her, he's of a sound character and goes out of his way to show me his love. That's the thing, all is good. But these thoughts keep consuming me and I want them to go.

299,"Me and my SO are in a complicated situation right now and I realize that I'm in the wrong and I want to show that I'm really sorry instead of just saying I am sorry and moving on from it, how can I show genuineness and that I really care, and am sorry through text messages?

I'm in another country right now for vacation while she's back in the home country so I can't right now show that in personal. (If it's a stupid question I'm sorry, I'm kinda lost right now and I don't know what to do.)",19Apr2019,1
300,"I'm a 28-year-old female from Europe. I come from a poor family, didn't have any money for college, that's why I started my first big job right after the school at a big e-commerce company and ended up working there for 7 years as an Executive Assitant to the CEO, at the same time I enrolled in E-commerce BA because it made sense career-wise. So I stuck with that industry, leaving all creative things that make me happy behind (love for art, food, movies, and design).

I was making good money, but job was very stressful so I finally had the courage to leave. After that, I've been approached by a friend who invited me to work on his IT startups, where I don't make any money so Im almost out of my savings. In addition to my BA I took courses on Digital Marketing, QA Testing and the theory is nothing without practice, but I'm afraid to go on interviews because I think I'm worthless and I'm lost about the industry where I want to work.

I'm in a loving relationship for 7 years, but feeling accomplished work-wise is very important to me.

For the past 2 years, I've been in this vicious cycle of depressing moods, hating myself, not seeing any future, staying at home 6 days a week and became anti-social. I won't talk to my friends about this because I don't think anyone will understand, that's why I'm spending my last drop of savings on a shrink, which is not helping and makes me even more upset.  I'm trying to lift my moods up by watching Ted talks, reading up, learning new things or looking up to successful people (career-wise), but that doesn't work. I think about suicide once a week but something seems to stop me, so maybe not everything is lost, however, that doesn't change the fact that I have no idea what to do with my life and is there any purpose in it at all.

I'd really appreciate some advice.",19Apr2019,3
301,"There’s just a little of a back story here. My ex boyfriend and I were together from ages fifteen to twenty. We were high school sweethearts, homecoming king and queen, the buzz of our small hometown high school. I loved him very deeply. However, he has hurt me horribly. We had a couple minor break ups in high school, and during each one I had to hear about him sleeping with other girls, while I was just horribly heartbroken. After high school we broke up one more time and he actually dated somebody else for a couple of months. We found our way back to one another and then we stayed together and were getting pretty serious. We were talking about moving in together, we even put a deposit on an apartment, and then all of a sudden he broke up with me over the phone. After five years he ended our relationship over a phone call. I was crushed. Soon after he got back together with the only other girl he had ever dated. They have been off and on. Every time they are off he contacts me. Of course, we all know how that goes.

I have good memories with my ex because he was my first love. Our relationship was so innocent because we were so young. I was blinded by love, and thought I was having the best years of my life with him. Most people know what being in love for the first time feels like-it’s blissful and exciting, you feel like life is perfect and like nothing can go wrong! However, when I look back I think of as we got older and there was a lot of things that weren’t so great about us. His parents did not like me at all, his friends did not like me, he didn’t treat me the way I deserved. Since I was so in love with him he walked all over me and knew I wouldn’t do anything about it, because I was so desperate to keep this relationship. When he broke up with me the final time I found out some things that lead me to believe he cheated on me. (“Poison ivy on his penis” after ignoring me for a weekend, being tagged in pictures dated when we were together that I had no idea about it in unknown locations, etc) This made the break up much harder. 

After our last break up I met a great guy, and I have been dating him for almost three years now. We live together, work together, and we have an adorable dog and the happiest life. I could have never imagined a guy could treat me the way my current boyfriend treats me. He is the best part of my life, and I love him so deeply. I can’t imagine life without him. I love his family, I love his friends, and I love who he is so much. Of course I don’t feel the same way I did when I was fifteen years old, I am not absolutely smitten with love and feeling like a giddy little girl every time we go out on a date. But I love him very much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Due to all of my thoughts about my ex boyfriend I caught up with my ex one night last year and it solidified it in my head that he is not who I want to be with, and he is in fact a jerk. (Side note: two months after I had met up with him he had a threesome with two of my “friends” further solidifying how much I despise him)

That’s why I am so confused why when today I found out that my ex is dating another girl that we went to high school with I got sick. I almost threw up. This girl is the exact opposite of me. For one, she is an atheist and when we were together my ex “loved God” (though could be doubtful now based on how he has treated me and others in the past), and he also hated my tattoos but this girl is covered, head to toe. This girl is also in the military. I am an extreme girly girl who hates physical activity. I don’t want to be with my ex, I almost want to go as far as to say I hate him because of the pain he has caused me. However, I can’t stop thinking about this, and I want to understand why? Is it because I’m wondering how he likes somebody so opposite of me? Am I still subconsciously loving him? I don’t want to have these thoughts, especially when I love my current boyfriend so much. Help!",19Apr2019,1
303,"Very close friend of mine just got out of a mutually abusive relationship, that lasted a few years. This isn’t really the issue. However, a few days before they broke up for good, his gf started making and selling “left of center” flavors of boiled peanuts and is trying to turn this into a genuine enterprise. I tried some chicken fajita ones and they were bomb as fuck. 

I have never had any contact or interaction with his exgf, however I’d be hella interested in buying more of these nuts. Is an interaction and an explanation to friend that I only have interest in business with her the best course of action? I don’t even know why I’m posting this because I probably won’t ever end up buying them from her, but I really can’t fuck up things with my friend, as I’m reliant on him for a handful of important things to me and he’s been an incredibly interesting character in my life since I met him.

He will message me most nights and we'll just talk about anything and everything, but in the last week or so ive noticed that hes been getting quite close to this other girl in our class and i am becoming so jealous.

306,"I’m a 26 yo Male currently working long hours as a chef. Around Christmas time I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, a form of tendinitis in the foot. During its flare ups I struggle to move with out assistance and had to take 3 weeks off at one point.

I have 2 children and a partner who rely on me as the primary bread winner, I have to work to keep a roof over their head and food in their bellies but if I work I run the risk of damaging my foot even more. I hear horror stories of people working on it and damaging themselves for 6 months to a year.

My partner is currently in her 3rd year of an AAT qualification that she’s almost finished with so asking her to go to work isn’t something I want to do and I start my degree in September once she’s finished so finding another job just until September is another option I don’t want to go down.

What can I do? I’m completely overwhelmed with the situation tbh.",19Apr2019,1
307,"Hey, I'm a 21 year old aspie with no job or degree who still lives with his mom. I've been to a few job interviews after I graduated high school but found it difficult to answer questions. I can hardly converse with my neighbors so interviews were very difficult. After realizing how difficult they were for me, my social anxiety before going to future interviews got worse. I started having full blown panick attacks and just stopped trying.

Every year after that became worse. I ended up never leaving my town, to never leaving neighborhood, to barely leaving my house unless I needed to buy food or walk my neighbors dogs. I fell into depression and just stopped seeing the point in anything. But I still had a roof over my head, a warm bed to sleep in and I did walk my neighbors dogs for money so i could buy my own food. This was fine until our home was infested by bedbugs an coackraches. We carried them over after moving from a place more ghetto than we live now and they're only now appearing in droves. Because of this I cannot even sleep anymore. I keep getting bit in my sleep and just now I saw a giant cockroach in my room for the third time. My sleep was literally my only refuge. I hate being awake. It's lonely and depressing and it makes me think too much. My thoughts always end up with wanting to kill myself so I rather just sleep all the time instead so I can at least dream about something else.

I need to get out of here so bad but I have no clue how. I have 0 social skills, I'm terrified of anything or anyone outisde of my home, I'm poor as all hell so therapy and medication aren't options. I obviously can't afford college. Even if someone was desperate enough to hire me, it'd be min wage and there's no way I can afford anything near this city that doesn't have the same pest issues I'm trying to get away from.

I'm a very delusional and paranoid person so part of me believes that some other being has unleashed this infestation on me knowing that bugs are my major irrational fear hoping it would force me to get out of my slump and find a way out. These delusional thoughts are probably due to some other underlying mental health issue that I just haven't been diagnosed with.

I honestly have no clue what the fuck I'm doing or how to drag myself out of this situation. I could live with my dad temporarily while I work out a plan but he was really abusive towards my mom and me. He wouldn't hurt me today as I'm a older and he can't take advantage as much, he's also depserate for me to forgive him. But I don't want my mom to feel like I've betrayed her. That's also why I can't kill myself. She would be devastated. I get really paranoid sometimes when my mom doesn't come home on time or if she's late. I always think something horrible has happened. Sometimes I would just sit silently, terrified and unable to breathe correctly waiting for her to walk in the door. It probably comes from the paranoia I felt as a child, that my dad would one day kill my mom. Even though it scares me, I think to myself that without my mom I could finally kill myself in peace and not have to worry anymore.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't understand how anything works or how to get myself on my feet. I feel like I'm in a really deep hole that gets deeper and deep everyday making it impossible to climb out of. I get so angry at these kids born into nice little familes with money and opportunity while I was born with a broken brain and dragged into a hellhole filled with abuse that would just fuck me up even more mentally for the rest of my life.

I would love to live live normal life, meet a girl, get married but I don't think that's realistic. I'm fucked.

308,"I recently got a new job at a place that boards cats and dogs. I left my old job at Target in the clothing section. I really loved it and enjoyed working there,  I'm really sad I had to leave, someone was harassing me to the point where i felt like throwing up rather than going to work. I decided it was best for me to leave for my safety.

I was really excited about this job, I love working with animals, but after my first day in on-hand training I'm having so much anxiety. Maybe I'm dumb for feeling this way, I am a very small person (4'10, 90~ lb) and working in an area with a many dogs barking at me constantly is very stressful. I struggle with handling the big dogs (I get overpowered extremely easily) and I'm sensitive to noise. My manager said I can wear an earbud to help reduce the sound, and it's helped quite a bit, but I'm afraid that this job is overwhelming. 

The person I was shadowing didn't really help my anxiety much when she said ""this is nothing!! you should see summer and christmas, we can house about 300 dogs!"" I'm just so overwhelmed. After my shift I sat in my car and cried. I'm so small and sensitive, I have autism as well so I get overwhelmed easily. My coworkers are tall, beefy people and have no issue restraining dogs.

During my interview they asked if I'd rather work on the sales floor, or in the boarding area. I knew that sales floor would match my experience more because of Target, but I thought maybe being in the boarding area would help with my mental health. I guess I overestimated myself. What do I do? I will give it at least 2 weeks before I do anything. I know it's my first day and maybe I'm just venting and I don't know what to do. I miss working at Target, I miss my coworkers and I miss enjoying my job. I feel so alone.",19Apr2019,1

310,"J and me were best friends for more than 10 years. We met in university and instantly clicked. We had the same hobbies and could talk about everything. She and her family were immensely helpful when my ex kicked me out and I had to move all my stuff within a day, I’m still really grateful for their support back then. 



Unfortunately, due to a series of events and mistakes on both sides our friendship completely fell apart over the last two years. I’m obviously speaking from my side only now, but I have no more trust left for her. This friendship break-up caused me a lot of pain and it took me months to get over the fact that I just wasn’t important to her anymore at all. 



Up until February of this year we had still somehow stayed in very shallow written contact online (we live in the same city but haven’t seen each other since April 2018), but after she didn’t reply to two of my messages for weeks, I decided it was enough and removed her from my social media. I accepted that it was over for good.



About a month later, she reaches out to me, saying how important our friendship is and that she hoped we could repair it. I was cautiously optimistic and agreed. We never addressed any grievances though, that was probably our first mistake. 



Ever since then we moved our conversation to WhatsApp, but you just can’t really call it a conversation. It's even shallower than before and she only ever replies every couple of days. Now, I know that no one has to immediately reply to messages, but we’re talking days and I do know that it’s not because she’s busy with work (she only works a maximum of 20 hours a week) or anything else. Whatever the reason, combined with the fact that the messages are just so boring and shallow, I want to put a stop to them. Clearly, it isn’t working out. There’s no trust between us, neither of us wants to actually share her life with the other person. Most importantly, the whole thing is weighing me down mentally as I still weep for the friendship that once was. 



But there is no going back and I’m now wondering whether I should tell her that I think it’s rude being ignored for days on end before she sends me another lacklustre message. I’m a very conflict avoidant person, so my first reaction would be to just ghost her. But on the other hand, I feel like I should say something just this once. The last two years I’ve been quiet when she threw accusations at me, always trying to diffuse the situation. I’m angry, but I’m mostly disappointed. Would it be pathetic if I told her this one time how I feel, that I can’t continue this “friendship” this way? Or should I stay quiet and just ignore J’s messages from now on?",19Apr2019,3

313,"As a person, I literally never become angry. Like ever. There’s only probably 1 time I can decisively say I’ve lost my shit in all 20 years of my existence. I mean being so calm has helped me out in the past, where it’s let me keep a level head in situations where most normal people would of lost it, but being this docile isn’t healthy. so I wanna become more aggressive for these reasons:

-1. To stop people getting their way with me. Sometimes I’m just way too docile when it comes to letting other people do certain things. My friends have told me that if they were in certain situations I have been in, they’d lose it. 

-2. I feel like by me not being aggressive, builds up negative emotions over time, and eventually I’ll get upset over something incredibly little. I feel that by me not venting when the scenario arises, it just build up this stock pile of animosity. 

-3. Im a Muay Thai practitioner and I wanna become more aggressive in the sport too. it’s not really like I don’t know how to fight going forward, but it’s more my docile nature stopping me from doing so. I’m pretty good fighting on the back foot, but you can’t keep back peddling forever. 

-4. Im simply fed up of not being able to get angry. It annoys me that I can not get angry, even to a normal person level. 

now the problem is, I have no idea about how to go about accomplishing this. I’ve looked online  and just can’t seem to find any helpful resources other than metaphorical speeches. I’m not looking to become a hyper aggressive asshole, but I’m looking for that switch. Something that when I flick, I’ll finally feel like I’m able to generate some anger or even hate. My life will greatly improve with a little bit of aggression. any help/ advice would be greatly appreciated.

He lives at home and his mother does everything for him I’ve noticed, cooking, laundry, etc. She can be annoying, but she’s nice enough. But he is always calling her names, mostly retarded and stupid.  He has a very bossy personality and has no problem in telling others what to do his parents included, but no one can tell him what to do.  He has a slow temper and always is right in any argument.  And recently he yelled at her to the point of her crying and apologizing, but he didn’t stop even after she was crying. He did that all right in front of me too.  He has never had a good relationship with his father he’s made that clear, and now I’m thinking he doesn’t have a good relationship with his mother either.  Which he doesn’t have a real reason to not have a good relationship with his mother, she tries really hard and does literally everything for him.  So this worries me.  He used to be nice to me, but lately he has been showing the same attitude towards me too, not as bad of course but he has been telling me to fetch him things and cook things.  And the other day he called me retarded and was annoyed with me for a little dumb thing.  He gets annoyed very easily.  His temper and bad attitude is what really bothers me, not to mention he is full of himself and loves the sound of his own voice.

I can’t leave the house without telling her where I am going, what time I’ll be back and who i’m meeting. She has gotten mad at me for leaving my house because she sees it as me ‘abandoning’ her. I can’t go to parties without her making a big deal about it. I’m not aloud spend a night in someone else’s house (even if they are just friends). She tries to guilt trip me into staying. I feel so restricted in what I can do compared to my friends who can do whatever.

The problem is that I’m am extremely unconfrontational and people pleasing. I would rather die than directly addressing the problem. There’s no doubt in my mind that she would take it badly. I just want to keep the peace but also have my own independence.

I was laying in bed about to go to sleep when I got a text from them, but it wasn’t them, it was a voice memo from an oncologist saying they collapsed in another state (they were taking a weekend trip there) but did not give me any other information. I called every hospital in the area and no one had this person listed there, and then I got several text from the nurse saying “why do I need to know the clinic?” And “be patient”. Obviously I don’t want to believe this person I love so much is faking this, and it may just be an outlet for me not wanting to come to grips with reality, but this seems extremely unprofessional of the hospital, and i also have no clue how they would have gotten in this persons phone, and wouldn’t they call me instead of sending voice memos and text messages?

318,"This girl, out of the blue, reached out to me on Facebook messenger. I guess she found me through my old tinder profile. 
She started out saying, “I found you on here and now we should be friends” 
I was confused because she still had her boyfriend in her profile pic. 
I asked who it was, and if he knew about it, like if it was an open relationship. She started to get defensive. 
I didn’t give in as I was not interested at all.
Anyway, she finally said, and yes, this is word for word, 
“My sex drive is too high for my boyfriend to handle. He's not very big and has ED”

Now, one, who in the world just blatantly speaks out against their supposed significant other like that. Putting him down, in front of me? 
I promptly responded with, “no I am not down” 

My question here is...do I reach out to the boyfriend even though I have no idea who he is, (I have mutual friends with this girl, as seen on FB)
I asked one friend and he said don’t, and that I wouldn’t want to get in the middle of that....
But I’ve been cheated on before, and I didn’t find out till weeks later. 
Granted, no cheating has taken place here, but the intention is still there.
Do I reach out and tell the boyfriend? Do I keep quiet? Who has had similar experiences?

319,"Hey guys, this is pretty urgent because I have to go back to boarding school in the UK in a few days on Tuesday. I've been going for 4 years now and I really, really don't want to go back. (For a multitude of reasons - specifically because I have a three-day army trip two days after I land in the UK, meaning I'll have to shoot guns jet lagged with zero friends or even acquaintances. And also the school in general.)

Would it be possible to quit boarding school and attend a school in Singapore (my home country) a year before my GCSEs? I could go to an International school maybe?

320,"Ok so for background, I am an au pair in Finland (eight months) and it had been an almost completely fantastic experience. I have been on holiday with them, never had a complaint or done anything wrong it seems. 

 When I arrived in September I stated my end date would be May/June as I was unsure what to do with my summer (go to camp or not). The host family said okay we will do a flexible return flight for the 18th June. 

So last Friday  I told the dad I intend to leave the 12th April (exactly a months notice) and I’ll change the flight and pay the 50 euros fee. I just caught him as I go to my boyfriend place for the weekend and he said ok that is fine. 

I’m thinking phew thats over with, but receive a text from the dad, the next day stating “Can I call in an hour? Having digested a bit what you said yesterday, it is actually quite a shocker and puts us into a difficult situation as we have planned that you would stay until mid June. What is of course also dissapointing that you have not mentioned about your plans to us at all.” So of course I say we can talk about it. 

He calls me and I say about the camp and I need time to get my visa from the embassy and I also want to spend a month with my family before I go to summer camp again. I say I’m at the point of being so homesick now and my family life at home isn’t easy (which they know as I have a severely disabled sister) and I feel guilty for not helping at this time when she has operations. Long story short the dad asks if I can compromise an extra two weeks. 

I return home Sunday night, (the dad is away until Monday night) and the mum ignores me. Like I usually go to my boyfriends place and come back say hi, what have you been up to etc before bed and there was nothing. She then states “I’m taking the kids to the supermarket” and makes them go with her (she always goes alone) so there is definitely an awkward vibe. I see them return after the supermarket and get a drink to give an opportunity to talk to me etc. She just tells me I don’t need to help with the kids in the morning and I simply say ok. 

All day Monday I am ignored by the mum until the Dad returns in the evening and they have a meeting with me. It basically went along the lines of them talking at me for an hour saying, that it doesn’t work for them, why do they have to pay for my decisions, its unfair, why am I doing this when they have been so good to me, they will be in a financial situation, I don’t care about their feelings, when we said it was a flexible flight we meant to decide together... Even though they don’t care about how I’m feeling and financially I’m being paid in buttons and they are beyond rich. 

I restate my homesickness and need to help my mum at home and also the visa issue and the fact camp starts 10th June anyways. The mum is not even willing to compromise like the dad and says that I will have to go late to the camp (its a special needs camp so I can’t I have to do the training etc and plus its beside the point I wanna see my family). It ends with them telling me I have to solve this problem by trying to get the visa in Finland. 

A few days pass and it is seemingly back to normal in terms of attitude but its just so fake and I feel like shit. I tell them I am not staying longer than I already stated just before they go on a weekend away and they said we will discuss it when we get back... I go into the kitchen after they leave and in the living room (open plan) I noticed a camera. They did not tell me it was there and they have been away plenty of times and I’ve never seen it. Its obviously to spy on me. I’m paranoid there are more but haven’t found any. I’m just sick of this and want to go home.  Ive covered the camera. 

The au pair websites states two weeks is reasonable notice and I gave a month. Plus these situations nearly never go to plan. The terrible week I’ve had, I can’t last that long. I have a perfect opportunity to go this weekend and move to my boyfriends for a few days then fly home. Everyone I’ve spoke to says to leave right now. I want to but I’m so scared of the phone call I would have to make and I feel like a coward. I wrote some notes for the kids but I don’t think they will even care that much.

325,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

326,"I will start by saying I’m sorry for the long post. It’s a long and complicated story.

So back in January of 2018 I met a woman on a video game. We started meeting up and talking about being together. After a few months we found out that she was pregnant. At the time we both lived in two separate states. We both love each other and have decided to keep the baby. 

In oct of 2018 I started getting everything ready to move to be with her and the child. It’s been a struggle between us but we have worked through it.

Fast forward to now, I have finally moved to be with her and the child. The baby is due in 2-3 weeks and now I am filled with doubt and guilt.

I no longer feel like this is what I want. It’s not that I don’t want my child or to be in my child’s life. I just don’t know if I want to be with her. I am confused on so many levels as to if I’m here because of the baby or if I’m here because I want to try and make this work. I am unsure of where to go from here.

328,"Hello.

For about a year now, I've noticed how much hate I carry toward men and group them all as disgusting.

I grew up in a hyper religious environment and most men I was surrounded by were controlling and shallow.

They are taught that an almighty God created men to rule and control women, so it's no surprise that they're sexist and entitled. 

Even my own brothers disrespect my mom like crazy, yet demand food and a clean home/laundry from her even though they're both adults. One of them absolutely loathes feminists and started blaming mass murder of dogs that was on the news on feminists since they're pro-abortion and therefore pro-murder of any living kind.

Part of my mom's role in the house was being the doormat. Anger was always taken out on her(I'm also very guilty of having done this) because she's always there for all of us and don't get as mad for being angry at her. Whenever my dad, my brothers and I were pissed off with something, even if it had nothing to do with mom, we would find a way to blame it on her.

I like to think that I've grown as a person and no longer contribute to deep rooted misogyny especially as a woman. But seeing my brothers still acting the way they did in middle school while expecting to be treated like men boils my blood and I can just imagine how they'll treat their future wives. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of those thing,

Since middle school, I've been hit on by many middle aged men. 

When I was 18, at church, a married man with kids showed interest in me and commented on my weight, telling me I should lose a few pounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I'm still in my early 20's, I despise the fact that men ranging from young to old will always seek 20-something women. It benefits me in no way because I will eventually age and then what? Will they get sick of my wrinkly, saggy body and start hitting on naive 18-year old  girls like they did to me when I was that age?

It makes me afraid to get married.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sort of TL;DR**

Having so much hate for 50% of the population is emotionally draining and also unfair to good men.

Deep down, I'm pretty sure that there are more good men than bad men in the world, but my narrow experience and emotional instability often hinders that rational thinking. 

I expect some criticism from the comments since this post is incredibly biased, which is why I would really appreciate help on understanding men's thoughts, that many of them are individual human beings, not shadows of the ones I've met.",19Apr2019,3

I (25f) was dating a wonderful man (27m) since Sept. We were going to move to another state together in June for his job he was promoted and made the decision to move up the ladder. A little complex but basically I couldn't afford to move until then and I also had my sisters wedding and it's also his birthday so hell be back during that time. He moved over end of Feb. We started having problems of course with distance. His work got very stressful. the company is going under and has so many internal issues. And he decided that it was too much for him to be with me around 3 weeks ago and yes I'm still heart broken. This wonderful man also has a wonderful son (1.5m.) And a previous wife (37f.) I've obviously gotten to know this little boy very well and have watched him grow. A little bit of background on their relationship it was very abusive to say the least. Shes very manipulative and from what I can tell tries to take control whenever possible. He doesnt talk about it a lot because he says it was a really dark time for him. But at the beginning of our relationship whenever he would go see her (to see his son) it would just be super hectic and he would sometimes come home crying because of what I can tell is basically ptsd from being with her. She would call him names and tell him hes a shitty person just on and on abuse. She threatens to not let him see his son etc. So obviously were broken up right now. But were on pretty ok terms. It wasnt a messy breakup we didnt fight.. he just decided he couldn't put effort into me at the moment (I have depression and I lost my job when he decided this and was also dealing with moving and also being away from his son). Weve spoken since the breakup. And he has told me that this might now be forever and that he just needs space. I understand that I shouldnt just wait around and I'm not but let's be real it's only been 3 weeks and I obviously still love him. Now I know this will sound cheesy but I've grown to love the son and every now and then I miss him and I went onto the ex wife's profile to see some photos of the son. And I noticed that they arent fb friends anymore and I'm very concerned because that means that they had a huge fight and decided to unfriend eachother. (They have had plenty of fights and never deleted eachother before) He would not do this, because he obviously doesnt want to risk not seeing his son! I havnt been speaking to him. Because of obvious reasons.. I dont want to chase him I dont want to be a burden but I'm genuinely concerned about his mental health... what if shes refusing to update him and Skype him as per agreement to keep a good relationship with the son.

337,"Any advice on how to end a long friendship? I’ve realized recently that I my “best friend” is really draining. We met in college and she ended up moving multiple states away a couple of years ago so we only see eachother a few times a year now.

We were close but recently I’m realizing that I don’t even get joy from talking with her anymore. When I see that she’s calling me I don’t even want to answer it because I know it will just be her complaining about her day and going on and on about everything in her life (mostly negative) while I’m acting super supportive and then she will kind of off-handedly asking me how I am at the end of the conversation but I don’t even go into much detail cause I feel like I’m just being a bother and she’s just waiting for her turn to speak. She complains about the same stuff over and over again and I’m just tired of it. I talk about my dreams and my fears and just get into deep life stuff with almost all my friends BUT her actually. And she also made fun of my body last summer. I have a small chest that I’ve always been pretty self conscious of and she told me I “had the body of a 5 year old.” When I told her that upset me she was just like “oh I just feel so fat compared to you I was just feeling self conscious.” But that is NOT how friends should act, they should tell you when you look good. 

I found out she’s spending the summer in my state a couple of hours away to work for the summer and I’m not even finding myself excited about it. I can just already envision the fights that will happen when I don’t go to visit her like every weekend because she will expect me to come see her all the time while she’s up but I’m not going to want to drive all that way all the time and I know she’s not going to be understanding about it.
Her wedding is coming up in the fall and I’m supposed to be a maid of honor but idk. I’m putting off buying my dress because I’m not sure how the summer is going to go. There’s a lot of other things, too. We can’t even talk about a lot of stuff because we have very different views. She is very liberal and I’m more conservative but when she just “wants to have a talk” it ends up with her seeming very condemning of my thoughts and almost threatening to end our friendship because she “doesn’t know if she can be friends with someone who thinks that way.” Like she literally almost ended our friendship over the fact I voted for Trump.

Last year I got raped in college. Im a male. I tried to hold off acknowledging it happened for a while, but since then I've developed PTSD, confirmed by a social worker. 

Because of the PTSD I'm overall depressed. I don't really like anything anymore. I'm shit in my classes right now. I'm not failing though. I've pushed through it all and that's one thing I know I should be proud of but I just feel fuckin empty and drained. I'm pushing through it the best I can. My motivation is negative . it's the best animation school in the country that I'm going too - like crazy good . it's guaranteed job at some studio, whether it's pixar or some no name group is up to how hard you work and what you want . 

Because of the PTSD, I developed some really scary panic attacks. A few weeks ago I thought I was going into cardiac arrest and literally sat in public to make sure if I collapsed somebody would see me. The next day I had another and went to the ER. they told me I was totally healthy . I connected the dots a few days later when another panic attack happened and I had a flashback happen . not just the rape itself but consequences after it happened (friends girlfriend was raped by the same guy after it happened to me - and telling a relative about it and them freaking out and threatening shit until I refused to give any information out)

If i leave a semester that means an entire year I would be gone because they structure their schedules so specifically.

My question is, what the fuck do I do? I'm trying to see a therapist right now but he's kind of screwing me in terms of payment. Broke college kid (insurance is not covering anything right now)

344,"This might take a bit of story telling and I’ve never really done this before so please bear with me. 

So my closest friend, “Jane” and I have been inseparable throughout 6 of these 7 years. Throughout high school we would spend nearly every day together and for countless times she was there to protect and support me no matter what. One example that springs to mind is when this one girl made it her aim to make my life a misery. On one occasion she decided to pour a bottle of water on me out of the blue. On this occasion Jane was there and basically beat the crap out of her. Needless to say, this girl never bothered me again. 

I was never more proud to call someone a true friend, and reasons like this are probably the reason why I’ve let this slide for so long but I’ve reached my breaking point. 

So Jane and her bf “Scott” have been together just over 2 years now. They were the perfect couple and really loved up. He was her first boyfriend, first kiss first everything really. Scott had been in a rough relationship before and was and still is pretty depressed because of it and other factors. These things are important parts in what happens next.

So the last year we’ve gone our separate ways. Jane has gone to college and Scott went away to a specialist college in another country. This took a big toll on them both as they had previously spent nearly every day and night together, and now suddenly they were trying to make it work long distance. However Scott was only away 4 days a week and would come home every week to spend time with Jane and would go back, so it wasn’t as if they didn’t see eachother often, just not as often as they had previously. As a result of this Jane gets caught up in the college environment, other guys start taking a shine to her which she’d never really had until now. Scott’s depression worsens since he’s miserable at college and can’t see Jane, he brings this misery back with him consequently pushing her away more. Jane begins exchanging nudes with some dude in her class. She told me about this and I showed my disapproval but promised to keep quiet. She said it was just a way of experiencing what it’s like to be with other guys and it was a way to have a bit of fun and cope without Scott. She seemed to feel a whole lot of guilt about it and so I hoped she would just kind of have a phase and then realise her mistake and sort herself out. Oh how very wrong i was.

It worsened. She began getting close to another guy at her college. She said she felt bad for him since he seemed lonely so I saw no strangeness in their friendship. However they began seeing each other outside of college and she confessed to kissing then sleeping with him. I was shocked and disappointed in her. She felt really bad about it and how Scott would feel knowing this. I told her I’d keep it secret since she seemed to feel so bad about it but again i was wrong. I feel a lot of guilt, maybe if i had done something and tried harder to convince her or tell Scott sooner it wouldn’t of got where it is now. 

As you could have guessed as guilty as she felt at first, she continued to have sex with this other guy all while staying with Scott and letting him pour out his heart and money to her. Scott found out about them after reading a message. He was heartbroken yet remained faithful to her. From the message he gathered something had happened but didn’t know about the sex. I told her to tell him, she said she was going to. She only confessed to kissing him and Scott bursts into tears. This was about a month ago. 

After this Jane tells other guy that they can’t have sex anymore, other guy is disappointed but says he understands. I thought it was over. 

She now has 0 remorse. She’s told me since shes kissed other girls and guys while out, and casually tells me the other day she let some random dude finger her after making out with him all night. What the fuck happened to her. On top of this she’s still really close to the other guy she was cheating on Scott with and is seemingly trying to justify it by trying to force a threesome between them all. Scott has confessed to me how much he hates how he let it almost happen and how much he dislikes this dude. Jane tells me how she thinks they’re getting on really well and that it could work. 

It’s a shit show and it’s really getting to me. I feel as though it’s my fault it’s reached this far, i keep thinking maybe I could have prevented it. But I’ve avoided telling Scott, not only because of how depressed he is, but because I’ll lose a life long friend. That’s extremely selfish but I find it extremely hard to make friends, losing her will be like losing apart of myself but it might be for the best. I really don’t know. Scott basically seems to know, yet he’ll turn a blind eye because he’s isolated himself from everyone else. He no longer has any friends and his family is really divided. She is everything he thinks he has, and even if she does confess I think he’d stay with her anyway and just let the depression eat away at him until he ended himself.",19Apr2019,2

346,"I have a cousin who constantly shit stirs then acts like shes so innocent and didnt mean for any drama, she is the eldest cousin and on my birthday a few years back in a house party she took my sister aside and told her lies that I had been speaking bad about my sister to the point my sister got up and left stating she would never speak to me again. Luckily a mutual friend overheard my cousin do this and i was able to salvage my relationship with my sister. My sister never aknowlodeged what my cousin actually did and insisted I have a relationship with her even though she was never remorseful for what she did to me I forgave.

A year later this same cousin text me inviting me on holiday with her two friends and my sister, i hadnt been away in over a year and really needed a holiday so was excited for a girls trip away and paid for my flights. On the lead up to the holiday my sister fell out with me for a week over something stupid, during the week we fell out i did not hear from my cousin at all until me and my sister made up. The day we both made up my cousin ended up coming over and i was talking about the holiday getting all excited and noticed she wasnt getting excited and conversing with me about it but sitting smirking at me. She left my house and about 10 mins later my sister phoned me to tell me that in the week we had fallen out they had asked someone else to go in my place but that I could sneak in the room and still go.

I was absolutely livid about this as i had paid flights and when I spoke to my cousin about it she took no responsibility and said because it was my sisters friend who took my place it was nothing to do with her, and that I should fall out with my sister over this. I paid her the flight money, she asked me to go and due to her past behaviour i feel like she enjoys me and my sister falling out and will do or say anything to make this happen.  I feel she doesnt like me and i dont trust or want her in my life.

My gran has just invited me to Easter dinner and has told me my cousin will be there and that this is a time for new years and moving on.

I cant, especially when this person does not acknowledge their toxic behaviour towards me.

351,"This has been going on for about 3 or so years now. I get inspired to start really learning how to draw but my brain tries to stop me as soon as possible. It's really sad because I love the concept of drawing and really want to be able to put in the work to become great but my brain physically  won't let me. 


This is my third attempt at learning to draw and it seems like it's happening faster and faster each time. The first time it took me about 2-3 months before I hit the point of ""My brain won't let me sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, I'm hallucinating  and also because of my lack of sleep I can no longer move my hands properly to draw or retain any information because my brain is running on empty."" Then, a year later, it only took a month. Now, another year later, it only took a week to get to this point. 


Can someone please help me out with this? I just want to work on this skill without my brain making all of my dreams so terrifying that I'm unable to sleep for any reasonable amount of time. The constant sleep paralysis wake ups in between micro sleeps don't help either... Have any of you had this experience before? How can I fix this? When I'm not learning to draw I have no problem sleeping a full 8-9 hours, this problem only comes up while learning to draw and goes away as soon as I stop trying to learn.",19Apr2019,0

I am an American, 25, single, speaks 2 languages fluently.

I have an undergraduate degree from an oversea country (MLT) but haven’t been certified yet. I do work in a part time job (24 hours/week) that pays me 1400$ per month and my dad gives me the rent to pay. Also, I am currently a graduate student aiming to complete my degree and then apply for one of these 3 options (MD, PhD, MD PhD).


That being said, I do have some questions that I’d be grateful if you can help me with the answers.


1- Should I get myself a full time job that pays me well, instead of the current one ? Or should I focus on the graduate school and work on my application to  guarantee an acceptance ?

2- Should I get certified as an MLT and then get a job as a MLT ? or should I forget about it since I am pursuing a different goal ?


On a personal level, 

3- What certifications do you guys think is a must to have for a student/human in general ?

358,"Disclaimer: I just want to say that I understand that it's hard to tell, simply from facts/statements, when someone is in love. I understand a lot of it is in emotions you can't express. However, I am not very in touch with my emotions so I am judging wether I am in love simply from my actions and basic emotions, not off anything that I can't tell other people about. 

I've only known my girlfriend for about 2-3 months now, but we have spent a LOT of time together. We go on many dates throughout the week (minimum of 2) and had a period when we spent every day together (for about 2 weeks). We talk every day. 

I never really believed I could fall in love, I don't really understand what it is. But what I know is that recently I have had the urge to tell her that I love her, when we are lying down, or listening to music, etc. She makes me genuinely happy, I am excited to see her often, from time to time I get that warm ~gooey~ feeling when I'm with her. There is no pressure in the relationship for me to say anything, but I want to regardless. 

I don't think I would cry if she broke up with me, if I did it would be very brief. I also only have 3-4 people in my life I care about and am not sure yet if she counts as one of them. 

My last relationship before this lasted a whole year and I never said I love you, and never felt comfortable saying it.

361,"Hi! This is gonna be kind of a long post so I apologize for (probably) giving too many details but I think it's necessary.

Quick note: I've read this whole thing again and I realized that it kinda sounds like my mom is an asshole, which she's not. She's a very loving mom and I know she would do anything for me BUT this is one of her issues that really really confuses me and I want to know what could be done. 

A little backstory. Me and my boyfriend met two years ago on the internet (in a cs:go match). He isn't the type of person to have friends online or add random people on steam or anywhere else on the internet but after the match ended, I added him and he accepted it. I consider myself lucky because he's the best person I know and I'm so grateful to have met him.

After half a year we've met irl in my country for a few weeks. My parents drove me to the airport and from there they drove us to another city where we stayed in a tiny and cozy apartment.
Then I went to his country two more times, I've met his family, flew for the first time in my life (never thought I'd ever fly, and never thought my first time flying would be alone) but I did it for him.

I'm currently in his country, he recently got an apartment so we could finally move in together. Now this is where my mom comes into the story. 

Few weeks ago I told her that I can't make it home on Easter and she got really upset. She has a tendency of guilt tripping me sometimes which is really bothering me. She regrets the fact that she didn't make more kids because now I wont be home  or at least I won't be in the same country. I choose to live in my boyfriend's country because it's not as corrupt as mine and the financial side of it is a looot better and since we want to start a family (soonish), I think it's the best idea for our future kids as well. 

I get that it makes her sad but I also want to be with my boyfriend. I'm 25, I can't please her all my life, but I do feel guilty. I have severe anxiety (especially social and health anxiety. I constantly worry about my health and it can really ruin my day.) I've also dealt with depression and whenever I have to go back home I get super sad because I miss my boyfriend but also because I feel like I don't have a purpose. 

Two years ago I finished university. I mostly went to university because my mom wanted me to. I wanted to follow some classes that had to do with graphic design or something like that but we don't really have that in my country, they mostly focus on ""important subjects"" but I went to university to make her happy and so she will stop complaining.

I had two months left of university after I've met my boyfriend. I was in a really depressive state because I lived alone in another city, away from my family, always been a loner but exams were really anxiety inducing for me. So I couldn't finish my thesis, I did pass all the exams tho. When my mom heard that I wouldn't ""finish"" University she went nuts. I felt really bad, I felt ashamed and a disappointment but I knew I was in a really bad state. 

Fast forward to a year after I've met my bf, I told her that I want to visit him (first time I'd visit him - going to his country) and she almost didn't want me to go because she thought I'd give up on finishing uni and then I won't have a future for myself blah blah. I never said I wouldn't finish it. It would be stupid. I only wanted to postpone it, and I also said that it would mean a lot to me to be with him because I really felt like there is something serious going on between us. We're very serious about our relationship. 

I haven't been able to start my life due to anxiety holding me down. I can't talk to people properly and the thought of having to talk to new people every single day at a job scares the fuck out of me but I really want to do it. I'm determined to start my  life with my boyfriend, but it seems like my mom wants to hold me down. She doesn't like the fact that I want to move to my boyfriend's country because she's scared of flying and she says that she won't see me often. She also dealt with a lot of stress and depression and it scares me that I will be the cause of her depressive state. I'd hate myself for that. 

I feel guilty but I also don't know what to do.

follow the step..

1. Just don't  think about that thing which is distributing you from inside.
2. just find a distraction.. anything like  you had a great lunch this afternoon.. or the girl/boy sitting opposite  to you smiled at you..
3. Now.. just sit straight  and go out for a site seeing.. see the trees just moving back and forth
the wind just touching you gently 
4. Play your fav. song with earplugs on.. and just close your eyes..

you will definitely feel the difference..

366,"So I went through secondary school with this girl, we would've met 6 years ago. We dated and it didn't work out but we stayed close friends and there was always a tension. became FWB but it was basically dating without the exclusivity or title. We used to always fall out and make back up. always been a toxic relationship. We had a large fight after I moved country with my family. We eventually made up after a few months and we got on well when i met up with on a holiday to see our friend group and we got along. so obviously I decide to move out from my parents home and get an apartment with her. 3 months in and I'm just realising that she's been emotionally manipulating me. 

&amp;#x200B;

While not religious, I think a lot about the phrase ""A prophet has no respect in his hometown or his household"". specifically in my hometown as, although I'm not in my hometown, staying friends with her is like taking my hometown with me because she know's about all the stupid things I did when I was younger. I only started getting my life together around a year ago when I turned 20. Before then I don't think I was respectable so it's understandable that anyone who knew me before then wouldn't respect me. Her not respecting me would be fine in as far as i could deal with it , if she could keep it to herself but she's always had a habit of telling people at parties all the shit i did and of course I didnt deal with it very well at the time but she's older now and it's been a while so I've given her the benefit of the doubt and recently it's only been her bitching about me while im in the room with another friend who is helping us find middle grounds which make sense to my but I over heard her last night bitching about me to the same friend about shit that I did when i was a dumbass 17 year old. So now I dont get a fresh start with all of the friends that she's introduced me to because I will never be a changed person. She'll always see me as the person who isn't worthy of respect. I am terrible at making fridnds and I've never done it myself. she's always been the one to introduce me to people and so she capitolises off my inability to make friends. If I stop being her friend I wont have any friends at all, all my friends are her friends first. But I have to stop being her friend. She's the type to brag to my face that she loves that I hate it when she cried because I do anything to fix it, but will always cry or even obviously fake cry when she doesnt get her way. She misinterpret my arguments to tell people the horrific things that I said, when I didn't say the, and she know full well that I didn't say it, she just has to portray me as the bad guy. Of course none of this will stop her from constantly giving my affection... since she's the loving one out of the two of us. I hate that it's taken me this long to see her in the light that my family see's her and has been warning me about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the option of moving back home to live with my parents which would make my life easier in the sense that I wouldnt have to worry so much about making rent, I wouldnt be living with someone as terrible for me, and my father is in a very similar profession as I'm trying to go down so more advice is always good. the problems are that I moved out originally because I felt like a tool living with my parents at 20, I want to be making something of myself and I'm almost 21 now. I also have no friends in England and I can't make them. My rent contract is up in 11 days making it an ideal time to move but the landlord is mid trying to sell the house and my roommate has talked to the new landlord saying we'll stay till next January but no contract is signed. cant be sure about getting the deposit back which would suck. also, She owes me €750 and I can't be sure about getting that back if i leave (especially if i spring on her that I'm moving back home and she has to try find a new place to live in the next few days) what really makes it worse is she's scheduled to have heart surgery in less than a week

&amp;#x200B;

Really confused about about what to do and I have nobody to talk it out with since my roommate's the only person I tell things to but this is about her, cant talk to it with my parents cause they're going to be biased and they already dont like her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate the help.

And sorry for the wall of text, just have a lot floating around my mind all hitting me at once. 

TLDR: My FWB of 6 years is emotionally manipulative and I need to leave but I'd need to leave in the next 10 days before we're due to sign another rent contract for over a year but she's having heart surgery this week and would have to also find a house within the next 10 days or she'd be homeless. she could move in with her mum I suppose but her house life is very unstable and would probably too much pressure on her heart after surgery.  She also owe's me €750. What do I do?",19Apr2019,1
367,"I was hoping to get a scholarship at CSB. When I passed the entrance exam, though, there was no scholarship offer. This broke my heart. I healed for a few weeks, then considered STI, where I got a 50% discount on the tuition for a whole year.

CSB - Communication Arts (Specialization in Multimedia Arts and Animation) - 80k-90k per year (25k-30k per trimester)
STI - Communication Arts (16,015 per semester)

I was dead asleep, and I woke up when my boyfriend was yelling at my cat. My cat was on our bed, where he usually is at night. I guess the cat was bugging my boyfriend somehow, because he yelled and ranted and HIT my cat. Super hard. I could HEAR him hit my cat. He also said, and I quote “you’re lucky I don’t throw him out of the fucking window and watch him splatter all over the ground”. My cat ran out, and I couldn’t go back to sleep because I felt so so bad that I didn’t stop him. I’m upset with him this morning and he knows that. We have fought several times before about the way he used to treat my cat. Now I’m really, really uneasy about it. He accused me of always “taking the cats side”, as if that’s thing. I don’t know what to do.",19Apr2019,101
379,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it",19Apr2019,1
381,"Not your average Advice post. Nothing to do with relationships and all that. I’m having a difficult time choosing a new pair of Bluetooth headphones. Lost my old pair back in January after about a year and a half of reliable use. Now I have the money to buy another, I’m conflicted.

So I want either the LG Tone HBS-910 or HBS-1100. But I’m reading all the reviews on any number of the product listings on eBay and Amazon and not a lot of them are good. Some claim they’re cheap knockoffs of the real thing, or break after a week. I’ve been looking practically everywhere. Careful not to go with $20 versions. Rather I’ll go with something a little more in the appropriate price range, like $90 since that’s what my last pair cost. 

If anybody has had the HBS-1100, hit me up with your review of the product since I’m leaning towards that, even though I think my last pair was a 910. Gotta let go of the past and embrace the future at some point, right? That’s how I figured I should move on to a new version or product.",19Apr2019,1

383,"My boyfriend and I lived together for about a year before having to go to semi long distance last year. I commute over to his city on the weekends and we’re at a good rhythm and I love seeing him at the end of the week.

Last week he asked me to stick around the house for an alarm installation, part of the install was a doorbell with a camera so I had to download an app that ties in to a camera.

Which means that this week I was getting notifications when he was coming and leaving the house with video attached.

Two things before I continue: (1) I love this man very man and he loves me but we’d always agreed we weren’t going to last forever and we take it Day by day. And (2) we used to go to bed at 8 routinely, and have only started going out in the last few months. He’s normally a total homebody and doesn’t have a social circle of any sort right now. 

Tuesday he didn’t get home until 1:30 in the morning. For someone his age, and his personality type, I thought this was highly unusual. But I let it go, I know there’s a local bar he’s become fond of so it’s not out of the question for him to have just lost track of time. 

But then it happened tonight. It’s now 5AM where I live and he hasn’t come home, the system is alarmed as away and he left at about 6:30PM yesterday.

I don’t know whether to be worried for his safety or start making some real exit plans. I could use a sanity check.

How do I approach this conversation with him if he HAS been disappearing overnight? Is it even a discussion?

TLDR newly installed house security system says boyfriend hasn’t been home yet tonight.",19Apr2019,2
385,"I’ve lived with horrible anxiety (mostly social anxiety) since I was very young and it causes me so much stress, I’m constantly stressing out over little things that I know don’t matter and I can’t seem to stop. I get extremely stressed out in social situations often to the point where I feel sick. 

After being crazy stressed and sleep deprived writing exams last week, I was suddenly in horrible pain and went to the hospital where the doctor diagnosed me with an ulcer which he believed was caused by stress. I’m in so much pain now and I’m just laying in bed at the end of my wits. 

This was a huge wake up call for me because I’m only 19. I’ve never been treated or anything for my anxiety/stress because I don’t want to take medication and I hate going to doctors.

Does anyone have any advice for how to deal with high levels of stress and anxiety? I’m terrified of getting another ulcer and that honestly makes me even more stressed thinking about it!

(By the way a family member suggested I start smoking weed. It’s legal where I live. Could this help or would it be a bad idea? I’ve never used it before but they have medical places where I live and I assume they are able to find a strain that can help with your symptoms, it’s not like I’d just be buying something off the street.)

We would get a gallon of ice cream and my dad would say we had to wait until next Saturday to have some more and by the time Saturday came it was all gone. 

I've been realizing that this has caused me to have an unhealthy relationship with food where even if he's not around I still get this feeling that I need to eat everything I really like as soon as I get it because if I don't I fear it'll be gone the next day.

390,"I am 30yo male living in North America for the past 5 years. I am originally from India and I had moved to North America for my PhD studies. I have always been a shy and introverted person who is the most comfortable in my own company. I love painting, reading books, playing drums and I can do these for hours at a stretch without needing to interact with other people. And this is what I have been doing for the past 5 years, in addition to my research. My research being in computational fluid dynamics, require the least amount of human interaction. This has further led to isolation from other people, which I really enjoyed back then.

As a result of my isolation from other people and not partaking in social activities at my university, I have very limited friends. All my close friends (4 people) abroad are Indian and I am friends with my Chinese lab mates. Apart from that, I know nobody well. I have been in some events in the past, but never actually made a good friend out of there.

I have never been to housewarming party, a birthday dinner or Thanksgiving dinner in an American home. It's not that I have never been invited to a party. Whenever I get invited to a party, my social anxiety kicks up and I end up declining the invites. 
So, now I know very little about the American culture and life. I had been on dates with several American women over the past few years, and that is the only way I got exposed to some of the country's culture.

This introverted behavior also affects my abilities professionally. I have never been able to network at conferences or meetings. I don't know how to negotiate or how to make a small talk with a potential employer. 

I have no leadership skills as I never joined a group to hone my managerial and group skills. In short,I never left my comfort zone to interact with a collection of people which has made me quite regretful lately. 

I feel like a failure as I don't possess the skills necessary to survive in the world. I feel as if I  just live in my coccoon and have stopped growing as a person. 

This has affected me emotionally and have made me an extremely insecure  person. Just wanted to let this out. Also, if possible, I would like to hear some advice about ways I can change myself.",19Apr2019,1

393,"I'm not sure what happened, but about a month ago I started to feel extreme paranoia/guilt over events that I cannot change.

These events can be small, meaningless events from my past, or even terrible crimes that have taken place in a different time period or place that I had no control over whatsoever. I can't stop feeling like I should have been there to save others, despite knowing that it would never be possible to. I know that even if I could, it'd still be impossible to save everyone in the world.

Of course, this worry has escalated into terribly vivid dreams that absolutely wreck my morning, however, I'll be completely fine the moment I force myself out of bed, but otherwise, I'm stuck in a fear-wridden, shaking mess. I lose the ability to breathe and there's sweat everywhere. I don't even have any recollection of the dreams, all I know is that when I wake up, I feel immense dread (with or without a prior dream). Then immediately after I'm out of bed, I'm able to reason my mind into accepting that some things are just always beyond our control and calm down.

Any suggestions on what to do in the mornings? Or more so, in general?

395,"Hello everyone, just needed advice please. I was at the customer service counter in a shopping center 1 hour from me a week ago, I told the lady my # out loud. The next day, I had a hair appointment booked for the hairdressers there. I rang and cancelled and said it's not me. It was too coincidental for me to believe the hairdresser accidentally misspelled their mobile number. 

Anyway, just tonight, I had a text saying I joined up to some sports betting. So I had to go to the website, talk to an online service rep, and tell them it's not me.

I just wanted to know, is there anything illegal they can do with my number? Why would they be doing this? I thought maybe they're tryna get their hair done and walk out for free (people do that). It's like stealing petrol with a fake number plate, but instead, getting your hair done with a mobile number that's not yours and walking out, so when they ring up, it's me.

I emailed my local police station just to ask for their opinion. It's probably nothing I can do but change my number, which I don't want to  because it's a big pain in the bumb. My psychiatrist, psychologist, and other doctors have my # now and I'm in the middle of organising important appointments, I can't afford to change it now, there are important things I have to do currently. I am very stressed atm so I can't afford to have this stupid burden of some lady using my mobie.

I just wanted to know, is this something I should just ignore? At the end of the day it's my phone, my account with my provider. Anyone could use anyones mobile number and do the same thing, so is it best I just let the police know encase any crime happens so they know it's not me, and go about my business?

We have to keep a pretty tight budget, which is hard for him because he was in the habit of buying drinks and snacks at gas stations or buying lunch at work instead of packing. Even though he agrees we need to stay on a budget, the bank statement showed he kept buying needless stuff out of our joint account. 

We discussed that he was having trouble controlling himself, so he agreed to let me hang on to his debit card so he will stop buying things. Then his card went missing, I learned that he stole it back without telling me. 

After that whole fiasco, I find that he has been stealing out of my ""bank"", or my cash bag I bring to work to make change for customers, also where all of my tips I've earned in a shift are.

404,"Growing up, my Dad was the youngest of six children. His mother abandoned him, his father and his other siblings when he was three, putting him in a taxi with one of his sisters, sending then far away, then never coming back. This really influenced his sense of entitlement growing up, which manifested into a lot of emotional abuse towards myself and physical abuse to my own mother (his wife) growing up. As I got older and moved out, our relationship took a real turning point. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Through seeing my maturity and ability to grow into a strong independent just like he did, he started coming to me for advice and I started asking more questions. This therapist role, though incredibly strenuous at times, really allowed us both to start piecing together an extremely broken relationship. He realised a lot of what he did was a deflection of his emotions towards his mother, particularly in a house of all females. There was years of apologies and emotional talks, he even said he loved me quite regularly. However, he's just never quite rebuilt that relationship with my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, his mother, who abandoned him, died. She had nothing to do with him and he didn't ever seek anything to do with her, despite a few of his siblings doing so.

I’m in my twenties and married. We are just getting into the thick of our careers and doing pretty well. My sister does pretty good financially also.

My mom reached out to my sister and i, last July asking for assistance with my parents behind mortgage. My sister told me she was done helping my mom and she wasn’t giving her any money. I sent my mother 900 dollars because i didn’t want them to be foreclosed on.

So far my mom has paid me only $100 back. However, after talking to a relative last night- i found out my parents bought a new SUV recently. My mom also let it slip that my step dad told her she should buy a certain dining table set on credit that she wanted. I found that weird considering they owed me money still. Also note that my mother has gotten settlements in the past and not given my sister or i a penny while we were in college to help. 

Am i wrong for telling my mom that i need them to go ahead and pay my money back? I’m not sure what their financial situation is currently- but they both work. And it hurts that they bought a new truck and didn’t mention it. It seems sneaky. I have never spoken to my step dad about this money, so I’m not sure if he even knows that they owe me.

I'm 21, a male European. English is not my first language, so I hope you'll forgive me if I make grammar mistakes. I have a female friend who is the same age as me whom I've been friends with for 6 years. We never dated or had feelings towards each other as far as I know and we've never had a fight or an argument until 3 months ago. So as you can guess we used to get on pretty well, I love her really much and I am sure that she loves me back.

I immediately told that it was not my intention, that I just didn't want to talk to her at that exact moment. But she did not forgive me and we didn't talk for 2,5 weeks (we used to talk literally every minute or two back then, so 2,5 weeks is like a year for us). Then she started texting and things got better but now I was upset that she didn't text me for 2.5 weeks and I stopped texting. We didn't talk for a month. Then we started texting again and but it isn't the same since then. We often have fights over things that wasn't a problem in the past.

We live in the same city, the distance between our houses is less than 6 kms, we go to the same gym but for some reason she constanly finds excuses for not meeting me and changed her gym hours to avoid me. We talk pretty well at the times we're not fighting but we just don't see each other because of her.

414,"Throw away account just because of personal stuff and drugs.  Apologies it’s abit long but really needed to get it off my chest and have no one to talk to about it.      


So about 8 months ago my friend, who is a girl, started dating this guy. The second I met him we really hit it off. He was just a super nice, cool guy and we had loads in common. 


I’ll be honest, I did find him very attractive. But he was dating one of my closest friends and he’s straight so didn’t think much about it, wasn’t going to develop feelings or anything.  


After a couple of months, we become quite good pals, start going for drinks just the two of us, he’d crash on my couch if we’d been out and I was super happy to have a cool new friend. He really fitted in with our friendship group so he basically turned up to every event now. 


We all head out on night and decided to take some MDMA. My memory gets abit hazy because I got wasted but I remember being outside and him putting his hands on my legs and keeping them there because it was cold. Did think it was abit weird but actually appreciated he felt super comfortable around me and never had a problem with me being bisexual or anything. 


But after that we all head back to my mates house. All I remember is me and her boyfriend cuddling on the couch. She was in the room the entire time and I thought he might have just been comforting me because I was super high on drugs. But I did panic as I had no memory who initiated it and was thinking fuck did I cross a line? Did it look like I was coming on to him? It made me super anxious and I was really confused trying to remember this situation. Ive literally never done that with anyone else before while high, this was the first time.  


A few months pass and at the start I was abit awkward about the situation. But it’s quickly forgotten about and we go back to being normal. I then host a house party and not wanting to get too wasted as the host I didn’t take any drugs. Start speaking to my mates boyfriend and he’s super friendly and gets abit touchy. So I thought that’s just what people are like on drugs and it must’ve been both of us who initiated it last time and actually felt better about it. 


Fast forward to last Saturday and it’s actually the first time my friends boyfriend tells her he loves her. We were drinking all day and me, my friend, her boyfriend and my flatmate all head back to mine. We get some MDMA and just stay up drinking and listening to music. I’m on the coach speaking with my mate for ages but then typical, I get too wasted and don’t remember much. 


From what I remember, again me and her boyfriend are cuddling on the couch just the two of us. Again I can’t remember who started it but I remember him rubbing me and getting really touchy. There were also some photos taken and you can clearly see he’s the one with his arms around me. Again I literally don’t do this with anyone, even when high. I’m not saying it’s all him but he seems to be fully on board, if not initiating it.  


Again, I don’t know how it started or even how far it went. But I know we started kissing. My friend was in and out of sleep on the other couch but I think she caught us and was understandably upset. They left and then the next day I felt so incredibly guilty. 


A few days pass and all of my friends blame me for the situation. Obviously I’m not saying I’m completely innocent but really upset I was so disrespectful to my friend and her relationship.  I know I would have never done anything sober and I know it meant absolutely nothing to me. 


But I’m really struggling to get over this. I feel like I’ve messed everything up.  Am I over reacting? How can I make things better with my friend?

429,"So we have been in this apartment for almost 2 years, downstairs neighbor has been there maybe for 9-10 months. Everything was fine in the beginning but as of recently she has started banging on the ceiling almost daily when we walk around. Now I’ve lived on the second floor and understand how annoying upstairs noise can be. But we are not stomping/jumping/banging stuff around up here. We both walk lightly and can’t even hear ourselves walk. We do have 2 dogs but we don’t allow them to rough house inside. When they get the urge to play we take them outside. But sometimes when we get home obviously they’re excited and get the slammie whammies lol but we settle them down. They do sleep in our bed, and of course have to jump down, which yes probably makes more noise than usual. 

Well last night I was watching tv in bed and my dog jumped down to get water. She banged on her ceiling for probably a solid 2 minutes. I’m just at a loss as to what we can do to get through this. At this point we have gotten the “broom treatment” as we call it for: cooking, having sex, dogs going under the bed, walking, dropped a pan, and literally one night we were just watching tv in bed. Our lease here is until December and I really don’t think I can last that long.

So, I need some advice on how to handle this situation in a friendly manner. I will admit, in a few of those times I have gotten angry and stomped my foot which was uncalled for I know.

430,"Context: My mom is a first generation Chinese immigrant who currently makes \~60K as a researcher at a local university, and I just graduated college at 21 and am currently enrolled in a computer bootcamp with no other job. We currently have \~100K in savings.

Situation: My mom had always wanted to own a house. A couple years ago, around 2015 ish (I don't really know the exact date because I was young and a high school student, but apparently house prices were really cheap), she had planned to purchase a home but didn't go through with it because 1) she was going through a really difficult divorce, 2) I was about to go to college, 3) as a single mom, she didn't feel comfortable throwing all her money into one thing. 

Fast forward a few years, I have graduated college without a single cent in debt (Don't be impressed--it's not because I did anything, it's because I chose to attend the university my mom worked at and they offer practically free tuition to their employees' children). House prices have really risen, and my mom just can't stop bemoaning her regret in not buying the house sooner. 

We currently live in an apartment, and our upstairs neighbor has been a tad...cacophonous lately. Thus, her talking about wanting to buy a house has increased 10-fold. She'll usually find a way to talk about buying a house at least once per day, and sometimes, like today, she'd manage to bring it up twice in completely unrelated scenarios (baby pictures to buying a house in 6 months...really?). 

And to be honest, that gets on my nerves a bit but if it was only that, I'm fine. After all, she's worked so hard all her life, it's understandable that she's excited at all of it finally paying off.

What's grating my nerves is how she intends to buy the house. Like I said, I'm currently rolled in a computer science bootcamp. The bootcamp has a delayed payment (so I'm not paying anything up front) and a job guarantee for a job that earns at least 50K per year, though some manage to earn 90K upfront. Since my undergraduate degree had literally nothing to do with computer science, I told her that I'll probably earn more on the low end of the barrel in the beginning, but she somehow became absolutely certain that I'll be one of those that earn 100K+ because I am her ""smart baby girl"". Now her bemoaning has turned from ""I regret that I didn't buy a house sooner"" to ""I regret that I didn't buy a house sooner, but after my daughter finishes her bootcamp she'll earn at least 90K a year and we can finally buy a house."" I tell her that I feel pressured by this, but she then snapped back and asked why I don't want to buy a house.

She hates her current boss (and after hearing the story of him firing someone for having a child, I do too) and is planning on quitting the job and taking a break for half a year as soon as I get my own job. Without any input from me, she's already had everything planned out--as soon as I get a job, we'll buy a three bedroom single-family house with two bedrooms for us and one for my future child and move out of our apartment. She'll make the downpayment for the house ""for me"", and I'll pay the mortgage and the house will have my name written on it. Of course we'll continue to live together, and I'll become the breadwinner of the family. My future husband will simply live with the both of us after we get married. 

What do I think about this? To be frank, not the most happy. 

I have lived together with her all my life and all through college (I lived at home because I had the permission to and lodging is expensive as hell), and I was lowkey looking forward to becoming independent. She is an overprotective mom, for all the right reasons but still, I want to try living on my own. I've been trying to become more independent by getting a part-time job and paying my own phone bills, washing my own laundry, doing grocery shopping, and cooking whenever I can (sometimes my studying goes a bit late in the afternoon and I forget to eat until later, when she had cooked everything.) but she still doesn't believe I can on my own. According to her, it's not realistic for us financially for me to live on my own after I get a job since we can't pay for a house and my own apartment at the same time. Plus, for some odd reason, she is under the impression that it'd be more awkward for me to bring my future boyfriend into my own apartment than it'd be to bring him to a house with my mother also living in it, just because the former's an apartment.

Also, I'm just not the most thrilled about her, once again, planning out every facet of my life for me. She has a tendency to plan everything for me, like her plan of having me and my husband living in the same house as her with our kids. First, I'm not sure I want to get married and have children. I never liked kids, and never understood what everyone else found so cute about them when they just annoyed me. Second, I'm not even sure I like men. I'm really confused about my sexuality, and my mom, being a self-declared ""devoted Christian"" isn't the most friendly towards LGBT folks. She said she'll accept me no matter what, but I have my doubts since one of her friends literally tried to find a conversion camp for her child and she didn't say anything about it. Third, she even planned on the kind of man I should marry! She decided that, since I come from an ""incomplete family"", I should marry a man with a really large family. To be frank, I never understood what's so incomplete about being the only child of a single mom. It's nice and quiet and we're very close. Large family gatherings scare me, and if I were to get married I'd not want much to do with my in-laws.

Sorry, this turned into more of a rant than a question. I guess my question is how should I...safely express my dissatisfaction without upsetting her?",19Apr2019,3
431,"Hello, I am 17 years old and my mother just agreed with her husband to move to Cozumel. My brother, 19, adores the idea and sees a future for him there. Sadly, for me, I've never enjoyed traveling, warm places, or anything they have brought up so far.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place, but not for me. I currently live in Quebec, Canada, and I have made career choices off this. I am doing great in my enriched programs at school to become a nurse, since Quebec is needing staff bad.

I am explaining this because I always wanted to stay here. They say they have no real future here, it's difficult to live and the winters are exhausting. Over there, they have hookups for apartments and even offer a new restaurant for my mother's husband to reopen (since he used to be a chef and owner of his own restaurant in Cozumel 16 years ago)

If I don't go, my mother explained, they will stay here, since they don't want to leave me behind in Canada. The only options I have found for the moment to stay here but to allow my mother to leave has been to ask my aunt (who said she has a full house and cannot take care of me) or my dad (who I haven't talked to in a year, I have blocked and refuse to talk to him. Added on the fact his wife doesn't like me and would probably refuse my stay)

433,"I mean, I *probably* don't have the money to be spending on a personal trainer or nutritionist, but... well, when it's important enough, I can usually find a way to make things work.

Frankly, I'm tired of being fat. But I just *cannot* seem to break a lot of had habits.

For example, this morning I needed to withdraw some cash to keep on-hand, and the nearest ATM for me inside a convenience store. So of course, I think ""Man, a donut sounds awesome"", and proceed to pick up not just a donut, but also a soda.

I get to work, drink the soda, take one bite of the donut, realize I've just completely undermined the *minor* victory I had this week (I've been hovering the same weight for about a month, finally lost like 3lbs this week), and just threw the rest away.

I work out almost every weekday at work, but deep down, I feel like I'm just not doing enough.

More than just ""knowing *what* I need to do*"", I feel like it would be great to have someone to hold me accountable. At the same time, though, I also kind of worry they would get frustrated or even *angry* when I make stupid decisions like this morning. Or that I'd continue making those mistakes anyways, and it would just be costing me a lot of money (I don't actually know how much a personal trainer costs; I'm assuming it's like $400/month? maybe more?).

I dunno. I'm curious of any of you folks have hired any personal trainers before, and if so, what kind of results you saw, or how it mentally affected your journey?

Or hell, I'd like to hear from personal trainers, too! Like, for someone like me who just *keeps* making the same stupid choices the undermine my weight-loss goals, is that something that a personal trainer or nutritionist can help you overcome? Or do you have to sort of ""solve that"" *first*, and *then* hire a trainer, once your head is *already* in the right place?",19Apr2019,1
434,"So this post is gonna be pretty long. I am an 18M from USA and I moved to India for university (parents are Indian) and I have MDD (Major Depressive Disorder). For those of you who are not aware of what people with MDD feel, other than occasional mood swings and low self-esteem, I also lost interest in everything I used to do a lot, like watching TV shows, studying and a couple of other things. So now here's where I need help.

I don't want to be depressed anymore because it's affecting my grades and already ruined my social life. I believe that getting myself interested in different activities that I'm sure I'll like will make me happier. So one thing that I really want to do is play on Nintendo again. When I was a kid, I used to play on GBC, GBA, DS and Wii and my parents were chill then. But around 2010, my parents suddenly went berserk and took away anything related to video games which they disapprove of, since they were afraid I'd get addicted to it and I would not study (Indian parents can be described by the same stereotype that Asians are known for: scoring high grades are priority and anything else is not necessary). I was not allowed to do anything except study and take a walk outside for half an hour. Not even watching TV or hanging out with friends. So from then, I never got to play video games again. 

And now I'm a university student with depression, and nearly nothing looks interesting to me. At the moment, I really hope to play on a Nintendo Switch or a 3DS. These two particularly, because Nintendo was my childhood and also because my parents will definitely not let me play a console that's hooked to the TV; handhelds are the option for me. And as expected, my parents refused to buy me one, not only because they disapprove of gaming but because my family is not well off. I'm not a kid and I can understand that, so I'd like to get one by myself. However I don't have any money since in India there is no concept of part time jobs. For example a McDonald's employee in India is legitimately poor and needs the position as a full-time job. So I looked for ways to earn money online, and something that caught my interest is animation. However I don't have a drawing tablet and my drawing is not good with a mouse. So I'm looking for a way to make money online so that I can afford the drawing tablet at least, but if there's a way to earn money enough to buy a Switch/3DS, I would gladly take on that. The biggest problem is that I grew up with no extracurricular because my parents didn't let me do anything except study, so to put it in simple words, I'm talentless. However I'm still willing to do anything that is possible and expense free to be able to earn online.
So can someone please help me in my quest on buying a Switch/3DS? Any legal and socially acceptable suggestions will be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance.",19Apr2019,0

I'm a senior software developer at a large tech company. I've been in the industry for about 8 years, and feel confident in my technical skills. But I'll be first to admit that I'm not the most apt when it comes to my interpersonal skills.

I wouldn't say I'm a people pleaser but I do care that my co-workers have a positive opinion of me.

One thing I like to do when I am put into a new environment is to take extensive notes. Often it'll be on my laptop, and I'll be typing away during meetings while listening intensely. I guess this comes off as a more junior thing to do, even though I don't agree.

Seeing this, I noticed that managers who I don't report to, or even sometimes my peers during meetings will tell me to ""write that down"". I didn't see this as a problem when I was more junior, but as I become more senior in my role, and hope to move into a management role in the upcoming year, I'm recognizing that complying with this is making me look like a person with less authority.

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and what I can do to politely tell them to stop treating me like a scribe. This is a new environment for me, and I hope to stay with this company for a long time. So I want to make sure I set the right reputation for myself and not be seen as a pushover.

My wife has known the mother since before she met me (10+ years) after they were besties for a couple years the mother moved a state away (about an hour) They sporadically kept in touch until the mother got pregnant. We were asked to be godparents to the daughter and we accepted not thinking much of the title as it’s not really legally binding. After the mother had her son we were named godparents to him as well. The mother was sure to mention we were the godparents every chance she got which was fine with us. So when the son was about a year old the parents started going down hill. Getting into drugs (meth and pills) eventually losing their home. They had been staying at the fathers aunt and uncles when DSS was called on them. The kids were tested for drugs. The daughters test came back clean but the son had meth in his system so they took the kids. We were not aware of any of this until the kids were already in foster care in separate homes. Once we found out we have been trying to get the kids to be able to stay with us so they could be together. We have a court date May 2nd and we might be able to get them at that time. We aren’t exactly well off but I believe we can provide them with all their needs and a more stable place than they’re in now. We just need some advice. Any advice on what to do and what to expect.

449,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm (\~25F) in a pretty serious relationship with my boss (\~35M). We've been working together for 9 months, dating for 6 months and moved in together at the beginning of this month. Yes, it's a bit quick for some people but it made sense for both of us and we've been semi-cohabiting since the beginning of the year. I don't see this relationship ending anytime soon.

Now that the weather has started to warm up (located in Canada), I find myself getting more paranoid that my coworkers or people in other departments will find out about our relationship. It's not because I'm ashamed to be dating him. 

I am, however, worried that others will question whether or not I deserve to have my job.

It gives me extreme anxiety and makes me very upset to think that others within our department (all men) would react like this. In fact, the two of us go to great lengths to separate the two aspects of our relationship because I really value my career and have been working really hard to prove that I am a valuable teammate to the department and company as a whole.

Whenever a situation arises where special treatment could be a concern, I always ask him if he's positive that he's treating me as he would our male teammate. There have even been times where we have talked through a situation together and ultimately decided that the outcome, although not particularly favorable to me personally, would be better for the company we work for.

I know that I cannot control how other people react, but what are some suggestions to better prepare myself to deal with this situation or my anxiety?",19Apr2019,1
450,"Hello all. I am a college student who currently lives three hours away from my parents. 

I told my mom already that I would be coming home for Easter dinner on Sunday and she started planning it and basically cooking already. There will be other people there besides me but I don't get home much and I know she wants to see me.

Basically one of my professors (that I'm pretty close with) invited me and a bunch of his other music students over to his house for Easter, which would definitely be exponentially more fun than having to drive all the way home and back (which is also a lot of gas money). He's a super cool guy and it would be a great opportunity for him to get to know me better because I'm applying for a fellowship under him for next year.

The biggest reason that I'm conflicted is that my mom and I recently had a falling out and she said a lot of extremely rude things to me, which has been affecting our relationship because I don't really want to be around her in fear of it happening again.

453,"Long story short, I am a director of marketing in a small but profitable business. I've been here for about 1.5 years. During that short time, I lead a complete rebranding package that was largely successful. Despite the mostly positive direction the company has taken, there has been a lot of unrest at the leadership level that has finally resulted in a split.

Three of the partners are going to stay at my current company (OrigCo), but in so many words said they didn't want to keep me because my salary was too high and they want to cut back on expenses. They might keep one low-level staffer of mine in order to just handle the simplest tasks and otherwise only do the most basic tasks.

Two of the partners extended an invitation to the new company (call it SpinCo), saying they need someone at my skill level to fill a strategic role. Since the split announcement, the SplitCo partners have pushed hard to get me working on their new company despite the fact that my current salary is paid by OrigCo. They want a pitchbook, website, branding, everything ASAP. As a result, it's sort of like working for two companies at once. I've been managing my team for OrigCo, while also staying extra time for SpinCo.

I've started to feel uneasy about this. Not only does it seem a bit unethical, it also worries me that I'm being prepped to be fired by SpinCo once they've milked me for their strategy/creative needs. Basically, asking me create a full strategic plan then say thanks your services aren't needed anymore while they push full steam ahead.

Not only that, but it seems clear that this new company's materials are not part of my original contract.

455,"**TLDR: My Older Half-Brother Blocked My Number After I Paid For 2 Weeks In Motels and I said I Won't Support Him Moving To Another Area.** 

This will be long so it will have a better frame of reference.

So for context my half-brother is 9 years older than me and he a mental breakdown when was 17 years old. I was visiting my Mom when this happened , he was hospitalized for two weeks, and diagnosed with Bipolar. After his medication caused him to gain weight and messed up his liver function, he got put on disability.  I remember him having a lot of angry outbursts whenever I came to visit and screaming at our Mom for the smallest things. My mom was not a perfect Mother by any means, but she certainly didn't what she could for him, and she didn't deserve being talked to that way. I used to joke about and describe him as Cartman from South Park, eventually when I got older I started sticking up for my Mom. I would often try to diffuse situations by putting it into context for him and give it some humor. He never showed much of an interest in getting a license and my Mom couldn't afford to get him a car anyway. She had to spend alot of time driving him around.   

He started to improve over the years and was able to get through college, and his social skills improved dramatically. He still snapped at my Mom but I would not let him if I was around. My mom still had to drive him around for the most part, and he began to grow some bitterness about not being able to drive. My mom also helped him edit all of his papers (she is an English professor) and I would have to teach him life skills. I taught him how to shave and when he started to have an interest in getting a license I taught him to drive. At this point my Mom would use his disability to help pay for the expenses, something he is bitter about to this day. Around this time he was also growing increasingly bitter that his younger brother was teaching him basic life skills. When he was starting his masters program and he was doing alot better my Mom finally helped him get a car. She moved to the state over for better teaching opportunities, and to allow my brother to finally get some independence. After about a year he totaled his car, got a concussion, and then he became delusional and paranoid. So much so that he was asked to leave his apartment complex because he had delusions about one of the female apartment managers and at the apartments pool he loudly talked to another resident about his delusions involving her. 

My mom thought it would be best for him to move in with me in my apartment, so he had to move to another state due to this, and find other mental health professionals in the area. After moving in with me it quickly became apparent that he needed to be under supervision majority of the hours of the day. He would often discuss his delusions, and communicate suicidal thoughts. I worked from home for the most part so that was not an issue, but I had to take online classes for college. I tried to spend time talking to him in constructive and non-confrontational ways about his delusions. He would spend most of his hours during the day watching tv series and in the time he lived with me, he re watched the same 3 TV series probably 5 times each at least. I would do my best to get him up and motivated, with limited success. My mom was still the payee for his disability and would put it toward my rent. My brother was very angry about this arrangement and about 6 months into living with me he started screaming at me at least once a week about how he thought I owed him money. 

He eventually decided that he needed to go into the mental health hospital and he spent a week at the hospital. After this my Mom came to visit more often. This made him more angry and he repeatedly said how Mom and I were stealing money from him, and how Mom and his step dad (my dad) abused him. I would tell him he is an adult he can find his own place if he wanted, once when I said this he tried to kick me in the testicles but I put leg in front of him, I let it go. The next week my Mom was eating dinner with us and he was screaming at my Mom so loud that I thought people were going to call the cops. I shouted ""You don't talk to your mom that way"" and he shot up from his chair, I stood up as well, and he started taking swings at me. I have a few inches on him and I was in much better shape, and I put my arms out and put up my guard, moving down the hall, until he tired out. It left my arms covered in bruises and some scrapes. He walked out of the apartment, took a walk, then when he came back in I hugged him and said that it was okay I told him that if he tried to harm me physically again I would defend myself.  

I slept with my door locked after this, after a few of days he said he was suicidal and wanted to go to the hospital. He spent another 10 days in the hospital and we arranged that he stay at transition house after his release. After 8 days he begged to come back to the apartment. Around this time he talked alot about how he was in 30s and wanted to get married. He went on dating sites after this and after a little while he started talking to a women a few years younger than himself on Skype nearly everyday. I asked him questions about her every now and then and he was less angry for a few months. After this he was more short tempered about how he believed we owed him money and how we sabotaged him. He made plans to meet the women he met on the dating site, My mom drove  him and he spent 4 days with her. He told me that they planned to get married when he returned. He grew increasingly adamant that Mom and I pay him back his disability money that we 'stole' from him and brought up his past delusions. I had told my Mom I had enough and we needed to talk to him about he would need to discuss med changes or live in the transitional housing. When we talked to him about it he was calm talking to me but after he said how I don't support him, my Mom challenged him on that. This enraged him and shouted at her saying she was a terrible abusive mother who never cared about him and he stood up. I shouted that he had no right to talk to his Mom that way and called him ungrateful. He lunged at me and tried to punch me in the head, I saw red. Before he could make contact I grabbed him arm, tripped him, got on top of him, and he kept trying to hit me. I had one knee on his left shoulder and I tucked my chin and brought my shoulder in, so he wouldn't be able make contact with anything but my arm. I put  my hand on his throat and when he kept trying to hit me I punched his forehead 6 or 7 times. I remember thinking I wanted to teach him a lesson. I left him with a sizeable bruise on his forehead.  

He stayed in transitional housing for a week after this, my Mom asked that I go with him to the counseling appointment the next week with him. After this the counselor recommended that he go to a skills trainer. He stayed with me until he moved in with his future wife, I helped him move his stuff out, and I told him I love him and good luck. I didn't talk to him for over a year, and my Mom stayed in some contact with him. I moved on with my life, He ended up divorced and homeless in a different state. My Mom lost contact with him as well.   

2 years after he moved out of my place I decided to try to get in contact with him. At first He was glad that He had a family member to talk to. He was staying at a homeless shelter and then got into transitional housing. It was actually nice to talk to him and it seemed like we were burying the hatchet. He then told me that he wanted to move out of the transitional housing, because he said there were too many arguments and that he believed abuse was going on. I asked if he felt safe and he said yes, so I strongly urged him not to move out until he had something lined up. He didn't listen and after spending less than a week at the homeless shelter he said he found a studio apartment that he found on Craigslist. I urged him to proceed with caution as it is an odd situation to be sharing a studio apartment. The next thing I heard from was that he was moving into the place, and he had payed his first months rent.  He told me they were getting along, a couple of days later he texts me late at night that he was getting kicked out. He also said the guy had his stuff and did not refund him. 

I tried calling him the next day and his phone went straight to voicemail. I waited a couple of days to see if he would call, and after making calls in his area I found out he was in the mental hospital. He told him he was kicked out because the guy said this situation was not working out.  I offered to help get his stuff back, coaching him on what to say. When he got out of the hospital He contacted the guy and I got him to ask for a refund, he said he would be willing to pay something back as a refund.  My brother arranged to pick his stuff up and I did not find out till later that he picked it up from a storage room so he wouldn't have to confront the guy. After this He used the rest of his disability money for the to stay in a cheap motel for a few days. He told me his top priority was finding a place, he said he was hooked up with an organization that could help him find housing and get him funding as well. He falsely told me that it should be done in a week or two. I got some advice from my parents on how to proceed. I ended paying for a week in the motel for him. 

He expressed some gratitude and I told him the condition was to keep me posted on what was happening. He began to call me multiple times a day with the most insignificant details and basically inane chatter. I began to find out more about what was happening, and could see him becoming rapidly less lucid. I had him show me the screenshots of the texts between him and the person he tried to rent from. It turned out he threatened to call the cops on they guy he was renting from for having meth in his bathroom. Also the resource that was supposed to help find me housing was primarily a career center, that had a small housing division. Beyond that he had never even meet with them and he was about to have his first appointment with them, I did not find this out until later on. When I would ask about how the housing search was going he would say something like  ""I'm trying to see what my funding will look like"" or he would tell me about what jobs he was applying for. In his case he is really not employable, and gets a decent amount for disability. Finding housing was what he told me he was going to focus on. On the day before he had to check out he had lost his bus pass so he was not able to go anywhere, he got it back at the end of the day. 

That night we had a long phone call about his state of affairs. I asked how the housing search was going and he told me the same thing about waiting for funding and he had one prospect from craiglist. I did my best to be calm and pragmatic with him. I tried to temper his expectation of what the organization would be able to do for him and what the time frame would probably be. I asked him what he felt the best approach would be, mainly to determine how organized his thinking was, and he said that another week in a motel would make it easier for him to find a place. Also that the shelter was depressing and he didn't want to stay in the shelter on his birthday. I sent him a list of affordable options for housing on Craigslist.  I called my Mom again to get advice, and she said if you get him another week in a motel do the best you can to get him into a more permanent situation. This is would be something of a challenge given that have I lived on the complete opposite side of country from him for over a year, and he lives in an area I have never been to.  I made the condition for another week in the motel that he give me ROI's with each organization so I could have a better understanding of the transitional housing options in the area, He agreed. 

I called nearly every motel in the area to find a better rate and room. I found one that was about a mile down the road from the motel he was at and I booked it. He asked how he would get there and I said I would get him an uber. He wanted me to tell him the night before when the uber would be there to pick him up, because he wanted to load the car with his stuff before checking out. He said that because of his rheumatoid arthritis that it would require 3 trips up and down the stairs. I spent a good deal of time explaining how to do it more efficiently and the litany of reasons why loading the uber before checking out of a motel is not practical. At this point he started to say things to me that where increasingly more inappropriate. Right before we got off the phone for the night he made a sexual comment about fiance'. Found out that my brother had started texting my Mom again around this time harassing her, talking behind my back, and showing that he was giving me false information.  

Once he was at the new hotel he expressed a measure of gratitude, and I did my best to refocus him. I also let him that know that if he lined up a place he would have our Mom's and My support to help getting him situated. Over the course of the next few days He found out that he would not receive housing funding from the organization, and had to deal with mental health court. He also didn't hear back from the places he contacted and this left him feeling depressed. I backed off for a couple of days so I would not have to deal with his drama and I was dealing work related stress. Yesterday I checked in with, and I found out that he not signed any releases for me. I got on his case a bit about it, and he reluctantly gave me one. He said he was going to try to contact more of the craiglist listing I picked out for him. That evening I called him and asked the day went, he replied shitty, and sounded pretty flustered. He had phoned a women about a room in a house, from what I could gather demanded a rental agreement in writing and receipts of payment. It was pretty clear he had phrased that request in confrontational way and came off desperate. After He attempted to explain himself, I told him that he probably came on too strong. He replied bullshit, and I tried to explain sometimes you need to take a softer approach. He told me he wanted to move out of the area he is in, and there are lot of reasons why that is a bad idea. I said you need to consider transitional housing, I then asked if the the transition house he was in before would be able to take him. 

This ultimately lead to him saying that he can't allow himself to be abused and he was suicidal. When I asked if that transition house abused him. He blew up and screamed that Mom and my Dad abused him, this was the first time since I got back in contact with that he has even raised his voice to me. I ended up shouting back about how he can't live in the past, and he hung up. Then we had a long text conversation about how I felt I was trying to control him and how he wanted to move to another area that would be about a 3 hour bus ride away. He has a mental health court thing to deal with where he is, he has a support network there, and has been in his area for 18 months. He also told me that he wanted to leave because of the crime and the climate, the crime rate is lower where he is than the other area. I implored he look at the facts of the situation and explained why he is better off where  he is for the time being. He wanted me to support him by getting him the bus ticket to the new area before his disability comes in. He said he would get the mental health court case transferred to the new area then leave. I asked would you rather live in transitional housing for a while where you are or be homeless in new area. My brother told me that he will not be controlled be his 'baby brother.' I said if housing is not your main priority then I can not support you, I love you, stay safe, and keep me in the loop please. His reply said that he won't be abused and that he will block me. He has the motel room until Saturday.          

We had this last conversation last night, he blocked me sitting in the motel room I paid for. I wanted to think he would try to do the right thing, I don't know if I should have known better. I don't know if I intervened too much. Is he just being delusional and entitled? Should have I handled these situations differently?  

&amp;#x200B;

As a drastic measure for his safety I have been told if I have the ROI for the mental health court case manager I can inform him of what has happened and ask him not transfer his case even if it is possible. Also, this may be too far but if I take the previous step I could also get him declared incapacitated and become the payee, is that perhaps the best course of action for the situation. Because to my way of thinking he has become a danger to himself.

So far I’ve had small portions of fish and just managed to bring myself to eat very few sweets with animal products in.

Part of me just doesn’t even see it as food and I really would like to I just can’t get over the initial idea of putting meat into my mouth that once was alive. If there’s anyone out there who thinks they can help it would be really appreciated, it is partially down to ethical reasons of killing a living being and I’d like to get over my repulsion but am struggling, thank you.

459,"My family has owned a cat for almost 7 years and ever since we got her, she’s been moderately low maintenance. Within the past year though, she’s started pooping on our two sofas, which are both really nice leather, at night. The damage isn’t permanent after applying some cleaning products and getting rid of the scent, but the pooping trend seems to be. My family also worries that the consistency of the trend might start to affect the sofas in some way. My father, the person who was against getting a pet from the beginning, becomes extremely upset whenever this happens, as do I and my mother. My father also is a strong advocate for getting rid of our cat and giving her to another owner. Although my mom really likes our cat from time to time, she’s the one who ends up cleaning most of the poop, leading to her also wanting to get rid of the cat. My sister, the person who wanted to own a cat from the very beginning, does not want us to get rid of the cat at all. The problem is, she’s currently at college far from home, so she’s rarely able to help us out. I personally don’t want to get rid of her, but it feels like the only decision that would benefit my family in the short and long term.

469,"Okay, I know the title is confusing..but hang on a bit, okay?

So first of all, I'll clarify a few details I think are important:

1)I'm a *minor*
2)This has been happening since I was 8, so..6-7 years of my dad cheating and 3-4 months of him being a complete and total asshole.(not saying he's that better than).
3)Mobile, English's not my first language.

And now to clarify the title, and then we can get onto the actual story I guess?

*How do I ""make""* = I don't mean like, force him to..just, how do I kinda like, give him a push in the right direction...
*..my father to sell the apartment, since he lies about selling it* = He has it up for sale and more than 25-30 people came to see it, a lot showed a ton of interest but I heard my dad twice say ""Sorry, we can't sell it right now to you.."" To some interested people.. And he always makes changes to what he's gonna leave and how much the bills cost, making it seem like the bills cost too much and he practically kinda says he isn't leaving anything the buyer wants, even if he stated before what we're taking we leave..he always makes changes to get buyers to not wanna buy our apartment.
*""trapping both me and my mother to live with him, a cheating, ex-abusive dad""* = He doesn't even want to give MY ROOM back. He slept in there when I was little and wanted to sleep with my mum, (didn't wanna sleep with my mom)..and when I ask him to let me sleep in my darn room HE SAYS HE'LL ""THINK"" ABOUT IT.

Damn, I'm going off topic. 
But he basically holds onto me and my mom to live with him, and my mom making him food/laundry etc. 
And by cheating and *ex* abusive I mean..he cheats on my mom and for some months he was really abusive to the both of us.. Slammed my notebook in my head because I didn't *KNOW* a math problem, gave me a slap so hard THAT I WAS SEEING BLURRY, (we got in a fight and he dragged me BY MY HAIR at a point saying that he' ll kill me)..mf spanking my mom with A METAL-ISH WIRE because..and I swear, this isn't fake..BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE RIGHT CUP.

ARE
YOU
KIDDING
ME
RIGHT
NOW
?!

He eventually stopped, but instead of that...he didn't come home for NIGHTS AND DAYS home, and when he did he always IGNORED me.

Now in 2019 he still doesn't care at all, comes home late, he called my mom WHILE in his ""girlfriend's"" House to make her hear him playing with his girlfriend's 2 kids...and guess what, my mom was in the shower..AND I PICKED UP...I could write a novel about the bad things he's done..but, for now..

What should I tell him to maybe, try, JUST TRY, to push him into *actually* wanting to sell the house?

I'm posting on here since my mom has her own little shoppy-ing thing..it basically got taken down for some time and now she has to pay a lot of money which we don't have to be able to work again, it's complicated.. And she was crying, everything..my dad, her shop, all this stuff are breaking her down. I thought..this could maybe a place where someone could kinda tell me what to do to atleast make things a bit better for us 2.

(Also, I post on this sub reddit a lot.. And I delete my post a lot of times, so you saw me on another post but can't find it..it's gone buddy, you can ask me 'bout  I guess?)

TL;DR= My dad doesn't wanna sell the apartment and move..and he lies about it. What should I say to maybe try to push him into a direction where he *actually* wants to move?",19Apr2019,1
470,"For context: I am F18 living in England, and this happened around 2 years ago. My parents are also religious (my dad is a very traditional asshole, but my mum is very liberal and normal compared to him).

This girl, Snake, once messaged me asking if I was interested in her bf, Pig, so I told her no, but she kept insisting that I was, so I told her I was interested in some other guy, Gorilla, to get her to stop. To be honest, Gorilla was actually pretty good-looking and I had a conversation with him previously before she messaged me. The reason she had suspicion was because I had spoken to Pig before they dated and had even hung out with him once, but I wasn’t alone with him as my friend, Ann, was with us. After I told her that I liked Gorilla, she got really happy and told me that he and P are actually best friends. She said things like she would try to get me and him together, I got a little excited and thought maybe something could happen between me and him. Anyways, me and Snake became friends. 

During our friendship, she would tell me about her jealousy issues and I realised that she was actually jealous of almost every single girl Pig spoke to (besides me and her best friend, Hyena). She told me private things about her relationship with him, such as him saying that he still has feelings for other girls and saving somewhat suggestive pictures of them on his phone (sorry, I don’t want to say slutty). She even told me once that she was actually using Pig to get over her ex. She told me a lot of other much more sensitive things as well, which I felt terrible for her and tried to help her, but she wouldn’t really take any of my advice. 

I myself needed (and still do) emotional support. At the time, I was also really starting to really like Gorilla and all I could do was think about him. I don’t really understand why now, but I became obsessed with him for some reason and he wasn’t even that great. Me and him had no chemistry. Anyways, he started talking to this other girl a lot and whenever I saw them together I would get really emotional inside. He told me that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone and he was quiet an immature guy as well, but I was just afraid that there was something going on between the two, because they used to get on so well. 

Snake and me decided to go out and get a drink together, I wanted it because I was feeling down and she claimed she wanted it for the same reason. So, we went and sat in a park, but unfortunately, I ended up drinking too much and everything went blank. All I can recall by memory is that she was nowhere as drunk as me and even walked back home by herself, she just called Pig and Gorilla to help me. They didn’t really know what to do and just called the police and left me at a station when they and my parents arrived. 

The next day I woke up in my bed confused with the blurry memories, I was shaking and my eyes were very red. I was scared that my “dad” would kill me so I tried to drown myself in the bathtub, but I didn’t. I later tried to contact Snake to see if she was alright, I lost my phone so I had to do it over the laptop. When she finally messaged me, she was very angry at me and told me it was my fault that she apparently got abused by a stranger, because she was so drunk while going home that she knocked on the wrong door. I felt even worse after that and tried to apologise to her but she kept saying it was all my fault and that I should stay away from Gorilla and Pig. I tried to call Pig, who spoke to me a lot better and he said that since he knew that I don’t need any help, he was more worried about Snake. I told him about what she messaged me (because he asked) and he said that he didn’t trust my words because I didn’t really care about her. By the way, since I was so traumatised by the entire event in general, my voice was shaking. I started crying and asked him if he meant that it was all my fault to which he said no. He even suggested for me to come to school on Monday. 

I came in and Gorilla was sitting next to me in class, he noticed my shaking and not laughing at any jokes. I tried to contact him as well over the weekend, but he just said he’ll speak to me when he sees me and that he wasn’t angry at me. Anyways, after class he privately told me about what happened while I was drunk (he hid a lot of things from me, but he told me the overall event) and he even ran after me to comfort me while I was travelling to the other building for my next lesson. I started thinking that maybe he did like me, since he was the only one out of the 3 who actually cared about how I felt. 

When I arrived to the other building, I saw Snake acting strangely normal with everyone around and talking like nothing was wrong. Pig was also with her. I saw Hyena walk past me and she kept giving me a really evil look, as if I was the one who made sure that Snake got “abused”. At lunch, l told Ann some of these things she told me that she thinks Snake is bullshitting and that she just wants attention, she said that she has always had a bad feeling about Snake and didn’t like her from the start. By the way, I was told by Pig that Gorilla also didn’t believe Snake and thought she was a complete shit talker as well. 

Anyways, some days later I confessed to Gorilla that I liked him over text and he told me to speak to him at school the next day. I was scared but I wanted to see him. The next morning at break I saw him showing my messages to one of his other guy friends and laughing. So, l got hurt and didn't want speak to him. He kept asking me to meet him in the library but I didn't go. I told him a little later that I was angry about what he did, but he just blamed it on Later on we called (he was on his way to the gym with his friends, while I was at home in my room) and he started shouting at me. I don't really remember how responded to him, but all I remember is that he started mocking my texts back to me and his 2 friends were in the background laughing, so I just started crying (to be honest I am starting to cry right now that I think about it). He then (apparently) went a little away from his friends and apologised to me and said, ""me and you will never ever be a thing."" I remember I cried until I eventually fell asleep that day. 

The next day one of his friends was smiling at me strangely and making me feel really uncomfortable, and even though my crush at the time apologised to me, he would make rude jokes about me to the guy sitting next to him. It really broke me and I wanted to commit suicide, he knew I became suicidal as well and only laughed at my depression. I saw no reason to live anymore, all I could ever think of was him humiliating me, but for some reason I still wanted to be with him. 

Anyways, I recently finally got over him and have realised that he and his friend are complete assholes. However I still have flashbacks of the time and it makes me feel really upset.",19Apr2019,0

I’ve only had one girlfriend in my life and that was freshman year of high school and now I’m 20. I feel like this girl is way out of my league but we talk all the time at work and i feel like there is at least some connection between us. My whole life I’ve been super insecure and struggled talking to girls much less date them.

But I like this girl a lot and don’t want to miss another chance at happiness. But for some reason I can’t muster up the courage to ask her out.

472,After sitting on the idea of community college for a while I have made the decision to attend a community college in my state (California) and transfer to a university after two years. One of my bests friends is also going to the same college and transferring and we want to share an apartment with each other. We know each other almost too well and I think I couldn’t have a better roommate. The reason I am posting here is because I am wondering how I can keep myself disciplined and engaged in social activities. I know that there is a lack of a social setting at a community college but I want to make the best of it.

473,"So me (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been going out for about half a year now. When we started dating, she told me that she had multiple personalities and had some sort of personality disorder that she didn't know yet. Recently she got diagnosed with the Borderline Personality Disorder. Since I don't fully understand what this entails and how to describe it to you, I'll just leave a [link right here](personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20370237).

The main challenge we are facing right now is that she's afraid of abandonment which makes her reluctant to commit to our relationship but at the same time she really cares about me and wants to stay with me. What doesn't help is that she's been through some pretty hard relationships in the past that she has still not fully recovered from.

I don't really know how to handle all of this and who to seek help from which is why I am posting this here. I was wondering if any of you faced such challenges in your lives whether it was with a family member, a friend or a partner and if you had any tips on what I could do to help her go through this.

Lately my boyfriend has been distant. I did not think a lot about it until I noticed he was still on his Facebook posting with friends or talking in posts with them while I waited for him to reply. He also posted on Snapchat. He’s been distant in general and told it up to be just because of school and work. I haven’t seen him a long time because he doesn’t seem to have time to hang out with me or even call me anymore. He’s been very happy with life, everything is going well with his work and his relationship with his dad and friends, but he becomes more distant with me. I came to a conclusion that he probably wants to get out of the relationship but can’t. There has been moments when he has talked about other girls in the past and it wouldn’t be a surprised if he has found interest in someone else. The last incident was a few months ago when we were doing great. I feel neglected and unwanted and I’m unsure if I can do this anymore. Is it even normal for this to happen? It’s my first serious relationship. 

I’ve cried about it all day. All of how much love I’ve given to him and the amount of effort I put into the relationship. I gave him every part of me and tried to mend his bad days. I’ve forgiven him for things I shouldn’t have. And that’s my fault for being a moron. I don’t want to break up with him but it feels like he might feel stuck and I should end it. Idk how not to feel so hurt. Should I break up with him and if I should, how do I get the courage to do it?

478,"I went through a bad depression phase in from 18 to 19 because I used to get bullied at school and had many problems at home to.
My dad is a very successful man financially and she built himself a large business from scratch after the fall of communism.
He moved from a poor countryside as teenager to a 300k people town and became one of the richest people in here.
My country is still pretty undeveloped and full of backwards communisitc mindsets.
My relationship with him is pretty bad because he portrays himself as an alpha male,while I am a “pussy boy”.
He always called me less than a boy because I wasn’t the guy always doing well with girls,always introverted because of a terrible self esteem and being skinny didn’t help.
I think he wanted me to become an alpha male,player,popular,take over his businesses,go to a great foreign college,speaking tons of foreign languages and having a bodybuilder phisique.
But I turned out to be skinny(I try to workout and build muscles,but i really hate public gyms),failed almost all my exams multiple times,have just two friends,never had a grilfriend(I am 22 years old),
I always feel that i am the biggest loser in this town that i started to hate.
The girl that I like will never like a loser like me and that hurts me.
At one point  I got into a terrible depression after being bullied by both my father and collegs for almost my whole life.
My father used to beat me for no reason  until I couldn’t get up.
He even broke my head once.
He told me things like:”You’re nothing like me”, “Where whould I have been if i behaved like you”, “You behave like a girl”, “You should have been born a girl”.
I started to develop severe anxiety when I saw him,I still do toaday.
I got into therapy paid by him for 3 years and I still didn’t solve all my problems completely.
I got into therapy with severe anxiety,depression,suicidal,anorexic and with thoughts that i was transgender. 
I started to believe I was transgender after seeing that my father and other people don’t see me as a real men because I wasn’t an alpha player with 100% confidence.
Everyone thought i was a freak because of my terrible depression and social anxiety.
I heard about trans people and studied the subject until I started to become certain that I was transgender.
My family started to notice that I started to not eat for a whole week and  was always crying so i told them what i believe.
They were horrified when I told them and my father got very emotional and started to cry every night about it.
He even contemplated suicide about it,which I am terribly sorry that he went through it.
My mother was angry because she thought I spoke nonsense and that I hurt my father with my stupid thoughts.
What makes me more angry is that my family members thought more about what people will think about them than my situation.
We live in a very religious undeveloped country in Eastern Europe were people are totally against LGBT rights and many people would either make fun of you or totally ignore you.
I talked to him after a couple years of therapy and he wasn’t sorry about everything he did and say.
He thought the beatings were because I deserved them(no reason given)and the ridicule was to motivate me.
In the ended I concluded I wasn’t transgender and it was just my depression and poor self image and I regret saying i wanted to change my  gender and become a girl. 
I spend most of my time alone and he is still very upset about this because I still live with him.
My tendency is to run from social situations and  cry afterwars beceause I couldn’t do it.
I am afraid that my efforts in school won’t matther because of my past,that I will never have a circle friends,no girlfriend,no job,no driver license.
I always feel that I am wasting my time doing anything and achieving stuff because in the end everyone will run away from me after they hear my dark secret.
I got a victim mentality becasue of things that my father did to me.
My wish is to stop resenting him and to start creating a great life for myself. 
I don’t think that aquintances, relatives, friends or people in college will ever talk to me after finding about me saying that i thought i was transgender and contemplated about gender reassignment.
People in this city are not open minded and I am afraid they will ridicule me till I give up. 
I am terrified of complete loneliness forever.
Many people would never associate with if they heard about my episode and many doors wold be closed for me.
I am always paranoid about people that I meet.
I ask myself questions like:What if they know somebody that knows this secret about?
Why should I try to know them if they will leave me once they hear this secret.
Everyone will think less about me.
I even regret telling this to my therapist because I feel terrible fear when I meet her in public. 
My lists of concerns is:having a conflict or accident with someone that knows me and that person destroys my life by telling everybody my secret or being called transgender in public by soemone.
I am even afraid  to go into the neighbourhood where my therapist lives and I even made a terrible mistake to go to therapy in place that I regulary go to(same block as the one she works in).
I know she is legally required to not share anything but I am still afraid of her
Her son goes to college in the same city I go to and I am afraid that if i make more friends I might bump into him one day.
Networking  is very important but I am afraid to do it because of my constant paranoia to be called transgender.
I want to become a well known businessman with lots of friends and girlfriend but my fear is kepping me low because i feel the need to hide.
Sometimes I think to leave my city and country and to start all over without ever talking to my family or former friends but I think my fears of bumping into someone who knows  my secret  will not get away.
I fear that if I ever have kids this will go on them to and people will ridicule them because dad wanted once to become a transgender. 
Becoming a social recluse is a terrible fear of mine and I don’t want my life to destroyed because of my fathers actions.",19Apr2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I am very lonely, I have no real friends, and I really just want people to hang out with. This makes me very sad because I love just being with people and talking and having fun, but I don't really have anyone to be with. I have no close family members, yes my mom loves me, and I have 2 aunts who I maybe a little close with - one of which lives on the other side of the planet - but I am not really attached to any family members.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing though, is that the only ""friends"" I have is when people ""have to be with me"". These people like me, I like them, but they all have their own friend groups. They might hang out on discord or something when I ask them (only when I ask them), but going to parties and that kind of stuff are all activities they do with their own friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

This is most notable at school, where I have a few people I hang out with, who are almost never available because they have other friends.

I do have hobbies, I play football whit the same ""friends"" who I like and we just have fun together, but usually after a match they go and have lunch or something in our clubs canteen and I am not invited. If I do go with them they don't seem to mind, but never talk to me. I play the drums in an Orchestra, but all the people that play there are boring, I'm only in it because I like to make music.

485,"TLDR: I asked the property manager if I could have a dog. He said yes. Owners find out because he disnt ask, and they dont want the dog. I can't sue them because they're family and frankly I dont think it's their fault. Would it be fair to ask the property manager to pay a part of the money I invested into the dog? 

I live in a house with 3 other people. They are all cousins of my SO, and we rent the place out for university from their grandfather, that lives in their home country. One of the cousins is in charge of collecting the rent and laying the Bill's, and is therefore the property manager. Over the course of 4 months. I asked 4 times (one of them documented) if it would be alright if I got a dog. He said yes all four times. I assumed he would've cleared it by the property owners, but I guess he didn't, and he brought it to my attention (in a very polite way, it is obvious he feels bad about it) that the family did not want the dog here. He didnt tell me I need to get rid of it, so I have just kept him in my room for awhile thinking of what to do.  It has come to a head though, and the owners are visiting soon, and the manager has made it very apparent the dog can't be here. I am well aware I could file a lawsuit if they tried to kick me out over the dog (I am training him as a service dog), and i am well aware I'd win. However, they are family to me, and I am not willing to sue them. I want to be respectful as it is not their fault their kid or grandkid or whatever did not do their due diligence. 

In my mind the best option is this: contact the old owners, as tough as it is, and explain to them the situation, offer him back, and if they don't want him, rehome him. It is hard, but it's the right thing to do. However, that still leaves me out of about $700 I've put into him in the first month of ownership (training, toys, startup costs etc.). Would it be fair of me to ask him to pay at least a part of this, considering the fault is his? It's hard enough emotionally, and it was quite a bit of money for me.",19Apr2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a freshman in college, a few states away from home. Four months ago, my dad and I made plans for him to drive down to my school to help me move things out of my dorm room and into a storage unit, and take the rest of my belongings home for the summer. When we made these plans, we also agreed that my best friend would ride with him, because she really wanted to visit, but can't afford to fly.

For months, my dad watched as she and I made all of these plans and got excited about her visiting. He even helped us figure out some things to do. We talked about it three weeks ago, when he came to visit for spring break, and everything was fine.

Today, he told me that he never actually planned on her riding down with him. He said that he was joking about it the whole time, and was never serious about her going. So I just had to text my best friend in the world and tell her that unless she can scrape together the money to fly, she can't come visit.

I don't understand why he would sit by and watch us get all excited for this and plan things out if he knew that it was never going to happen. Or why he didn't just say no in the first place. It just really hurts a lot that he would do this. He didn't just hurt me, he hurt her too, and that makes it so much worse.

Whenever I bring up the topic they get very defensive.   I'm not sure just love me and are scared that if I learn more about my culture or identify with it that I  would try find my birth mother or if they are just straight up ashamed.

494,"Hi everyone,

I never thought about sharing my feelings and worries in reddit, but here I am. I will omit most of the detail to let it short. The whole story begins 3 years and a half ago when I arrived in Quebec with my family, at the time I was 18 years old and I didn't have too much certainty about what I wanted to do. I loved sciences since a child so I was sure that I wanted to study something related to the field. In my country, I did very well in high school and I fell in love with math and physics in the process. I spent the first 2 years of learning French and working. During that time I finally decided that I wanted to study physics. You may say that it's a hard career that only geniuses go into, but I didn't care. I knew it could be hard as hell but I was willing to pay the price. So I started a science DEC at cegep. The first semester I did well enough to pass all my courses, but my grades weren't too good so I ended it with an r-score of 28, so  I decided to quit my job with the hope to make it better the next semester. I'm 22 and currently I'm finishing my 2nd semester with low grades and a high possibility of losing 2 courses mainly because of a bunch of bad decisions and an overwhelming amount of work (essays and analysis redactions in french drain a lot of time given is not my native language), one of them being a physics course. for the next semester, I'm planning to low the workload ( only 5 courses) but now I'm really afraid because failing 2 courses will just screw my R-score. I'm feeling so depressed and I'm afraid of not being accepted at university. Do I have any hope of getting into my dream career?  can I recover from this in the remaining time at cegep and raise my R-score?",19Apr2019,1
495,"I am currently a junior in college majoring in professional journalism. 

As I continue through my classes, it's becoming clearer and clearer to me that I don't want to work in news. It's too fast-paced and stressful for me. Also, everyone takes themselves too seriously and the whole school feels cliquey. 

I started college in the graphic design department and I left after the first semester because I wanted to explore other majors. 

After dabbling in sociology and child psychology, I landed in journalism. My thought process was that I love learning and storytelling, and I thought the major was broad enough that I'd be able to do a lot of things after graduation. But I don't feel that way anymore. 

I have one year left, so maybe things will become clearer in that time, but for now, I feel completely lost. Does anyone have any advice about what I should do?

My interests include:
- visual art (painting and drawing)
- comedy (stand up, tv shows)
- cooking
- storytelling
- working with children
- editing (writing, video, audio)

I fantasize about working for a show like Last Week Tonight or shows on comedy central, but I don't even know what this would look like.

497,"crosspost from r/anxiety and r/anxietyhelp. 

i [18 F] have 2 jobs, one at gamestop and another at a bubble tea shop. ive had both of these jobs for about a month and a half now, but i feel a bit more comfortable at gamestop because its a lot slower and my coworkers are nicer. for the past 3 weeks ive been having anxiety and/or panic attacks almost every single day and it’s exhausting. (i cant tell the difference between a bad anxiety attack or a panic attack.)

the other day i had one of my worst anxiety attacks while i was at my job at the drink store. i was in the bathroom for 30 minutes because i started freaking out during a rush and my coworker had to come get me out of the bathroom and lead me outside while i was in tears trying to tell her what was going on.

i have anxiety attacks at this particular job every time i’ve gone in for the past 2 weeks. i feel absolutely miserable. my coworkers are nice, but the managers are not too understanding (while the owner is very nice!). i feel bad about quitting but i’m getting so much anxiety over this job that i’m freaking out about my next shift already and it isn’t until sunday morning.

Ive had experience in fast food before for about a year and i did fine (i worked at a smoothie shop in the summer and i live in california, so it was crazy every single day) but my anxiety has been dialed up to 10. ive seen my doctor about this and she gave me prozac, and i know for some people it gets worse before it gets better, but i kind of hate this job and it just makes me feel even worse. i cant focus on anything anymore because my life is so consumed by my anxiety.

i dont want to quit on the spot but i dont think i can make it 2 weeks. every time i go in im anxious for the entire shift and have waves of anxiety. i feel like i’m drowning and i dont know what to do anymore. thank you for reading this and if you have any advice please leave some for me as i feel like i’m at my wits end",19Apr2019,1
498,"Okay. Met him a couple of months ago. We work together. Got really close quite quickly, over the course of about 8 months. He's very understanding. I tell him everything. I trust him. I've told him about all the skeletons in my closet. We have similar aspirations and goals. Professionally, he inspires me. His dedication to work is outstanding. He's also good looking and makes me laugh every damn day. We ending kissing one time but decided against doing anything like that again because well, we work together and we both weren't looking for a relationship at that time. We laughed about the incident and pushed it away but recently, we've started flirting again and the sexual tension is back up. I'm generally very selective about the people I open up to, but with him everything is just easy. I love how we shift from talking about politics or philosophy to memes. I can be myself with him. He's constantly teasing me. So for days, I feel everything is great.

Then there are days he's always talking about this other friend of his he wants to marry. The one he's in love with but she doesn't reciprocate that love. He tells me there are certain things he hasn't told me truth about.. Not sure if this is about his past or present.. won't tell me exactly what. Makes me question how well I do know him. He tells me wouldn't date anyone right now.. because his work comes first at the moment (which I understand I think) He also asks me why we shouldn't just casually hookup (which i don't want to do.. But since i like him and my hormones are a mess, can be easily convinced). He knows he's quite smart so that's gone to his head a little and he's a little cocky sometimes. He knows girls fall for him constantly despite his horrible attitude so continues to be cocky.

To be honest, he does most of the talking. I'm not a very talkative person. I just chip in a story or comment from time to time. Just how I'm wired, can't help it. Maybe, I just like listening to him and his never ending stories? Does he like me or is he just stringing me along for the free rides? ( He travels with me to work everyday. That is when we've gotten to know each-other.) We're both moving soon so we know we might never see each-other again after a few months.

So why does it suck? Because i hate his rude, obnoxious attitude. I hate how he manipulates people to do things for him. I hate how he thinks the world revolves around him. I hate how he still has somehow made me like really him. He helps when i really need him to. He's kind to me (apart from the teasing of course). I spend ungodly amounts of time thinking about him and i can't focus on work. I'm too distracted.",19Apr2019,0
499,"So I'm finishing up a week long vacation with my boyfriend that happens to be a small family reunion with his mom and her 2 remaining siblings, along with their partners (and one mid-30s cousin). Everyone else is 55+. My boyfriend's uncle married a woman a few years ago who is very Type A, headstrong, outspoken and frankly A LOT. Well earlier in the week she took me to an occult shop and told me she's been reading tarot for the last 40 years. She's only done it on a personal level and never for financial gain. I'm a slightly spiritual person and like to learn more about these things so when she asked if I wanted a reading I agreed.

Lately I've been struggling with decision making regarding my career path, schooling, all of that. I'm 26, I'm half way to getting a bachelor degree and I work at a restaurant. I struggle with a lot of mental health issues. I'm just living day by day.

I was hoping to get a reading with direction towards that, but instead she disected every aspect of my relationship that she observed, told my my dad would die in the next year or two and that I needed to help my mom write a living will for him. While my dad does have a lot of health issues, this is as still a very heavy and uncomfortable thing to talk about. My dad doesn't have any assets or money, she said my parents fight like crazy and they don't, at least not what I would consider fighting. Despite that she still said a lot of things about my family that seemed eerily true, my aunt having a son, daughter and a sick husband as well who is going to die soon too. It was all A LOT to take in. She continued to pick at my boyfriend's personality and his parents being bad people. It was all very upsetting because to her they were bad parents because they never took him to Disney World. The whole experience left me feeling very uncomfortable. She asked if my boyfriend was gay because he doesn't have a high sex drive or if I gained a lot of weight that could cause him to lose interest. I've always been fat and my boyfriend has always had a low libido. She kept asking for more and more issues I have with our relationship but I couldn't come up with any. He and I talk about everything and if there was an issue we would have discussed it. She finally picked at the fact that he makes good money and probably feels like he's always supporting me while I can't financially support him in return. This is an insecurity of mine but the only thing he pays for is our rent, which he would pay if I lived with him or not. I don't make a lot of money but I buy my own meals and pitch in with bills as much as I can. 

So while I the vacation is nearly over today and I won't have to see her again for however long I still feel very lost and I can't shake all of the things she said. Of course I'm thinking ""maybe she's right"" but at the same time it was just a bad experience and I want to take it with a grain of salt. I'm a sensitive person so all of these weird comments are really bothering me. How do I deal with it? Is there really any truth in these things?",19Apr2019,0
500,"So im posting this in hopes someone can give me a list of the right stuff to buy, and the right stuff to do for my bodyweight. 

Im 19, almost 20 and am in the Marines, yet I only weigh about 140 pounds, on a good day. I havent really gained any noticeable weight or muscle from being a marine for almost 2 years now.
 P.S. im not a POG, im a grunt so its pretty physically demanding.

Anyways, after noticing that, ive decided to just start going to the gym, which I shouldve done way earlier but whatever. Im not struggling in my job or anything I just want to look bigger and pack on more weight. 

Body characteristics:
Roughly 140 pounds
5'10""
Obviously im pretty skinny
Also I dont gain weight from eating, despite eating anything and everything.

I guess, im just looking for a list of what proteins, or mass gainers to buy. Also any pre workout you recommend. Ive been pretty commited to the gym for almost 3 weeks now and I just want to bring in the proteins and stuff. 

Also does anyone here use SARMS? A lot of guys here use them, but im still skeptical. 

P.S.S pls dont recommend any diet plans, because im on deployment for the next 6 months in the middle east and I won't be able to follow it. Plus they really only feed us chicken and rice mainly.

I would also appreciate any workout plans that you guys may have that have worked for skinny guys like me.

502,"Back in 2017, a coworker hooked me up with her friend, a girl from her sorority from college. I’ll call the woman, Rose.

Rose and I texted for a while before finally meeting one another and we began going out nearly every day for close to a month. It was fun and I was beginning to like her.

Our dates were more like outings as friends. We never officially called them dates at the time. We never kissed, held hands, etc. We did hug. On the second date, she asked if I wanted to go back to her apartment because her friends weren’t there. I didn’t fully process what she was saying and suggested we keep going on our date to other places to hang out together. I’m not sure if going back to her place was a definite hook up or not. I made it kind of obvious that these were dates like taking her to romantic, low lighting restaurants, but still never made anything official.

I worked up the courage one night when dropping her off to tell her that I liked her and asked if she felt the same. She didn’t say that night whether she felt the same or not and said she’d get back to me.

I awoke the next morning to a big text message from her about her not really feeling the same way and her also saying she just got out of a relationship with a guy who cheated on her so I guess she was still hurt over that. I didn’t really know what to say but I told her it was fine and I understood but we slowly faded away after that. Just kind of stopped talking.

I accidentally called her months later but hung up before it continued when I realized I called the wrong person. She never called me back or anything.

Then this morning, she texts me out of the blue, asks if I remember her, someone I went on a few “dates” with a few years ago. She asks if I’d like to meet up for dinner next week and have dinner.

I have no idea whether I do or not. Based on what I said above, what do you think I should do?

I’ve always been someone who doesn’t redate old girlfriends, but we didn’t really do anything or have a bad falling out or anything.

I moved since then but we were already pretty far from each other as it was. I might actually be closer to her where I am now than before.

But anyway, just curious what you guys as internet strangers think based on what I wrote. Thank you.",19Apr2019,1
503,"First off, I am going to be frank and open with the status of my life, and who I am. 


I am a straight, white male currently in High School. My GPA is averaging around 3.67. I struggle in math, and some science, however I usually pull off a B/B- by the end of the term. 

As for physical stuff, I’m 5’10”, 133 lbs., and 
of average physical ability, although I probably could do with some slight exercise and health conscious eating so I don’t deteriorate. 

The main concerns about wanting to become a police officer are pay, college, and family. 

•Pay: I want to be able to support me, my (hopefully) future wife, and 2-4 future kids. I also would like to live a fairly comfortable lifestyle. New car every year, and Hawaii vacations every fall? No. But a decent house, and be able to take the kiddos on a fun vacation every year and half or so? Yes.  Keep in mind, please be blunt with me. I’m a high school kid with a pleasant fantasy of how I want my future to be. Don’t be afraid to shatter my dreams if this expectation is unrealisific. I also realize stuff happens, and life will change. 

•College: I am hearing it both ways. “College is unnecessary, and just leaves you with crippling debt and no job experience. Skip college.” I’ve also heard that college degrees are necessary to be successful in life. As a Police Officer, should I consider getting a degree? How will it benefit me? How much school should I got though? Will the debt be managable?

•Family: As stated above, I want to be able to support a good sized family, from 2-4 kids. I understand that officers will have to miss out on events, and work Weekends, nights, holidays, and so forth, but from people who know officers: How bad is it? I’ve heard that Police Officers have some of the highest divorce rates because of their careers. How difficult is it on the family? My main concern is family welfare. 

Is it worth trying to risk to make it work? Or is it better to look at other career paths?",19Apr2019,1
504,"Hello all,
I've was recently thinking about some things that are bothering me in my life, and I realized they all revolve around my general lack of will power / discipline.
I find that I'm the type to wait for motivation to do something. I won't clean my room for weeks, then one day I'll get a random spur of energy and do it all. The same with homework. If it's work I find interesting, I'll work hard, if not (90% of the time) I'll wait until the last possible moment to finish it. I got by just fine in HS like that, but I don't want to live my life that way. 
Here are a few other examples:
I almost always stay up late wasting time then wake up exhausted wishing I had gone to bed earlier.
I often eat dairy even though it makes me sick.
I've never stayed consistent with a workout schedule.
When it comes to drugs/alcohol and food I often struggle not to take things overboard once I get started.

506,"The scoop (abridged): I an engineering undergrad in the US and have been offered a project management internship locally for the summer paying $20/hr with a company. The first caveat is they would like me to start before school gets out for the summer. I cannot, in good conscience, take on a position with finals coming that I cannot do good work in, and commit myself to fully. I believe it would be a disservice to my education and, more importantly, their company since I have never worked while in school.


The second caveat (this is where things get interesting) is that I interviewed for a position with the House of Representatives earlier this week. This internship would be paid and housed in the Capitol proper. I am most interested in this opportunity and I feel as though I have a fair/good chance at being chosen for it. I displayed an extensive portfolio related to the position and conducted, I think, a reasonable interview. I was not given a timeline for when they will make their decision for the position. However, looking at the House calendar, their recess concludes next Friday the 26th and I anticipate a response before then.


The finalé: the local company would like for me to respond to their offer by end of day today. Do I contact them and only take the internship if I can start over the summer? If I contact them and am able to start over the summer, do I contact the House and inquire as to my status?! Do I contact the House first and find out my status and work with the company from there?!?


What I am leaning towards as of now is contacting the company and finding out their leniency and progressing from there so as to avoid disturbing the house in light of current political developments.

508,"Long warning. Also on mobile

Sorry for the overdramatic title but i didnt know how else to title it. I’ve posted here before on a throwaway acc so if something sounds familiar, that might be why. Things have gotten worse sinde then though and i could use some advice on how to deal with everything. I’ll try to keep it short 

Me: 20, trans(Ftm), depressed, sociophobic, Childhood trauma i never got proper therapy for, Possible ADHD, Very bad abandonment issues

Back in 2018, i dated this guy i was good friends with for a while. I was head over heels for him. When everything seemed perfect, he broke up with me suddenly. We remained Best friends though, and things were pretty good for a while. This left me very anxious though. Ex is the kind of person to just disappear for a few days and not tell you where he went. Also the kind of person to get angry and then not confront you and instead give you the cold shoulder for an indefinite amount of time. For this reason, I (low self esteem, anxiety) would often ask him if there was something wrong. He would also never tell me if he was feeling bad or anything so as his best friend i still felt a bit left in the dark. Oh btw, he lives far away so this mostly takes place on social media. Anyways, we met up 2 months ago and spent a week together. It was amazing, we had so much fun. After he left, he was crying and telling me how sad he was for like two weeks. He would say things like that i’m his favorite person ever, his soulmate, he couldn’t do without me, and i make him so happy. We immediately made plans to meet again in april. Anyways, ill just say quickly what happens next. 
- He goes back to school and gets more busy/quiet again. My anxiety comes back 
-He doesnt talk to me much but says hes fine, I vent to friends but try to tell myself its fine and its just something im making up and need to get over
-Eventually i send him some photos i took when he was here, and when he doesn’t respond for a while i ask if hes mad. This leads to him telling me that hes been avoiding me because my mental illness and dependency was too much. I understand, but i wish hed told me earlier because i wasnt aware at all. We agree that i will work on it and he will also try to act normally again. 
-(A week or so later): We talk about things to do when i visit him (I wouldve come back today). He seems pretty excited and lists a few things. However he suddenly tells me he has exams coming up and a lot of work so we should cancel the trip. Obviously im sad but he tells me we can meet in summer and for a lot longer as well. And he will try to be available for me more during the holidays to make up for it. Im Pretty happy. 
-2 days or so later. I message him, i wanted to talk about the things that had happened and his opinion on if im being less of a stressful person. I was pretty positive i was doing well. He hates these kinds of talks, and lets just say it keeps getting worse. I tell him i just want things to be normal, he says: I dont think they will be normal again. What you did was too much. (I’m still unsure what exactly it was. ) He doesn’t think we should call ourselves best friends anymore. 
Now, I’m devastated. All this time i was working so hard, and thinking “at least we will meet soon and can bond and talk irl. “. Then that falls away. I think, Okay. At least were still best friends, so it’ll return to normal. Now that is gone too. He says, he needs a break and some distance, but i shouldn’t worry because we can still talk and it wont be much different. And we can still hang out. (Mind you he lives ~15 hrs away. ) I’m confused and feel horrible. I basically just lost my best friend. This person means so much to me, and i still can’t understand how this could happen. We used to be inseparable.. even just two months ago! He said all of these things, and I believed him. He is also very mentally ill, so i don’t blame him for being stressed out. He just never told me about it before and didn’t give me a chance to change. Now, We are still talking occasionally. But he doesnt reply to me often, it feels very dry and i’m almost scared to message him. Hes finding new friends so quickly as well, now he seems infatuated with this person he met a few weeks ago. I feel like i’m being replaced. I want to be his friend, it’s just so hard and i don’t understand what happened. How can someone cry for weeks after leaving my place and then not tell me im doing something wrong, and then tell me we’re not best friends anymore? 
This person is honestly so important to me, i mean, our parents even know each other (even though we live in different countries), we have a bunch of matching things (rings, bracelets, even piercings), we have matching polaroid walls with each others pictures, i have his drawings on my walls, everything. Obviously these are just things but they mean a lot to me, and right now they only remind me of better times. I can hardly stand being in my room. I see him talking to so many people happily and with me it feels forced. 
I know i need to give it time, i would just like some advice on how to cope with this. 

Im also trying to apply to an art school next month, but all of this has left me so emotionally drained that i can get almost no good work out, which stresses me out even more. I’m scared i might fail. I don’t have a therapist yet either and i’m on no medications (I’m looking though). I just feel lost. 
On top of that my brother is suicidal, has frequent violent breakdowns and might need to be hospitalized because we dont know if he might hurt himself. My mum is so stressed as well. The atmosphere here is horrible. I’m scared of going outside alone but i have pretty much no friends. Also a few days ago someone i considred a friend suddenly cut me off, and when i talked to them they accused me of something very serious and insulted me very hurtfully. It was a misunderstanding but they didn’t want to hear it. I don’t know why i deserve to be treated like that? I want to heal but it feels impossible. Help :(

Anyways, i’m happy with any advice on how to deal with this situation. Please be nice and don’t suggest therapy (I’m already looking), focusing on myself (I know, advice for how to do that is appreciated though) or cutting off that friend. Simply because i know i won’t and i don’t want to. It might sound foolish but im stubborn about that. Please be kind. Thank you :(",19Apr2019,2

518,"Hello Reddit!

This is my first post on reddit so I’m not exactly sure how this goes, but I’m at a loss for looking for anonymous help (as many people in my life are not aware of what I’ve been through) about a difficult situation. And if you have different views than me, I would appreciate an adult conversation about the issues at hand, and not an argument.

So... here it goes.

I’m very much in the mindset that love is love, weed should be legal, all lives matter, and that if it’s not my uterus, it’s not my problem.

I had a very hard interaction with my father the other day as he’s not really around for me, but finally showed up to see the ultrasounds of our second child. He said something to the effect of: “how can anyone get rid of that? It’s a life from conception.” (A very brief quote). I remained silent as we moved on with our day and he left shortly after.

It’s been almost a month since he said that, and it’s still eating away at me. As someone that’s been sexually harassed/assaulted and having friends that have been through rapes, I can’t shake how heartbreaking it was to hear that from my dad. Now, as I said, he’s not really involved in my life. Shows up once a month to see his granddaughter to get his quota of “bragging rights” photos for his work that’s always taken priority over my sister and I and he’s a complete Trump-ster where as I am the exact opposite. I work part-time because I want to be with my daughter and the second one on the way (family first for me), and all of our political views are the exact opposite (i.e.: pro-life vs pro-choice).

I guess, heartache aside from him not being around as a Grandfather, how do I approach this conversation without turning into a raging, sobbing mess and hurt an all ready fragile relationship? Or should I just let loose and make him think long and hard about his views since he now has a personal reason to think differently (i.e.: his daughter’s assaults)

Also... I’ve never told my parents about my sexual assaults...

I’m just... I’m trying to figure out how to best approach the situation, coming from where I’ve been without it seeming like I’m attacking.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for offering any advice ❤️

520,"For the past few months I've been scheduling doctors appointments back and forth trying to investigate a cyst that showed up in a CT Scan. The cyst is a little larger than a quarter. Right now they don't know whether it is on my slightly enlarged spleen or whether it is mesenteric. Doctor says my lymph nodes are also slightly enlarged. And I should consult a surgeon about the cyst. 

I've had a 7 day vacation booked for about 4 months now. My SO and I have been very excited. It is a pretty expensive trip at an all inclusive resort. And is also sort of a honeymoon for us. It would be a real shame to cancel.

Just recently, approximately 3 days ago. I started to feel pressure and discomfort in my upper left abdomen exactly where my spleen would be. The feeling is similar to a bad bruise. I am now at a point where I don't know the severity or what the pain could mean regarding my condition and I am now nervous about traveling to the Dominican Republic where I plan on drinking a good amount and eating a ton of raw seafood. Both of which can be very hard on the Spleen. 

I have gotten very bad infections in the recent past which is also representative of an injured Spleen, so now I am worried about being out of the country and having something happen where I need to be helicoptered back to the United States for an emergency surgery.

What opinions do you have regarding a final decision to go or stay?

Am I overanalyzing, and can this wait until I return?

Are spleen issues and abdominal pain minor more often than not?

What can I do to be cautious while on vacation if I decide to go?

TL;DR - May have an injured spleen, pending potential surgery. Have a week long vacation in 3 days. Can't decide to stay for safety or forget about it temporarily and go to party.",19Apr2019,1
521,"I’m basically at my wits end with this one. Some background: I’ve known the girl for about a year I’ve known my friend for more than three years now. I’m pretty close to him and talk to him about nearly everything that i do. Including my experiences with the girl. The girl knows that i like her but doesn’t like me back (and that’s completely fine as we’re good friends) but the reason this hurts is that I’m the reason that the two of them met. And now a lot of the times when we meet in person all she does is ask me where he is. Which is also ok I guess. He is a good looking guy so has a lot of people vying for his attention. He usually gives them the cold shoulder when he gets bored with them and brags about it. Which is pretty normal too considering his situation. But just yesterday i just happened to glance at his phone and he was talking to her. He tried to hide it but I didn’t ask him about it. When I jokingly did in the past he said it’s just normal stuff but from what i gathered yesterday they have been talking for a while. The girl comes to me whenever she’s depressed or needs something of me and is moody otherwise although helpful and I’m thankful for that. I have no problems if he likes her or something I’m just butthurt that he hid the fact from me or made excuses to hide it. Makes me think can i trust him ?

522,"Hi,  


I have a low-paying retail job that has told me I am required to use my photo and name to advise people on their website. I am not comfortable doing this. My manager says I have to.  


What are my options here other than quitting?",19Apr2019,0
523,"  

This will be a long story because I’m going to try to tell what I think is everyone's side.   
   
 

My parents have 3 children two daughters and a son (I’m the son). My sisters are married and have kids I’m the baby and still single. My parents grew up loving the beach.   
 

When my parents got older and better off they bought a beach house on said beach. My father wanted to buy it without a loan. He had all he needed but about 45k and he wanted my and my two siblings to have a stake in it. He asked us each to invest 15k and he said if he ever sells the place we all will get a equal share of the house. And until that day everyone will get a room in the house to stay in during the summers. We all gave the money.   
 

I was in college at the time and the 15k was most of my savings so he did something that is what complicates this story. He was already planning on getting a mortgage but only for the remodeling he planned to do on the house. For some reason he thought this was the best way to buy the house outright in cash then get a mortgage for the repairs. He gave back my money when he got the new mortgage with the understanding I wouldn’t get anything if they sold the house. I could use it during the summers but I didn’t I lived 10 hours drive away (in college) and would be there maybe a few weeks a year let alone during the summer.   
 

Years go by with my sisters having their money invested in the house and them spending most of the summer almost living at the beach house. After the remodel the house ended up with 6 rooms. Each sister got 2 rooms and my parents have a room and I have a room but mostly it’s the guest room because I’m never there. My parents treated the place like it was everyone’s in more ways then you might expect. My sisters furnished their own rooms and had to pay some of the utilities but nothing else. I payed nothing during all of this.  
 

My parents are getting older but they should still hopefully have another 20 years on this earth easily. But my parents are at an age and level of wealth where having a will is a very good idea (early 60s and upper middle class). At this point my parent have given back both my sisters 15k investment but they still pay utilities I believe. It has become obvious that my parents will never sell the beach house. They would rather sell the childhood home then the beach house. One of my sisters has started arguing about what will happen to the beach house when they die. She believes I shouldn’t have any part of the inheritance of the beach house since I hadn’t kept my money in the house or payed the utilities as well. I stay out of the arguments but my parents don’t want to “cut anyone out of the will”.   
 

So what do you think about this situation. Should I say I want part of the house? Should I give up any inheritance I may get? Should I give someone 15k? Or should I do what I have been doing and staying out of an argument that hopefully what been needed for at least a decade.   
 

And would I be an ass if when they pass and my parents leave me part of the beach house and take it? Right now I don’t care but I also don’t have any kids right now. And in the future if I’m married with kids, I would want to take them to the family beach house.

His facial hair grows in the perfect places, he is tan with an amazing sense of humor, he has a smile that would kill, his hair is dark like cherry wood, he pleases me in every aspect in bed, his looks don't even compare to Brad Pitt, Thor, or anybody else that you'd consider a perfect specimen to look at, and he is the most loyal person I know besides myself. 
But my depression is getting the best of me. I want him to be his happiest and I felt as if taking a break would give him time to heal. I'm afraid that he will be happier without me and leave forever. I have never loved anyone as much as him. I have never felt this depressed trying to make someone else happy. I'm lonely and sad and scared for the future to come. I never wanted him to leave, but it was the healthiest option for him not to resent me any longer.

I've had a pretty bad day so I'm gonna keep things short and sweet.

for context, I'm married to my wife [27F] and we have two beautiful boys (twins) [6M] and also my daughter [11F] .

For more context when she was three years old she was diagnosed with a special form of autism so she has been visiting an autist school and an autist doctor for the past 8 years (but there was one year that she spent in a YO or something because she was too difficult to manage).

Back to the plot: I was in the middle of a game of ApexL (which I take very seriously now), she came in to show a picture of a cow she'd drawn at autist school (not very good), and I was naturally quite frustrated so I may have shouted, ""get the fuck out of my life you spergwhale"", which may have been an overreaction. Ever since then (about 36 hours) she just won't stop crying, I even offered to take her to KFC drive thru (her favourite restaurant) but she just cried even more.

All the crying is getting really distracting, and I'm not getting any from my wife, which as you can imagine is very difficult for me

540,"This is sort of complicated, but here are some details.  My nephew is staying with us (my parents, my partner and myself) for a week.  This morning, while playing the Wii, he said to me that “only boys play with cars.”.  

On a side note, I’m pro-fun so I’m really fond of the idea that kids should get to play with whichever age appropriate toy they want, regardless of the gender it’s advertised for.  

So I tell my nephew that not only boys can play with cars, but rather anyone can play with them. He responded by telling me “well only girls can play with dolls”.  I told him once again that that wasn’t right but they could be enjoyed by anyone.  I was intrigued by the origin of his train of thought on the matter so I asked him where he learned about this stuff.  He told me it’s in a song his dad plays in the car.  My sister is a peace-loving centrist type person but is also incredibly supportive of progressive social change. I know she wouldn’t be too happy to know that he’s playing these kinds of songs.  My BIL is a Trump supporter, as is my father.

Which brings me to my father.  He often picks up my nephew from his home 45 minutes away so we can babysit.  Recently, I was in the garage when they got home and I heard far right talk radio on full blast in his car.  If it was only Fox News, okay, that’s awful but I could handle it, but it was even worse than that.  Think breitbart style fake news.  

I’m conflicted.  I really, really don’t like the idea of my nephew being intentionally influenced like that.  If it was just happenstance and he heard the song once and I’m overreacting about my dad, then it would be no big deal to me.  Its his formative years and he is naturally just picking up these influences.  Unfortunately, it’s also not really any of my business but I do recall that old saying “it takes a village...”.  

As a villager, should I tell my sister about my conversation with my nephew?  They’re leaving on an anniversary trip tonight, so I should probably wait till she gets back, right?  What about my father?  Mind you, I’m not even allowed to say the word trump in the house because he gets so worked up in defense of him.

We’ve been together for almost a year and we’re both really happy with our relationship. We’re both freelance photographers and we’re currently not studying (and so far we don’t think we will go to college for photography).

547,"So basically I have graduated university last June and I’ve now moved back home. I am about to finish my masters degree from a university local to my home, through my time at this uni i’ve kinda kept myself to myself despite making some friends, I haven’t really made much of an effort with them as I don’t really feel that I get on with them as much as I like as we don’t have many similar interests, it was more of a studying friendship.

My friends at my previous university, had a really good relationship with, and in general I really miss my old university experience as it was some of the best times of my life and a big contrast to my pre uni life, as I was quite shy and anti social and didn’t have what I would consider a close knit friendship group like I did at uni. 

Since I’ve now moved back home I feel quite alone and I don’t have any social life apart from very occasionally meeting up with my original university friends which is challenging as we all live quite a distance from each other and trying to organise things can be difficult, especially as a few of them have girlfriends now which makes it even more difficult in my view. 

So I’m really finding it difficult living at home with my family as like I said I now suddenly have no social life again and find it quite overbearing being surrounded by my family every day .

I wish I had a friendship group in my home area similar to my university group but I have no idea how to do that, as people in my similar position often had strong friendship groups before they left for uni so they were able to come back to them, but i do not relate to that, I’d also be happy to find a girlfriend but i’ve not really had much luck with this due to the lack of social life and I honestly hate all these dating apps like tinder.

551,"This is a long story but I’ll try to shorten it up. I’m looking for advice or help because it’s been the main part of my depression for a while. About 1-2 years ago my mom left the house at 10 at night. I thought it was suspicious and waited for her to return. She said she went out “jogging”. (Note she took her car) when I continued to question her she started yelling at me to “mind my own business”. A few days after that I was getting out of my bathtub and heard my mom trying to talk quietly on the phone. I very clearly overheard her say “no they didn’t suspect a thing”... “we can meet up the street again” ... “I had fun last time” while giggling on the phone. She has a certain tone of voice when she’s trying to be flirty which I easily picked up on. I then stormed into the room and screamed at her becoming ultimately hysterical. I know what I heard. It still makes me upset and I can’t forget it. She then said she was on the phone with... my uncle. “He’s going to move up the street”. (Note she changes the story later saying he’s moving to Idaho and tells my dad “she misheard me on the phone”) I was ready to confront my dad on what I heard and she kept saying I misheard her and that I’m crazy and need to go to thearapy. Yes my mom is saying this to me. I started to believe her and that I possibly was mishearing it. I mainly told myself this so I wouldn’t be depressed at the thought of my mom cheating on my dad. Sort of selfish but it kept me going. Soon, maybe a few months later I received nudes from my mom. Yes. Nudes. And not sure how this happened but it sent repeatedly to me 14 times. That was only one occasion. That excuse was “I was sending my doctor pictures for a mamagram and I’m embarrassed to even talk about this”. Then I get another picture a month or so later. It’s her in lingerie. And that excuse was “I wanted to see if it looked good so I took a picture”. Another side note (my mom never had a good family life and was raised on lying by my grandma, ironically all my life she told me she never wanted me to be influenced by that). Finally a few months ago a man walked out of my house who was not my dad saying “oh sorry I was dropping off a package for your mom”. Of course my mom was home and I accuse her of cheating. Final excuse is “I never answered the door” and I return with “ I saw him walk out” and she said “no you didn’t mind your business you need help”. I now live with my bf. I don’t see my family often because of all this but I know my mom cheats on my dad. I’ve come to terms with it. I don’t want to be the one to say it and I don’t think they’d believe me if I told them (they as in my dad and brother). Today on a family trip my mom screamed at me for not helping her get a Wi-Fi passcode working correctly (she doesn’t understand technology). She said she needs to text my brother and make sure everything at home is good. Which I know she does, but she also turns her phone away whenever she checks her text messages. When I asked her to open her texts she screamed at me and told me very loudly to “mind my fucking business”. When I wouldn’t help her because I don’t want to help a cheater cheat she said “I want to punch her in the fucking face. As soon as we’re home she’s off the phone plan, I hate her”. We’re in a small hotel room. She had no problem saying it to me. At this point she’s the overall cause of my depression. Once this was found out I went through a few other traumatic life experiences that have now affected my school life and personal life. I’ve even wanted to end my life because of this. So I honestly don’t know how to go about this. I mainly wanted to vent but I would love feedback on how to handle this situation. What would you do?",19Apr2019,1

558,"Backstory, I am a 34 year old guy, been in a relationship for almost ten years. I various phases, we've opened up the relationship, first for purely sexual encounters, but more and more moved to a more polyamourous setup. Fast forward to about half a year ago. For me the openness of the relationship has been pretty much only about sexual experimentation, but my girlfriend had 2 other relationships over time. One of them is still going strong, the other is a bit on/off. And I'm truly happy for her. Out of pretty much nowhere, someone messaged me on Fetlife. Or rather, she followed me, because as it turns out, she was too shy to write. Long story short, we started writing and talking and really liked each other. We met, we met a few times more and developed somewhat of a relationship. I say somewhat, because due to the fact that she lives 2 1/2 hours away and I have a crazy schedule, we saw each other way too little.

Now, I am still occasionally looking for casual stuff while this is going on, and I never made a secret out of that, really. Fast forward again to a few weeks ago and I met a girl I hit it off with online. I tell my girlfriend of ten years about it, she's happy for me. I tell my long distance relationship about it and she kinda freaks a bit. Talking about being replaced by someone, who lives actually close to me. I try to calm her down, explain to her that this is really only casual and noone is getting replaced. It seems like she is calming down to it and I make a mental note of talking to her about our relationship and where it may and may not go in the future. Two weeks later, we finally meet again. I planned on talking about the relationship with her, but we have a good time and I don't feel like ruining the already short weekend. So we don't talk.

I proceed to have another two weeks of work and stuff and we barely talk. Two weeks ago I text her that I am free over the whole of the long easter weekend. She doesn't reply. I text her again the next day and she basically says, no thanks, I don't want to come, I don't want to come anymore at all, in fact. She says the thing with that other girl hurt her more than she realized and that she hoped our relationship would evolve much more than it actually did and that we might one day be exclusive.

Now comes the bad part. This breakup by her really pulls the rug away under my feet. I am devastated, try to talk to her in text. This goes extremely poorly because of a few things. For one, I have another crazy work week and am completely unable to concentrate on either talking to her or work. Add to that the little fact that the breakup made me realize how much I actually love her and you get a desaster. We text back and forth, basically what she is saying is that she always felt like it was pretty much only a sex thing or at best a side relationship besides my main one. I try to tell her that that's not true, that I'm sorry I made her feel that way and that I was and am willing to talk about what to do to evolve the relationship.

I fuck this up royally. Because of extremely bad timing and because I am realizing how much I love her while loosing her. It ends up going back and forth over a few days with her one by one blocking one messenger after the other and me going back and forth between hoping to fix things and being angry at her for not answering; and being devasteted because not only am I loosing her, I am also unable to talk to my girlfriend of ten years about it, because basically, she is the very reason for the breakup. And while hating myself for it, I am putting serious thought into the option to leave her which makes it impossible to talk to her.

Now the situation is I am home alone, my girlfriend is gone for the easter weekend with her other relationship and I am sitting here not knowing what to do. Almost all lines of communication have been blocked, for the past four days I haven't heard one sentence from her. Today I finally got another reply from her, telling me that, no, she hasn't blocked this last line of communication, she is just busy.

In regards to advice I am seeking, I'm not quite sure. She has made it very clear that she does not want a poly relationship to continue. On the other hand, her main complaint was that she felt like a second class girlfriend, something we never talked about while the relationship lasted. And now that she broke up, I have told her that I was and am willing to talk about this and that she never was in any way second class to me, not consciously anyways. The other main issue she talked about briefly was a lack of closeness and daily routine, to which I told her that the only reason we were lacking that was the distance and that, again, I was and am willing to talk about it.

I think, what I really want right now, is to somehow reopen some line of communication. Wether this can lead to a repaired relationship, I am not sure. If I am being honest, probably not. I do still hope, but it seems unlikely. But is it really that presumptuous of me to want to talk about the things that went wrong?

I am not sure if my story makes sense, for one, english is a second language and also, I am still in a pretty bad state, emotionally. If you have any questions or need clarifications, ask.",19Apr2019,1

560,"I adopted from a rescue in my city. I knew the cat had a non functioning eye and a dislocated jaw but apparently he needs teeth removed and needs his non functional eye removed also. The person who was fostering the cat didn't bring him to the vet for like 3 years apparently so they say they didn't know this before I adopted him. I e-mailed the rescue asking if they would help pay for these surgeries since they really should have been done beforehand if the cat was brought to the vet like he should have been.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner of the rescue then proceeded to lie to me claiming they would pay if I surrendered the cat then we could discuss if I wanted him back, (With 0 intentions of letting me have him back after which was made clear in the e-mail that followed.) and implied being with me was not in the cat's best interest when they wouldn't even bring him to the vet. 

&amp;#x200B;

They claim they give the animals all the care they need before adopting them out, which is obviously bs. She gave the excuse that the cat is afraid of the vet so they don't bring him. (Not once in 3 yrs what?) If I have a kid and they are afraid of the Dr. I still bring them for a check up, just saying. Then they depend on people getting attached to the pet and not wanting to surrender them to dump all the fees on them... Which is what I am facing now. This would cost me so much money that I was not made aware of at first. The cat comes and sleeps next to me every day now and he is doing so right now and it would kill me to bring him back but they just straight up lied to me. Then tried to trick me, then pretty much insult me. They claim they will get him his surgery if I surrender him. Can I even believe that? They have lied so much already, they could just as well try and dump the cat on someone else. On top of it I want to keep the cat but I don't know if I can realistically afford this now due to all these costs. I am livid right now because of this woman's ridiculous email and feel like writing a furious email in response, though that may not be the bet course of action. I'm not actually sure what to do at this point regarding the email and the cat. :(",19Apr2019,1
561,"So I’ve had this really fucking close friend of mine for I’d say a good couple of years, and she’s in her thirties. She’s had a lot of trauma in her past, and I’m usually the person she talks to about all of it, and she always asks what my thoughts are on her situations and her family. Like... I don’t know what she wants me to say, does she want confirmation on her feelings, does she want advice that she’s not going to follow? It gets really emotionally draining for me dealing with that on a constant basis, but I don’t tell her that because I care about her. But her anxiety from her past has led her into some self-induced freak outs over lots of small things, one of which ended up with us fighting recently. She doesn’t recognize when it’s a real problem, and when it’s just her anxiety, and I’m really tired of seeing her struggle with this, but all she does is work six days a week, and bitch about her life. I want to tell her it’s time to go seek some other help, possibly get counseling, take a yoga class, or at least listen to my advice on how to be more mindful if she doesn’t want to make time for any of that. I just don’t know how to not sound like a dick about it. How would you go about telling your friend they need professional help and that you can’t be their counselor anymore? 

TLDR: my close friend has lots of anxiety and past trauma, and it’s affecting her and her relationships with her friends and herself, but I can’t continue to play counselor or watch her hurt herself anymore with her habits, how do I tell her she needs help without sounding like I’m attacking her or I’m a dick?",19Apr2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I've just begun my second full time job I've ever had, and man uh, full time is kind of rough. I was given the 4pm-1am shift (With one hour optional overtime into 2am), with a chance at maybe having a morning shift with the next shift bid, coming up in about a month.  


It isn't the worst shift in the world, but it's doing all sorts of stuff to my body that I need help with. I'm already kinda tired when I get to work (I try to sleep until at least 1pm or 12pm on work days), and after lunch my shoulders/back start to tighten up in that kind of 'you are very tired, go sleep soon' kind of way.  


I'm usually dead tired by the time 12am rolls around, and I'm really fighting to get to 1am.. 2am is almost out of the question but I'm trying to ease into overtime since I know mandatory overtime starts soon.

I’m 23 years old and a full time freelancer which means I don’t have to clock in anywhere particular every morning. 
For the past 2 months I’m having a terrible time waking up early. Every night I tell myself that no matter what happens I will wake up but usually it’s never before 10am and I absolutely hate it. It’s the worst feeling in the world. Okay I’m gonna point out a bunch of important factors at play here:
1. For the longest time I’ve been a nocturnal animal. I’m an artist, and my creative juices somehow tend to flow more than usual after 11pm.
2. I don’t have a set sleeping pattern. Sometimes I stay up till about sunrise. “Sometimes” being the operative word here. 
3. I’m suffer from on and off insomnia. 
4. I’m bipolar. 
5. My brain in all possible ways prefers night over day. 
6. I’m an extremely deep sleeper. Which makes alarms and pretty much anything else redundant 99% of the times. 

But here’s the funny thing, regardless of when I sleep if I got anything work related, be it a meeting or say my call time on a set is early morning, I’m able to wake up. 
Now I know it’s all in my head and work gives me an incentive to wake up but regardless of aforementioned kind of projects, I still work everyday. I acknowledge that there’s no time constraint per se but I’m fully aware of the fact that I do want to wake up early.

579,"So I'm in college and my classmate X and I are planning to do an internship abroad together this summer (school requires it). We both received positive responses from a very good place, however after we replied to confirm, I received my signed letter of acceptance and she didn't.

Two other people in our year got accepted at the same company, and received their letters despite applying later than us. We all got our mails one evening in the span of 20 mins, with mine being last, so we brushed it off as ""the guy probably went to bed or something, X will surely get her letter asap"". However it's been a couple of days and nothing, X has mailed the employer to see what's up, now we wait but I'm pretty worried.

While I would very much like to take this internship and wouldn't mind going with the other two people, the initial agreement was with X and it would be a major asshole move to leave her behind (and would likely break a long friendship). I might be a complete fool and any normal person would choose the career opportunity, but I know I would hate myself for it. Even if she said ""go without me"" I would feel guilty.

However I hope this is just an unlikely possibility, since the employer's initial response was positive and he has no solid reason to change his mind. Worst case scenario: he forgot about her and accepted some other intern in her place (especially considering the order in which he sent the letters). We do have other confirmations as back-up but this one is the top option. Maybe we'll get some good news soon and I won't have to make this choice, but I really dread the possibility and I can't stop thinking about it.

August 2017 my sister moved 6 hours CLOSER to us. It was so exciting because she was so far away and I had just had a baby and our kids could play and be together. Not to mention we are super close and we love a bunch of the same things. 

Spring 2018  my husband got a job an hour south of where she lives! Better pay, better health Care, and we get to be closer to my awesome sister and her family!

2018 was the best year. We saw eachother 3-4 times a week, bought season passes to theme parks , and literally just did everything together. Their kids and my child get along so well and its so nice to start somewhere new with your best friend close by. 

2019 we are looking to buy a house and are looking right by my sister. We asked how things were going at their jobs and if it would be smart to look closer to them then to my husband's work. They loved the idea and went to several house viewings with us.

Whenever I text him I get feelings but this time it was so strong that I texted him one week ago and I haven’t stopped thinking about him since then. I know it’s a very short period of time but this time I don’t know it feels different. I really want to confess to him sometimes but I’m really afraid that he will reject me and our friendship will get awkward. I really don’t know what to do. I haven’t talked to anybody about this so I’m writing here. Please give me some solid advice. Thank youu,19Apr2019,1

587,"So, to preface this, I fully realise this is all my responsibility and I dug my own grave, nobody else did this, only me. I'm 22.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing a Masters for the past 2 and a half years. I passed the first year with flying colours (85% grade average) and was top of my class during it. It was a regular university year, lessons to attend, assignments to hand in, people to answer to, deadlines set by the teachers.

When the second year began, it was time to begin writing a thesis. Started the year in September, had a topic by October, and then it was off to the races by myself, with a single class per semester, a lesson per two weeks. At that point it was just reading material and taking notes. I slacked off until the deadline of that class, where we had to hand in a sample of our references and a few pages of text formulating a prototype said thesis.

Did that on the last day and handed it in. Good grade. The second semester was basically the same thing, except it was for starting to do field work and forming the core of your work, given that you'd already had done the theoretical reflection. The same thing happened, I slacked till the last minute. Had a good grade, but worse than the first.

During summer I kept slacking and telling myself next week was it, I'd start. Comes September, the thesis deadline, I pay an extra fee and get a one year extension on the deadline. So far, I've made little to no progress due to my own laziness.During all this time, my family asked questions about my work, my deadlines, when is it done, when are you handing it in, does your supervisor not help you?

Here's the kicker, I lied. Everytime they asked, I lied and dug a bigger hole for myself of deceit, self hate and misery. Wasting money, wasting time, doing almost nothing this past year and a half except lose some weight,get my drivers license done and start a new hobby and make new friends. Now my friends are moving on, finishing their courses, getting jobs, doing good for themselves, and I'm still stuck, due to no one but myself.

Now my family are rightfully getting more infuriated with me, I can't bring myself to tell the truth due to fear and because I don't want to let them down, and know that my savings and their money has gone to waste. So here comes the question: Should I man up, tell them I'm a failure and start fresh, going hard at work and end this once and for all, if they can even trust me to do it.

Or freeze my enrollment, go job hunting and move on with my life, perhaps returning a few years down the line more mature and with a true sense of self discipline and responsibility. It would also be so I can pay back my family the wasted money and start contributing to house expenses.

Or try to combine both, by finding part time jobs and finish the thesis with the time I have to spare during the day.

Have a nice day and sorry for the wall of text! Hope life is treating you all nicely.",19Apr2019,2

594,"High school was relatively easy for me and I didn't really get challenged except for some AP courses I took - but I still never felt smart. Sure I had to study for tests, I can't not study and expect to pass like some skilled people. Math has always been a struggle for me but I've always passed with at least a B in high school 

Now I'm in college and trying to not fail Calc II, and I'm just fucking it up. My last test was originally supposed to be Thursday, but my professor pushed it back to Friday. The plan for Wednesday before my professor pushed the date back was to just study study study! I was motivated for it too. But then, I got a little carried away with relaxing and hanging out cause I've pushed myself this week to catch up on procrastination on a paper and a physics test. Thus, I didn't go to bed until 3 am Thursday morning and didn't look at any material. I KNOW that my best bet for passing math is to repeat and do problems over and over again to grasp it, but I just haven't been able to this semester, besides my third test I gave it my all because the information we learned for that test was interesting and was clicking for once. I got the same score I got on my first exam, a 64. I haven't gotten higher than that and we just had our fourth midterm, the next test being a final. I just feel so unmotivated after working my ass off for that third test and not improving my grade at all. I've been to my professor's office countless times, I've missed his class twice, once because I had a conference/championship and once because I was reviewing for a test I had immediately after his class and was too stressed to sit in his class taking math notes. I've also hired a tutor for this exam and the final, churning out some money to be retaught the lessons and make sure I grasp the ideas. So I looked at material three days in a row before the test, even getting up an hour and a half early today to do some problems by myself - but I feel/know I'm not really giving it my all and I'm pissed at myself and I just feel stuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

595,"I've been studying interactive media design for almost 2 years now. A few months ago, we got to hear that we'd be going on internships at the end of the year. While almost everyone from my class already got an internship within 1 or 2 tries, i've been struggling. Either companies told me they were full or didn't need any interns. 

As i got kind of desperate as the clock was ticking, a teacher helped me out finding a company close to where i live. (I thought of that place before, but really doubt it would be a good internship. It was a copyshop.) So i called them as a last hope resort asking if they needed an intern. The boss said i should come over to discuss everything that afternoon. There really wasn't much he wanted to know and said i was welcome. I gave up on searching for another place, and thought ""why not?"". 

Fast forward to yesterday. I get to work my first day there, and normally they're with 2 people(the boss man and a girl) but as the boss man was sick i only got work with the girl who didn't really talk much or had a sense of humor. For some reason they don't use Adobe programs, but instead some program which is kind of difficult to use. So i was already a bit bummed out. I get a spot at one of their computer and get to learn the program a bit. After learning for a bit, the girl says it's time for a break. As we walk to the kitchen she turns around and says ""Oh, we always let the interns make coffee and tea for us. I want tea."" I honestly wasn't sure if it was a bad joke or serious. I prepare the tea and coffee while feeling really bad about my choice to take an internship at this place. After the break was over, i got to copy 500 emails off of different websites and paste them in excel. Not really anything i SHOULD have to do as an intern. I'm supposed to learn to design stuff. When i got home i told a group of my classmates how i felt really bad about it. I later got a private message from a friend that said he could ask if they had a spot for an intern at them. I told him i would wait a few days to see if anything would change.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day (today) i get back to work with a really bad feeling about my choices. The tells me i can try to design a birth card. I suddenly feel a lot better because i can actually do what i'm supposed to do. When i finished it, she doesn't even take a look and says ""Great, how about a business card for yourself."". I immediately saw where this was going. While she was doing the real work, i got to design my own things that would never be used or even looked at. That's pretty much what i did all day long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I'm already tired of the place and got 282 hours left to go. Should i ask my teacher if i can get transferred to another company or do i stay at where i am and see if it'll change through the time?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: After long search got an internship at a company which turned out not to be as helpful as i thought they'd be.

She approached me after class and basically told me that she's always had a crush on me, to what I said me too (even though I didn't) out of empathy and cause I didn't want her to feel bad after she had gathered enough courage to go and tell me.

  


After that I started to ask her out to get to know her better and maybe get to like her back but I simply don't like her at all (we currently have plans for this next Wednesday and to be honest I really don't feel like it). I'm not even looking for a relationship atm I don't even know why I did what I did.

  


Now things are going in a serious direction (met her mom, borrowed her my favorite book, etc, etc)and I honestly (feel like crap saying this) don't find her attractive at all, not only physically but on every aspect

  


So my question is ¿How do I dump her/get dumped by her without making her feel like shit? I know I'm pretty much asking for a miracle here because I know she won't take it lightly (taken that she most certainly feels like we're meant to be together)

604,"I'm 51 and have gone through some enormous changes in the past 18 months.  Just as my youngest left home for college, my husband's abuse turned physical. I ended up being assaulted and raped.  Between the concussion, broken bones and PTSD, I lost my business (I was an artisan goldsmith).  When I filed for a restraining order he responded by filing 6 lawsuits against me in an effort to bully me into not pressing charges or challenging him on the separation of our assets.  

I got through it, sort of.  I won the lawsuits, completed our property settlement, and he has just asked for an out of court settlement re: rape and assault.  I've agreed to the settlement to avoid months of criminal and civil lawsuits, but it's not a done deal and he has been erratic.  After a year of not working while I healed, got therapy and spent months in and out of court, I started graduate school in Fall 2018. I'm still struggling badly with PTSD.

It was a fairly brief marriage after raising my three kids alone, and after losing my business I decided that I needed a career change.  Losing my business truly broke my heart, and going in a new direction seemed more pragmatic than starting over.  It would also allow for a higher income to offset years of single motherhood.

not my first time asking this reddit for advice, and since you all didn’t let me down the first time I thought i’d ask for some more advice that I desperately need. i’ve been best friends with this girl now for three years and although i’ve had my chances to be her boyfriend i decided not to because i’m too inexperienced (I see it as how jim and pam were from the office before they got together)— i have only had one relationship which barely made it to three months— and in that time she’s been with a few good guys but they haven’t worked out. now however, i’ve been told from a few friends that this is my opportunity to seal the deal and ask her out, but i’m a little worried. she would talk to me ab how her boyfriends were inexperienced as if she was looking for someone who just knows what they’re doing, and i would take mental notes as to how to best approach asking her out. i’ve only ever asked one person out as i said before, but i’m thinking of asking her smthg like,”hey we’ve been good friends for a while now and i was wondering if you’d like to try smthg new with me, and be my girlfriend.” and then i’d warn her ab being my being inexperienced, and then say smthg along the lines of, “bc i’m inexperienced i won’t rly know if i’m doing smthg wrong, so plz don’t hesitate to tell me.” I was wondering if this is an appropriate way to handle this, and if i should do it in person or over the phone, or if we should go on a date or two first (even though we know everything ab each other), and i just would like to hear some other opinions.

615,"TL;DR = I have been rudely, but NOT purposefully ignoring and/or forgetting things my girlfriend tells me, and i HATE IT.
&amp;nbsp;

I am in a long(ish) distance relationship with someone whom I consider to be my soulmate. We mostly  use Discord to communicate daily. We are coming up on three years together with several speed bumps in the road--usually due to my character flaws.

&amp;nbsp;

An ongoing issue that I can't seem to curb has been my frequent inability to take in and retain the things that she tells me. I feel like one of three things seems to happen:

&amp;nbsp;

1. She will tell me something, I will not understand, but placate her by responding in such a way that tells her I do understand. For the record, this happens the least of the three things on this list (but it is by far the most disrespectful, in my opinion).
&amp;nbsp;

2. She will tell me something, but I am distracted by something, and my brain goes on autopilot blurting out, yet again, a response that makes her think I listened and understood.
&amp;nbsp;

3. I listen actively, I understand explicitly, respond in kind, and then just FORGET everything she just told me.

&amp;nbsp;

I am so sick and tired of any of these things happening. For number 1, I know how to solve it, and I have been actively getting better at not doing such a dismissive, rude thing. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second issue, I definitely just need to give her my focus and attention, OR simply ask her to repeat. However, there is some self-sabotaging part of my mind that prevents me from realizing this has just happened, and because of that, I do not ask her to repeat. I know it sounds weird, and what's even weirder is that it's not all the time. I have caught myself many times being distracted and asked her to repeat herself. But sometimes I simply don't catch it.

&amp;nbsp;

The third problem... I don't even know what that could possibly be about. Some neurological thing? How does one just up and forget what was just heard, understood, and acknowledged?

&amp;nbsp;

What also makes me seem like a crazy person is the fact that it's not like I ""remember that I forgot"" (in the case of 2 and 3). She will call me out on not listening/forgetting, and I sound like an idiot trying to scramble around in my mind to recall things.

&amp;nbsp;

It makes her feel so unappreciated and frustrated; and I am just as frustrated and, frankly, ashamed. I hope there is something I can do before I ruin what has been the best thing to happen to me.

&amp;nbsp;

I know I am not blameless in this whole thing. Maybe I just need to ""try harder"".

616,"**Finally I have had the courage to post this!!** 

**For context:** I am F18 living in England, and this happened around 2 years ago. My parents are also religious (my dad is traditional, but my mum is very liberal and normal compared to him).

I recently finally got over the guy I had a crush on and have realised that he and his friend are complete assholes. However I still have flashbacks of the time and it makes me feel really upset. At times I even end up randomly crying and when I get the flashbacks, I feel really angry.

**The story =** 

This girl, S, once messaged me asking if I was interested in her bf, P, so I told her no, but she kept insisting that I was, so I told her I was interested in some other guy, C, to get her to stop. To be honest, C was actually pretty good-looking and I had a conversation with him previously before she messaged me. The reason she had suspicion was because I had spoken to P before they dated and had even hung out with him once, but I wasn’t alone with him as my friend, Ann, was with us. After I told her that I liked C, she got really happy and told me that he and P are actually best friends. She said things like she would try to get me and him together, I got a little excited and thought maybe something could happen between me and him. Anyways, me and S became friends. 

During our friendship, she would tell me about her jealousy issues and I realised that she was actually jealous of almost every single girl P spoke to (besides me and her best friend, H). She told me private things about her relationship with him, such as him saying that he still has feelings for other girls and saving somewhat suggestive pictures of them on his phone (sorry, I don’t want to say slutty). She even told me once that she was actually using P to get over her ex. She told me a lot of other much more sensitive things as well, which I felt terrible for her and tried to help her, but she wouldn’t really take any of my advice. 

I myself needed (and still do) emotional support. At the time, I was also really starting to really like C and all I could do was think about him. I don’t really understand why now, but I became obsessed with him for some reason and he wasn’t even that great. Me and him had no chemistry. Anyways, he started talking to this other girl a lot and whenever I saw them together I would get really emotional inside. He told me that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone and he was quiet an immature guy as well, but I was just afraid that there was something going on between the two, because they used to get on so well. 

S and me decided to go out and get a drink together, I wanted it because I was feeling down and she claimed she wanted it for the same reason. So, we went and sat in a park, but unfortunately, I ended up drinking too much and everything went blank. All I can recall by memory is that she was nowhere as drunk as me and even walked back home by herself, she just called P and C to help me. They didn’t really know what to do and just called the police and left me at a station when they and my parents arrived. 

The next day I woke up in my bed confused with the blurry memories, I was shaking and my eyes were very red. I was scared that my “dad” would kill me so I tried to drown myself in the bathtub, but I didn’t. I later tried to contact S to see if she was alright, I lost my phone so I had to do it over the laptop. When she finally messaged me, she was very angry at me and told me it was my fault that she apparently got abused by a stranger, because she was so drunk while going home that she knocked on the wrong door. I felt even worse after that and tried to apologise to her but she kept saying it was all my fault and that I should stay away from C and P. I tried to call P, who spoke to me a lot better and he said that since he knew that I don’t need any help, he was more worried about Snake. I told him about what she messaged me (because he asked) and he said that he didn’t trust my words because I didn’t really care about her. By the way, since I was so traumatised by the entire event in general, my voice was shaking. I started crying and asked him if he meant that it was all my fault to which he said no. He even suggested for me to come to school on Monday. 

I came in and C was sitting next to me in class, he noticed my shaking and not laughing at any jokes. I tried to contact him as well over the weekend, but he just said he’ll speak to me when he sees me and that he wasn’t angry at me. Anyways, after class he privately told me about what happened while I was drunk (he hid a lot of things from me, but he told me the overall event) and he even ran after me to comfort me while I was travelling to the other building for my next lesson. I started thinking that maybe he did like me, since he was the only one out of the 3 who actually cared about how I felt. 

When I arrived to the other building, I saw S acting strangely normal with everyone around and talking like nothing was wrong. P was also with her. I saw H walk past me and she kept giving me a really evil look, as if I was the one who made sure that S got “abused”. At lunch, l told Ann some of these things she told me that she thinks S is bullshitting and that she just wants attention, she said that she has always had a bad feeling about S and didn’t like her from the start. By the way, I was told by P that C also didn’t believe S and thought she was a complete shit talker as well. 

Anyways, some days later I confessed to C that I liked him over text and he told me to speak to him at school the next day. I was scared but I wanted to see him. The next morning at break I saw him showing my messages to one of his other guy friends and laughing. So, l got hurt and didn't want speak to him. He kept asking me to meet him in the library but I didn't go. I told him a little later that I was angry about what he did, but he just blamed it on Later on we called (he was on his way to the gym with his friends, while I was at home in my room) and he started shouting at me. I don't really remember how responded to him, but all I remember is that he started mocking my texts back to me and his 2 friends were in the background laughing, so I just started crying (to be honest I am starting to cry right now that I think about it). He then (apparently) went a little away from his friends and apologised to me and said, ""me and you will never ever be a thing."" I remember I cried until I eventually fell asleep that day. 

The next day one of his friends was smiling at me strangely and making me feel really uncomfortable, and even though my crush at the time apologised to me, he would make rude jokes about me to the guy sitting next to him. It really broke me and I wanted to commit suicide, he knew I became suicidal as well and only laughed at my depression. I saw no reason to live anymore, all I could ever think of was him humiliating me, but for some reason I still wanted to be with him.",19Apr2019,0

I’ll try to be concise and not drawn out in the details but what we have is a family dynamic of an abusive father who has now become a grandfather and acts as though he has done nothing wrong.

My father was horribly abused as a child and passed some of that abuse (emotional, verbal, and physical) on to us, his kids. I (27M) have just had my first child and do not want my father around him and I’ll explain why.

2 years ago my mother passed away suddenly and left the whole family fragmented as she was the glue which held us together. After she passed, my father told us kids that he needed time and space, which is reasonable and so we gave him just that. It was made clear to him that we were there for him in whatever capacity needed and all he ever need do was to call or text us.  Well time has passed and us kids have had to move on and deal with the loss without him (no phone calls from him, barely a text, no face to face contact except once or twice after the funeral) after he told me via text that he did not need us in his life as he felt we were too hard on him.  At this point I should mention that he has thrown bricks at us, choked me to the point of drawing blood after I got in between him and my sister, been cussed out more times than is worth mentioning, sent to bed without dinner if we looked at him wrong... the list could go on.  Never once while living at home did any of us kids throw parties, drink, smoke, do drugs or anything typical of a teenager. I don’t understand what he possibly thinks has been done to him by us to make him think that we are too hard on him but to me, it’s ludicrous and abusive still for him to shift the blame for his actions onto us. 

I know I’m rambling and this is somewhat incoherent but now that my son has been born, he’s started to text me again asking where his gift is and when he’s going to be invited over, blah, blah, blah... I have no desire to see him after he cut us out of his life for 2 years during what was the most difficult experience I’ve had to face in life so far. 

What do I do? Do I tell him off? Do I welcome him over? He is extremely manipulative and controlling and stubborn as hell. He has met the baby once already at the hospital so I feel I’ve fulfilled my obligation as a son to let him see the baby. 

I don’t want him around, how do I let him know that he’s not welcome until he changes his behaviour?",19Apr2019,1

619,"I graduated college Summa Cum Laude, last year, moved out, got married, and moved to the big city to start my new job/career.

I’m thankful for these successes, yet, I look back on social media and see my friends as if they’re stuck in time. One of my best friends is in college and already has a new best friend. My other friends are moving on and hanging out with others. Yet everyone has the same job (even if they complain about it) and nothing has changed, except for the people they’re hanging out with. 

I don’t go out as much because I feel like I’m settling down, live farther away, and honestly don’t have enough energy after a crazy busy work week. My old friends all go out and stay up late and all that jazz all the time. I only see them on the weekends during the day.

It’s normal for people to move on, especially if you live an hour away from them and if you’re not in the same community as them anymore - so I don’t see them all the time. However, it hurts that they’re not as close with me as in the past. It hurts to see other people take my place in their pictures (yeah, jealous and selfish, I know 😭) and have other people be the “best friend.” I keep in touch, but feel like I’m getting more distant from them because I’m at a different point in life. I feel lonely and just want a tight group of friends like I used to have. I can’t connect to anyone at my job because I have nothing in common with them, but I’d like to find more friends.....is there a way to get over this lonely, pitiful, isolating feeling? How do you deal with moving on and finding more friends in a new area? How can I not be jealous?

So me and my current boyfriend are together for like only a month,it was quite a really long way,we long were friends and inlove with each other without knowing for like a year.Then I told him and we came together.The first 2 weeks were like perfect.It felt like heaven on earth.But then suddenly he stopped writing me, I wasn’t very worried at that moment so I just kept starting conversations with him.Soon I felt like he doesn’t want to talk,his answers were short and it was like for example when I asked how he was he said good,he didn’t even asked how I am or anything for me it felt like he didn’t have any interest in what I am doing or how i am.So after two weeks of chasing him and always starting the conversations by myself,we met and I asked him if he don’t want to talk or what’s the problem.He said he doesn’t know,he will try to better himself.So half a week later nothing changed and also he forget about our date on Thursday,the day before he told me everything is fine and he would really like to meet,So I wrote him a really long text which point was,that I will stop writing him and if he wants to stay in contact with me he has to get his ass whooped and write me by himself.I wrote this text 2 days ago,he still hasn’t answered but I know he read it.I am a little pissed because I don’t understand why he Is acting like this,does anybody have an idea ?",19Apr2019,1
621,"So i was dating this girl for about a month, it seemed to be going fine, albeit slow.

I had started to like her quite a bit by this point, and became invested pretty quickly until we had an argument one night out which ended up in her crying, it was resolved and things seemed fine. We ended up going home together after she wandered off with a friend for around two hours. 

The messaging slowed down over the next few days and i made a comment about it and she blew her lid off and it ended up in her saying she didn’t wanna talk to me anymore, i said fine. Obviously this was rather upsetting but what more could i really do? 

I was out drinking last night with other people and headed into a club where the vast majority of people i knew were headed. 

So around 45 minutes of me arriving and grabbing a drink, she turns up, obviously i know the conversation we had so i actively do my best to fully avoid her for the night and let her do what she wants whilst simultaneously socialising with people around me.

It seemed okay until out of nowhere she starts making a massive scene and pointing me out, it becomes really bad and i’m drunk and confused at the whole situation, she starts telling people that i’ve attempted to approach her, which i haven’t once. She then makes a big deal out of it and starts getting upset, so i leave. 

Angry and drunk i sent her some messages saying i was done. I was a little harsh and i do regret that but i was so angry at being made a public spectacle for no reason.

622,"There’s nothing more fun than over analyzing our crush’s every move over social media, right?

A guy from my university added me a month or two ago, and we don’t personally know each other, though we’ve gone to school together for a few years now. I didn’t think much of it, but his posts caught my attention. He’s got a great sense of humor, he’s very goofy, and seems to share views with me that many people don’t openly share where we live (as far as I can tell from what he posts). 

Because of this, I’ve been actively liking whatever’s funny or relatable. He’s been doing the same, presumably because he finds my posts relatable or interesting. Because of this increased interaction, his posts are usually front and center on my news feed, and I’m assuming vice verse. (Thanks, Zucc)

Aside from this, he’s likes 65-75% of my posts, and is usually last to like my pics. I try to like every other post to make sure I’m not coming on too strong, but I’m usually the only person or one of a few to like his posts. How many college kids actively use Facebook, anyway? Lol. 
I liked a photo of his a while later to see if anything came of it, and we’re still going back and forth. 

My question is, could this mean he’s somewhat interested? Should I continue to see if he says anything? Maybe say hey if I see him on campus?

PS, I know communication is the easiest way to find out, but I’m 100% certain I’m not going to message him unless he messages me first.",19Apr2019,1

Well today I visited my grandmother for the first time since she moved into this facility, and when I walked by the room my ex's grandma had been in, the name plate outside the door had changed. This hit me pretty hard, because I assumed she'd passed away. I thought about texting my ex to give her my condolences, but then I realized that they could very well have just moved her and I would have no way of knowing.

Still, if she *did* pass, I would want to say something out of respect for her and my ex. As far as breakups go she and I split on relatively cordial terms, but we haven't spoken in about eight or nine months, so it might be awkward to contact her out of nowhere about her grandma. Plus I wouldn't want it to be rude if I ask and then it turns out either her condition has worsened or they just moved her somewhere else. I've thought about maybe texting my ex's mom instead and asking what the situation is, figuring that she might harbor less complicated feelings toward me than my ex and be less likely to make things awkward, but I'm not sure.

The repairs were pretty extensive and I couldn’t live there anymore, so my landlady broke my lease and I was suddenly homeless (The flooding was not any fault of ours, a plumber told us so. The landlady was extremely uncooperative and a massive asshole about it, but I digress). 

I ended up staying in my friends garage
for a few months. It was dark, filthy and cold and I felt very scared and alone. During this time I would text my mom telling her how badly things were going for me. I told her how depressed I was but she never returned my texts. I assumed she told the rest of my family what was going on with me, but it turns out she kept it to herself. My dad and my siblings had no idea what I was going through. I thought they knew and just didn’t care. I don’t have a great relationship with any of my family members but I thought someone would at least reach out to me and see if I was ok. I cried every night. 

On the day of my graduation my dad showed up high on drugs and barely able to keep his eyes open, my mom passed out from drinking in the early afternoon, and my siblings left after about 20 minutes when they saw this going on. I don’t want to sound materialistic or anything but nobody gave me flowers or a card or anything. I felt like nobody cared at all and I feel like I accomplished nothing. It was the worst day of my life. In October I was (voluntarily) hospitalized when I became actively suicidal. I’ve been living with my parents ever since while I work on my mental health and I’ve been doing a lot better. 

It hasn’t been easy. My parents abused and neglected me when I was growing up and it’s hard for me to be around them sometimes, but I don’t have a job at the moment (I was on short-term disability while treating my depression) and I don’t have any other option. My mom recently stopped taking her antidepressants and has been throwing tantrums on a daily basis. Yesterday out of nowhere she lashed out at me, telling me that it was all my fault that I was homeless during college and I can’t blame her for anything. I told her that I do blame her for not being their to support me emotionally, and that I’ll never forgive her for ruining my graduation. She started screaming about how she must be the worst mother ever and threatened to kill herself. She discredited all of my emotions and made me feel like all of the progress I’ve made towards getting better has been for nothing. 

Today I packed my things and left. I don’t know where to go but I’ve been homeless before without a support system and I think I’ll be ok. I would rather be homeless than continue to live with my abusive, alcoholic parents. I’ll be living in my car and I have a gym membership so I can shower and access wifi. I’ve been applying for jobs and I think I’ll get hired soon. I don’t have a specific question but any insight or advice would be really appreciative.",19Apr2019,2

Okay.
I seem to have this weird problem, where I seem to feel like I have to be interested in one thing... example, sometimes I enjoy dipping into the Goth Rock music genre, and I find when I do my brain suddenly thinks I can ONLY like Goth stuff from then on. So when i find my interests changing to say, Celtic folk/Renaissance Faire type music- I suddenly feel like I have to ONLY dress like Ren Faire and watch LOTR non stop...and my brain gets angry and I get depressed cuz I feel like a flake or something, like I can't stick to any one interest.  I know this is kind of a lousy example, but I am wondering why the eff do I think like this?",19Apr2019,1

651,"K, so the title sounds very odd; and it is. But just hear me out for a bit.

I’m a high school student who is enrolled in my school’s honours program, a rigorous program that requires lots of studying. I’m on neutral territory when it comes to studying, I’m ok with studying for long periods of time and also ok with not studying for a bit. 

Here’s where my mom comes in. Almost every two days, we get into a argument, normally over something petty. It escalates very fast because my mom likes trash talking. Not full on swearing (that’s not allowed in the house) but more of an “idiot” level insult if you catch my drift. 

Anyways, I know that if I try to retaliate, things will only get worse. So I try to bottle up my frustration until she’s finished ranting, which usually takes about 15 mins. (15 mins of her, only her, talking. I’m just there listening.) After she’s done, Id find myself with no energy left to do anything until I’ve released the frustration. This takes about 30 mins. 

The question is, how can I make it so I don’t get frustrated over these insults OR how can I vent faster?


This is off-topic, but she’s also the reason why I’m introverted. I used to be very extroverted until around 8. Without going into too much detail, she’d shut down all my advice or help I tried to give, and if she does use the advice I give, she’d either pretend it was her that came up with it, or that the advice didn’t really matter.

Also, when I had something Im very proud of and showed her, she’d respond with a grunt or “oh nice” kind of response. Because of these, now I can’t show anyone anything and I’m afraid of people shutting down my ideas and making fun of me behind my back. When I told my mom, she just said to get over it.",19Apr2019,1

On all the facebook pages i see i notice people congratulating each others friends on the timeline. It seems to be a unspoken rule or etiquette. Rarely anybody congratulates me on my timeline. I feel this can't be coincidence. There must be a lack in something. Because they don't care.

654,"Heya, I made a throwaway account for touchy subjects such as this in case anyone I know is following my real account.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically... it starts with my friend. We're teens right now, and he's a closet furry clearly. He doesn't admit it and denies it, but visibly draws furry art and has a lot of signs. This is when I began getting more defensive towards furries and the such, since he has depression. It gets bad for him, people constantly make fun of him for it, and he's a social outcast to most kids in the school. I don't receive the same treatment but I hang out with him since we got aplenty of the same interests and humour.

Next, I am incredibly attached to a Discord server I'm in, like, inCREDIBLY attached to the people in there. My parents have done some shady stuff with me and I don't fully trust them as much as these people. Now, I was shown furry art by a guy there who is a furry. And I felt really weird.

Basically, it was just Lucario art, but I felt super weird over it. I was FASCINATED by the art. I began discussing and he told me it's perfectly justified for me to feel this way considering it's an animal with human features, it can speak, do human things and everything. Not only was I now getting defensive over people hating them, but now I'm fascinated by the art.

But it's weird, there are only very few anthro art pieces that trigger this weird ""fascination"" feeling within me. All of these multi-coloured foxes and wolves make me feel nothing.

There are lots of people who shun furries on the server, and I really try my best to stand up for them, they CLEARLY like who they are and that shouldn't be shunned.

Yet some people compare them to ISIS (I know what you're thinking, why...?), some people still refer to it as bestiality despite it being anthro-art and not actual animals...

I don't like how some people would hate you or dislike you if you were to have such a different interest. Somehow people haven't caught on that I might be one, too...

What should I do? Should I embrace this fact or keep it to myself? Do I shun furries for who they are or praise them or just not let it bother me? I can only thank this, though. It made me realise that people who like different things from me AREN'T bad people or weirdos...",19Apr2019,0

658,"
In 2014 someone contacted me over Facebook using a fake account to tell me my husband had propositioned her to be her sugar daddy. I didn’t see this message for 2 years as it went to my junk or whatever. When I noticed it in 2016 I had just given birth to my daughter. I told my sister about it and she decided to try speaking to her to get more info. 

I am confident that that person was lying for a variety of reasons but they still managed to produce pictures of e-transfers with my husbands name on it and a picture of him we later determined was on facebook. The person got frustrated we didn’t believe her and stopped replying. I thought that was the end of a very strange chapter.

In March I got a follow request on Instagram from a weird account I got a bad feeling from. I blocked them. 

My sister called me this week to say she discovered that this same person (using the Instagram handle I blocked) had contacted her saying my husband was with her on two separate occasions. She mentioned in this exchange information I know to have only told a handful of people. I am 95% sure this person is a teacher at my daughters preschool whom I have known and dealt with (with my older two) for the last 6 years. There are two of them I suspect - one of whom my husband has actually sent e transfers to for babysitting my kids.  But the other one has equal “motive”...

I don’t know what to do. I know this is a person who I know and that is terrifying and all consuming. Why is this person trying to hurt me and my family? They are using fake emails and Facebook and Instagram accounts. Is there any way to find out who this is? Help reddit!!

667,"I’m in this contest for TV and video production with a friend of mine. We got 2nd place in the qualifying rounds, we had to do a PSA and we had to do all the prep work that would occur in a realistic scenario, that involved making a script and doing Storyboards.

I guess out of the two of us, I was the better artist. I’ve doodled in the past but other then that I had no prior practice drawing (let alone a human anatomy with proper scaling). I was informed afterward that the quality of the storyboards and script were what put us up in the top 3. 

The problem is that, with the qualifiers, we had to bring in the script and storyboards before hand and our teacher looked over our script and storyboards days before. The storyboards took me hours to do because I had to make them look nearly exactly like each shot in the PSA.

Now that I’m in this competition for real, I have to do everything within a 6 hour period. I can’t draw that quick, let alone make it good enough to get a decent score. One day after school me and my friend did a practice round of what it would be like in this competition(recording, scripting, editing and story boarding) and I had very little time left to work on the drawings after doing everything else and they ended up being all stick figures(even then I was off by 10ish minutes). I will start practicing drawing on my own time but I just wanna know any tips for any of you artists who happen to browse this subReddit.

50% of me thinks this is a really toxic way of thinking and it isn’t fair to tie everybody in with the same brush and the other 50% of me thinks there is some truth in what I think.

670,"I'm in my early 20s (F). I have abusive tendencies, like a little manipulation here, a little bit of sadistic thoughts there. I recognized it as a teenager, and even told my mom I needed to see a therapist because I didn't want to hurt anybody. My mom had previously been concerned about her own well-being because me and my dad used to gang up on her and she would cry. I realized this was pretty fucked up, and I wanted to move out of the house when I was 18. But my parents insisted I go to college, and I was too chicken to move out without any money. I ended up trying to leave the house several times, because I was an adult and I always read you could just leave if you wanted to. But my dad called the police on me and they... well, sent the dogs out. And I've ended up in the mental hospital several times, but I was aware of everything going on with me even though my parents thought I was fucking crazy and not conscious of my ability to damage their psyche through my actions. I knew I needed help, but never once did I tell a whitecoat that I thought I could hurt someone, because I wanted out of the loony bin. Nothing has changed in four years. 

And my mom just took the birthday cake she baked just for me and threw it at my face because I told her I needed some privacy, she demanded I tell her what was wrong as I came into the house (something really embarrassing), and when I told her no, she proceeded to yell, and I as well. We then had a thirty-minute fight with a bit of physical struggle and a lot of yelling and crying. Now she says I've wounded her beyond repair in all my time alive, and she's no longer my mom.

I keep saying I'll leave, and I'm still chicken, but I think I really have to. Where do I go? I'll be outcast from my family, and my mom says if I leave she won't help me ever again.

672,"Hi, thanks for stopping by and sorry for my English.. This is (for obvious reasons) a throwaway account. Long story short as possible - I (15yo f) feel kinda empty and apparently try to fulfill that space it by randomly falling for people (no, not like crushing - just thinking about them all day, starting from my first though and ending my last though - or dreams, if I happen to get enough sleep). Sometimes I struggle with simple tasks bc I'm afraid they'd judge me if they were here (I do realize it's weird, that's one of the reasons I'm writing this.) It can be multiple people (regardless of gender and almost regardless of age) at the same time and all they have to do is just be nice - smile, kind word - that's all it takes to get stucked on my mind for next half year and become a reason for me to live. Yeah, pathetic, right, I'm disgusted too. At first I thought I might be bi or sth, turns out I'm probably just weird.

I’ve been working in kitchens since I was 16 , not cause I dreamed of it but I was chasing the money and so I stuck with it and become easy for me . When I started to work I was very social , care free , and had no worries . All my friends knew my personality as fuck it . I started dating a girl when I was 17 , we lasted roughly almost two years , in the beginning it was great but i guess slowly but surely it started to die to the point where I found message and calls from other guys on her phone and I couldn’t trust her anymore I couldn’t get past it even tho we got back together multiple times . I think this was the point where I fell downhill , I started to doubt myself , I started to overthink everything , I lost sight of who I was because I was so invest in her I didn’t put time into me . 
After that I kinda was on a rampage of fucking myself up , I was already a heavy smoker ( pot ) but I started getting into drinking . I spent my 20th birthday in jail . Than crashed my car weeks later on Xanax . Than a month after that I got a dui because I zoned out on the free way under Xanax again . Than maybe a month ago I totaled my car because I was really drunk . I have anxiety and I think I’m depressed . But I recognize why so it’s a step . I have good days and bad days . I get anxiety when I feel like others are looking at me possibly talking about me . When it probably isn’t the cause so I over think that . I feel like I’m depressed because I lost the love of my life . I’ve tried to go to community college , but I’ve left four times . It’s not that i couldn’t do it but i wasn’t focused into it . Plus being in a room full of students who actually want to be there while I’m just waiting to get out gave me anxiety . 
So now I’m at stage where I’m not sure . I continue to work this 9 to 5 job . I don’t love it but I need cash . It’s hard sometimes because I feel like my coworkers notice I get inside my head and zone out . So coming back everyday I feel like they talk shit but sometimes I just say fuck it do my best and I get to go home . I’ve been going to the gym , which has helped me destress i focus a lot and put time into my body . I’ve made some progress . Also beautiful women everywhere and sadly all the gorillas huffing n puffin , I’m 5’4 but got attitude like I’m 1000ft .
I don’t smoke pot anymore and I cut down my drinking , I’ve tooken account my experiences so I avoid bad thinking . Lost touch with most of my close friends , kinda a zombie going through the motions . 
There has been one thing since I was kid that I do remember . I always wanted to join the military . I have family meme bees who served in the army . So I looked up to them . I thought they were big in this world . I think about going more than ever . To devote myself into something bigger than myself . To prove to myself I did it . To know that if I accomplished this what is there to hold me back . I don’t know if it could help with my anxiety and depression but I know I’m a fighter , I give everything when I’m backed into a corner , I know on the inside that I’m burning but I’ll do my best never to let others know . Pros and cons . 
My questions are , do you feel like you’ve better yourself joining ? What branch travels the most , I’d like to put myself in new places ? What military jobs are the most useful when your service is done and your back being a civilian ? 
Sorry that this may be a rant but I hope someone takes the time to read this and helps me out . Thank you !",19Apr2019,1

It’s a volunteer position and I basically had to rearrange my life (school, social, etc.) to make it fit my schedule. It would be awesome because I absolutely love the sport except for the fact that I get nothing but disrespect from the players. 

I think the reason is that they are comparing me to the head coach who is straight up someone I idolize and I’m an 18 year old guy who is okayish at the sport. If you compared the two of us it’s like night and day. I definitely am better at teaching a concept then actually doing it. I can guide you step by step on moves I can’t pull off myself. 

The problem is that theses guys don’t listen to anything I say. Some of the varsity team actually listens to me and they’ve seen improvements in the skills I’ve helped them with but the JV refuses to even give me the time of day. 

I’ve gotten so much crap that I’ve actually broken down crying in the middle of practice when I was in charge one day. I understand the fact that respect is earned and just because I show up doesn’t mean I deserve respect but I do everything in my power the help these guys out.

He texts the exact same on tinder and Facebook, His location adds up to where he is today, and he tells me both on tinder and Facebook in the same hour that he went to school for environmental science.
He said he’d “love to catch up sometime” on Facebook and that basically means “let’s bang” since we weren’t that close in high school and we never talked to each other in the past 5 years.

Should I tell her that her husband is cat fishing people on tinder and wanted to “catch up” with me? I’d certainly want to know if it was my husband, but I don’t have any real proof that tinder Ed is high school Ed and I’ve never spoken to this girl in my life.",19Apr2019,2
678,"(At the risk of sounding very conceited and arrogant, I’m gonna preface this with something I believe people reading and answering should know, hopefully it doesn’t come off that way lol.)

Just finishing up my freshman year of college, and it’s been a nice opportunity for a clean slate. Nobody knows who I am so I branched our a little bit and developed some kind of new persona for myself. I was never a nerdy kid/ the kid who sat at the end of the lunch table in HS, I was highly athletic, dated around and was/am smart. 

As I started moving through highschool however, I noticed people took to talking behind other’s backs very often. I saw it at parties, practices, in class, and in hallways. Didn’t date a girl for more than a month, some of that was my fault some of it wasn’t but it hurt all the same. I got to be very protective to the point where I didn’t really associate with anyone in the last few weeks of senior year because I honestly didn’t enjoy being around anybody while worrying about anything I say being school-wide news. I carried this attitude into college and only went to a few parties and made a few friends before I noticed the same things happening. I haven’t been to a party in about 7 months, I haven’t been out to eat with anyone I might even call a friend in a year, the only girls I talk to are short term hookups, and I mainly focus on studies and being better at my chosen field (aerospace engineering)

I really want to have a solid friend group and a relationship, but I’m not sure I can trust it. Anyone have any advice? 

Again, terribly sorry if this sounds conceited. I just felt it was important to know I’m not deciding to be antisocial because I have no choice. Hope everyone reading this has a lovely weekend!",19Apr2019,0
679,"I will shortly be divorced and will be having to change my last name.

I don't like my maiden name because it's attached to my narcissistic father who I haven't seen in nearly 20 years and I would be the only person in my family left with that name so trying to think of a surname to change to instead.

I've also never liked my first name. It's very common and I have always had multiple people with my name in the same class/work groups as me and I think it would be the best time to also change my first name.

However, this is obviously a big change. I have 3 young children who have their fathers name, I have family and friends who would have to get used to an entire name change as well as all the legal issues and I'm just wondering if its worth it, if it will feel strange at all or if I'm just crazy and should just stick to the surname change.

682,"I have a partner (or almost ex-partner) who took pornographic videos/photos of me while I slept. My goal is to get his phone so I could delete the content off of it.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about a month ago (has been showing symptoms a lot longer, but it had been hard to get him to see the doctor), and I had been taking him to the therapist and psychiatrist since then. He went through many manic episodes where he acted delusional and violent, even when he was calm he tried to make impulsive decisions that involved traveling across and/or out of the country alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Since he had the diagnosis, I began periodically checking through his phone to see if he made any large purchases or bought any travel tickets, etc, as his doctor told me that if he acted on these impulses, it would be dangerous for him and everybody around him.

&amp;#x200B;

While doing a routine check of his phone while he was asleep, I discovered he had multiple videos of me that he filmed while I was asleep, all extremely pornographic in nature. I had no idea he had taken these, nor when he had done it. He never mentioned to me that he did, and I was very surprised and at first even wondered it was me or not, but upon inspecting it clearly, I know 100% that it was me in those videos.

&amp;#x200B;

When I found the photos/videos, I did not delete them, as I didn't want him to notice that I had been going through his phone without him knowing. I just wanted to add that he also willingly gave me his passcode and let me register my face to unlock his phone.

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend he had the biggest manic episode he has had of yet. He became extremely angry, violent, and paranoid, and I immediately took away his phone as soon as he mentioned he was leaving, and I tried to keep him inside the house as he was in a state where he could hurt other people.

&amp;#x200B;

He began breaking things, stomped on them to completely crush them, and then charged at me while waving his arms, trying to hit me. I managed to get him outside the house as I did not want to get beaten up, and I asked him to calm down and talk so he could come back in. He was still violent yelling to be let back in, I told him I was going to call the police, and I called the police. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was very mad at me at this point, and told me that if I called the police the relationship was over, and that he was going to get back at me in every way, and that he was going to sue me with a class action law suit (I don't think that's how it works but obviously I'm not a lawyer), and I told him the police was coming anyways because this was too much and asked him to please calm down. When the police finally came an hour later, he was calmly sitting outside waiting for them.  

&amp;#x200B;

After questioning both of us, the police decided to take him to emergency psychiatric care, and asked for his phone and keys. I asked them if they could leave the phone with me because a) I needed to pay shared bills with it and use our shared accounts and b) he makes impulsive decisions and purchases on them that we can't afford and c) there was pornographic content on it of me that I would want to delete in case he was feeling extra vengeful. The police said that wasn't possible because it was his belongings/property, and that I had to hand it over, but he wasn't going to have access to it at all because he was going straight to the hospital. The police also told me the things he destroyed were ""common property"" because we live together.

&amp;#x200B;

He got admitted to the hospital, and I visited to make sure he was alright. The doctor told me he was asleep, and that he would be assessed in the morning, and that he wouldn't be back until a bit. I asked the doctor if I could have the phone and why I wanted it back, and she told me that she could not give it to me because of legal reasons. The next day he got admitted and transferred from emergency psychiatry to the psychiatric ward, and from there he began repeatedly calling my phone, sometimes apologizing, sometimes angrily talking. The last call he made to me was extremely threatening, and upon getting that call I immediately visited the hospital to ask them a) how he was making this many calls and b) how is no one watching him on the phone, where he openly just threatened me. 

&amp;#x200B;

They gave me a meeting with the unit director, the director of nurses, and some random nurse I assume was watching over my partner, but all of them had already made up their mind about me, with the random nurse telling me I was ""over reacting"" and that the staff was there to ""protect the patient and not their families"". I asked for the phone back anyways, explained why, but they kept repeating ""it's his property, you can't have it"". The hospital put my number on a do-not-call list and then restricted his phone access to 2 short calls a day, and then told me I also waived my rights to visitation by being on the do-not-call list. I left the hospital crying.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days after this (yesterday), his mother came to stay with me, and has been going to visit my (former) partner everyday during as many visiting hours as she could. I told her all about his drug use, his work stress, his smoking habit, as well as the sexual assault-y things he has done and what is on his phone, but I quickly realized that she was the ""Brock Turner's mom"" type. Weird enough, she looked really sad and upset when I talked about everything but the rapey stuff, and then when I talked about anything sexual, she sheepishly smiled and shrugged, and even laughed at some of the stuff. It really bothers me and that's probably a different issue (or maybe there is some stuff in the past I don't know about), but my main focus was getting that phone, so I asked her if she can go retrieve it for me (because she is his legal guardian), and she said she would. 

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't been back with it yet, but I kind of doubt that she would do this for me, because she had told me this morning that she wanted to rent a new apartment for me so she could live in this one with her son (just the two of them) when he got out. She insisted that he would take care of him and pay for all of his things including the rent and utilities, and would take time off work until all of it worked out. According to her, the original plan of taking him home wouldn't work out, as she would not be able to control him if he got violent on the airplane on the way back. I asked her what she planned on doing if he was violent at home together and knocked her over and left and harmed someone else, and she said that wouldn't happen because he would be taking meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner's mother said a lot of really selfish things, like that if he got better and found a job she'd leave him here to live alone (despite the bipolar diagnosis and this meltdown), and that I would never have to see him again if I didn't want to, and that he probably wouldn't hurt anybody with medication, but in the event that if he does, he is a sick man and can't help it. At this point, I doubted that she even tried to get this phone or even side with me when he gets released from the hospital and get his personal belongings back.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anybody who has had experience like this who knows how I could deal with this? The photos and videos are not just on the camera roll but are also saved on the ""my eyes only"" section of snapchat, and so factory resetting the phone wouldn't do much especially if he had the photos/videos backed up on a cloud somewhere. I just want to borrow his phone for like 30 mins to power delete everything I could find including my contact info as well as my family's contact info, along with any kind of media of me that is on his phone he can use later against me.

&amp;#x200B;

His mom says he'll probably be out in about 15 days, but it could depend on his behavior/how he reacts to the meds. The doctors said so far he has been calm in the hospital, but he doesn't get triggered until he sees someone that knows him well (like his mother or me), and so it could be a reason why he is so calm.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Partner is bipolar and took porn videos of me while I slept, I was unaware he ever took them until I found them on his phone. A few days later, partner has violent manic episode and I call the police. Partner got put in the psych ward and the phone is now in the hospital safe, hospital will not give me phone back. Partner calls threatening from the hospital, I put myself on do-not-call list and am banned from visitation. Partner's mom comes into town to take him home, promises to retrieve phone but hasn't delivered. Partner will be out 2 weeks later and regains access of his phone.

I will call my friend John, and my crush Sally

So basically I have this big friend group with 8 guys in it. We are all super close and are like best friends. We hang out a few times a week outside school, and text each other every day in our group chat. Lately, I've been noticing that one of the guys in that group, John, has been acting differently at school. He frequently brings up Sally's name during our conversations, and I saw him talking to her a few times. During class, John made a joke and made Sally laugh. John was super happy and felt accomplished to have made her laugh as she is super shy. Sally is super shy and doesn't really talk to a lot of guys in general.

Both me and John have known Sally since grade 8, when she joined our school. A few months ago, when we're all talking about the past, John made a comment that he used to have a crush on Sally when he was in grade 8. Although, he never mentioned still having a crush on her, it is kinda obvious. I've liked Sally for a few years now, but I haven't really told anyone about it. None of the guys in the group knows that I have a crush on Sally. So there is no way that John knows that I secretly like Sally too.

I and Sally don't talk much, as were both super shy around each other. We have each other on social media (snap, insta, fb) but we never text, and she never likes any of my photos. I tried to text her on snap a few months ago, but she came off as too dry so I just finished the convo, and never talked to her since. I do notice, however, that sometimes she stares at me from the hallway, and she sees most of my stories.

Yesterday at the cafeteria during lunch, Sally was sitting by herself, and I saw John go up to talk to her. Inside, I was super cheesed as he is trying to get the girl I like. Some of my other friends followed John, so I too followed. Sally seemed pretty shy while talking to John, she only smiled a little bit. Like 10 mins later, I left to go talk to my other friends. We were joking around at the other side of the caf. As a joke, I opened the maintenance door and pretended to go inside. From the other side of the room where John and Sally were, I noticed she was staring at me and smiling/laughing. Idk if John noticed this or not.

Should I tell John that I have feelings for Sally, or should I just be silent and let John try to get her. John hasn't admitted to liking Sally now either. Should I try to compete with John, by starting to talk to Sally more? I don't want to ruin my friendship with John, as he is a really nice guy.

I think Sally used to like me a few years ago from stuff that happened. IDK if Sally moved on or secretly still has feelings for me.

TL:DR: Although he hasn't admitted it, one of my closest friends is showing obvious signs that he likes the girl I have a crush on. He doesn't know I like her. He started talking to her more recently, and frequently mentions her name in conversations. What should I do about this? Should I tell him, or compete with him?",19Apr2019,1
690,"So I have been accepted into two colleges, at one school I would earn a bachelor's in Russian and commission into the military after college and the other I would earn an Associates in Paramedic Science and then go be a firefighter-Paramedic. 

I have been working as a FF-EMT for 2 years and I love it but it is at a small department and if I chose to continue in the career field I would want to go to a bigger city and to be a paramedic.

691,"My friend and I are both 18f. Neither of us are “science people” in that we’ve always been better in school at non-scientific subjects; however, I do understand the scientific method and I like to keep myself updated on science as it pertains to my own life, like understanding human health and staying away from scammy pseudoscience. 

Today we were hanging out and she mentioned something about aluminum-free deodorant. I told her I had tried a free sample of aluminum-free deodorant but prefer normal deodorant/antiperspirant, and she said she’d heard that aluminum causes cancer. I pointed out that pretty much everyone uses aluminum for something or other, be it deodorant, or sunscreen, or as a container for food. Her response was something along the lines of “yeah, well, they used to not know smoking was bad, and so everyone did it, but now they know it’s bad so not as many people smoke. And now they’re saying the same thing about aluminum.”

I had a lot more questions/comments/concerns about this claim of hers, but I didn’t want to start an argument, so I changed the subject. When I got home, I looked it up and found that the science of the danger of aluminum is inconclusive, and there isn’t really enough evidence against aluminum to warrant cutting it out of my life. 

Honestly, the anti-aluminum crusade is one of the more benign trends in pseudoscience, but my concern is that my friend is going to a university near the US “Bible belt” later this year. I’ve got nothing inherently against Christians, I am one myself, but that region of the country seems to be where a lot of bizarre “alternative” medicine ideas come from, and I don’t want her to be susceptible to falling for this stuff.

696,"Title to grab your attention. This is a bit long, and not very entertaining I guess. I'm sorry, I really need help and also share my thoughts.

I was pushed down, cut off my own emotions, fallen from grace, condemned to a boring life. The magic vanished, straight through my hands. God said: you work, you sweat, you suffer, for you have sinned.

I thought I'd be special, I thought the world was beautiful and full of wonders. I have felt such joy, such happiness when I was younger. A particular state of mind, not just pure happiness, but a sense of adventure, novelty, discovery, uniqueness, avant garde, state-of-the-art. 

I wanted to be everything! As if I was the first human being to ever exist. This is truly indescribable stuff. I really really thought ""Oh my God. How lucky am I to actually be alive, in this time and age. We are finally free. Human beings are beautiful! Imagine all the super developed countries in the world, all that science, progress, peace, wealth and all that good stuff!"" 

I wanted to travel. I wanted to have experiences, to feel all there is to be felt, to make this life a wonderful adventure (to paraphrase The Great Dictator) Life was a work of art, God's beauty, a place of absolute excitement, imagine that! Everything is made for you! For your own enjoyment! Food, fun, karaoke, parties, music, art, hobbies, paintings, movies, yoga, New York, Japan, bands, concerts, shows, friends, jewelry, unbridled happiness. And then you die. It's cool! It's all good. Already to be able to explore this world is a gift.

This is no longer possible. Progressively my limitations became clear, my family told me I would need money for that. The thing is, it will take time. And sacrifice. Until then, I am already middle aged a middle aged man. I'm 21. 

If I don't have the chance to explore life to it's absolute full potential, then what is the point of living at all? To restrict yourself to a particular lifestyle, to a narrow worldview, on a specific country, on a specific job, to do repetitive things until the day you perish?

701,"Disclaimer: I know this is not that important  (especially compared to other posts on this sub) but it's been on my mind. Anyway, I'll give a tiny bit of background. 

I've been a bit of a loner pretty much all my life. I'm not shy; I can talk to people just fine. The thing is that I matured very quickly and grew tired of having to deal with childish classmates, so I've always just kept to myself. This year, I met a girl (for privacy reasons I'll refer to as Chloe). She's on the spectrum and didn't have many friends, so I tried to be nice to her despite my aloof attitude and impatience with other people. 

The thing is, she started to get a little TOO close. She was exactly the type of person who I try to avoid when looking for potential friends: they ""jokingly"" hit you (way too hard), make fun of you, and talk crap about things you're interested in just to piss you off. So, I started to distance myself from her. This caused her to become even more aggressive in her mannerisms, with her constantly hitting me with wooden drum sticks (very painful in case you didn't know) and berating me in front of other people for attention. Chloe didn't seem to get the message, despite me asking her to stop several times, so I did the only thing I could think of: I started ignoring her. 

Literally, straight up pretending she was invisible. She thought it was a joke at first. However, a few sharp glares from me when she tried to get my attention seemed to get the point across. Soon after, she started ignoring me back. It's pretty clear that she despises me now. I never meant for this to happen, but I don't feel like I should have to apologize. Now I'm afraid that she's gonna report me to a teacher or something, or worse, she could start to suffer from mental health issues.

707,"Hello!

I got my mental health under control, I drink plenty of water, exercise a few times a week, and I am making okay progress towards getting enough sleep... but I absolutely love desserts and fatty things, so I want to eat better now, too.

I know some people where I work who are cutting down on sugar, and they say that they feel better than ever. Is this really what happens? Is it really worth giving up if I love desserts so much? (Loving desserts is almost a part of my personality :p I love cupcakes, cake, ice cream, pie, cookies, brownies, all that stuff). I just want to see if it will really be worth it for me to give it up, like how much does it really help you?

Also over the past few years I have been yet another victim of technology addiction, and it has really been impacting my productivity and happiness in life. I've tried a lot of things for this but nothing seems to work. Ideas?

Thank you in advance ~",19Apr2019,1
708,"AITfor my wife wanting to leave me because I try to console her because she couldn’t catch a Pokémon? So she loves Pokémon go, I play just to spend time with her because she is obsessed. So obsessed she spends actual money for poke balls and raid passes. Anyways we are doing a raid and no one is around them all of a sudden five other cars show up but don’t join the raid. So I join the raid and then so did everyone else. When we started to raid another 10 people showed up. We lost the raid and second group won it. She was super upset saying it wasn’t fair and the game is stupid. So I tell her it’s ok sometimes you get them and sometimes you don’t. She then blames me for joining to early and if I would have waited he could have been in the second group and beat the raid. I told her that not fair for her to say and that it’s just a game. She then processeds to yell at me saying I don’t understand her and she doesn’t want to be with me. We finally come home and she asks for extra boxes so she could start packing.",19Apr2019,1

..since then he has been super distracted. Then yestersay hit me with the whole I need time and space thing.  He is going out to a conference a town over. While he is there he Doesn't want me to contact him. Should I take this personally.? All I want to do is block and delete his number. To move on cause.....my gut says i need to protect myself.
