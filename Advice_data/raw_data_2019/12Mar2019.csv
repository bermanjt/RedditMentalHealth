0,"Hi so I applied to many jobs for one type of store and I got 2 interviews let’s call them Heart and Emery.

I had the heart store interview last tuesday and got the confirmation that I got the job today. I have a interview with Emery tomorrow. I need to make money quickly so I can pay my rent at the end of the month.



Pros and cons 

Heart

- I start probably this week (I can make more money before the end of the month)
- My role is something i’ve done before (low anxiety)
- Early morning role 😓

BUT

- the store only gives people 7.5 contacted hours but it’s rare that you only work those hours the manager said. they give hours out like candy 

Emery

- It’s at a location I know very well
- Having this job AS WELL AS the other one guarantees me at least like 15 hours each week if the case is that I only get my contracted hours and no more
- gives me security if i don’t get enough hours with heart

BUT

- I haven’t actually got the job yet (fairly certain I will)
- I would only get like one or two weeks to earn money which isn’t enough
- could clash with heart as the rota is done sort of randomly 
- i would probably leave the job anyways as I only need lots of hours this month but i’ll be fine other months with whatever im given 


**TLDR** I was offered a job but only contracted 7.5 hours ( they give wayyy more overtime hours anyway apparently so i wouldn’t just be working 7.5) but do I take the risk and stick with that or get a second job

I hope this makes sense, i’m not very coherent with my speech ",12Mar2019,2
1,"My friends and I (group of 7; mixed genders) are having a drinking night tonight. We’re planning on getting seriously wasted and sleeping over. We’re having our group St. Patrick’s Day celebration early because some of us our involved in other St. Patrick’s Day parties with other groups but we wanted to do something together just our group. We have food planned. We have all our drinks purchased. We have Tylenol/ibuprofen and anti-nausea medicine for any next day hangovers. But we haven’t decided on a tv series or movie series to watch yet. We want to play a drinking game that goes along with said series. Listed below are some series we can all agree on:

The number of * indicates how many of the group voted for each series. Each person was allowed three votes in the tv category and three votes the movie category but every series in both category was played by all members before voting

TV SERIES
Arrow*
The 100***
Shadowhunters***
I Am The Night****

Game of Thrones****
Avatar: The Last Airbender**
Teen Wolf*

MOVIE SERIES
Harry Potter******
The Lord of the Rings******
The Maze Runner***
Twilight*

As you can see, a lot of the series are evenly popular. What do you think would be the best series to watch while drinking? Any suggestions not on the list? Do you have any specific drinking games you’d recommend to go along with the movie or series?",12Mar2019,1
2,"this is LONG. i would really appreciate it if you would read it and help me, though. I am feeling so alone lately and just need some one to tell me the facts and what I should do. I don't know how I should feel. It's kind of complicated... but I just hope someone can help.

&amp;#x200B;

For about 2 years, I was best friends with a girl we will call Maya. Maya is introverted and quiet. We had our issues, but we were best friends. Maya would sometimes do things that got on my nerves, like never answer my texts, or leave me on ""read"", or only text me to brag. She would manipulate me a lot. We have so much in common, though. So I just let it pass, even though some things she did made me upset. I was on an emotional roller coaster with her, constantly. Our friendship was toxic for me, but she was just like my twin, so I couldn't let go of her. Like a sibling.

This year, we had no classes together (in school). But, I changed my classes to be with her. And she had already made friends (in 1 month?!) . These friends were fierce, unlike her. They had big mouths. I'm more extroverted than Maya but I am still shy and easy to walk all over, I guess.

I tried to be friends with them and Maya at the same time, but they thought I was ""stealing"" Maya from them, even though I had been friends with Maya for 2 years. Maya didn't take my side in front of them.only when they weren't listening she would tell me that how they were treating me was wrong. But she did nothing to fix it. Overall I was angry, angry at Maya for not taking her ""best friend""'s side. For not helping me in a time of need. I didn't talk to her the next day after her friends basically attacked me. They easily pushed me away from Maya and made her all theirs. She didn't make an effort to keep me close to her. She just went to her other friends. This really hurt me. I thought she would fight more for me. But I guess not. So we stopped being friends.

So I made new friends. 2 girls, one was someone I met that year (Riley), another was my bully (Ava) from 2 years back. I had thought the bully changed so I became friends with her. Eventually I was completely left out in everything with them. For example I'd make plans with Riley and she would invite Ava without telling me. Culturally, they were the same and I am completely different. 

6 months after I stopped being friends with Maya.

I posted something on social media talking about Maya, but not naming her. It was something like ""I miss you, but I don't know how to talk to you. Maybe you will text me if you know this is about you ?"" Maya texted me. She told me she felt like I'd replaced her and missed our friendship. I told her the same. The next day I began sitting with her again. Me and the ""fierce"" friends are cool. We are friends now.

Me, Ava, and Riley are not friends anymore. I left the friend group, and now Ava is my bully again. She yells at me in the hallways calling me the ""b-word"" and cusses me out on text. She tries to break up me and the ""fierce girls"" and come sit with us to stir the pot. I really don't like Ava.

(Oh, and I can't exactly report her either. The only physical thing she's done to me was punch me in the face 2 years ago. I didn't do anything she just punched me. I didn't report her then and I don't think I can report her now about that. Also, she's a teacher's pet. All the teachers like her)

Right now, I have no ""Bestie"". I have a lot of friends, maybe like 10-15 people I consider my friend, but all of them have a #1 best friend other than me. Maya is best friends with one of the fierce girls (Which I don't get, she said she didn't replace me, and missed me? But she is doing everything we used to do with each other with her and not making much of an effort to be friends with me again. I feel like I am the one making all the efforts to be friends with Maya. I always start the conversations) All of my close friends have best friends. Ava and Riley are best friends.

I feel so alone lately. Like nobody REALLY cares about me? I'm nobody's first choice, let alone second. I miss Maya. She's so introverted and quiet, but in reality she is very  manipulative. She told me the other day she's so glad we're friends again, etc. It made me really happy and I felt we had a chance to become best friends again. But today she is with her ""best friend"" doing nothing but talking to her. She's so complicated? Does she really want to be friends with me? Ever since we were best friends I always felt like a... homeless dog? to her. (metaphorically)....

She'll pull me inside and keep me warm and give me food when she wants to but abandon me in the rain the next day. 

Who do I be friends with?! What do I do about this emptiness inside me, like I can't be enough for anyone? It sucks seeing Maya having so much fun with her friend. Seeing all my close friends having that 1 other girl that will be with them through thick and thin... and then realizing that I don't have that.

Is my whole life going to be like this? I'm 14, and I've never had a best friend that is truly loyal to me and stay true to the end. It's always been one sided, where I love my friend so much it consumes me. What about my love life? Am I only going to have relationships where I can only be put second? Where I will never be a priority to anyone? Everything that's going on puts a damper on my self esteem and my hope for the future.

I'm not suicidal, but it makes me want to fall asleep and never wake up again. Forever dreaming, not having to face the reality of being alone.

It would also help if anyone is willing to be friends with me, a person to talk to. A person who won't ditch me .... Thanks for reading this. I'll answer any questions if any of this confused you, because I know it's kind of all over the place.",12Mar2019,1
3,"So there’s this girl in my chemistry lecture that I see all the time.  I also see her in the dining hall sometimes.  She literally takes my breath away, lol as corny as that sounds.  I would love to strike up a conversation with her, but I feel like it would be kinda weird if I just came up to her.  We only have that lecture together, but today was the last day of lecture, so it’s not like I can just sit next to her and get to know her that way, and she seemed focused in the class not really talking or anything anyway.  But yeah, I really feel like I would regret it if I didn’t talk to her.  I’m like 70% sure i’m attractive at least 50% of the time, lol, if that matters.  ",12Mar2019,1
4,"So, last night, my boyfriend and I received and invite to the wedding of one of my good friends. It's scheduled for the 20th of next month, and I told him this and he agreed to go with me. However, this morning, the singer of the band he's in asked about splitting a hotel for a show out of town the same day. My boyfriend had forgotten that there was a show that day and I didn't know that was the day of this particular show. So, now it's a decision of who is going where. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend says I should go to the wedding and he would go to his show, but he would go with me if I really need him to. I'm not entirely comfortable going alone, but it's admittedly more of a want for him to be there to meet my friends and enjoy the day with me. But I don't want him to miss this show either. The band is important to both of us, and I would hate to complicate things for them. I also have been looking forward to this show myself, thus why he's suggesting I go to the wedding. I don't think both are possible considering that we would have to be out of town for one, and on the day of. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've kind of discussed it, but not really. He wanted to wait until later, which I am fine with. But I wanted to get some outside advice on this too. Maybe it will help me or us make a more solid decision. What do you all think? ",12Mar2019,1
5,"There's a guy in one of my classes that I have a crush on and I feel like he probably knows that I do (jury's out on that, however) since I'm not the best at completely hiding that. We usually sit near each other in class and he does look at me almost every time he sees me there and on campus (note: I don't know what this means on his end and I'm trying to not get too wrapped up in what it means other than being aware that i exist haha) but we have not had a full on conversation yet. I really want to talk to him but because of the fear of rejection (and the part where I feel like he might be aware that I have a crush on him doesn't help) makes me reluctant and I'm not the best at starting conversations in general. 

So what are the best ways I should go about talking to him and whatnot? ",12Mar2019,1

16,"My name is Bob( not actual name) I’m a 30 year old Male. And to start I will say I hate talking about my problems, but I need to do something. I suffer from anxiety, severe depression and mild compulsive disorders. I recently suffered a stroke which only made my life worse. Most of my anxiety is social anxiety and for most you may think it’s not that bad. But it has ruined my life and any hope of having a relationship. I am terrible at starting conversations. I clam up instantly and lose any train of thought I have when talked to. I hate being in large groups of people, it makes me super nervous, makes me sweat like crazy, my stress level peaks and I get sick to my stomach to the point of either vomiting or having diarrhea. I don’t know if I should blame my mother for my problems, because she refused to put me and my siblings in a public school until high school or what. 
Pre-school through 8th grade was spent in a private catholic school where there were barely 200 students. Then when I reached high schools I went to a school with well over 1000 students. I was always the tallest, biggest kid around so I did get called plenty of names some fun and some that were beyond rude. I have always been shy and mixed with my anxiety in high school I never talked to anyone or made friends. I always did everything in my power to never have to give a presentation in front of the class. I hated being the center of attention and still do. 
Fast forward to college I did something o never thought I would do, I moved away. I only did it because I had a friend that was going to move with me because he had gotten a job in the same city. First few months were not so bad until one weekend I came home to an empty apartment. My friend had packed up everything he had and left. Only leaving a note for me, no phone call , no heads up. So now I’m living in a huge city with absolutely no friends or family. I hate being alone. I am paranoid so I never left my bedroom unless leaving for class or to work the job I had to get to cover the half of rent that my friend left me covering. After a few weeks my depression got to me. I had multiple break downs. My friends back home said they would come visit me. So for 2 weeks it was what I was looking forward to the most. They never showed up. They never called to say they were not coming. I called them and they said they forgot about it. That hit me hard. I tend to care about what people think about me way too much. After a few more break downs my depression was at an all time low. It felt like no one cared about me, no one called me, no one asked how I was doing. I spent all my time in bed never wanting to leave with darkening thoughts running through my head. I contemplated ending it all. I stuck the sharpest knife I had straight into my wrist, but couldn’t get the strength to pull it up the length of my arm. So I just cried myself to sleep. A few weeks later I thought maybe if all I had to do was make one action to end it all it would be easier. I made a noose and put it around my neck but then I had the thought of my parents finding me hanging dead. So I pulled it off and cried myself to sleep again. I eventually made it through the year and moved back to my home town.
Over the next few years I failed to keep a relationship for more than a month. To this day my longest relationship was 6 months long and I ran as soon as it got too real. I have spent my entire life being told that I am such a great guy and that I will make some girl really happy. But even those who say I’m a great guy, that I am so sweet and deserve a nice girl, wont even give me a chance. Like I said before I am a very tall guy and somewhat heavy set but I have been told I carry my weight well. I finally saw a bright light at the end of the tunnel this girl I worked with , who I had a thing for from the first day I met her, she was married at the time but was now divorced. We shared dark and twisty pasts. We started texting a lot and my feelings grew stronger for her. She was dating a guy though. So I kind of held back. Then I found out she was loving out of state with her boyfriend. I was crushed. Then she got engaged. Which hurt but I was happy for her, she deserved to be happy. One day she removed me from her social media so I took it as a hint and stopped texting her. A few weeks after we stopped texting I suffered a stroke. I still kept from texting her, so I text her best friend in Hope’s that she would let her know. Well she never did. I was scared and alone so I sent a text about a month after my stroke and told her I needed her back in my life. I informed her of my stroke and she helped me cope with things a little. We caught up. I found out she wasn’t that happy, she finally got past her own fears and broke off the engagement and moved back. My heart was beyond happy. I had my dark and twisty best friend back. We blurred our friendship lines and began making out which eventually led to sex. I thought things were heading in the right direction until after one awkward night led to her not coming around anymore and her texts slowly decreasing and then stopping. 

My thoughts are getting dark again and I just needed to get this out there in Hope's of some advice or something. I don't know. I just need to vent I guess.

I’ve liked her for a while, and I used to think I had a chance. But recently I found out she doesn’t feel the same way. 

I have her on Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. Should I delete her from all my social media because I often look through her insta and Facebook pics (I know it’s stalkerish, but I want to stop). 

I’m still going to see her in the halls at school until the school year ends. Should I just ignore her, and pretend not to see her. We don’t talk that often anyways so it’s not like I’m going to start talking to her.

She’s going away for college in September, so I hope I still don’t have feelings for her when’s she’s across the state. If she meets another guy at college, I don’t want to be jealous about it and already by moved on. 

I talk to plenty of girls, and I’ve met very attractive girls, however I still seem to have feelings for the same girl. 

Any tips or tricks to help me get over this long and deadly crush? Thanks

26,"First of all if this is too long I'm so sorry I have no one to talk to and please excuse my poor English ... I'm a girl who had a normal life and I consider my self very average,  had few relationships but I invested in my studies and career ... In terms of beauty I've always had insecurities and body issues specially as a teen. I had a squad and we were equally attractive and get the same attention even though it was never important to me...  Until last year when a new resident jointed us and we quickly clicked as she was very nice to me and showed interest in my company .. I've never noticed how pretty she was specially without makeup until we started going out with her (the two of us as the other girls moved out)...  People on the street would stop to stare at her and we always get chased by guys who wanted to talk to her and get her number (single, in relationships and even married men) her professors and classmates, her facebook and instagram are the proof of how attractive she was, to this level I was very comfortable with the situation and have problems ... But lately we became inseparable like I have my own room but I would spend the nights with her, so we were always together and I often get hurtful comments from people on the street like 
- wow you girls look completely different wth
- the ugly and the gorgeous 
- she's way prettier than you 
- your friend is really hot... 
And it goes on and on I've heard everything that can mess up my mental health, I get ignored in shopping stores when I'm with her, people on the street would go for her for directions and literally anything. We once took a very good picture of me and her (rare case) and I uploaded it as my profile picture, immediately friends requests started to scare me I'm not kidding and everyone is asking me which one are you ? When I answer they automatically delete me or lose interest...  One of them said to me : ""I knew you were that person because the other one wouldn't have the time to answer me she'd be busy with all the attention she must be getting"" I didn't even like any of them but my heart was shuddered and I felt really ugly I had to take off the picture before my friends see it.  It's not over  ... There was this guy who's dying to be with me and really serious about me and told me he loved me since we met at school 5 years ago  but we were in different cities so I was waiting to the perfect moment to make the right decision, this guy is extremely hard to get and very indifferent to girls around him, I've seen girls throwing themselves on him and dying to go on a date with him but he refuses each time and that was the thing that get my attention. Lately my friend changed her facebook account and automatically she's now visible to all my friends as ""someone you may know"" the first day of course she received tons of friend requests one of them is from the guy I never thought would send her a friend request if he didn't know her and I know he didn't. She spent the day complaining about how complete strangers add her on social media .. She asked me if I knew this guy I said yeah old classmate I didn't tell her he's the one I keep telling her about that he loves me and praying that someday we'd be together ,he wasn't the kind of  guys to add random girls but he did eventually ... although I think she suspected it was him...  I felt really humiliated and ugly again in fact now I always feel ugly .
I spend my all my life trying to be the best version of myself PhD student got a job at the university and made my family proud but by the years I discover that looks are the key to a happy easy life..  I get harassed in the streets because I look less pretty than my friend... By the years I get the conclusion that a guy will always love me for my personality and principles and education bla bla bla only because some other hotter girl didn't give him a chance and if so you'd be forgotten in a minute. I've come to the conclusion that my looks are not as secondary as my mom used to tell me. 
The question now is : Should I look for excuses to break up with my gorgeous friend for the health of my mind before I go into severe depression and be done with harassment or should I keep friends with her because being her friend was such an eye opener for me regarding relationships and society standards ?

I haven't told my gf (25F)because i dont want to put all that extra stress on her and i just am very afraid of losing her.

I tried to move back but the crowd was way too tight to move around. So for some stupid reason I kept going with it.. But it did not go on any longer than 5-7 seconds. I touched her rear a bit. I then pushed away because I felt disgusted at what I just did. I feel terrible, every single day it comes back to haunt me. It throws me into a depression. I cheated and disrespected a person whom I love very much. I am not that type of person. I have never cheated or even thought about it while with her.

So she told me that her thyroid problem is largely due to the my family problems and also because I don't seem to stand by her side in viewing that there is any problem with my family.

So this issue has been going on for a few years now, since the day that my parents match make my brother to his wife and I have been telling her that I don't condone what my parents are doing and I have scolded them, talked to them, advice them but they don't seem to listen so I gave up on talking to them about this.

However, my wife still feels affected by this and from time to time she will bring this topic and I have become really irritated when she talks about this issue. I feel frustrated that I have to keep repeating that its not that I dont't stand by her side on this issue but I have already given up talking to my parents about this.

I really like hanging around him, but sometimes im having a hard time with him. I tried to take a step back and keep it cool and when i thought it got better it just went back. I help him alot in things like uni and so forth and he helps me a bit in the gym. The problem is his random acts. He seems to always be irritated when i say sth or confront him in an argument. He gets infuriated very easily. Mind you i am a very relaxed person, so it takes more to unwaver me, so it doesnt really bother me, but it just makes it hard to talk to him. One time i helped with a homework which made him furious again cause the code wasnt working as he wanted to. So when i got him to the solution he smiled and when i told him he needs to work on his negativity, he admitted and looked like it gave him some perspective which made me happy. But now the other day again he lashed out on me saying he cant talk to me or have a man talk because i questioned his thoughts. He was complaining about a friend of his that did not contact him about their planned hanging out together. My friend said his gf is ugly so he doesnt understand why his mate is ditching him for her. He keeps saying life is pain and always seeks to party to probably fill his void or unhappiness about sth. He has a very negative view on life and people. He is a good person, but is kind of broken and acts that way because of things that happened in the past that idk off and because of his personality in general.

I feel like after what happened he stops talking to me, but its not my fault and i dont want to be always the one to reach out yet i want him to realize this. Theres more to the story than i want to write here because it would be too long to read.

I just want to know how to help him have a better view and how to give him some perspective and maybe rethink how he is treating some ppl including me. Cause he has been giving me hatred for reasons i dont understand.

Should i wait till he writes me or should i write him a short message that i dont understand why he behaves like this and why he is always so easily irritated? If its just a day fine, but this quietness after is just weird.

I wish I knew how to have my way around people. Sadly I have a hard time expressing myself or convincing people. If anyone has got an advice on how I can approach him let me know. I would really appreciate some insights or if anyone of you has got a similar problem. Just getting out of peoples way after some problems like this, doesnt seem right to me.

41,"Hello y'all,

I have been dating to someone who is 10 years older than me. I am 19 he is 29. We met on tinder. Been texting on facebook messenger for a month before our first date. Everything went well like bread and butter, We had a lot of first date arrangements but had to cancel many because my family does not know I am gay and dating and they are extremely homophobic. Flashing forward to my first date, my first date was at a coffee shop. I avoided the clicheee dinner dates. The date was longer than 2 hours went very smoothly. Never ran out of topics to talk about. I had to end my date forcefully because they have been calling me 4 times in 5 mins. I told them that I am going to the church. I rushed things and told him lets leave this venue. I chatted with him until I reached the church, had a good eye contact, ended the date, said good bye, gave him cheek kiss (It is the traditions in Latin America), did not lip kiss him and didnt have any sexual activity. The date went overall friendly no romance at all. After that we kept chatting on facebook messenger for like 2 weeks after the date. He lives 2 hours away from where I live. After two weeks he suddenly ghosted me (maybe ditched me) . What should I do about it. This was my first serious dating experience, should I try to get things hot again via texting (he is now away from where I live), I texted him when you will return to the city where I live and didnt answer even though he was online. Was I supposed to have sex with him or at least kissed him, I liked to keep those sweet intimate stuff for later and me more classsy. Any advices for getting things hot again he ghosted me for a week now. I don't want to ruin things up. Does he want to date me, is he playing hard to get tho he is very humble or what other date game he might be playing. Should I keep texting him even if he is not answering but I don't like being any desperate because I am not. Any advice?

43,"Small bit of background, I am 22 and have graduated from a state university in Pennsylvania, USA with a Bachelors degree. However, I have always held doubt that my degree wouldn't necessarily bear the fruit that I anticipated. I am now considering returning to school to study a more technical trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is this: I let my feelings and own passions dictate my university degree, and it has yielded nothing. I don't want to make the same decision again. I need to go into something that I can get a job in, and make decent money. Because of this, I am considering two options: welding or auto restoration.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if one of those sounds more specific and interesting than the other, it is because it is. Personally, I have always enjoyed classic autos and anything old and technical. I only began considering that course path because there are a few schools relatively close to me where I can study it. However, I am concerned my own wants are speaking again. I cant find reliable info on the future outlook or even wages for this type of thing, although I know a few people who do it and make good money at it. A big issue here too is that the schools are much more expensive than just taking courses and being certified in the other option. Hence the reason why I am considering the other one...

&amp;#x200B;

Welding seems like an impartial, logical path to take because of the various methods taught, and the opportunities. However, once again, I do not know how much of a future there is beyond the basic stuff. I am not particularly interested in welding itself, although I want to learn it better just to do some more with personal projects I have. Welding is more of a ""well, I dont like it necessarily, but the money is better than I am making now, so I have to at least consider it."" The cost to train in it is much cheaper than above, but is it really worth it to take that path, even if its cheaper, money-wise?

&amp;#x200B;

I am lost in the decision process, and am spinning my wheels. All I know is, I am pretty damn miserable at my current job, and am eager to get the rest of my life on the road. I don't want to spend an exorbitant amount of money, but I will gladly invest in my future at a good institution if it will benefit me later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I am really asking is, should I allow myself to listen to my heart again, or just go with the easy choice?  ",12Mar2019,1

TLDR: bf has girl over until 4am the one night I was out of town—is he cheating?

My bf of 4.5 years just had a girl over last night while I was out of town. He didn’t know her (only from a few conversations on various uni fb pages), but he had her over for dinner and to record a podcast. I didn’t think much of it because due to some personal health issues, he hasn’t been keeping up with his friends and I thought it was nice that he was finally making irl friends. That was until I came back this morning and heard that she had stayed over until 4am. Now, his sleeping schedule has been a bit nocturnal lately due to aforementioned health issues so I genuinely believe they were maybe just having conversations as people do during the daytime.....I just can’t shake the thought that something went down or that something will go down in the future. I confronted him about it and he just got mad at me for freaking out about “stupid arbitrary social norms” (about people not staying over past, idk, midnight) and tried to make me feel guilty by saying he has no friends. He’s done something similar in the past—texting girls around 1,2,3am and behaving as if that’s a totally normal thing for someone to do when they’re “just friends”. I’ve made it known that I don’t like that behavior, yet what happened last night still happened. 

Idk I just need someone to tell me I’m not overreacting and that this actually is kinda sus. 

Pls offer any advice because at the moment, whenever I get upset about it he makes it seem like I’m being too restrictive and just making up rules for how people should normally behave. ",12Mar2019,1

54,"TL:DR at end

My coworker and I were leaders of a small team in a customer service environment. She struggled a lot with the level of work and it ended up being about a 80/20 split of workload as she just couldn’t wrap her head around accounts, systems, sales, finances etc. 

That was fine, I was happy to do more as I really like and am genuinely good at all that stuff. Even with the workload split that way I still got plenty of time leftover to step up and help our manager with his own work which I was happy to do to showcase my skills to him and learn the managers role. 

But once that manager left it was my coworker that got promoted up to his role as she is a more ‘people person’ whereas I am an admitted introvert. While this sucks and hurts my biggest issue is that I am far more knowledgeable and talented than her and she is already used to having me do most of the work for her. 

How should I approach it when she inevitably needs help balancing an account or analysing a P&amp;L report? Should I help her to look like a team player even though she’ll get the credit or should I let her figure it out on her own which could  lead to problems between us if she expects me to continue doing these jobs without any benefit to myself? 

I’m also worried about the fact that the team members were already coming to me before her promotion complaining about how they were having to explain things to her and help her with basic tasks that were part of her job, which they didn’t see as fair. If they continue having to do this when she’s now in an even higher benefitting position it will cause resentment. Should I try to hide her struggles from them to keep the team happy?

Also how much should I make her actually go into the managers office? Currently she is complaining that it’s lonely and she has no one to talk to in there and keeps coming out to do her work on the shared desk with the rest of us so she can have ‘fun’. I don’t see this as appropriate nor is she going to be able to finally get her head around complex financials if she is being interrupted by customers constantly as she looks like just another frontline worker.

57,"I live in a 2-bedroom apartment outside a major city. It's a homey, wooded neighborhood away from all the hustle and bustle so the area is very quiet, especially at night. However, the floors, walls, and ceilings are fairly thin and I can hear all the happenings in the building. I have a corner room, so I know for sure it's either my upstairs or my downstairs neighbor doing the moaning. The problem is that I don't know which one it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually hear a few moans in the morning and a few at night. Definitely human, my neighbors don't have pets. When I first moved in, I just thought it was a couple who lived above or below me gettin' it on. No big deal, do your thing, I'm happy for your sex life. But after a few weeks, I met my neighbors and am 99% sure that there are no couples living above or below me - just two pairs of roommates above (males) and below (female) me.

&amp;#x200B;

The moans are ambiguous in tone and could either be a male or low female moan. I have 3 theories:

1. My neighbor is constantly in pain
2. My neighbor likes to please themself loudly and often
3. My neighbor lives with a significant other AND a roommate, and I've just never seen or met the significant other

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, it's been 6 months and I'm pretty annoyed about hearing the moaning literally EVERY morning and EVERY night. But I don't know what to do because I DON'T KNOW WHICH NEIGHBOR IS MOANING. If I approach either of my neighbors, there's a chance it's the other neighbor and not them, which would make an already-uncomfortable situation even worse. And if I complain to the landlord about it, both neighbors will know that I was the one complaining because it's a 3 story building and I'm on the second floor sandwiched between them.

59,"Now I know I have the majority culpability here.
I know that I should have thought this out more so I know my Fault.  Part of it is I didn’t know this could happen so I didn’t intentionally lie but still here we are 

 just asking advice
I’m not a cop or loss prevention or investigator btw

Not giving exactly what my job is 
but informed my boss on a situation that happened where I had to talk to two juvenile teen girls about a situation that one of them caused.
Minor situation but situation none the less that needed a cop just to be there. 

So reason why both needed to be talked to was that the girl that did not  cause the situation was within 2 feet of the other girl but looking off.  And I mean 2 feet Away.

Now do I think she knew...of course she did...they were together for an hour walking around on video. But on video she is looking away so other girl got named the subject. Girl 2 just got let go cause she said she “didn’t know” and She  while we were talking to the girl stayed cause she didn’t want to leave her friend.


So after informing boss what happened he told me I should not have spoken/detained both girls. I did not detain them. And I still do this day do not know why he is saying this. I said she was right there and wouldn’t leave. He says well she wasn’t the subject. I said ok still perplexed. She was a extremely close Witness

But since I’m or now was a high performer, mistakes happen  ok I’m at fault here.  i said ok well if I shouldn’t have, I’m sorry I’ll take the write up or Whatever the ramification.


So then he tells me well since it’s on video you talking to both write the other girls info into The report and you’ll be ok.

So I write the report and girl 2
Has her info added.

And here is the outcome I did not know.

Her parent calls the office today and says a law office wants $150 restitution cause she was named an additional suspect. 

Now I feel like a fucking idiot for not realizing what he told me was wrong and a lie but truthfully I didn’t realize this would happen. I thought her info being added was for OUR records only. And she wasn’t named as the subject either in my Report. Is there a chance
By looking at the video they are asking for restitution anyway? Yes a small chance but I think because she was added to the report they are calling her subject 2

So I tell boss this and now he says he DID NOT tell me to do that (I do have a witness who heard it as well but I have no idea if he would help me)
But that he will call the dad and try to work it out with the restitution 

So yes I know  I stupidly falsified information by following orders and not knowing the outcome. Which again I know isn’t an excuse. But I truthfully did not know my
Report would lead to that.


So I’m assuming he is also gonna try to talk to the parent to cover his own ass tomorrow as
Well....but if it doesn’t work I know the hammer will come on me cause I wrote it.

So looking for any advice? 

I know my fault but what about him do you think ?
Anything? I know if I’m fired they will interview me and hell yeah I’ll accept my stupidity but I’m also gonna say what he told me to do.

Aside from that.....There is a second scenario where I do know of my boss doing some things in his OWN reports Where he should not of.  I kept it to myself though because they were his and his alone reports and if he got in trouble it’s only on him. 

Have I whistle-blown him? No and I know I probably should have  (apparently I’m a doormat)
But I have reported illegal behavior before
 for another company and it made my life a living hell. Not an excuse but the truth.

And I’ll be honest I figured if someone
Catches my current boss it’s on him along 

So aside from my own blatant Stupidity any advice?

When asked in upcoming interviews what should I say when asked why I am no longer employed at this company? I know it’s not proper to say “My boss was a drunk and I didn’t want to work there anymore.” There has to be a more eloquent way to phrase this.",12Mar2019,1
61,"I’m a teenager, but my feelings are there nevertheless. I met this boy a year ago during a musical production my school was putting on. I was a freshman, he was a junior. Now I’m a sophomore and he’s a senior. We instantly had chemistry together and it was great. Except one thing...he has a girlfriend. 
His girlfriend lives two hours away but she’s still there. 

But that hasn’t stopped me from getting close with him. He’s one of my best friends actually. The only problem is that I’m in love with him (He knows my feelings. I’ve told him before) and it’s really hard for me.  Not only because he has a girlfriend and I can’t have him, but also the fact that we both agreed that if we’d met at the right time, we would have been great together (we aren’t dating on the side, I just have feelings for him). Also the fact that he’s graduating soon. 

He’s really important to me, not just as a crush but as a best friend. He knows a lot about me and he cares about me. But it’s just so taxing emotionally. Because when his girlfriend comes to see him I have to watch them be all lovey. And then I get upset because I’m emotional as it is, and tend to distance myself. Which he freaks out about. 

Last night was our last show together, and I kind of told him that maybe we should say our goodbyes. And he got really scared and upset. It wasn’t me trying to get him to fight for me, but I’m just really confused on what to do. We haven’t really talked today, but I miss texting him really bad and it’s only been like 24 hours since our last conversation. I think he’s waiting for me to text first because of what I said about saying goodbye, but I don’t know if I should. Because I want to get over him, but I think that means that I have to cut him out completely...

Teen drama, am I right? Kind of petty, I know. 


TL;DR:  -In love with a boy who has a girlfriend 
                -Boy happens to be one of my best friends 
                -Don’t know if I should end our friendship

62,"For my specific case:

The job was posted for a research associate preferably a post doctoral researcher or a PhD candidate.

Ya, my ass has a BS (not bull shit) degree in biology and I graduated in 2017 and have been unemployed for 6 months after my internship ended back in the summer. 

LUCKY FOR ME my undergraduate research was right in line with the work they’re doing and my internship prepared me for project management.  so they took me for two interviews, both went really well. 

But then..... I got asked the salary question.  

“And what are you looking for for a salary” 

I managed to pull together some bullshit and say “well I need to do research on the cost of living in the area (I’m states away from the job) before I’m confident to talk about salary” 

PHEW bought some time.  But I know it will come back up. 


So, on the job posting they posted it would be salaried between 50-70k.  Awesome pay for two year removed college graduate.  That’s still a huge gap.  But then I didn’t get my PhD which is what they had in their job posting... so do I qualify to make that much?  I’d be doing the same work.. but I don’t have the same amount of education.  


I don’t want to aim too high and look like an asshole.  And I don’t want to aim low and be taken advantage of.  I value myself and the skills I bring to the table.  I think I’m an incredible addition to their team.   

Any advice for navigating this question in an interview? Not just for this situation but honestly any time it comes up? 


Here’s hoping to no longer being unemployed!

63,"Hi all, I'm sure this is an odd question/place to ask it, but I'm a bit lost as to where to turn to. I am part of a closed group on Facebook that keeps getting taken down. We are a very close knit group (about 8k of us or so) and each time we try to make a new group, we get taken down. Now, you'd think it's probably because we're some racist, homophobic group that keeps posting about how great Hitler was or something, but we're just a group of girls and LGBTQ individuals who share memes. That's it. In our first group there was a few 'men are trash' posts which are what got us zucc'd originally, but since then we have been super careful (not reporting posts, changing admins and group names, etc.) but it keeps happening. The groups are usually up from anywhere from 1 week to 2 months before they get zucc'd. I know that this doesn't seem like a big issue in the grand scheme of things, but it is genuinely upsetting when we keeping seeing the awful things that get said around Facebook that are apparently not an issue, when our friendly and extremely supportive group is quite clearly being targeted.  I don't want to be that person going around screaming ""misogyny"" but that is very much what it feels like from our perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my question: does anybody have any ideas about alternative sites/platforms we could use, or even an idea how hard it would be to create a website that would replicate the features of a Facebook group? Currently it's looking like a Discord server is our best option, but I'm open to any better suggestions. Some features that we'd need/like to have include:

&amp;#x200B;

* Ability to be modded/admined by multiple people
* Closed group (either invite-only or application, whatever)
* The ability to post memes/images/text/etc.
* A facebook feed type of feature or similar
* Ideally, Facebook integration for accounts (either log-in with facebook, or link it, I'm not too sure of the specifics of how that works)
* Likes/reactions and commenting
* Tagging feature
* Ideally (but not at all important) badges

&amp;#x200B;

If anybody has any ideas it would be very much appreciated, thank you :) ",12Mar2019,2
64,"So for context I meet her at work and then messaged her. We ended up talking for hours at the restaurant. We talk a lot about everything. Whenever we would hang out we would both loose track of time talking for hours and she really enjoyed it. she was very out about a lot of stuff and is very open. Which lead to her saying she doesn't date but she didn't give a reason. We would still hang out and nothing really change we would cuddle while talking and watching TV. After a bit she mentioned how I was a great friend, after which I looked extremely depressed. After seeing this she went on to say she still has me over and basically that I'm not in the friendzone, but adds she doesn't want to date right now. That same day because we literally continued to stay up till the sun started to rise she offered to let me spend the night to which she offered to let me sleep in the same bed as her but we basically passed out right away. she has had some trauma with dating back in high school and she's had issues with depression a couple years ago. I have told her I want to talk about what she means by not wanting to date, but i just can't stop thinking about it. I don't know want to do and its starting to affect my concentration and emotions.

66,"To understand how I don’t know what to do I have to provide the full story.
 About a year and a half a ago or two years ago ( two grades ago in school), I met this girl who was a a friend of my friend, I immediately thought she was cute but not much else. I’m a nice guy so I just said hi and kept my thoughts to myself since I’ve never really just been one to ask out girls. Summer passed and it’s a new school year and this same girl is in one of my classes, still as attractive as ever. I start talking to her in class but it never amounted to more than just a classmate asking or commenting on something. One day on her Snapchat story she says “SnapBack” (to talk obviously) and since I had a good feeling about her I started talking to her. We had a nice conversation where I made some jokes and we talked and at some point I was joking and was like “I’ll kill myself if you want to” (I know I’m an idiot, I was just nervous) so since we were in that joking sense she was like “yea do It”. Some being the genius that I am I thought it would be hilarious to say okay I will then ignore her the rest of the night as if I did (I know now this was a stupid thing to do). At some point she was like wait, is he actually going to kill himself? Then my phone proceeded with texts from her telling me not to and how it was a joke. I eventually called off the joke since I realized it wasn’t really a joke and I told her that and how I was sorry. She was obviously very mad at me and was ready to hate me for the rest of her life. Since I obviously didn’t want that, I tried restarting the conversation as if we just met kinda like stuff you’d see in the movies. It didn’t work and she was really mad. I liked her and didn’t want it to be all gone that fast so I started texting her these “lyrics"" so a “song” I was making up on the spot. It was just a song about her filled with compliments and obvious flirtatious signs. She read it and told me to keep going, so I did. At the end of it she told me how that was actually nice and how I was a nice person. Our conversation then continued and it was obvious to her that I liked her but we never flat out said it. She asked me if I’ve ever done stuff like that with another girl and I haven’t so I was honest with her and we talked in a way ( at least to me ) meant that now she was somewhat interested in being with me. Our conversation ended and I was happy with what I’ve done. 

The following months her and I would talk constantly, before school, during school, and after school for hours, and not just flirty text stuff, on the phone for hours, real conversations not just both of us being dry and trying to keep the conversation alive. It was very clear to my friends and her friends that I really liked her, but since I technically haven’t told her that I did, I would deny it. I don’t know if I loved her to be honest, but it would’ve been the closest thing. It wasn’t even about me thinking she was cute anymore, I genuinely thought she was an amazing person, incredible sense of humour, generous, kind, smart, beautiful, and just great to talk to. I loved talking to her, it would brighten my day and ( to me at least) it seemed like she did as well. So that was our “relationship”, just clear feelings and no one said a word, until Christmas. We would talk everyday for hours so when Christmas break came and she just suddenly stopped talking to me I found it weird. I initially just thought something may have happened in her family and she wasn’t really in the talking mood so I was kinda fine with that so I made sure to tell her I hope everything was fine. Eventually she gets back to me and tells me she just really wanted to focus on her family this Christmas,. I immediately knew that couldn’t have been the real reason but I had no reason to call her out so I just said that’s fine. A couple of days later I get a text from her friend asking me if I liked her, since I didn’t really want to talk about that I just said that’s between her and I, so she ends up texting me as well. She asked me if I liked her and me confused I didn’t know what to do, she probably could’ve told I did and there’s no way she wouldn’t have noticed it so I figured out that she was hoping that I didn’t. I told her no and it was kind of a big relief for her, I felt terrible. She told me that that would’ve been weird and she’s happy the way we were. 

We eventually started talking less and I could tell we weren’t the same kind of friends we were. Even though I liked her and wanted to be with her, she turned into one of my best friends and it was horrible to see our “relationship” slowly decrease. Eventually she started talking more with the “popular” kids, and don’t get me wrong, I’m somewhat popular, people know me and I’m friends with everyone, but you know how there’s a different group of kids and they’re just “popular”, well that’s who she would talk with more. I saw her actively change into a different person around these people and I wasn’t really sure how I felt about that. Eventually we stopped texting and talking in the halls (hell sometimes it seems like she doesn’t even want to make eye contact with me) but when we had class together we would talk the same and it was just nice to talk to her. Fast forward to now ( a grade later) and things are the same, we just talk in class and the only times we Text is when I find an excuse to talk to her. She’s different in some ways, she’s more “popular” and is friends with some of the “thots” in my school who I don’t think are the best people to be friends with. She just does different stuff, and it’s not the fact that she changed a bit, everyone does, it’s the fact that I feel like most of if is an act she plays in front of certain people. I also recently found out that she asked out a close friend of mine who’s been in our class all this time, my friend rejected her and she hasn’t (at least from what I know) done more advances. What sort of bums me out though is that she has talked to him kind of in the way we would. I know I’m getting in my own head but i would just not like it at all if she got together with somebody especially with my friend. On that point as well, I know she talks to other guys and I don’t exactly know if she’s going to date someone but it especially sucks when some of the guys she talks to are people from other schools and I just feel like I’m out of the loop since I don’t know who it is and how much they talk. Keeping in mind all of that I still think I may “love” her and I want to be with her but I also really want our friendship back. 

So to me I don’t know if I should just lay it all out on the line and say what I feel and ask her out, I don’t know if I should tell her just the facts and say everything that I think about her and just say that I just wanted to tell her this and if she feels the same way great, if not let’s be friends, and I don’t know if should even risk our friendship. All I know is that I care for this girl very much and I miss our friendship even though I very much want to be more, and I don’t want to bear any more time the way we currently are.

68,"So on top of being the anxious, stressed and suicidal ball I've been these past months I went through a traumatic life event recently. An event which I've now come to realize I didn't deal with. I applied my anxiety coping methods, distraction and redirection, to my grief and now it's hitting me pretty hard. 

The problem is that I'm on vacation right now with a friend. The first week was great and amazing but now I'm struggling to just avoid crying or having panic attacks, and all this has stirred up my preexisting issues so I can no longer tell what I need and what my anxiety wants. 

I would like to go home, which is financially doable and only a 3 hour plane ride away. I want to be in my apartment safe in private so I can work on these feelings as I need to and so I can talk to my family without fear of disturbing my friend or hotel guests. 

However, with my anxiety in the past my unhealthy coping skill was running away. I fear that's all I'm doing here. 

After a really rough day yesterday I finally managed to express most of what was bothering me in a coherent way to my friend. So at this point I don't think he will be thrilled but he would understand. 

Honestly, sometimes I think I can manage to stick it out but then something small triggers me and I'm back to square 1. Plus, it slightly terrifies me that after this trip I would only have 6 hours to myself before having to go back to my high stress job.

My mom saw a doctor and was prescribed Xanax and she’s showing signs of withdrawal which I’m afraid might lead to addiction.

  My sister is leaving for college soon leaving me stuck home with my parents. My dad refused to see a doctor and this causes his to release stress on me and my sister + the fact that my mom might get addicted. I’ve been trying to talk to them about my potential mental heath condition and they keep saying “you have no reason to be sad” and shit like that.

I want to hear what you guys have done to quit drinking because I want to break this cycle and live a healthier lifestyle for not only myself but my family. This shit makes me feel like I’m letting everyone around me down and that I cannot be alone. Thanks in advance. ,12Mar2019,2

He does know a lot more than I do and all I want is to learn from him, but he doesn't seem to be interested in teaching me. He's taught another coworker before I got hired at this company, so I tried asking him to teach me what he taught the other guy. He keeps saying he's busy.

She claims that practice exams are good for practicing for exams but literally so much is either not included or many things on it are simply taken off once I see the test. All my other classes are straight forward. Review lecture slides, teacher hints what will be on test during lectures, review by using practice exams for each unit. But this teachers philosophy is im gonna give you a crap ton of “vague objectives” and your responsible for predicting what the problem will look like and which ones will actually be tested on. 

Like you’d think after studied 14+ hours for one test I’d have mastered and self learned all the material. But apparently not. She managed to stress things that weren’t stressed in practice exams and I ended up focusing on things that didn’t even show. So now I’m gonna be left with a grade that doesn’t accurately depict my abilities. Why is she such an asshole? Why do teachers do this? As if we gain anything from this extra obstacle of learning the material.

100,"So, straight off, I am financially dependent on my boyfriend. He pays for home and half of my school (4 year college). I have about 4 semesters left. I KNOW I won't graduate without that support. But I no longer love him. 

We've been together 8 years. 3 years in, he abused me sporadically (sexually, and very rarely physically) and he cheated on me repeatedly for 3 years. He still is emotionally abusive but it is less common. Through out this I still loved him. But no longer. 

Keeping it short: my family is either unsupportive, abusive, abandoned me, and generally crap. So even he kind of feels like better support.

I made a friend that I could talk to. He was fun to be around. I eventually liked him more and more. He has a girlfriend. I knew it wouldn't go anywhere but I wanted to tell him how I felt. He said he was sorry but he loved her. I told him I understood and figured as much. I didn't expect to feel so heartbroken though. 

I feel like I have nothing in this world. I feel all alone and not good enough for anything or anyone. I don't want to keep living and existing with my boyfriend for two more years until I graduate. I want out and there is no out. ",12Mar2019,1
101,"I apologize in advance for formatting because I’m on mobile and if this is long. Regardless, buckle up because it’s probably gonna be a ride. Throwaway after any comments I may get stop coming through.

Here’s some backstory: I’m a 16 year old boy living in Ohio with my mom, stepdad, little brother, and little sister. I’ve live with them since the start of my 6th grade year, I’m a sophomore now. 

I believe my mother is manipulative. We’ve had money issues, and she smokes cigarettes and only drinks Coca-Cola. She doesn’t work and finds any excuse to not get a job, and my stepdad can’t support us all without troubles. They constantly fight and he’s cheated on my mom up into the 30’s. Anyways, I think my mom is manipulative because whenever she can’t buy cigarettes or coke and asks me to, I always say no... at first. She pulls the “I’ll remember that next time you ask me for something” card or the classic “I birthed you so you have to listen to me”. I always cave in to prevent groundings and such like that. This has been the regular since I moved when I was 11. She smokes in the house, around us, around the animals, and in the car. It was embarrassing as fuck when we picked up my girlfriend to get dropped off for a date and she was smoking without a care for anyone else and clearly herself. She rolls the window down a tiny bit and acts like it’s the vacuum of space and would suck all the smoke out but it only goes back into my face or that of my siblings. Whenever I’ve talked about moving in with my dad, she pulls a sad face and convinced me not to go. They always promise that things will get better but they never actually do. Countless times I’ve had to cancel my plans that I’ve had for weeks because something they wanna do comes up. Here’s why I’m considering any possible legal action:

This house is fucking filthy and it has been for the last 9 months. We haven’t had clean dishes since then. Dinner pretty much every night is restaurant food. There are pizza boxes and other awful and horrid smelling garbage everywhere. There are mice, roaches, maggots, and the dogs and cats have had fleas for the last two years that haven’t been properly taken care of. We have a male and female dog and the female is normal sized while the male is a large breed so obviously we can’t have her getting pregnant because they’re not spayed and neutered. So for the last two months ever since she went into heat, we’ve been keeping them apart. (SHE is a damn German Shepard) our girl dog has been in a tiny bathroom for up to 16 hours a day most days (and a whole day today, which pushed me to the edge beyond reason. I plan on arguing to hell when I’m done with this post) my mom is always asleep. No excuse for her to be locked up that long when my mother is home all day every day. She was originally my dog, but I admitted that I couldn’t handle the responsibility so my mom said that she’d take care of her. She hasn’t. The girl dog was never properly potty trained and is in that 4x3 (rough guess) bathroom all day with her poop and pee on the floor, so fucking thick that I wasn’t even able to scrape it off. There’s probably more I’m forgetting because of how fucking angry I am right now. Our big dog has had fleas for a year and a half and is always scratching. He’s losing fur and has sores everywhere and never gets the attention he needs and deserves because he hasn’t had a bath in just as long. We can’t even feed them sometimes. The cats are basically going through the same thing with the fleas and losing their fur and getting blistered lips as well. 
There are stains on the carpet too. I’ve been sleeping on a couch since last June. My brother and sister have been sleeping in my mom and stepdads back room for the entire school year, either on the same mattress or some ottoman thing. 
This house smells awful if it wasn’t obvious. 
I hate myself and everything because of how I live. None of my friends or my girlfriend know where I live. I didn’t even let my dad come inside when he wanted to help take in my weight bench.
The grass hasn’t been cut in so damn long and there’s garbage all over the backyard. There’s mold all over the kitchen.
I think this is it. If this gets any attention I’ll post updates.
Thank you",12Mar2019,2

103,"So I’m not sure what to do. I just finished interning with a great company that I really like. I got an offer recently to join them full time as well so I was feeling very excited about that.

The problem is, we had to turn in our laptop bags today, and I accidentally left a few condoms and some lube in an envelope in the bag.

I bought the condoms because my girlfriend was coming back from school and I left them in my car. I had to drive everyone to lunch one day and I didn’t want them to see so I threw them in my bag. I obviously forgot to take them out.

Do you think they will revoke my offer? Should I call someone? Just ignore it? My gut instinct is to just ignore it and hope someone in the IT department just threw them away. This is a larger company, and they’re rather progressive, so I honestly doubt anyone would be upset. To my knowledge, this isn’t something that is explicitly against any terms of employment or anything like that...

Mind you, I was once one of the smartest in my class, and at times still am. All of my grades are a 95 or above, except my science grade has dropped greatly, all the way to a 77.

I already had a conference with her, and nothing has been done. A huge issue that I’ve noticed is that when I talk to her, nothing is done because she won’t listen to me because I’m a “kid”. 

She listens during conferences when a change has to be made, and she LIES in front of our faces, because she knows that I tend to be quiet, or keep to myself, so I don’t speak out about the fact that she’s lying.

I wondered if I was developing feelings for her for weeks, but ultimately decided I loved the friendship we already had and I was more than happy with that. I didn't want to risk ruining anything if she didn't feel the same.



Fast forward to about 2 days ago, where she suddenly confessed to me that she had very strong feelings for me. I was surprised and even replied that I still had feelings as well (which is true), but since then she's expressed that she feels like she's ruined everything and gets anxious talking to me when before, talking to me was enough to help her with her anxiety. So now it's the opposite.



From what she tells me, she's kind of been a mess in this area because in the past, people have betrayed her trust or used things she confessed against her multiple times. She mentioned one former friend who liked her, but when she didn't reciprocate those feelings, that friend turned all of her at-the-time friends against her which literally made her friend-less.



I was just hoping for advice so that I can help her, because I hate seeing her this way and I feel like I can do more. I've already promised that I'm not like the people in her past and I'll prove it, and I've assured her that I don't think any different or less of her since she confessed... any advice as to what I can do or say to help her would be greatly appreciated.

114,"Hey so I’m a little confused at this situation here. 

For some backstory I’m 18 and in college. 

So my roomate asked me one night if was interested in going to a 18+ rave/club with him and his friends. Seeing as how I just transferred in, I was in dire need to meet new people so I decided to go. The place in question IDs everyone as they enter and of course only serves people over 21. The bouncers make it painfully obvious if your under 21 (sharpie markings on your hands). Knowing this in advance the group I went with decided to drink a lot before walking over there. 

Once we got there things were pretty good. We danced, had fun. Me being in my then drunken state, got separated from everyone and I was just dancing by myself with a group of strangers. There was this older guy (at least 45) and another person who was at least 21 (drink in hand, no marks). Not even knowing them we all just danced. Somehow we all just got together, locking arms and such. The older guy starts to grab my dick through my jeans, this happened multiple times. I mean in hindsight I’m not really surprised. Here’s this 40 something guy, gray hair, wearing a “who’s your daddy” t-shirt at an 18+ night. Anyways the other guy got close and started making out with me, like heavily.  Full on ear biting, sticking his hands down my back, biting my neck. The older guy even got in it as well. I was into it, most likely because I was intoxicated, but still I liked it. I eventually break off, he added me on snap, and we go our separate ways. It must have been like 5 minutes later and I run into them again with the guy grinding on the older dude. Somehow they break from each other and I’m front of the guy I just made out with. I don’t know why but I leaned in and kissed his neck, maybe trying to spark something. He then got visibly disgusted by this and responded by saying “I’ve moved on” and proceeded to grind on the “who’s your daddy” t-shirt guy. I apologized to him and instantly felt really guilty/embarrassed. I didn’t see him after that and my group I came with eventually left.

124,"Fair warning, this involves a bit of backstory;


My extended family is pretty close. There’s about 11 of us cousins, all similar enough in age, and all raised in the same city seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. I’m the oldest cousin (20M) of the eleven, older enough to feel a bit of seniority between my cousins, but not old enough to feel disconnected from them, though the ones closest to my age are who I’m the closest to. We all love to hang out and always have since we were kids. Our families even take vacations every two years and enjoy every second of time we get to spend together. However, things started to change after one of my uncles got divorced.


My biological uncle and aunt (now removed from the family) have three kids. Their oldest (let’s call him Justin for this) is four years younger than me (16M) and is pretty close to me. He has two younger sisters (14 &amp;amp;amp; 13), though the age/gender difference makes it harder for me to be as close to them. When my uncle and aunt got divorced, they split custody as expected and though it wasn’t an easy experience for my cousins, we thought it wouldn’t change the family dynamic too much.


However, Justin began showing signs of resentment towards his dad (my biological uncle). It started off with him not staying at his house as much, but still keeping contact. But as time went by, things began to get worse. He had always been kind of a momma’s boy, but we never expected to this extent. It’s been about 4 years since their divorce, and Justin hasn’t stayed at his dad’s house for 2 years. He now only sees him during family holidays, and even when he does he barely speaks to my uncle. It got to a point where Justin skipped out on the last family vacation, which were some of the happiest memories I had growing up, simply because it involved staying a week with his dad. To make matters even worse, his youngest sister now refuses to go to my uncle’s house, and I think that either him or my aunt have some part in that decision.


On top of that, I know the reason why Justin’s parents got divorced. My aunt cheated on my uncle. She’s the reason for their split and it’s obvious Justin doesn’t know that, otherwise I doubt he’d be treating his dad in such a way. My uncle won’t tell him either, at least not yet, because he’s trying to take the high road and hopes that his kids will come back without such a bombshell being dropped on their lives and them turning on their mom. But it’s heartbreaking for my uncle to see his own kids turn away from him because of something that wasn’t even his fault. 


Still, I would like to point out that I don’t know exactly what their family dynamic was like before the split. I don’t know how my uncle or aunt treated their kids, and how the kids thought of their parents. I do know some bits of their parenting style after the divorce, however from a more biased source (my parents). 


My aunt remarried almost immediately after the divorce, to a rich older guy. I’ve heard she’s been known to spoil Justin and the girls, but I don’t know to what extent. Her marrying this rich man certainly makes it easy to do so. I’ve also heard she says nasty things about their dad to her kids. I’ve never heard any specific examples, but I know of my cousins had shown my uncle some nasty texts that she’s sent about him, which is sad to hear. 


My uncle waited to start dating again. He got married a year and a half ago, but didn’t want to rush into anything (I think for the kids sake). I know he’s not one to spoil the kids, but I also think he may have been the one to lay the hammer down when they did something wrong. He’s a clown at heart, but I’ve seen him raise his voice from time to time.


Anyways, I haven’t talked to Justin to ask why he hates his dad. He could’ve before the divorce and just used it as an out. He could’ve hated him afterwards because he thought his dad was at fault. I know he was a momma’s boy, so his mom could’ve easily taken advantage of that favoritism to “turn him against his dad”. But because it’s such a touchy subject, I have not had the confidence to be able to approach Justin about this whole situation. The only reason I know he even hates his dad is because one of his sisters told me. 


Regardless though, I’ve tried my best to keep Justin connected with the family. I text him when we’re having family events to make sure he’s coming. I’ve picked him up from school and hung out before he got his license. I try my best to have fun whenever I’m around him. Even though Justin has lost all respect for his dad, he still is eager to hang out with me and the rest of our family, which is good to some extent. I’ve also been told by my parents that my uncle really appreciates me keeping contact, and thinks I’m part of the reason Justin keeps showing up to our family gatherings. As flattering as that is, it puts me in a tight spot.


My parents think this’ll end someday, but I’m not seeing any signs yet. It’s been four years, and each year it’s gotten worse for my uncle. I feel awful for his situation and really want to help, but I also don’t want to overstep any boundaries, especially because this is such a sensitive subject. I don’t know whether to confront Justin about this, and if I do, what do I say? I feel like he hasn’t had anyone to talk to about this whole situation, and I want him to be able to open up. But I also don’t want to lose him because I went too far, and lose that last connection my uncle (and rest of the family) has with him. 


I know this is complicated, but any advice would be appreciated.

125,"My SO (30F) has been working at a place that doesn't really fulfill her, personally, economically or otherwise. In the last few days, she received two offers and needs to pick one... urgently.

Option 1: My aunt has a flower shop managed by a good family friend until recently. He wants to quit now and my SO has been considered for the job, starting in May. This job would probably require both of us to move into the apartment located above the shop. Economically, this would be a huge boost for her, and also it would give her flexibility to start a master's she is interested in, and to take a few days off from time to time, too. Also, it would give her the opportunity to sell her paintings in the shop (she has a bachelor's degree in visual arts), which is something she has sort of abandoned in the last few years and would love to return to.

Option 2: She applied for a job as a coordinator at a public institution for psychology (she also has a bachelor's in psychology, lol), and today she got a call from the office after she had thought that they had probably taken someone else. It would make sense careerwise to take this job, as it would open doors to future job opportunities in the public sector. She believes it is also a good option because she thinks she still has a lot to learn, and this job would allow her to design actual policies and do a lot of good within the community. On the other hand, the economic factor isn't that good, as she would barely make more money than currently, and only about half the money of option 1. This option wouldn't require us to move, but she would be dependent upon the car, driving into the city center and out of it at peak hours 5 days a week. She has to go to this place tomorrow in the morning and start as soon as possible.

Any advice is welcome, we are looking for neutral points of view.

131,"I am in a dilemma currently as I am about to graduate college. I have two options: find a job in a different city or come home to live with my parents. (Our family dynamics are different, this isn't frowned upon in our culture)  


If I stay home, I'll still make money as I can do freelancing, however, I won't necessarily be getting the job experience. I have a plan to go abroad for my masters so I won't be at home permanently, maybe just for a year. However, If I stay home and keep doing freelancing (which is sort of a non-stable source of income) and then I am not able to make it to a grad school, it will be hard for me to find a job. I'd have to move to another city on my own expense, and then waste time and resources as well as finances waiting for a new job, which might never come.  


On the other hand, if I find a job right now, it will be easier as I am still in university and won't have a lot of problems. But I will be away from home.  


The reason I want to be at home is because of my parents. They're getting old and don't feel well. And I haven't spent a lot of time with them lately. The last 4 years, I was at university. If I spend another year away for job then go abroad for my masters, chances are I might never meet them again.

About 6 months ago, i met my current German girlfriend who has a temporary job in China (like me) and she is possibly the most amazing girl i've ever dated. However, she is going back to Berlin this month to start going to college. (

  
A little over a year ago, i broke up with my ex girlfriend who i had known since high school, and we had practically been in a long distance relationship for 6 years as we had worked in different countries and we saw each other about 3 times a year (it sounds fucking crazy i know). In the beginning we promised to settle down together but in the end, everything went down to shit because she decided that she did not want to leave her job and i did not want to leave my job in China which i had just started at the time. 

  
I am thinking of going to grad school in Germany when my contract runs out in 6 months time and my girlfriend is supportive of the idea. I am thinking of making a leap of faith because the last time i didn't do it, it ended up in a heart break and till this day i still feel sorry to my ex that i did not do it for her.   
How do i know if it is a good decision to move halfway across the world to be with someone even though the odds are stacked against you? 

* I do not speak the language.
* I am quitting a well-paying profession to go back to school and the cost of living in germany will most likely take up a huge chunk of my savings that i have accumulated during my working years.

153,"I (17m) am a swing player (JV and Varsity) for my lacrosse team. I was sick last week with the flu, a terrible wet cough, and diarrhea. Of course I could not go to practice, my coaches understood and I had other sick teammates as well. No biggie. On Friday, the day before game day, I had seen some improvement in my health and was keeping most of my food down. It was pretty rough, my skills were dull from the break but I felt like I needed to prove myself to my teammates just with my presence. Then came the day of the game. I am a midfielder. If you don’t know much about lacrosse, for the most part the midfielders never stop moving, they are always sprinting up and down the field and taking and giving hits. On the JV team we only had one midfield sub, so there was little to no rest. In the second or third quarter, I felt my fever come back. I felt myself getting chilly and exhausted. But every stupid Nike poster saying some generic pseudo motivational sentence like “athletes don’t take sick days” resonated in my head. Not because I believed it, because I could only imagine how my teammates, my school in the bleachers, my coaches, and my family would think of me, sitting down on the bench and letting my team run themselves down. I never want to be seen as weak. Mentally, I was miserable. I wasn’t doing any of it for myself. The game was a chore. There was zero fun, enthusiasm, or passion for me. Then, I was laid out but two defenders. Basically clotheslined. I have had a mild back injury from a car wreck which was later opened back up by a similar lacrosse hit. And this time I felt it again. Not severe pain but discomforting and still pretty painful. After about 1 minute on the bench being examined by the trainer I was put back in. I was mentally beaten and this thought made me very mad at myself, in my head I kept calling myself sickly and broken. I decided I was going to floor the next man with the ball. I told myself that his team might win but he won’t. I am a very shy and mellow person so my meanbone is never seen. The candidate was a little unfair, he was probably 5 ‘ 5 and 140. I’m about 6 ‘ 2 and 180. Not a huge guy but I had size behind my hit. I checked him, hard. It was a legal check and it put him back for sure. But it put me back too. I sprained the ligaments of my thumb and hyperextended it. I couldn’t move my thumb at all. Luckily, there were only 2 minutes left. The ball didn’t come to be, nor did any other of my opponents come near. After fist bumping my goalkeeper, coach came over and said he wish he saw more hustle out of me. I wasn’t mad but a little disappointed he couldn’t see my side. I’m usually a great runner hence why I’m on midfield. Then he said that he thinks I don’t like this game and it shows that I don’t have fun. I took this pretty hard. I know it’s just coach language and I’m not mad at him but just questioning myself. I feel really down and like I let everyone else down. Because he was right that I was not having fun. Is it okay that I’m not having fun 100% of the time?

I was an incompetent person and I acted like I wasn't interested in my date the entire night. I just can't get over the fact I ruined her prom.

I know I can use this as a learning moment but it is hard to do that when I am constantly beating myself up. I don't care that I am sick, I don't even care to get with this girl anymore, it is the fact that I ruined her night, a night she was looking forwards to for a long time. She would always talk about how she was excited for prom through text and/or when I was with her and had small talk with her.

160,"Hey guys! So there is a situation at my job i need some advice about?! I work in a hospital as a patient care tech. There was a situation with another tech and myself were working together along with two other nurses. We had 8 patients to take care of and one of the patients was on a order where we had to stay in arms length of the patient the whole shift. My coworker was assigned to the patient for the first two hours while i took care of the other 7 patients. We have something called round sheets which is where we chart what the patient is doing every 15 min. It’s all kept on one board. So my co worker took the patient’s round sheet who she was assigned to first, off the board. This made it easier for her because she would be with the patient for The first two hours. She then takes it to the nurse to do her hour round. Around 6:15 PM I go to get the round sheet because it is my turn to be with the patient. The round she is nowhere to be found. I asked my coworker where the route sheet as she stated that she gave it to the nurse to do her hour round. I then go to the nurse and asked where the round sheet is she tells me she doesn’t now. We look high and low for the round sheet and we cannot find it. We let everyone around us know that the round sheet is missing and to be on the lookout. Long story short we come back the next day and we’re pulled aside by one of our managers to let us know that the round sheet was found on the overnight shift and it was brought to the nurse administrator. I apologize for the inconvenience and the severity of the problem and I also let her know that I never touch the round sheet.

That same nurse manager came back the next day and asked me to go back and fill out the round sheet. She said out of her mouth that technically it was falsifying documentation but we had to do what he had to do. Out of fear, because I was already threatened with a write up, I went to head and signed the round sheet. I was then asked to write a statement about Monday night when the round she went missing. And my statement I stated everything that happened including when she asked me to go back and fill in the round sheet. The next day I was told that she went to her boss and told her that she never asked me to fill out the round sheet. This was a bold face lie.

A few weeks before this incident I put in an email to the nurse administrator who is over our scheduling and requested that I go part time to work on my future career. She asked me to send her an email so that she can send it to HR concerning me going part time, it was never a problem at that time. About four days after the Statement was sent concerning the last round sheet I then went back to nurse administrator and asked her if there was any word on me going part time starting March 3. She said she would be denying my part time request, that I wasn’t a good fit for the job, and that she does not want me here anymore. Keep in mind I have never had a problem with the nurse administrator all of seven months I’ve been working there. Two days after that I was called into the office and I was told that that day would be my last day. I asked if I was being fired she said no. She said that she took my email requesting to go flex as me resigning. Nowhere in my email did I say that I would have to quit or that I resigned it was completely based off of her assumption. I’ve tried to tell her that that is not all what I meant and that I would not like for today to be my last day. She stated that she already sent over the paperwork to HR And there was nothing she could do about it now. I went to HR on Monday to talk to them about it and they had no idea what I was talking about. HR stated that they can reinstate my employment but that’s not the point I shouldn’t have to have my read and there was nothing she could do about it now. I went to HR on Monday to talk to them about it and they had no idea what I was talking about. HR stated that they can reinstate my employment but that’s not the point I shouldn’t have to have my Employment reinstated if I never resigned in the first place. I was asked on Monday to come turn in my badge and keys. I don’t want to make this too long but tell me what you think from just this little bit of information.",12Mar2019,1

163,"So this last year I’ve become really good friends, best friends, with this girl. When we first met I thought it might’ve been headed to a relationship, but I was open about that and she did not feel the same way. We agreed we were better off just being friends, which I’m fine with.

Fast forward 5 months and we’re still really really close. I pretty much just oppressed any feelings I had for her and tried to just be friends, which worked for the most part with only a few problems here and there. 
At a party recently I was wasted and overheard her talking about her ex. She is still obsessed with him, and I ended up having a breakdown, sparked by sadness of her not liking me back (among other reasons I might have a breakdown). This really has me thinking that I’m still struggling with feelings for her. I do not want these feelings because nothing is going to happen in between us and she does not reciprocate them.

After my breakdown I felt I kinda owed her an explanation so I explained and said I still had feelings for her. I don’t think she knows to what degree. I guess it’s love but I don’t really know what that is. She’s on my mind pretty much constantly. 
We decided to take a little step back and give it some space. So from this point I’m faced with a decision. Either I truly come to terms this time with just being friends, or I decide I can’t handle it and end the friendship. I do not want to do the second option because I value her too much as a friend. But I feel that if I can’t get her out of my mind and my feelings, then it might be a bad idea to say I’m good with it again. It might just lead to another drunken breakdown and a future of more hurt. There’s gotta be more options.
I feel really stupid for even having any feelings and I don’t want them, they only lead to bad things I don’t want.
Kinda just using this as a sounding board but would love feedback, maybe somebody who’s dealt with this before

He would say that he wanted some space but then he would keep coming over and hanging out. She would say she wanted some space and he would do the same thing. One day, he asked her if he should buy some condoms and she got scared (ofc bc she was fucking 12). She refused and he broke up with her a week later.

178,"I’m about to graduate with my Associates Degree at a Community College. I worked very hard to finish school, budgeted my money, paid for everything, fought for every A I’ve gotten, and went to the study hall everyday of the week after class.

Some days I would stay in that library early in the morning right when it opens til it closes at night, and then go home and study some more and then exercise for at least an hour.

When the weekend comes around, I work in warehouses, restaurants, literally anywhere. And then I tutor and help people enroll for their classes.

It’s hard. But I managed to pay for everything with the money I’ve earned.

I started to really like what I was doing, yes it’s hard work but I feel like I’m doing something great. I hang out with some really smart kids that are majoring in STEM, and I felt like “wow! I want to be more like these guys!”

So I’ve been buckling down and working my tail off. I get A’s on every exam I take even if it isn’t for engineering, because I’m trying to keep my parents happy and have a place to stay.

I recently won an award for making the dean’s list for 3 semesters, an actual medal. I never won a medal before ever. I never been so emotional in my entire life. I say to myself: “This is it! I made it! This dumb small town kid actually did something great!”

I come home and tell my parents about the award, and that I was thinking about being an engineer and going to university instead of the major they wanted me to do. And they were livid.

They told me that it was too expensive and that I would never be able to afford it or be able to do it.  And that getting that reward was a complete waste of time, and that I should concentrate on what they want me to do.

My dad wants me to do what he does for a living, and anytime I tell him what I’m interested in he just gives me an entire list of why I shouldn’t do it. He wants me to major in what he wants me to do instead. And gets even more upset the more I talk about it.

My mom’s deeply religious. She doesn’t believe in college, at all and thinks I’m a bad person for going to school in the first place. She wants me to be a janitor instead or go work at a warehouse full time and be a preacher.

Both of them don’t support my dream. And sometimes I feel like they want me to fail so that I can cave in and just do what they say.

I want to escape this, go live at a dorm at the school I want to go to and just study until I finally get my career and prove them wrong.

When I applied for the school my dad wanted me to go to, I told the person running admissions to please don’t accept me so that he thinks that I just wasn’t able to get in.

When I go to school, I would borrow a few textbooks from the lab. I enrolled in an organic chemistry class and a trig class and told my parents it was “one of my requirements” on top of my other classes my parents want me to take. Which sparked the idea of me being a biomedical engineer, I keep them happy but at the same time I give myself a little flicker of hope that I get to be the person I want to be someday.

I’m trying to keep it a secret. I need to keep them happy just long enough until I get my associates. 

I just wished they were proud of me,  I do something that means a lot to me... that took a lot of hard work... and they just get angry or indifferent.

I don’t know where to go from here, but I’ve been doing my homework and going to plan a way to go to a university and at least try engineering. 

I’ve been volunteering, getting letters of recommendation, trying to find every single way I can to get enough scholarships to do it.

I’m scared and stressed. But I can’t live for someone else, I have a dream. I just want to be proud of myself.",12Mar2019,7

Anyways, my friends have called me a germaphobe and OCD for a really long time now (maybe at least 3 years). For me, this looks like washing my hands more than 5 times each time (and I probably go to sink to wash at least 10 times a day), 20-40min showers (usually twice a day), washing my phone and phone case off whenever I go somewhere I think is dirty (basically anywhere), wiping things off that other people touch, including my family, and washing off whenever I hug and touch my family. Whenever I go to my other family members’ house, I come home and take a shower and if my parents and/or sister don’t shower, I freak out and wipe myself off after even brushing against them or even change my clothes. I have a separate pair of headphones for school and home. My hands are raw and cracking from how much I was my hands. There’s other stuff too, but that’s the main stuff. 
That being said, I think I need help. What do you think? Am I a germaphobe to the point where I need help? Or am I good for now? If i need help, any suggestions on what type or where to go?

183,"This may be kinda long so bear with me~

I’m currently going through my second year of college  studying business. I just transferred this year to a school in my home state from a large school in NYC. I found the adjustment back home to be quite difficult for I never thought I would be living back at home while in college, but due to financial reasons I had no other choice.

Both of my parents never went to college, however my whole life I was told that college was the only way to be successful and that my parents didn’t want me to turn out like them. My parents worked hard to put me into a college prep school for high school and have always had high expectations for me to “break the cycle” in my family. I hated the high school I went to and always felt like I just never fit in with any of the other kids who went there.

When I was going to school in NYC I was extremely happy and for once in my life I felt like I fit in. I found some of the best friends that I will ever have and overall just became the person that I always wanted to be. However, when I was in the city I started getting into drug use and alcohol which at the time didn’t have any affect on my performance at school or my mental stability, but when I returned home only made things worse.

Now being at home, I am the only one if my friends here that goes to school. I miss having the motivation that I got from my friends in NYC to do well in school and be successful in all aspects of life. I constantly feel lonely and have made no new friends at my new school. I have realized that I don’t enjoy what I’m studying at all and have already changed my major three times. To be honest I feel like school is just not for me, or at least not at this time. I feel like I no longer have any idea as to who I am as a person and am constantly under pressure to be someone I’m not especially while living back home with my parents. I don’t care about the money anymore, I just want a life where I can be happy and enjoy everyday. If school is not the way I want to achieve this, how can I? I’m too depressed to go to classes anymore and want to drop out right at this very moment but I keep feeling guilty and that I should at least finish the semester. It’s just so hard to wake up everyday and go to class knowing that I’m wasting my time and money doing something that doesn’t make me happy and only continues to make me miserable.

I don’t want to let anyone down that has been working so hard to get me where I am today, however I’m just so sick of living this life I just want to be happy while doing something that I love.

This girl at my school was recently kicked out of her sorority and blacklisted from a fraternity for multiple sexual assault allegations against men (which pretty much everyone at school knows they are true). There are a lot of other not good things about this girl but this is at the top of the list. 

I told my two close friends who were also close with her since no one else would tell them. I felt as if they deserved to know so they could make their own decisions. The girl facing the allegations, of course, lied and denied everything, but the evidence is highly against her. 

Despite all this, they are still seen to be hanging around her. The girl posts multiple snapchat stories with my two friends in them and they still go to things on campus together. My two friends have told me they do not want to associate with her, and do not want their reputations at stake, but their actions say otherwise. 

I know they feel like they are in a conflicting situation, but I cut this girl out immediately after hearing the allegations and have not looked back. I do not want to be associated with her and I know many other people in my sorority do not either. This includes being around people who continue to be her friend. What this girl did is horrible and has emotionally scarred many people on campus. I feel no sympathy for her and do not feel like it should be hard to cut her out. 

I just want to know if it's worth it to try and talk to my two friends again or stop speaking with them. Or what you would do in a situation such as this. Or, tell me what you would do in this situation. I know this girl is very manipulative, but I cannot defend my friends actions forever.

So I’m a senior in high school and starting at the end of last semester I’ve been passing by this guy from my orchestra class a lot during passing period, lunch, and after school. I think he’s cute and lately I kind of even look forward to passing by him everyday but we’ve never talked or interacted and I don’t even know his name ): For context, we’re in two separate orchestras and I only “met” him the few times the two groups combined to play concerts and now that those concerts are over, I technically don’t share a class with him.

I’m pretty sure he’s one grade lvl below me and, going purely off observations, he hangs out with a crowd that I normally wouldn’t interact with. I’m pretty introverted and “nerdy” (for lack of a better word) and he seems to hang out with the fuckboys (again, for lack of a better word :,))

This feeling usually comes around when I'm with friends that are in relationships, like ""damn I really wish I had someone that felt that way about me."" I have tried dating but I've been rejected 11 times in the past two years and at this point feeling hopeless. 

Is a relationship really what I'm missing? I just feel like that's the only thing that can be attributed to my constant unhappiness. If there is more information that you need, just ask. I'm pretty open about everything in my life. Don't even know if this is the place for this sort of question but what the hell.",12Mar2019,1
197,"Long story short - my best friend was dating a girl for about 3 years but their relationship was never ""good"". it was really unhealthy and by the third year he always told me how he wanted to leave but she'd threaten with suicide and other crazy things so he felt like he had to stay.

I went abroad for a few months and when I was gone I guess he realized he missed me much more than a friend and when I returned he told me all of this, broke up with her, and we started dating shortly after. She asked me straight up and I was completely honest with her - at first she threw to me that she was going to commit suicide and all this other stuff and would show up at his apartment at 2am, 3am, and demand to come inside and a whole load of other shit. Then, she randomly stopped one day and was really cordial about everything. We all are in a very niche music scene so we would see her at shows and she would try to catch me when he wasnt there and be super nice to me and all this other stuff. Then, I told her one day that it was unhealthy for us to have this type of relationship and that my boyfriend (her ex) didnt want us communicating at all anymore. SHE WENT BERSERK and said that I must've been fucking him while they dated (never happened) and that it's my fault he doesn't want her to be friends with us or talk to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then, every other month, she will write stuff about me on facebook, instagram, snapchat. (We have mutual friends and they tell me). I didn't care at first, but it's been 1.5 years and it's still happening. A friend the other day told me that she posted a photo of me a week ago, she said I looked young like 18 maybe (so an old photo) and that she drew an arrow towards my face and wrote that I'm her ex love's ""home wrecking whore new girlfriend"" and that I am a ""stalker"" among other things. I was ignoring it for so long but I feel like posting pictures of me and slandering me is something I won't tolerate. What should I do? Would a restraining order do anything? What would you do? It's past the point of being a hurt ex and its starting to freak me out. ",12Mar2019,4

200,"I’m the youngest of three children, but my mum actually gave birth four times. She was always honest with my siblings and I, and told us from when we were little that we had an older brother who died when he was born. This is because my nana kept big family secrets from my mum and she felt betrayed. 

So I already knew about my brother “J”, and I have even visited his grave when we drive through our old town. 

Today I went into the basement of our house because I’ve been looking for some reading and my mum has a huge collection of Stephen king. While I was looking at the bookshelf, I found a bunch of baby books. They were of my brother and sister (living) and had a bunch of photos I have and haven’t seen before. I found an empty baby book which I assumed to be mine (by the third time parents just give up). I kept looking to see if there was a baby book for me I wasn’t seeing and instead I found a book called “in loving memory of a special baby”. 

I knew what it would be immediately, but I still opened it. I was shocked to see photos. I had never in my life seen a photo of J before. I had never really questioned it. There was also a page of his details. His weight, length, date of birth etc. 

He had the gestational age of 41 weeks. He had auburn hair. On one of the photos, there was even a tape with a lock of his hair. There were also cardboard with his hand and footprints. 

I told my mum that I saw this, and she wasn’t angry. She said the book is very special to her and when we had a flood decades ago, she was only concerned with saving the book (nothing else in the basement). 

I guess I’m just really upset at what I saw. I had always pictured J as a little sleeping baby, but in the photos he was clearly a dead baby. He looked dead with black eyes and mouth. He was 41weeks, which is a fully formed baby, and even had hair (which I touched). In some of the photos, my mum and dad are in the picture and crying. 

I feel disgusted and horrified. I feel so bad for J. I feel so bad for my mum. If J has lived, I probably wouldn’t have been born. My mum was happy with a boy and a girl, and was told she couldn’t have anymore kids after my brother (so I was an accident). If J had lived, and then my mum had my sister, she might have stopped there and used contraception, meaning my brother and I were never born. Mum always said it worked out for the best because she ended up with three healthy children, and I guess I grew up thankful that J died so I could be born. I just feel awful now. 

I can’t stop picturing his face, and his little body buried in the dirt. What bothers me most is that the even had pretty ginger hair. 

I’m not sure what advice I’m asking, I guess, how can I recover and calm down after stumbling on photos of my stillborn brother. I don’t want to talk to my mum because I know it’s a very upsetting topic for her.

She says her coworkers will snicker at her behind her back and my sister caused this by texting her friends about wanting to die and taking a bunch of pills.

My mom's a bit of an abusive asshole. I wish I could sweep my sister far away from this place when she turns 18 but I'm a college student with no job and no money to call my own. I graduate at the same time my sister does. I want to be able to help her before she breaks down and actually kills herself the next time but I don't know what to do.

She thinks it's my sister's fault for ruining her life. I don't know what to do.

The only reason that I haven't begged any friends for help is because my mom forbids we talk about family matters outside the house. Heck, I'm at risk posting about this online. If one word of this gets out to my mother that I've told anybody about anything that happens here then she's going to kick me out. I don't trust other people a whole lot. I don't trust them to not tell. I barely trust posting this here but I'm freaking out. This is my only place to stay while I complete college.

There's a bit of time between now and when my sister graduates. It's enough time for my mom to change her mind but there's still my sister who is probably barely holding it together. If she breaks then I don't know what I'll do.

213,"So I've been sharing an apartment w/ a friend of mine for almost 4 years now. Initially we each had brought a few items from our parents homes to help furnish the place but otherwise most everything we owned starting out had come from the 2nd hand store. Once my overall budget settled I began replacing things w/ they're nicer, pricier, forms. &amp; buying stuff that made the overall place look nicer (hanging pictures, knick knacks, small appliances). I bought these things know full well that my roommate would never expend the effort to upgrade out himself, &amp; that's okay, it's just not a priority for him, &amp; I understand. To this day we have never had an argument related to the appartment. 

Though I think it was when I started do this is when a dynamic between us began to develope where I would take care of nearly everything that had to do w/ common space between us: Eventually I stopped asking him where something might look nice or if we should get this or that; I just went &amp; got it if I felt like it belonged in our apartment. &amp; This is not to say I am claiming the space at all. we both share the space equally. 

Now all this time has passed &amp; literally, &amp; I mean literally, everything  in the common spaces belong to mean, save his food &amp; a few mugs. 

About a year ago I replaced our dining room table (which I had bought) w/ a newer nicer one &amp; chairs. &amp; Like everything else I hadn't consulted him about it. I felt a bit guilty about not doing so, but on the other hand I had paid for the previous table, &amp; the new table. Should I not have a right to replace it w/ a better one I paid for? He said nothing about it.

I now face a similar situation w/ our couch (which belongs to me). I have told him I'm looking to replace. He said he liked our couch b/c it's comfy (which it is), &amp; I told him I plan on getting on same size &amp; shape only brand new. 

Do I have the right to replace our couch which belongs to me w/ a brand new one 100% paid by me of similar form w/o his say so?

214,"I’m going to try to be discreet about this. 

I work for a program with kids. 

I have my own class and students. Now I have recently over the past few weeks. Been accused by my boss that I’ve been part of a clique at work. 
There’s no such thing. Honestly  I have two of my co workers that I do talk to more than the other two. 
We talk more because they have taken an interest on my life. I’m going through a break up and some financial issues. As well as family issues and health. Honestly I’m still alive lol so there’s stuff to be dealt with. 
And whatever is going on at my work. Well it’s just adding to it. And it’s not even true. 

My co workers we do talk on our way into work and out of work. Sometimes in work. But mostly on our way out. We talk about quick hiccups in life. Or some legal stuff. Or just my personal stuff and the work stuff we do talk about is strictly about lesson plans and materials not about co workers at all. Like I could swear on my life. 

I don’t think that constitutes a clique. We don’t talk about co workers or our boss for that matter because I honestly have a lot on my plate to even consider that.  but she’s been throwing out that clique word. And honestly I think I can speak for us accused and say that’s not true and it threw me off so bad. 
When she said it last Friday again. I had been talking to one of my co worker whom she has accused me to be in a clique with. And I kind of made a face because I was again. Very really confused and upset she said it. There was some kids around too and I was kind of like? Really unprofessional. And it’s not true so I was confused and dumbfounded. I figured honestly it’s the weekend. 
I’ll just go in Monday ask for a meeting on clarification because this has been thrown out there too much. And I want to know why comes out as that so I can address it because I value my job. Also because there is no clique honestly I consider those co workers friends and they have been helping me a lot by listening to me in my time of need right now. 

Then today comes. And I get an email and she’s set up a meeting with me for tomorrow and she has CC’d the boss above her. And I’m confused. But I was like okay good. I wanted to talk to her, I guess she does too. 

Anyways I get to work and she waits until everyone is clocked in to announce that she has let two of the main bosses know about our problems and how she’s tired of being disrespected and everything. 

Okay cool. 

She also says that there has been said there’s a group chat and that we talk about her and that the known parties of this situation have been emailed about a meeting. Okay that’s when the three of us knew because she previously called us out at work for being in a clique. 
I have tried to talk less to the co workers in accused of being in a clique because honestly idk. 
I wish I knew how to handle it. 
There’s no clique and no evidence of anything. She said that she heard and I’m wondering what exactly she heard and from who. 
I feel like I’m being harassed I’ve had other run ins with her. We’ve always solved them but this tops it. I haven’t done anything wrong but I’m not sure she believes me. And it seems she talks about me to my co workers that are the other two I don’t always to as much but I do talk to them everyday just not to the level of the other two because the other two they stay with my boss after work and talk to her. They talk about their lives and honestly I don’t go talking about my life to her that much. 
When I clock out I walk to my car and sometimes the other two will be there my friend co workers and we’ll talk on our way to our cars and go our separate ways. 

Is there something I could say tomorrow? What should I do? The boss above my boss she’s really cool and hears both sides. Should I maybe have her come to the meeting? Should I remain silent? Or just post pone the meeting. 
I really feel harassed now. I haven’t done anything wrong and I depend on this job a little to be able to stay alive. 
Sometimes I think I might be getting harassed because of my sexuality or personality. This just seems too much already. 
And I don’t know if I can afford to be without a job. 
I need some advice if any of you have some. I might request a transfer to a different school because I don’t think I can deal with this. 
It doesn’t look like a positive outcome she’s convinced we’re doing something but honestly we don’t even talk about her. 
I’m going through a break up and life changing stuff and those co workers have been there for me. That’s all I can legitimately say. 
I knew she was lying about the group chat. There’s nothing like that on my phone. Like nothing and that’s how I know she must be talking about me to other people or something. 
I had last year reported the two co workers that stay with her because they had this little clique where they’d go out together and just talk to themselves. 
A co worker who no longer works with us also reported them. 
At the moment of reporting she came off too me and said she was thankful we could tell her and be honest. And she would handle it so we felt included.
But when we had a meeting together. She ended up siding with the two co workers we reported saying she understood them and that me and the other one were wrong basically. Like she literally flipped and didn’t stay neutral. And now it feels like maybe she’s retaliating against me for that. Because she’s gotten closer to them. 

It’s honestly a mess. I just think I’m honestly going to lose my job because I spoke up about something and because I’m being accused. There’s no evidence to help her but I don’t know. She technically is higher up there than me. 

I’m kinda worried I’ll be losing my job soon.

However, for the past two weeks things have become different. He started asking to borrow things and began frequenting my department a lot more.

A few days ago at work, he walked through my department when we were closed and cleaning up the store. He made eye contact with me but I didn’t smile, nor did I acknowledge him when he would bring things to my department. I don’t know why but I just panicked and didn’t react the way I usually do. I become really nervous and awkward around guys I like. Since that day, his demeanour has changed. He avoids my department, doesn’t look at me and seems very cold again. I went over to his department to ask him for something and he was very short and curt with his answer. I really like him and feel terrible that I sent him a mixed signal.

221,"Need some advice on a kind of quarter life crisis. I looked through a bunch of other posts, but didn’t find any stories like mine. There’s a tl;dr at the bottom of you don’t want to read my whole life story. 

Generally, I’m 27 years old with a double degree from undergrad in music composition and psychology, and a masters in user expertise design. Two years ago (right out of grad school) I somehow got my dream job at a super competitive company, moved across the country, and started working for my dream company. The role and company were nothing like I expected, and while I do love the job, it’s not as magical and happy of a place as I had imagined. That being said, i could easily stay at the job for the rest of my career and not hate it. 

Here’s where my issue comes in: I hit the jackpot with my job, I have a solid group of friends, and I’m living in a phenomenal apartment, albeit in a city I don’t love (Los Angeles). I’m happy with what’s going on, but I’m bored and unmotivated, which is bringing me way down. When I was in both my previous job and grad school, I worked a ton of hours, then filled my minimal free time with side projects, hobbies, performances, side jobs, and hanging out with friends. Now, I work a solid 7-8 hour day, get home, get high, and play video games or watch TV. Maybe 1-2 nights a week I’ll go to trivia or a bar with some friends. I’m not motivated to do any side projects, play or write any music, work out, or even see friends more than a few times a week. I used to have this hunger to always do better than people expected of me, but once I got this job and “achieved my dream”, that hunger disappeared. I know I don’t love the city, and that’s certainly contributing, but generally I’m feeling super stuck in a situation that should be an achievement and something to enjoy.

223,"Im currently living with my mom and plan on moving out soon. It's something that has been going through my mind for the last year or so, and now my girlfriend and I are taking about beginning to build our life. Really lucky to have her and like her mentality as it is in the same place as my own. Anyways, the mobile home is not so bad for the price and might get it cheaper because of family. My mom is not so for it since the price they gave me was more than they paid and put money into.  However, if we can agree on getting the price to go lower then I plan to take it.  I did my research and it's a steal for now they are going for. I also know they lose value like cars since it is essentially that in a way. Yet I plan to live there for a bit, renovate, and rent it out. That way I may get some passive income. Should I still go through with it regardless of depreciation? Could get my money back after 4 years of renting out and would be paid off in 3 years or so. I just don't want to rent an apartment and have that money go to waste if I can buy this and maybe get some passive cash. ",12Mar2019,2

227,"Shiiiiiiit. 
 Background: My best friend and I for over a year struggled with our feelings back and fourth while she ended up going back to her ex for a while. So I told her how I felt right after they broke up. She then said she just wanted to remain friends. So I faded out fast. Forced us to have space. She knows she played with my feelings for a while. 

So for about two months and a half i worked on myself. Got a new job, new car, working on my fitness etc. with almost zero contact (she used to send random snaps, instas, and text. She used to stalk my other social media as well too to see what i was up to i hardly ever wrote back) then I got off social media... didnt open her snap for a week. She deleted me quickly after. But i was told by a friend her story was of something I did for her.

The texts I would get was “i hope this is just one of our mini fights”  and she goes to my gym so she already told me she missed me a couple times. 

I told her i was seeing someone, she said she was too.  Now she brings her friend or new guy to gym sometimes, rarely looks or says hi to me if hes there. But when hes not she’ll say hey. 

Fastfoward to present day march. I talked to her, for a bit, started to catch up, she called to talk. Couple days later i send a video on insta (testing waters) she likes it. See her at gym she says hi. She leaves without saying bye which she knows I hated back then. So now im here im like wtf.

I’m seeing this girl who is nice, likes same music, kind of funny, and i cant stop thinking about my old best friend who i left behind.

Need advice.

228,"So I recently let my family know my partner and I are expecting a child soon. My partner (P) and I had discussed who we wanted as godparents a while back, but since my side of the family didn’t know, we kept it under wraps. Now that the immediate family knows, I asked my best friend (M) of almost a decade to look into what being a godfather entails, as I would like for him to be one. My mother being the religious one between us two, told him the requirements he needed to meet through the Catholic church. He said he’d happily consider, and will let me know his answer in the near future.
Now, it was all set and done, but while talking to my dad and his sister today, I received a text from my older half brother (J), asking if we had chosen godparents yet. Not wanting to make my M’s decision for him, I said we were still in the process. I received a message back essentially hinting he would be up for the task. Normally I would have been excited, but because of where he has lived most of his life, and him living with his mom, I never really got to connect with him as a brother. I would love for him to be a part of this child’s life, but not only had P and I already asked M, J is not of the same religion as I because of his sexuality (not an issue to me btw). My aunt and dad see this as my brother really trying to make up for those years we never talked, but my mother reminded my dad it is a religious ceremony/role, thus should be M’s position as a member of my faith. My dad (religious but not devout nor catholic) on the side told me that family is more important than religious traditions, and if he had been passed up in the same situation, it would hurt him deeply.
I don’t want to stress P out with this, so I have turned to you, Reddit, to ask how I should approach this. I do care about my brother, and would like for him to be involved, however I unfortunately never really connected with him, and do not see myself seeing him often enough because of where we live. My best friend, while not a frequent visitor now, is someone I have  seen almost daily for years until we graduated, bringing it down to 2-3 months out of the year. He is also of my faith, which I understand is what is traditionally expected. I know it would hurt my dad, aunt, and J if I choose M, but it is what my gut tells me is the more rational choice for my child. 
I guess the questions are: should I prioritize family over religious traditions? And how should I go about letting either one of them know why I didn’t pick them?

232,"A little background. My husband and I are currently pregnant. 29 weeks. And just last week I was in the hospital for contractions to which they had to give me meds to stop them. And so any added stress is a no no as we don’t want baby coming early. 
We have 2 dogs. One is a full bred husky (about 3 months Male). So he’s a little puppy. He behaves really good for a puppy. When we first got him he instantly was potty trained. He had some trouble sleeping for the first few days which is normal. 
The other is part malamute and part husky (almost 2 years Female). She is the one that I am struggling with. My SIL was taking care of her but was pretty much abusing her (never fed her, kept her in kennel 24/7, never let her outside, etc). So we took her in. And so I know it’s really hard to break habits especially when they are older. But when we first got her we instantly went into training mode. She was doing SO good. We had no problems but a few normal ones. She never pooped or peed on the floor, hardly whined (except when needing to go outside), we trained her not to jump on people and she was doing so good at not doing it. 
Now here’s my problem. She all of a sudden went back to her old habits. This past week has been hell. When my husband is home she does okay, she listens a little more, she not aggressive. But the second my husband leaves she has nipped at my hand more than once, has clawed at me, jumped on my stomach (which again I’m pregnant so that’s a HUGE no), etc. She is very strong and knows that she can overpower me at the moment due to being pregnant. 
I just can’t do it anymore. She’s too much for me to handle. I don’t have the energy or strength to take down a 2 year old husky. Plus trying not to go into preterm labor?? I also worry about when the baby comes. She’s aggressive towards me, what is she gonna do with a baby in the house. It stresses me to my core. And I just don’t want her, I honesty didn’t really want her from the beginning but my husband did, so we took her in. But it’s at the point I’m scared to be alone with her. 
Our other puppy, he’s great. I have no problem with him. He’s cuddly. Fun. And just a great dog overall. 
I don’t know what to do in this instance. I don’t want her, but my husband does. Advice..?",12Mar2019,0

236,"A friend of mine just got out of a terribly abusive relationship. The two still work at the same factory, and he's been going out of his way to ruin her life. 

To start, her ex accused her of cheating. He found out that after he broke up with her the first time, she slept with someone else who also works in the factory. She didn't tell him when they got back together because she knew he would blow up like he did. Because the third party does have a history of cheating, and was at the time, her ex decided to make it public and also ruin the third partys relationship. Feeling bad for him, my friend said she could stay at his house for a few days - their boss had a spare room he could move into so it would definitely be short term. 

Somehow, more on this in a second, the fiance of their boss heard rumours, all lies, that the third party was gay or bi and would try to get it on with the boss and a fight started between the boss and his fiance, halting the move in plans. Now my roommate is stuck with this person in her tiny 2 room apartment and neither want the situation.

The part that is fucked is how the information has been transfered. My friend found out today, after some suspicions, that her phone was bugged. Her ex knew things from conversations he wasn't a part of, down to having a name of the person she ""cheated with"", who was actually the first and last name of two different people that were brought up in a conversation he wasn't around for. The reason the bosses fiance heard the rumours is because her ex found out the plan and wanted to stop it and cause her more problems. This sounds far fetched but I know for a fact this guy is mentally unstable and good with technology, and in general a garbage human.

So my friend has had her phone bugged for a few months, all her info is compromised, she has a guy at her house who she doesn't want but has no where else to go after being kicked out, her ex takes every opportunity to cause chaos in her life, and she's already dealing with some rough mental illnesses.

Is there anything we can do to get out of this? I hate seeing her this stressed and panicked all the time but there doesn't seem like a lot of options.",12Mar2019,1
237," My boyfriend is 22, and I am 21. We met in college and have been seeing eachother for about a year now. He is very attractive, with gorgeous eyes and has had no problem with getting female partners throughout his life.Last night he told me that he made out with two transgender women who did not fully go through transition yet on different occasions, but that he did not do anything more.   


He told me that he was a virgin and that porn made him get into different fetishes, and that he was talking his mom's medication which made him feel numb, so he made out with them but that he finds it disgusting now that he thinks about it.I'm not going to lie, I have nothing but support for the LGBT community, but I can't really look at him the same after that.  


 I know I sound horrible but I keep thinking of him kissing two transgender people. Even thought he claims hes 100% straight, I can't forget about what he said he did.

238,"So I had this friend in high school that I was fairly close to. She was in my group of friends and I'd hang out with her on the weekends with my other friends almost every week senior year. We also had study hall together and would sit and talk so we grew kind of close, but she was by no means my best/closest friend. We ended up going to the same college together and freshman year lived in the same dorm, so still hung out from time to time. I thought she was really funny and I admired a lot about her. As we went further in our college career we spoke and spent time together less and less. I began to feel like she didn't care about me and my life as I did about hers so I gradually drifted away from her. Now we don't talk anymore or really see each other, I haven't seen her in about 3 months.

She has lost a lot of weight since going to college. I realize that once people move out on their own and try to figure out how they want to live their lives things like that often change, people gain or lose weight. But, she is looking scarily thin. The few times I would eat lunch with her last semester/year she wouldn't eat or just eat peppers/some type of vegetable and drink tea. My other friends and I were concerned for awhile but since we don't really talk to her it didn't feel like our place to intervene. Tonight I went on vsco and saw some pictures she posted that literally shook me to my core. She looked so skeletal. Her arms looked only to be bone. I don't know what to do. Like I said, I haven't spoken to her in a long time, but I'm really concerned that something bad is going on and while she's not really my friend anymore I still care about her and hope that she is well. What do you guys think I should do? Looking at those pictures tonight really scared me and I feel like I should speak up but I don't know who to/what to do. I don't know her roommates enough to talk to them and her mom always kind of scared me but I am concerned. Any advice about this would be seriously appreciated.",12Mar2019,1

My best friend(M) and I(F) have known each other for six years. We met in college and really became close. He told me he liked me in college but the time was a bit of a mess for me and I told him I'd rather stay friends. This was because I honestly did not want to ever lose him in case I fucked up the relationship by making it ""romantic"" and it was also because I had way too many things going on in my life including hospitalization for my mental health. We both didn't handle the situation well. I ended up dropping out of college and moving away but we stayed in touch. The last two years, we mainly communicated through email and a few Skype calls. We apologized to each other for the way we treated one another and our friendship got stronger. In one of the Skype calls last year, he said he still had feelings for me. I was afraid of leading him on (as I was in a position where I couldn't even meet him if I wanted to) so I didn't really get into it. 
Since then, he has had relationships with their ups and downs (as relationships tend to be.) 
Few months ago, I moved to his city and we've been hanging out regularly. He has an on-again-off-again girlfriend whom I met last week. 
I keep trying to explain myself better by writing down how I feel but I never feel like I can send it to him. First of all, I'll be leaving the city in two months, I'm also someone who has a lot of ""issues"" that make it difficult to generally be with me (anxiety, depression and I've also never been in a relationship.) I feel guilty when I think of dragging someone else into the mess of my life and so I don't think I should tell him that I think we should give this a chance. 
 A few weeks ago, he set me up on a date with his brother and I feel like that's just made the situation a whole lot more complicated. His brother is wonderful but I'm not attracted to him and I don't think he's attracted to me. I don't know why I play such an active participant in making things more difficult for myself. 
We are still hanging out and I'm so grateful to have him in my life. Sometimes, he's the only thing that gets me through the day. 
I haven't quite processed my feelings for him, I know that I love him but I don't know what that means and if it means that I want to be intimate with him. I'm also struggling with understanding my own sexuality (I'm still a virgin, don't know if asexual, bi, straight...)

241,"Me and my friends enjoy playing Smash Bros at our community college. I bring controllers and my Switch, get permission to hook it up to a TV in the lounge, and we just enjoy ourselves. They usually leave around 6 and I stay to unplug everything. 

A few weeks ago, around 5 PM, it was me and 2 of the other guys there when this strange guy comes up to us. He proclaims he wants to play winner and sits down and watches us play. This guy stinks to high hell. Like seriously. It's the most vile, potent stench you could ever imagine, like he hasn't showered since the day he was born. We try to ignore him but he makes annoying comments at everything; ""Wow, you're so trash!"" ""How did you get hit by that?"" ""I'm so surprised this match is going the way it is."" Eventually, I have had enough and ask him to please leave. He refuses, but shuts up, opting to just sit and watch us. Eventually, my friends leave and he just sits there, watching me as I pack up my Switch and controllers. Now I'm a pretty strong dude, if not on the skinny side, but I was afraid at that moment. I'm very paranoid and afraid of conflict, not to mention germaphobic, so I was convinced this guy was going to attack me while my back was turned or just steal my stuff and spread disgusting germs all over it. Thankfully, he left and I packed up, rattled and gasping for clean air.

A few weeks later, he comes back, once again insisting to play. There were about 7 of us this time. One of my friends who is very cocky agrees, and he uses a controller that another friend brought. He gets bodied and leaves as the friend who the controller belongs to gags. There's a horrible smell coming from his controller, so I go to get him some wet wipes to clean it off. Everything continues as normal.

And now today, he shows up once more and demands to know why I don't let him play. I tell him the many reasons; he stinks, he annoys me, no one there likes him, and it's my Switch so I make the decisions. He starts yelling and cussing at me and then quiets down for a moment. Afterwards, he asks again to play and I try to ignore him, but he keeps pestering me so I cut him off with a strict ""No."" He leaves and we all pray that this is the last we'll see of him, but life just doesn't work like that. Turns out he went to the front desk to complain about how we weren't letting him play with us. Of course, this was such a ridiculous complaint that the front desk just told him that they couldn't do anything about that and told him to leave us alone. He started yelling at them and eventually left. Once again, we thought we had seen the last of him, but no. He comes back with his girlfriend who tried to take me to court just because she was in the background of one of my Snapchat stories and some other dude who I don't know. He then comes up behind us and calls me by my name, saying to never take pictures of his girlfriend again. At this point, even my friends, who were polite enough to not say anything the past few times, start telling him to go away and that he's acting like a dick and bothering us. I was and still am very shaken.

Now I just don't feel safe in school any more. I was looking over my shoulder all the time to see if he was going to rush back in, guns ablazing, and attack me or otherwise steal my Switch and infect it with all sorts of grotesque germs. I'm having some really bad troubles at home and going to school to play with my friends was one of the only things that kept me from sinking into complete depression. Now even that is being taken from me. I'm scared for my safety, the safety of my friends, and the safety of my possessions. I don't know if reporting him to our Student Affairs office will do anything besides set him off on an absolute rampage. At the same time, I'm also somewhat afraid that he's going to shoot up our community college or something. What do I do?

TL;DR: Creepy dude who has never seen a bar of soap in his life won't leave us alone when we're playing Smash Bros. We tried everything and it got somewhat heated. Now I'm scared for my safety, scared for my friends, and scared for my stuff.",12Mar2019,1

I feel so lame when people want to go out to eat somewhere, and my first thought is panic over the menu and “is there anything I can eat there?” Or at a family gathering when my sister makes a new dish and I can’t try it. She says “what’s the worst thing that will happen? You won’t like it, and you can spit it out.” And yes I can see the logic in that but my brain is like “DO NOT EAT IT you dOnT kNoW wHaT iT tAsTeS LiKe!!!” It’s like I’m standing too close to the edge, and my body is physically willing me to move back, except it’s not falling off a cliff, it’s just the thought of a taste that I have no way of pre knowing what it tastes like without having to put it IN MY MOUTH.

I work as an admin assistant in an admin team for a large organisation. My team consists of four other admin assistants, and our manager.

Occasionally, other employees who are put on light duties (injury/sickness etc) also assist with these big projects, even if they aren’t part of the team normally. Because we work together on big projects, our team meets regularly, but the other light duties employees don’t attend.

One of our projects was to move a massive amount of datafiles from one database A to database B. The two databases couldn’t talk to each other, so the data had to be moved manually. Our team has been working on this project for months. I’ve been working really hard and all of the data assigned to me has already been moved over to B.

In our team meeting, my boss told us that we needed to start deleting files from A as they were no longer required, and that we should be deleting as we go.
Whole team agrees to do so, but I voice my concern about this change in process and it’s potential for things to be accidentally deleted off A before being transferred to B.

My boss responds to me voicing my concern by stating, in front of my team, that it won’t be a problem if I do my work properly.

I insist and summarise my concern because I don’t feel like I had been listened to.

My boss responds to me by saying that I’m then obviously not doing any work and am slacking off.

I was/am furious. I realise now that voicing my concern could have come across as a threat to my bosses authority, but I also feel embarrassed and disrespected by my boss saying I do nothing when I have completed everything asked of me so far.

Should I have just walked out of the meeting then and there? Should I say anything to my boss privately that I felt disrespected?

250,"Maybe drop out isn't the right word, but I want to take at least a year off from college and pursue a career in graphic design. If it doesn't work out, I will go back to college and finish my degree.

A little background: I am in my second semester of my freshman year of college, and so far it's been pretty miserable. I'm realizing that I'm not as interested in my major as I thought, even though it could lead to a very well paying career down the road. There has also been a lot of stress from issues with my student loans both semesters so far, the first time leading to severe panic attacks. I attended a vocational high school where I took a four year graphic design program, and consider myself to be fairly skilled at it.

I really want to take a break of college for a year and pursue a full-time career in graphic design, but I know my parents will have reservations, being college drop-outs themselves. Like I said, if nothing works out within the period of a year, I plan to go back and finish my degree. I currently work a part time job, so it's not like I won't be bringing in any money in the meantime. This is the biggest life-choice I have ever made, and it's pretty nerve-wracking. ",12Mar2019,1

254,"I was speaking with two people I work with, one of which I supervise, and we were discussing the cost of living and one of my colleagues sighed and said, “$xx amount per hour is just not enough to pay my bills without overtime” and the other person (the person I manage) said she agreed. They both assume that I make more than they do and I didn’t confirm nor deny, but I was really crushed as I love my job and previously thought that they treat me well. Now I’m not so sure. 

These two employees were just recently hired within the last 3 months and their starting salary is the same amount as me, despite the fact that I have been at my job for 3.5 years and have several more responsibilities than they do. As I mentioned, one of the people is someone I supervise so I was really surprised to hear she makes the same amount as I do, especially when part of my job is supervising their productivity and leading meetings with them, etc. 

I haven’t received a raise since last April but am due for a raise within the next month or so. I am only making $3 more hourly than I made when I started ($1 increase per raise). I want more than just $1 raise if people with 3 month seniority are making what I make after 3 years, but am not sure it’s appropriate to mention that I’ve learned how much other people make. 

If I go into my review and am only offered a $1 pay increase, is it appropriate to negotiate that or tell them I think it’s unfair, or is it simply time for me to get a new job? Is it inappropriate to mention that I know how much another person makes? ",12Mar2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I think I am in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

We all joke with each other for everything that we can as we have known each other for some time now. However, I think I get most of the jokes (you should also know that I have a problem with that, while some people can just get fine with it).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I checked an article to know if I am being used and some stuff really matched to my condition.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't really feel much comfortable around them.
2. I have it hard to say no to some their requests. Yesterday all of my friends were asking me to smoke some weed, I said no but one of them said I'm going to unfriend you. I still said no and didn't smoke. I talked with him that day, but I don't really like that he used that shit on me. I know that it was used around each other some time too though.

So what do you think I should do? If you want to ask more information I can tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I think I can do is to.

1. Abandon them forever (which is very very hard to do as we live in the same City and I will be named as a big pussy. I don't have really close friends like I have with them. I had another one, but just lost bcz of similar reasons with those. So losing them, it will be really hard to do as then my social life would be like inexesistent. I mean I can hang-around with them sometimes and just have fun with them (it's not that I don't really enjoy at all).
2. Hang-out with them only if I be treated other-wise, otherwise go with the A plan (1). This is also hard to do but I don't think it will be unachievable. I don't blame them at all, I got myself in this position and I suppose there is a friend in every friendship that feels like so.

261,"My dad was incredibly abusive towards my family. I saw him strangle my mother and attack her with a knife while she screamed for help. He would beat my brothers senseless, even broke my closest brother’s collarbone. He never touched me though. I was his favorite child, he would buy me candy and give it to me in front of my brothers, get me toys. He once called our house after my mom left him and when my little sister answered, he ended the call not saying “I love you and your sister” but with “tell your sister I love her.” He and I were so close, even though I witnessed the terrible things he did. 

As much as I loved him, I was scared and scarred emotionally. I spent most of my childhood afraid he would kidnap me after we left. I would stay up all night until I heard my mom go to bed because I thought she would hurt me in my sleep. She always treated me differently because I reminded her of my dad. To this day I have panic attacks when men raise their voices. I get nervous around men taller than me. 

He died a couple years ago after liver cancer had spread through his body. He was given a month to live. I told my mom when he died thinking she’d be excited but she didn’t really react. I thought I’d be happy that he died in pain, scared, and alone, but I wasn’t. The other day I was thinking about how now I have the ability as an adult to travel. I began crying because all I could think was how badly I wish he were alive so I could go to him and kill him myself. All of my siblings have severe emotional issues because of him. My own mother couldn’t fully love me because I reminded her of him. I feel like the pain he caused will never leave me. Sometimes I wish he had beat me like them so I wouldn’t feel so guilty, so maybe my mom would have felt bad for me instead of resenting me.

274,"Hey good people of /Advice

I've never met anyone besides me who has their life's mission as clearly laid out and realised, yet is unable to do anything else for it than the absolute bare minimum.

Some backstory: I'm a 29 year old guy with a master's degree in music composition, working as a freelancer in the film industry. I've always been obsessed with music, and it's been the #1 thing in my life for as long as I can remember. I don't enjoy anything in life as much as I do music.  
I was relatively gifted with understanding musical instruments at a young age, which unfortunately fed my laziness as I didn't have to practice as much, so I never learned discipline. Because of that by the time I was 18 I had to abandon my plans of studying the guitar as a major, since everybody who had the routine bypassed me. Only when I got into uni later to study composition, I realised that everyone else had the discipline and a routine for self improvement - where I simply lacked it. Those years developing discipline as a 25 year old was painful as hell. I thought I had it for good, but when I graduated I took a step back again.

My goal in life is simply to be better at music - and I know perfectly well how to get there: composing new material, transcribing, researching theory and the masters, practicing the guitar and developing my craft through experimentation. Educate myself and transpose that knowledge into new music. I know what to practice, I know how I can reach the things I want out of life - yet I don't pursue them 90% of the time.

Most of the time I am unable to scale the wall that's between the thing I'm supposed to be doing, and the thing I'm doing - which is dulling my brain with social media and the internet, and being in a state of deep lethargy. Being addicted to doing nothing. I find it baffling as I see time as the only resource that cannot be bought or replaced, tt is precious and one should in an optimal situation make every hour of the day count. Even though I realise that - it just seems absolutely impossible to do the things I should be doing. I've tried it all, I've made schedules, meditated, done self psycho-analysis on the subject. But I'm still battling with the same question: -Why am I not doing the things in life that I enjoy the most? I know a lot of people battle with this in some form or another, but I hven't met people who have their ""mission in life"" as clearly mapped out like me since early childhood, and still are unable to live by it.

Nothing brings me as much joy as writing even 30 seconds of new music, or transcribing a piece I really love. To me that's better than any earthly pleasures in this world. Yet I refuse to do it. I even go to great lengths to avoid it, for example cleaning my whole apartment and sending out 30 work related emails, or (my recent favourite) watching a guy clean a MacBook Pro motherboard on youtube for 2 hours. When I do make the jump and get in it I can make music for 8 hours without a break and completely losing myself.

I find it amazing that with the minimal amount of work I've managed to be somewhat successful and reach accomplishments that I certainly don't feel justified to. I mean, how can I claim to love and live for music, if I'm going to such great lengths to avoid dealing with it and confronting it?

Sorry, this turned out super long, but English isn't my first language so I'm the best at laying it out efficiently!

275,"I am a 28 year old New Zealander currently working in New Zealand. My employment contract will end early next year. It's possible that my contract could be extended, but I'm not counting on it. I'm thinking of studying a diploma for a year after my contract ends so I can get the 1-year post-study visa to work in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a lot of odd jobs over the years and climbing the corporate ladder doesn't appeal to me so I don't mind this being a blip in my career history. However, I have a boyfriend who I met in September last year that I will miss dearly if I go overseas. We are in a serious relationship as we are living together, share expenses, and have met each other's families. He isn't able to come with me since there are no long term work visa options for him, and he isn't interested in going to the United States anyway. I don't think our relationship will last long distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've already lived in Washington DC for about 2 years in the past, so I feel like my opportunity to experience life in the US has come and gone. However I was more eager to live on the west coast which was the plan before I met my current boyfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the opportunity cost of not working and earning money for a year to study the diploma. In New Zealand, higher education is affordable so the actual cost of tuition isn't an issue for me.

&amp;#x200B;

What it really boils down to is that I don't have the heart to leave my boyfriend in New Zealand but I want to live in California for a year. I want two things that can't coexist at the same time.

She has been in a relationship with the guy for about a year now and I’m cheering them on but I still have these feelings inside me. I don’t wanna confess cause i treasure our friendship a lot but its been difficult to move on. Ive tried talking to other girls and going out with them but nothing always seem to work out.

Anyway today i went out for lunch with her. Had a normal conversation and we ended up talking about some celebrity sex scandal. When we were about to leave she told me that she has had sex with her boyfriend. To a lot of people it may not be anything much but from where I come from its quite a conservative place and both our families are the kind that strictly enforce no premarital sex. I don’t particularly feel betrayed or anything I just feel really heavy and empty in my chest right now even though I’ve been feeling great the past few months. The fact that she always tell me not to be stupid and have sex with my gf if i ever get one is kinda making me even more upset. As of now i am quite lost on how i should carry on my friendship with her. It feels quite stupid to be hurt and grow distant because she had sex with someone but at the same time i cant deny that i feel hurt about this. Any advices on whether i should maintain my friendship with her? And if yes how?

289,"When I was in High School I got bullied to the point of my self esteem pretty much not existing. It's been 6 years since then and my confidence has increased a tonne, I'm living in my own, studying for a degree, got some good friends and things are looking promising, the only problem is that my deep seeded anxieties are starting to get the better of me.

I've been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now and I can't get enough of her, we've made a couple of jokes/unserious talks about marriage, basically we can definitley see things going the long run. But then my brain keeps on telling me things like 

""she's falling out of love with you"" 

                           ""you're not doing enough"" 

""she doesn't find you as attractive as she used to"" 

Deep down i feel like these things are probably true but I have this strong need just to ask ""hey you love me right?"" But I don't want to be a pain, and I don't want to start putting insecuritys into the relationship. 

I know this is ridiculous and small.compared to some things around here but if anyone has any advice at all it would be greatly appreciated.

293,"Definitely at a crossroads right now.

My entire life I’ve wanted a career in theatre, which we all know. Hardly exists. I’ve recently decided to settle to be a theatre teacher, this is the most you can get. Going to school has been difficult for me because my parents have money to pay for college, but have no intention or support of me going. Doing anything has been difficult.

I moved to Arizona with my boyfriend. I’ve found a relatively less expensive school here. I have a couple scholarships. And it looks like I’ll be able to attend in the fall. Full time, while doing theatre actively to keep my scholarship. 

Only problem is I have no support from my parents. So I have to pay all my bills myself. But I won’t be able to work nearly as much as I’ll be going to school full time and doing theatre. So my boyfriend has agreed to help pay my bills for the four years. Which I feel insanely guilty for and incredibly stressed about.

On the other hand my boyfriend is going to an amazing sound engineering school. The best in the country. His parents are paying for him. It’s only a year program, he goes to class for four hours every day. The work load is way less. He gets an internship right after he graduates, and the school has connections for jobs everywhere.

He could have a career in music, film, video games, live sound. And on average  sound engineers make more than theatre teachers.

Only thing worrisome about this career is that there will be short times of unemployment.

But I’ll be in school for way shorter, have way less debt, and still be doing a super cool career. Where can I have my hair any color, and as many tattoos as I want. Dumb reasoning, but that stuff is important to me too.

I can also choose to go anytime of the year as they’re always starting cycles. And it’ll be nice to have the same career as my future husband.

Having a college degree is always good. This sound engineer school only gives you a certificate.

I just don’t know if I’m ready to give up on theatre. And I’ve done so much work to get ready for this school, it would feel almost rude to my counselors to just dump it. I’ve always dreamt of going to a university and it feels backwards almost to just suddenly give up on it.

Have no clue what I should do.",12Mar2019,3

297,"I [23M] didn't really have my dad in my life all to much until 8th grade. (I still live at home with my family). Yes I was excited that he was back but also barely knew him and had already built up a partial wall that only got stronger as time continued. I have never been too close with my immediate family and still to this day, it remains the same. I always was curious as to why my dad was gone for so long but kinda forgot about that question until this recent holiday season when I found out the reason why. 

My brothers and I had a family meeting with my mom about how my dad feels like we dont like him because we hardly talk with him (to be fair, hes not completely wrong).  She explained that my grandmother who we lived with before she passed away did NOT like my father one bit to the point where she refused to let him live with us all over petty bullshit and personal grudges. He could visit for a day but was never allowed to stay the night. My grandmother didnt even care that she was depriving her grandchildren from their father. My father ONLY moved back in the house because my grandmother passed away. And when he did, he brought all of the harbored hate towards my deceased grandmother and her family with him, expressing it day in and day out for years, still going today strong. 

I want to hate my grandmother for what she did, but I just cant find myself to dislike her even a tiny bit. I also have a huge wall built up around myself and my dad that I dont see coming down anytime soon. I legitimately do not know him on a personal level. There is zero and I mean zero personal connection with my father and I. And it's like he's not trying either. He comes home from work and goes straight to his room. Never comes out unless it's to go to the bathroom and even does the same thing on his days off. It's a rare occasion to see him talk to anyone aside from my mom in the house. 

Taking all this as the icing on the cake and adding in the fact that I was in a emotionally manipulative relationship for 4 years that left serious emotional scarring on me and depression making me extremely hesitant to pursue anyone else and several close friend/family deaths over the last year and a half (4), I've been at a all time low for what is close to two years now. The thoughts of self harm have always been floating in the very back of my head but I can easily say that they will most likely stay in the back forever. I can feel that I want to cry day in and day out, but I just cant. Nothing ever comes out anymore. I'm just tired of it all. Tired of this helpless feeling, tired feeling like I'm wasting away, tired of pretending to be happy, tired of day by day routines, I'm just tired of everything and I feel so lost. Just staring into a black hole waiting for some light to come out of it.

I got her Snapchat before I left that day we sent each other a couple goofy snaps then just stopped really communicating. Fast forward about 6 months we meet at the same event again this time we make plans to actually hang out. Me, her and a couple of friends hung out a week later. Then, that same week I took her to a concert I had an extra ticket for we had a ton of fun and laughed all night. I've hung out with her about every two weeks or so since then and talk with her on Snapchat every couple of days she somewhat recently broke up with her boyfriend and her friends had accidentally said in front of me she was planning to break up with him for the last couple months she got super shy when her friend said that she denied it. I ran into her the other day and I think her and her friend we're talking about me but I'm not 100% sure. What do I say to her to establish that I might be interested in taking our relationship further but at the same time not risk losing her as a friend? How do I know if she likes me back?

I graduated a rural high school in 2017 with no real idea of what I wanted to do, but accepted into a major uni for a Bachelor of Arts, which I deferred. 

I took 2018 off as a gap year, studied, travelled, but ended up stressing the last few months of it away, trying to figure out what I wanted to really wanted to study. And with no luck.

At this point, I feel my anxiety had gotten the better of me, and I opted for an easy online arts degree. 

I thought it was sorted, and was happy I finally had some sort of direction, but that’s quickly fallen apart. 

The course has just started, but I can’t shake the feeling it’s not meant to be. Ideally I’d like to be in the aviation field, but knowing how small, anxious and socially awkward I am, I don’t feel like this is something I’d survive.

Very confused about wether I should try and stick this course out (I only have a few days left before I can no longer opt out of financial obligation), or opt out and work this half of the year and hope I can find that thing that clicks for the second half of the year. 

Sorry for the long spiel, but thank you for reading. ",12Mar2019,1
307,"My mom was really abusive, mostly verbally and played emotional games, and sometimes physical. She didn’t take us out or ever let me leave the house, apart from one friend, once every few weeks for a day a week. 

I moved out as soon as I could (when I was 16) but I was too broke to do anything, too depressed, and started getting crippling headaches. I spent any time I was able to on trying to do college work, and then uni work, to secure a future, so continued to not live and stay at home.

Found out years later (when I was 23) that the horrific headaches that stopped me from doing much was actually a brain tumour that was slowly growing for years. I had an emergency operation to remove it, and they told me they don’t know how long I’ve got. I panicked - what have I actually done with my life? 

I survived but this put huge pressure on me to find meaning in my life. I went back to doing uni work immediately to try and graduate and secure a future because it was a degree you could get work in. I got ill again, less than a year later. I became practically bed bound for years after that and then I had my second operation. 

It’s only been in the past couple of years that I’ve finally been doing ok health wise, and my family aren’t in my life anymore. I get checks every so often but it’s unlikely to come back. Technically I’m finally feel free but I have a mess of a life to fix.

I can’t find work no matter what I do. I tried being honest on my cv (that I’ve only really done part time work, apart from starting my own business as soon as I was healthy enough, but it didn’t work out) and I’ve tried lying, well, changing dates around and not stating things were part time. The honest cv didn’t get me an interview, the lie did but they see right through it because my answers don’t hold up and I’m sure once I’ve got the job I would crumble too.

I feel like until now my life has been a waste. That I’ve been waiting to live it. I’ve got no money to live on at the moment. My partner provides for us both but we have nothing spare. We had to move somewhere really poor with nothing happening, away from friends, because we couldn’t afford anything else. 

I’m just spending most of my days in the house all over again, applying for jobs. I feel like I got a second chance at life, maybe a third chance, maybe even a forth if you count getting away from my family, and I’m just wasting it.  

I want a job so I can do what normal people do. Go out for meals, holidays, drinks with friends. etc but I can’t seem to get anything with my lack of experience. I can’t work in my degree field because I’m too far behind and it’s an industry you need to keep up with. My past work has just been part time in customer service and my skills are kind of useless - I’m good at drawing, and a little Graphic Design (not good enough at either to get a job in it and ironically it takes most of my day searching for work so I don’t have time to scrub up on either skill and they’re such tough industries to get into, I’d be up against people with tonnes of work experience anyway) 

I’m starting to really panic that I’m never going to get a chance at living life. Until it’s too late to enjoy anyway. I’m 31.  Plus I don’t know what life even means to me. I always thought my goal was to get a career I care about and travel the world (just going on holidays once a year or something) but that seems impossible right now. 

A career I care about would be tattooing or illustration but both take years, if you ever make it at all, so I can’t wait for that before starting to live. I’ve been wanting my whole life to just be able to live a normal life but it seems impossible whatever I try.

320,"Hi I am pretty new to reddit (so please bear with me) but I needed some insights from other people besides my friends. 
So it is basically as the title says, my dad caught me and my boyfriend almost having sex. That’s right, “almost”. 
Let me just lay out some background informations first: I am [23 F] and I have a boyfriend [21 M] of 3 years. Around our second year of dating, I started to introduce him to my family because he is my first boyfriend and I really love him. My mom liked him but my dad clearly did not like him. To be fair my dad does not even like the fact that I have a boyfriend. He says “I am too young to date”.  It obviously would be easier for me to date someone if I don’t live at home but I currently live at home since I commute to my college to save money. First year of college I lived out with my roommates but my dad constantly came to check up on me so it didn’t even feel like I was living out. My dad is very very controlling person. He used to be physically abusive but now he is just pretty mentally and verbally abusive but he denies it all. I don’t want to paint my dad as the villain or anything but thats how it really is. I used to be afraid of men because of him but my boyfriend is so very caring, loving and kind. I never met a guy who is so patient and nice. My boyfriend knows how bad my dad can be and he does not like my dad at all but tries very hard to be polite and nice to him because he knows how much family means to me. 

Anyways so one day I asked my boyfriend to come over to my house. I am just gonna skip some details but basically after he politely greeted my dad and when we were in my room, things happened and we were about to have sex. I told him to keep his shirt on and stuff just in case because even when we lock our doors, my dad would find it suspicious, but he took the shirt off. I was really scared of being caught and just very nervous about the fact that we were in the same house as my dad. I know it’s totally my fault I should’ve had more self control and should have stopped. But basically when we were about to get it on, my dad enters the room without knocking or anything and sees my boyfriend naked, basically on top of me, and all hell breaks loose. He accused us of things we didn’t do, yelled and called both me and my boyfriend names but when he kept on insulting me, my boyfriend got mad and talked back to him. I am not gonna list the things he said but it hurts me to this day. I was crying trying to stop him but soon it became a huge yelling scene and I had to push my boyfriend out of my house before anything worse happens. After I pushed him outside, my dad continued to yell at me and insult me, and told me that I better break up with him etc. He also said he is looking into arranged marriage for me and whatnot but I don’t want any of that I love my boyfriend. He was just being ridiculous. But I know I was at fault so I just took it all in while crying like a mess. My dad said his trust for me was broken now and I just feel so awful. I lived as if I committed a huge crime for these couple days. Obviously my boyfriend feels awful too and he’s worried about me but I am more worried about him. I just don’t know what to do I feel sorry and guilty but I also feel like my dad and we could’ve handled this much better, and I am sorry to my boyfriend. It actually has been some time since this happened and now every time I am going out, I have to tell my dad and maybe even send him pictures as proof. I go to school everyday and also have work during weekends so I only really have Fridays off after my morning class so it’s always been so hard to see my boyfriend, but now it’s much more difficult.

I also told my mom and she was surprised but she said “it’s okay you guys are both adults this these could happen” and comforted me instead. My boyfriend has done a lot for our family, driving long drives for us, helping us with groceries, buying things for us, helping us fix cars and much more. He is not a dumb person as my dad say he is, he is studying pre-med. My dad over exaggerates the situation saying that my boyfriend threatened to punch my dad and whatnot which is so not true. He said he never ever want to hear or see him ever again. He keeps referring to him wit bad names and it really hurts me. My mom told me it’s because my dad, who is extremely prideful man, got his pride hurt that he is acting more out like this. But I don’t know... I know I did wrong too but at the same time I wish he didn’t act like that. I wish none of this would’ve happened. I never liked my dad all that much but after this incident, it’s become so suffocating. I am still dating my boyfriend and I don’t intend on breaking up with him. I love him a lot. Please give me an advice on what I should do. My mom and my friends just tell me to ignore my dad but I just can’t. I am very haunted by all these mixed feelings. I feel depressed, stressed, and just overall very traumatized. I am sure my dad is traumatized too and I don’t know what to do. I have already apologized to him over and over again but should I be doing more? 

Yes, I am planning to move out as soon as I graduate and hopefully move in with my boyfriend, but I am afraid he will visit me again a lot. I know this is reaching right now, but I am also worried about what would come if I ever tell them that I want to marry him or something. 


TLDR;  Dad caught me and my boyfriend in act, they fought because dad kept insulting me and now dad tells me I have to break up with him no matter what. I am haunted by guilt and sadness because of this issue. ",12Mar2019,919

Speakers, music, shouting, screaming, banging, DIY, all day and night, every god damn day. They don't check their mail, they leave the hallways in an awful mess. I've done it all- polite and friendly chats, soft and hard letters, complaints through our apartment complex (won't touch it because there's a kid there) and even through our city (mostly same). I've even called the cops on them.

I have no friends, one time my friend came over when I was a little kid and mom said my friends were annoying and that really sank into me. And I guess I stopped making friends since then

Fast forward. I am now 25 no job don't know how to do anything. I want to get a job but even a simple cashier job requires me to have experience beforehand. I have been living inside a bubble my whole entire life. 

There were times when I tried to break out of the bubble like I tell them I don't want them doing things for me I want to learn how to do it myself, but they just get angry with me. Eventually I kind of gave up 

Anyways right now I guess my parents realized that they had been overprotective and they want to throw me out of the house but I have no money. 

They blame me saying that they have done the best they could to raise me up. Now they tell me what I should be doing with my life right now but I am not doing it. So they think I am taking them for granted and just trying to leech off of their money while not doing anything to get money

The thing is I have no idea what to do... I have applied for jobs but I guess no one wants me.

326,"Hi so I work at a certain fast food chain ( rhymes with shmuckdonalds) and we’ve always been told we are not allowed to accept tips. I’ve had a few sweet older people trying to hand me bags of fruit pastilles/other sweets or chocolate  ( I work in a retail park near a supermarket so most likely they have just purchased them) , and occasionally asking that I specifically keep the change or cash they hand me. This fast food chain has a very reputable charity we run and any change is meant to go in to the charity box. However , some customers insist that I personally take it and I have to tell them I’m not allowed. We have no pockets in our uniform for this reason and also to deter us from stealing ( not that anyone I know would) . Is it legal for our employer to do this?

328,"I would like some advice on how to handle this situation? Tl;dr at the bottom. 


My son (11) stayed at his friends house on Saturday night. The next day he went to the beach with his friends family, mother, friend and little brother. They are a family that goes to the beach a lot as they all surf. I picked my son up around 4pm on Sunday. I did not go to the house to get him as the family lives in a gated estate. I made my son meet me outside the gates as I picked him up whilst in the middle of  running errands.

I told him to have a shower when he got home. When he was finished he walked down the lounge room to where I was sitting with my husband. It's hot as balls at the moment in Straya so my son was just wearing pyjama pants and no shirt. I could see that from the waist up he was sunburnt, red raw. I asked him about it and he said that they spent 3 hours at the beach, the mother only gave him sunscreen once. In Straya in the hot weather, it should be applied hourly. I gave him some pain killers, rubbed him down with vitamin E cream and sent him to bed. He came down 5 minutes later saying his testicles hurt. This is not unusual for him as he usually gets chaffing when he swims. I had a look and they were a bit swollen and had a small red rash. Told him to put some vitamin E cream there and see how he feels in the morning. 

My alarm for work went off at 6:30 Monday morning, so I woke him up to tell him to get ready for school. He groggily said ""yeah, yeah"", so I continued getting ready for work. 5 minutes later he comes screaming into my room in a panic. He showed me his penis and it was blown up like a balloon. I called my boss, said it was an emergency. Called my husband, he was almost at work but turned around and came home. I dropped his little brother (8) at my mum's and went straight to the hospital. 

We went straight through to see a doctor. The head of his penis was swollen and his foreskin was trapped behind it. Doctor managed to push it gently all back into place. Then he was concerned about his testicles and ordered an ultrasound. After the ultrasound, the doctor told us we had to see a Urologist Surgeon at the bigger hospital half an hour away. Full panic mode set in. 

We arrived at the second hospital. After waiting for what felt like forever, the surgeon came down. He said his testicles were fine and he had swelling in his scrotum. They prescribed steroid cream to stretch and loosen his foreskin as it was tight and antibiotics for any infection he may have in his scrotum. 

Get home late Monday arvo. Does him up with medication, send him to bed for a good night's sleep. Tuesday morning (today) he says his sunburn is sore, have a look at there are now blisters covering both shoulders. Have to go to the pharmacy as hospital gave him tablets he couldn't swallow so was hoping the pharmacist may switch it for liquid. He says he can't do that, need a script. He says go to the local  doctor for that and also get the blisters looked at.

Go to the doctor, he says son has heat stroke and 2nd degrees burns to 1/9th of his body. He also says that he believes the swelling in both the penis and testicles is from the heat stroke. 

I am so angry with my son's friends mother. Is it neglect that she didn't look after him whilst he was in her care? I really want to call her and let her know all the pain and distress she has put my son and our family through. What would you all do? Am I over reacting or was she neglectful?

I was my mums first born child and up until age six I lived with my grandmother, who basically raised me and taught me everything I know today, mannerisms, how to eat with a knife fork, my alphabets, how to read, all the basic things a mum would do. 

And during these years that I stayed with my grandmother, my mum would be out working from 8am to 6pm and during those hours, the only thing I can remember her doing is either arguing with my grandmother or sleeping. Which means the only time I got to see her was when she was basically having a screaming contest with my grandma.
So fast forward a couple years I’m around eight years old and now we finally have a place to actually live on our own but unfortunately due to an abusive boyfriend she had, we moved around A LOT. This lead to a series of bad experiences and screaming matches. 

One event that actually affected me though was when we moved into our new home I was maybe around 14, and my mum had some sort of paranoia breakdown?? I don’t know how to describe but basically she thought I was putting bugs in her drinks and the AC, and that I was inviting strangers over in the middle of the night to tamper with the breaker. 
It got so bad to the point where she made me pack up all my stuff at 6am in the morning and kicked me out onto the streets. To sum up that era in my life I basically called my grandmother and moved back in with her for about a year until my mum came back and said for me to come back, idk why it took a year for her to come, maybe she was actually getting help but maybe it was just so she can get her child support money (I think this as a reason only because she didn’t even apologise once after that incident).

I moved in reluctantly and we moved around some more until finally now where I’m 17 and still not sure how to feel about my mum. I mean she’s my mum but she definitely doesn’t seem to care but when I point that out she says that she does and to appreciate all the stuff she’s done for me.

Basically, a friend has started being overly friendly. My problem is that I don't know whether she's just being assertive and friendly or she actually ""likes"" me.

Recently, she has started being quite noticeably aware of my presence. I think it's just to tease a lad that happens to be her mate, since she knows that she's *literally* obsessed with her. Emphasis on ""I think"".

She's been complimenting me more that pretty much anyone has ever, and being really touchy feely, if you know what I mean. And laughing at my jokes, that I know for a fact aren't funny. She also seems to be making a real effort to include me in things, but when it comes to messaging and that she's doing nothing at all. She's inviting me to do stuff with her friend group and I can't tell if there's anything in it.

In person she seems really into me but as soon as it comes to messaging me and that she backs off and puts nothing into it.

I *think* that she is just doing it to get under another lads skin (who is in her current group, that frequents the same club as us), because its thinner than single ply paper and that's just the way I think they seem to crack on with each other.

We took a taxi to his place and as soon as it dropped us off he pulled me close and started making out with me and I suggested we go inside.

Well we got right into it, three times but because of the alcohol he couldn't finish so he stopped and just wanted to cuddle and go to sleep which was surprising since all the guys I've been with previously either leave or expect me to the second after they finish.

He apologised and said that he feels bad because he thinks I'm worth so much more than just a drunk hookup and he wanted to make up in the morning...

And he definitely did, it was the best sex I'd ever had and he was so attentive and focused on me and we did it another four times.

But one thing made me wary. Not only did he want to cuddle and makeout all the time, he kept telling me how cute and beautiful I was and affectionately kissing my face and nuzzling my nose and cuddling me.

He also made me breakfast, bought me an ice coffee and wanted to make out when we were stuck at the lights. He added me on my social media accounts and has wanted to talk and hang out again.

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed feeling wanted and the affection and he was hot. But, I might be wrong saying this, it felt a bit like he really liked me and like he was considering me for a relationship which scares me in a way as there is a big age gap (I'm 21 and he's 28 turning 29). I don't know how that would work out.

Am I right or just overreacting? Should I be wary that he likes me as I just went into it as a hookup. Is this how things normally go as it's all new for me?

Maybe it was just the alcohol? He'd had 12 drinks. I'm confused as there seem to be differing opinions, ranging from ""avoid him he seems clingy"" or ""Because you've been treated poorly in the past being treated nicely seems odd"" so I don't know what to do.",12Mar2019,1

365,"First, i will go back to the doc but i just wanted to ask here if anybody has experience with this topic.

 So yea this happened. Right after the incident it started to bleed like hell under my toenail but it didnt fell of nor was it loose. So the couch fell on my nail not on my toe, so it wasnt broken.

So in the next few days i could walk but it hurt, my toe didnt break there was no shallow toe, only a full red-black nail with a relatively small wound under my nail.

So i went to the doc she said i should use some cream but otherwise just wait its gonna take a few months to heal. So its 1,5 years now and slowly the redish-black part of my toenail grew off so it looks normal again but still hurts if i do some physical activities, running ,jumping, squats.

Its not ingrown! It hurts beneath my toenail in the central area. Its not a big pain, i can still do my workout but still pain is pain and i wonder if it will ever stop to hurt. 1,5 years is a long time.

So what do you think why does it hurt? The nail looks almost perfect now just like before and just like my other toe looks like, i tried to press around my toe area to check if the pain comes from a bone or anything but no, my toe is perfectly fine and it only hurt under my nail and in the central area, so if i press the sides its totally fine.

Thanks! Any ides appreciated, i just want to know if its normal that s toenail injury that didnt fell of, the healing could take up 1-2 years. Its just so weird.

She asked me if my husband understood she would be moving in when she’s old.  I told her that we hadn’t talked about it and she reminded me that I promised when I was 10.   I was very distant with my mom during my marriage, but when I got divorced she was really there for me.  She had apologized for the way I grew up and we have done a lot of healing.  We spend a lot of time together and I call her at least twice a week and we see each other often.  I know this all sounds great and it is but I feel like she’s planting small seeds again.

I also feel like I have no real marketable skills. As far as people go, I’m very average. But, I don’t want to be average. I really would love to have a job that makes me feel like I’m doing something worthwhile, or having a positive impact on other people’s lives.

It took almost 3 hours to put all of the lightener in my hair. She was super sweet and I could tell is was a lot for her because I have a lot of hair. Unfortunately, she misjudged how long to leave it in my hair and instead of turning my dark brown hair, light brown to dark blonde, she bleached my hair. And the Ombre effect is completely lost.

She freely admitted to feeling sad and lonely when she last was “dating” him (once again, all via this messaging schedule), and also right now as she’s back in to lovewagon. I suggested gently that it might be better for her and her mental health to try and think about him less, lessen contact, and all and all basically move on. She’s sad. All the time.

Okay so I (24 F) moved in with a close friend (24M) about a year ago. He used to spend the majority of his time in the living room, getting high and watching TV. This didn't bother me that much, yeah he's untidy but it was manageable. The worst spot is his bedroom. Now, it's his bedroom so he can do whatever the hell he likes in there and I've been letting him off. I'd mention occasionally about tidying it up a bit, but he would brush it off. No worries, his space, his rules.  Except now theres a really bad smell leaking out of it through the rest of the house and it's really bothering me and my boyfriend. 

The smell is putrid, like sweat mixed with decomposing food, and just staleness (if that makes sense). He is hoarding the majority of our dishes in his room (all dirty with food/drink left on them). He has clothes and junk everywhere around his room to the point where you cant walk in and barely see the floor. 

He leaves his window open everyday, we bought him incense to burn and nothing is helping.

 How do I bring it up without hurting him? He's going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment and i don't want to make it worse but I also don't want to hate coming home to my apartment. Any tips?

Me and my friends went to a bar, this guy (not a friend) brings this girl. She’s good looking, smart, charming. She meets my friend, and starts insulting him and roasting him, which made me lol at first. But she finds out I’m a muslim, the girl starts insulting my
believes, saying how I should be a good muslim boy, assuming things like I have never fucked in my life and that I shouldn’t joke about things. Religion is a private thing, and it’s something which is dear
to me, what ever sin I commit is for god to judge.

Nor would I insult anyone’s beliefs and assume things about them in context to their beliefs, cos it’s not my fucking business. This girl then thought it’d be funny to insult my god. 

Ofc I didn’t say anything or say anything back to her. But i look back at the fact I never asked how my friend was cos she insulted him (he never brought it up) but i keep thinking he wasn’t cool with it.  I love a good

412,"I'm a 33F in a senior management position at a large corporation. Recently, one of my colleagues was promoted to become the boss of the team, after our previous boss left earlier this year to pursue another opportunity. The problem is that he's an absolutely awful manager. 

This individual has:

* Verbally mocked me (complete with eye rolling a couple of times) for personal accomplishments and even my appearance (making fun of my glasses one day).
* Asked me a very personal question in a one on one regarding pregnancy plans.
* Told me to stop being so goal oriented and to stick to what's just in my job description.
* Avoided, despite my requests for more transparent and direct communication, talking to me about my projects. I always receive news that something I'm doing is wrong (which is pretty much everything) through other people that don't even report to our team.
* He refuses to accept or openly comprehend my projects unless they fall in line with what he deems the ""right way to do things"" (which is actually the wrong way since his projects have all failed to this point). Meanwhile, others have absolutely no problem understanding them and the direction I'm taking them. He'll also ask me to explain them and then, after I leave the room, ask everyone else as if I was just speaking gibberish. 
* Excluded me from important conversations and events taking place on our team - such as hiring someone that would be reporting to me. I managed to find out and get included in a couple of interviews but he overruled my request to send someone an offer and sent it to a girl that ""excited him"" instead, despite her not being a good fit.
* Sent me into meetings and presentations with less than a handful of minutes to review the deck and content I'm to speak to. 
* Continuously changed his position to better suit himself and make me look like I screwed something up. 
* Micromanages even the most moot details of projects that have little significance.

Whenever I have had a discussion with this person about things such as the mocking, personal question, career advice, etc., I receive an excuse that it was just a language barrier/miscommunication and that what he *really* meant was something else. This seems to be a common occurrence. Overall he's also very insecure and has difficulty giving presentations or speaking to higher ups, fidgeting and stumbling through words constantly. I'm honestly surprised that he was deemed fit for this role. (Which I did toss my hat in the ring for.) 

Anyways... I'm not sure how to deal with this person at this point. It's utterly exhausting trying to cover my ass all the time and I'm beyond frustrated that I can't just continue leading my projects. I have no trust or respect for this person, despite trying to be as understanding and forgiving as possible. I've raised some of my concerns with upper management but have just been instructed to talk to him about the issues, with them defending his communication, which never leads to any positive change. 

I do enjoy my role and want to stay in this field but he's toxic and making my life utterly miserable at work. I'm almost instantly in heightened stress mode by the time I start work every day, wondering what's next down the line and worrying about how I need to cover myself. There's also usually some sort of event that happens first thing to set the day off. I have dealt with diminishing managers in the past but usually had more of a code monkey type of job where I didn't have to deal with them on a regular basis. I also know that I can put my own managerial skills to work to ""manage up"" but it just seems so utterly exhausting and like this is a lost cause. 

I make good money and just started university part time so I really don't want to lose that or overwhelm myself, either. I try to live as healthy a lifestyle as I can to combat stress, too - yoga, meditation, running, eating healthy, taking some ""me"" time. It's becoming a real challenge not to let him get to me.

There's a chance that our department may have a re-org in the summer but I'm not sure if that will actually happen and what that might create. Otherwise, there's not much else in our department and I'd rather not leave this department for the sake of my career.  I know I should just ""bide my time"" but that's easier said than done.

Today is one of biggest days of my life, I am getting a very experimental surgery. Even my surgeon is resilient to talk about it, or even under take (he is the most specialized doc in his field). 

I have a severe AC separation(Grade 5) but along with that I have a severe Brachial Plexus injury. The hard part is that they are linked together, two different injuries with the same foundation/problem. I am getting a very altered Weaver Dunn procedure with a hook plate. I am also getting someone else's hamstring as a new ligament. 

The hard part is my nerves are severely damaged due to the AC seperation to the point I have almost lost all function and feeling in my right arm. I am at about 2/5 strength and only 20% feeling in my whole arm. My surgeon is hesitant to proceed but I do and it is my decision. The consequences are having a dead arm, no feeling and not even the smallest motor skills. Basically losing my whole arm.

418,"so i’m trying to move out of Ohio by next November-January and i’m having difficulties narrowing down where i should go. i work for a company that has locations all over the US and has the potential for me to transfer easily. i’m originally from California but also grew up in the greater Detroit area in Michigan, and recently relocated to my mom’s basement Ohio to save up as much money as possible. i’m a single woman in her mid 20s who prefers to live alone (and so i’m considering buying a home since renting can be expensive). i don’t need to live right in a downtown area and having grown up in apartment complexes my whole life i kind of like the idea of being in a neighborhood, just not the suburbs (if that makes sense? lol) 

here are some things i’m looking for in terms of relocating:
-affordability 
-strong arts community (i’m a poet and a dancer. i’m also a big music junkie and a budding producer)
-warm weather is a big thing for me, but i’m open to colder states if the feel is right 
-walkability (i have a car, but after commuting for years i miss just leaving my house and walking to stores/bars/entertainment/etc)
-culture 
-diverse demographic 
-nature/scenery (i like to hike, go to the beach, skateboard, run outside, explore, etc)
-strong political community (i have a degree in political science and care a great deal about being involved with racial/social/environmental justice as well as nonprofit organizations) 

if you know of any places that encompass most or all of these things please let me know! i’m currently looking around at places in the south and southwest, but i’m struggling to come across a place that really sounds like me. thanks in advance!

TL;DR My boyfriends past fuck ups are haunting him every day and causing an extreme worsening of his depression. I have forgiven him for what he has done to me but he won’t forgive himself. I want to do something to try to cheer him up so what have you done for you SO’s that had similar mental health issues?

I love him, more than anything. He is my soulmate and I am his, and I really know this to be true. Recently he has been having a really hard time. He suffers from PTSD from abusive parents and an overall terrible childhood (moving countries/ dealing with immigration issues). 6 months into dating he was kicked out by his step mother and came to live with me and my family. He ends up getting his own place about 3 months after but he still stays with me the majority of the time. My mother sees him as a son and my sisters see him as a brother. I know he doesn’t feel like he belongs though and I don’t expect him to. I just want him to feel welcome at least and he gets more and more comfortable every day. He had been smoking pot since I met him, and I knew it was partially because of what he went through and partially because it was ‘in’ with his friends at school. Well he graduates HS (late due to immigration issues) and his habit becomes an addiction. He is smoking every day and doesn’t see an issue- he isn’t himself. We talk about it and I try to be understanding and empathetic. 

He goes to visit his step sister in a city close to us and ends up cheating on me in a night with his step sisters roommate while high on mdma, drunk and he had been smoking 24/7 for the 3 days he was there. This caused a massive breakdown on my part (I do suffer from mental illness but this isn’t about me). He decided he wanted to leave everything and move in with them and at this point I thought he had a psychotic break. I took him to the city and drop him off at their apartment and meet the girl he cheated on me with. I keep my composure and ask them to take care of him because what will being angry do? I think this is the last time I am seeing him. He leaves all of his stuff with me (phone, clothes etc.) because he wants to start fresh. I had expressed my thoughts that this was a bad idea but he needed to cleanse. I know now him saying that was him mostly coming down from the molly. Well 3 days later he shows up at my work erratic. He is screaming and really angry with me, saying he heard my voice and was angry I didn’t leave him alone (we weren’t in contact). This really was his low point, but the things he said in this state broke me and I ended up in the hospital in a mental health rehab for a few days after this encounter. I gave him the keys and deleted his number. 

2 weeks later his sister (biological) and her husband contact me (they had been on their honeymoon overseas and were the closest parental figures he had). They told me they went to see him and he didn’t want to talk to them (he had went back to the city with his step sister only to be asked to leave and went back with his step mother). They were upset because they had to pay for the rest of his lease and that he fucked up basically. I then contacted him and saw him that night and he looked terrible, like the life was drained from him. He hugged me when he saw me and I broke down, I still loved him so much. I see him the next night and he alluded he was going to take his life until I called. I told him I was willing to be there for him. He took me up on that and came back to live with me, my mother welcomed him.

During the last month (being that his freak out was end of january) we have been working every day to rebuild trust. Truth be told I forgave him, he needed it more than I wanted to be angry. He is sorry, he apologizes every day. But this has taken a toll on him and made his depression worse. The mdma he claims opened his eyes and he gets really upset because he thinks he is critically judged. He feels hopeless because of his immigration status. My mother just started a petition to become his legal guardian in order to petition in court he was an abused minor etc etc. The main point of this I want you all to take is that I have forgiven him, he has grieved and realized his wrongs and every day he works to make sure I know I can trust him and I do. People fuck up and this was a *massive* fuck up.

He won’t forgive himself. What prompted me to write this was him telling me last night he thought about killing himself. Being an attempt survivor myself I panicked, knowing that feeling. I sympathized with him all night and tried to talk him down and I eventually did. In the morning he told me he was okay and just felt really impulsive. I ended up reaching out to his brother in law (who is still mad at him from the lease issue) begging him to reconcile. My boyfriend had recently reached out to his sister who was very unforgiving. I feel like as his family she should at least try, is money really everything?

What can I do for him. I’m being patient and kind and letting him talk 24/7 but I want to do more, something unique. He talks about not finding joy in things he used to do. I made an appointment for him with a therapist (this was put off for so long due to financial issues). I want to do something else for him. I love him so much and I want to do something special. Basically I’m asking for ideas from the reddit relationship advice community (: Thank you

427,"(Background:) Hey all, 17F. After a bad breakup I got on Bumble to match with a guy I knew from an old program in college that I attended with him. As acquaintances I thought he would be a good rebound but eventually backed out because I literally just left my ex and I needed time alone/wanted to get back with my ex. He was ok with hanging out and just being friends, but we got to texting about politics.


He is a very left-wing individual, very pro-socialism/healthcare/free college, etc. I expressed that I am likely aligned with Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan because I believe they have some interesting ideas and are generally considered centrist. I was called an alt-righter despite being POC/LGBT/what have you, even though I’ve both framed my interest in JP’s ideas due to an inherent cynicism and negative attitude toward the world (BPD/mental illness) along with the fact that I never act in a violent, negative manner to minorities of any kind. I am a transmedicalist (believe trans people need dysphoria to be trans) but respect pronouns and identities and in general am in support of diverse genders and sexualities. I also expressed I don’t particularly care for gender fluidity but also do not care to disparage or be derogatory towards such individuals. They also make a really small percent of our population which is also why this is not a big deal to me. I also expressed the fact that biphobia is a mainly first world problem that I was not interested in due to bi people’s ability to be “straight passing”. He basically threw me a pity party for my beliefs and implied my views are extremely wrong/literally Hitler.


I consider myself a center liberal but I’m afraid I will be doxxed and sacrificed to call-out culture going forward. He seems to think my personality disorder is painting the way I view the world, which could be true, but again, I’m not quite sure he won’t try to use my (very distinct name) on social media platforms and post our conversations. He said he’s sure I’m a nice person and when I stop hating the world so much, I’ll realize mt limitations, which I appreciated, but seemed condescending enough to me that I’m hoping he’ll leave me alone and assume I’m struggling with my own shit. To be honest I originally identified as apolitical because I really don’t have a lot of knowledge or beliefs that I act on politically, ans generally keep my politics and views private. I feel terrible that I shared these potentially controversial statements with him and have been stewing in fear every day that the SJW hivemind will come after me and wreck my reputation. He is also someone who is trying to get into apitoo Hill and work upwards so yeah idk. I’m really nervous... I’ve been such a wreck...

I'm studying Interior and Spacial Design at uni and my latest brief is redesign an old building to create a safe space to combat loneliness. I myself have dealt with it in the past after the untimely passing of my uncle. He was more like an older brother to me as he was closer to my age than to my dad, so when he died I spiralled a bit. I isolated myself from friends and family to the point where I ended up breaking down and not attending my college classes for over a month. I was lonely and depressed and I never want to go back to that place again. Its been just over 2 years now since my breakdown and the recovery process has been long and tiring but now I'm on the mend and I want to create the best space I can for this project. I could use my own experiences, but to create the most effective space possible I need to talk to as many people as possible.

I'm thinking about creating this space to help combat loneliness primarily in those who have suffered from the loss of a loved one and are still in the process of grieving. For this I need to know what people would like in a in a space solely dedicated to helping them. Despite my focus on post-loss loneliness, input from anyone suffering will be greatly welcomed regardless of situation.

**In essence, all I'm asking is that if you were to go to a designated space designed to help you combat your loneliness; a place where you can meet with other people also suffering; a calm and welcoming space just for you; what would you want? This can be anything from optional therapy, comfortable spaces, games etc etc.**

Sorry the post has been long! If you aren't comfortable responding on this thread, I'll happily answer direct messages. Wishing you all the best :)

I didn't get specific answer, but later that friend of hers told her about this, and she got mad at me, not for asking if she's interested but for ""talking about her behind her back"". Since than she did everything to piss me off, said some things, which she later apologized for, but we were at least talking and texting with each other, more rarely than before but still. Until we had a talk about this whole situation, and she told me that she got hurt and still needs some time, and also told that she still thinks that I want something more from her. I don't know if I made a mistake there or not, but too smooth out the situation I told her that I just want to be friends. And from this point everything went to shit. She stopped texting me completely, started avoiding me, and suddenly started talking about her boyfriend (a guy that she never was interested in). From this point her behaviour towards me started being really strange. One week she was talking with me almost normally, other she was avoiding me as best as she could. Also she started to look really depressed and she generally behaves strange and tensed once when I show up nearby.

441,"Hello. I am just a regular Joe who is currently 23 years old. I'm working full time right now at a company, but on the weekends, I drive down an hour to my church, where I help serve the youth group there.

One of my youth group students started bowling and likes it a lot, so it his parents wanted to find him a bowling ""tutor"" to help him get better. I told his dad that I could do that on the weekend, since I'll be down in the area anyway.

We get to talking and he was mentioning the logistics and what not, mentioned that for the first lesson, he wants to be present with us, then from then on, he asked if I could pick up his son from his house and then drop him back off afterward. He said he would pay more if this was the case. I said that should be fine, and asked him how much he would be willing to pay. He said $30 and he would pay for the games we play for the hour lesson, which I reluctantly said okay to. Keep in mind also, I did not have a chance to look up how far the bowling alley and his house was at the moment, I only had a very general idea.

I looked it up just now. From my friend's house (who's house I stay at on the weekends for church), their house is 21 minutes away (around 9 miles). From their house to the bowling alley is 27 minutes away (around 12 miles). This means that even without including the commute from my friend's place to the pick up and drop off, it is almost an hour of driving and 24 miles round trip.

I am wondering how much I should take. I'm thinking more. My friend brought up a point of that if I was still in college, $30 would be fine, but since I am working now and my time is worth something, I should've at least taken $40 an hour just of the lesson themselves. However, I am not a professional bowler, just bowled in high school (team captain :D), and I do believe I have enough credentials to be teaching this student (multiple awards and trophies).

This guy and his parents are church members of mine, so I do not want to take too much money. And the person who taught me everything I know about bowling, who is also a pastor of a different church now, told me to just accept the least amount possible. I would've been more than okay with $30/hr if it was only just meeting them at the alley and then leaving afterwards to do my own thing, but now that we add the 1 hour (24 mile) round trip into the equation, I do not know where to go from here? Can anyone offer some advice to me? Thanks in advance!

TL;DR 1 hour bowling lesson was changed from just doing the lesson and leaving, but parent asked for me to pick up and drop off child after the lesson, which adds a total of 1 hour commute (24 miles) round trip on top of the lesson. Offering $30 + games played paid, but trying to raise it to a reasonable price.",12Mar2019,5

When we’re alone it gets very intimate between us 

I already know we’re going to have sex soon but we don’t have condoms and I don’t know where I could even get them 

My parents would never buy condoms for me or let me buy condoms because they are very religious, they would be mad if they found out me and my girlfriend kissed each other already, they’d be pretty mad if they found out that we are starting to get intimate

My girlfriend has the same conditions with her parents 

QUESTIONS - 

Where can I get condoms without them knowing  ?

If I go to a store to get them how would I buy them behind their back? (They would have to bring me to the store because of the area we live in we can’t walk)

Where could I hide condoms so that they couldn’t find them?

Should I feel guilty for having a sexual relationship behind their backs at this young?

TL:DR - I am a freshman in highschool with over protective parents. where can I get condoms behind my parents back? If I get them how could I hide them without them finding out? Should I feel guilty for doing this?

Ps. I’m not trying to paint them in a bad light, I feel like I could go to my parents and ask for condoms when I’m about to have sex when I’m a little older (16,17) but I’m only 14 turning 15 so that would probably be too young for them

446,"Hello,

I'm an emotional roller-coaster. Here's some background information. 

 My father is utter shit. Besides being controlling, mean, inaffectionate, demeaning and a liar, he's also lifelong gambling addict. I'm talking full-blown addict, every day, lost his inherited wealth, never set himself up or us for the future, past due bills, etc. I was in debt by the age of 16 because he was already putting credit cards in my name to gamble with. He did the same for my siblings. I've had to pay all of my schooling out of my pockets or with student aid/loans. On top of being a terrible father, he was a terrible husband for all the same reasons. However, I felt like he was obsessed with my mom and still is, in an unhealthy way. Not in an ""love"" way, but a ""trophy wife"" way. I feel like we were just the byproduct of their sex. I don't feel like he ever actually wanted kids. At least, that's what his actions tell me. 

I grew up with my parents constantly arguing. Like every single day at one point. He's was verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive to her and to us. He even got physically abusive a couple of times with me, specifically. He's grabbed her arm and pusher her out of the way too when she was hiding money that he wanted to gamble with. It got so bad near the end, we'd hide in our rooms when he would come home. No one wanted to deal with him. 

Last year, we finally left the bullshit. Free at last. 20 plus years of living with an addict was finished. I was happy to escape from the trauma of the drama of every day fighting to finally have some peace. I'm in my late 20's, but still live ""at home"", due to cultural reasons. They don't allow us to leave the home unless we're married. I'm a senior in college and a couple of semesters away from graduating with a finance degree. I already have a co-op with a big company locally which starts next week. Things are going well. I'm in a stable environment, we're paying our bills. I'm finally at peace. However, it's all going to come crashing down if my father has anything to do with it.

My dad has been calling my mom every other day to beg her to come back home. You know how many times he's called me in the last year? Twice. We've been gone for nearly a year. He's saying he'll change, things will be different this time and a whole bunch of promises. He's even getting his family members in on it. My aunt pressures me every time she sees me. My grandparents do the same. My other aunt calls my mom all the time about it. It's absolutely ridiculous. They didn't live in that house with him. They are the ones that enabled him to be how he is now for years. They have absolutely no right to get involved. My mom has been trying to talk to me about moving back. I don't know if it's Stockholm syndrome or what, but she's so back in forth. She tells people she's happy here and finally at peace, but then she tells me we should move back. I'm dead set against it. I don't trust him at all. I'm still working on MYSELF to get past the trauma they both put me through and I can't do that in that environment. I don't believe a word he says.  He's yet to call me about it. Zero conversations about it. He's yet to go to rehab. He says he'll do it if we move back. He says we can control the finances. My mother is believing these promises and is putting me in the middle. 

I'm just extremely hurt, confused and frustrated. I know I'm not going crazy. I feel like I'm justified to feel how I feel. I just don't know how to proceed. Our lease is up in a few months. If they move back, I really don't want to move back with them. If I move out, that will sever my relationship with my completely and I'm really close to her. I know in my heart that my dad is not being genuine. If he was, he would have changed. He would have called his kids more when we moved out. He would have made attempts to see us. He would have gone to rehab. He's done nothing, he's just saying he will. He's been a lifelong addict and he's been who he is all his life. In his mid-50's why would I think he would change? I just don't believe it. How should I proceed?",12Mar2019,1

448,"When I was a teenager, I just got out of a situation involving child abuse and a court case about it that made things pretty heavy on me at the time. At school, I obviously didn't have any friends, got bullied a lot, yada yada, you know the deal. There was this one guy who confessed to liking me (after admittedly having bullied me, too) and because I was weak and naïve and pretty desperate for any kind of human affection at the time, I said yes. That was a grave mistake.

While things started out sweet enough, he soon turned out to be very manipulative and controlling. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair or dress in ways that I wanted because I had to be ""representative"" for his friends, which weren't few in number either, btw. He knew *everyone* in town, and outside of town, and their parents. He just knew everyone. He was good friends with everyone and he was the most charismatic person out there and everyone liked him. I never had a really good connection with my family and especially not at that time, because I was a bit of a difficult child back then. Yet, within a few months he had phone numbers from several family members and regularly talked to them -about me. He often would try to use them to uncover things about me that I didn't want to tell, mostly about he aforementioned child abuse situation that I, for obvious reasons, didn't want to talk about. Especialy not since he often asked very confronting and blatant questions about it without seeming to care about whether or not I felt comfortable with it. I remember him once threatening me in a similar way as to how the abuser would, just to see in what way I would react.

He has also taken advantage of me sexually. When my cat died, he came to pick me up from school that day to comfort me. At the end of that day, he wanted me to undress for him to return the favor. I was not yet naturally sexually active at that time, so every sexual act he made me do (he was pushy as shit) felt uncomfortable. He knew this.

&amp;#x200B;

After I eventually gathered all my courage to finally get rid of him, things took a turn for the worse. He would often be outside of my house exactly at moments I had to be outside, and tried his best to remain friends with me. One day, however, he or a friend of his had made a erotic roleplay account on some shady site with *my* character I used for Dungeons and Dragons at the time. He sent screens of that account to my parents, telling them I was behind it, and since I didn't have a very good bond with them, they believed everything he said. I wasn't allowed on the internet for the next two years. A friend of his who believed the story too messaged me that day that he would break my neck if I ever pulled something like that on him again.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this happened six years ago. a year or three ago he somehow found out I had a certain social media at the time and messaged me there every now and then until I got the courage to block him. Same went for another social media somewhere in that same time period. No matter what I do, he always manages to find me on social media, and when he does, he leisurely talks to me as if nothing ever happened. On rare occasions do I encounter him irl, and even then he seems happy to see me, walks along as if he doesn't have anything better to do and tries to have some friendly small talk. He calls me his friend, he asks if I wanna go places with him. He was around on the social media I currently use for a while too before I finally had the courage to block him there. I'm even scared he'll read this and know this is about him. He always comes back and finds me, but stays lowkey enough about it that nothing he does is punishable by law or provable. 

I currently study psychology and.. what can I say? A lot of his traits add up to what *could* possibly be a psychopath, and while I've always had my suspicions and I'm currently in my bachelor's so I am in no position to actually diagnose someone, it feels dreadful. I don't want to be scared anymore of this guy, my ex from 6 shitting years ago, still tracing me down to the point that I have to be extra discreet about my bus times and online activity.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (F21) and my family live in the same ground* but n separate houses with my aunt and my cousin (M20) we don't get along well because my aunt likes to blame my father for everything since they were kids..., they have to move away because their house isn't safe (because of the last earthquake in my country), so they choose to leave alone their dog on their house with an awful made ""fence"" (that was useless because the dog could scape anyways) they have left about 15 days ago and we bath and feed the dog because they come to feed it one time every two days or so. The poor dog kept barking all the first five days.
On Friday when my brother (M25) is leaving to university the dog run out as fast as it can and my brother gets stuck on the door because of his backpack. He searched for it for ten minutes and come back to tell my mom, he leaves to college because he was having a important meeting with his thesis assessor (?) And my mom took her car and went to look for the dog. Nothing.
We told them about that. ""Your dog escape again""
At the 7pm I was alone with my brother.
My cousin enters in the house without asking first and ask my brother about his dog in a very agressive way, as if taking care of him was my brothers obligation. Cousin told him that he doesn't give a fuck about his college, that he is going to help him found his dog, I repeat, the dog that they weren't taking care of... My bro is a very calm person so he just nodds. My cousin leave and slaps the door.
I forgot to say that for years ago they let one of our dogs (a puppy) escape and they didn't tell us, I found it dead on an avenue, a car killed it.
We didn't complain. It was an accident...
So now, my cousin is full of anger and wants to ""talk"" with my brother because ""they made a deal""... He even blame us because my aunt have a facial paralysis after the problem of the dog.
Almost tried to threaten us ""I don't know if something is going to happen or not...""
So, we search for the dog the first day (including me when I came back to school) but because of his attitude we don't want to do anything. We're just waiting the exact moment to put a demand on him if he hits my brother or if he kill our two dogs.

So, what do you think

464,"I'll be attending grad school this fall and have cut my decision down to two possible schools. One is in a neighboring state next to me in the midwest, while another is in North Carolina. If I attend the midwest school, I will likely end up working in my home state, allowing me to live by family and friends. 

Downside of this option is that i am starting to hate the midwest. The weather seems to really put a damper on your quality of life and what you are able to do. I attended undergrad in Texas where the weather granted you the option to live a much more exciting and comfortable life.

If I attend the NC school, I will be going in knowing only one person in the entire state. I have no other connections there or elsewhere in the southeast, which is where I'll likely end up working. The area of work I am going to school for (law) isn't exactly known for your ability to be able to make friends once you are working, either. The tradeoff here is that I will not have to resign to living the rest of my life dealing with midwest weather. I also believe this school can grant me better career success.

Due to unfortunate personal reasons, I will not be attending grad school back in Texas. 

For people who have any experience with this kind of thing, or really just anyone else with an opinion, what route should I be leaning toward?",12Mar2019,1

469,"Full story before is on my previous post but long story short- 

Girl at work was acting incredibly hot and cold with me, playfighting and generally acting weirdly around me. This was happening for around a year. I asked her what was happening, she said nothing was going on and it’s just her personality. That she’s never treated me any differently. 

6-7 weeks on, carrying on straight after the ‘chat’-
She is messaging and trying to get close to my best friend obsessively in work, who she’s never really bothered with before. She has came in on his break privately and just talked exclusively about me, an example of what she was saying: ‘oh she has 2 days off in a row here, she’s been working split shifts the last few weeks’
(Baring in mind I’ve been completely off with her, not really speaking to her, and vice versa coming from her)
Every shift she is bringing me up to him, saying pointless things like ‘oh I must be so much taller than her’, she’s telling stories about me in front of other people too. Every shift. Any time she has an opportunity, she brings me up it seems. 

She’s even been chatting to other people about me in front of me, without me being involved in the conversation. At this point I was still keeping her at an arms length. 
Gradually I’ve got to the point where I’m being a bit warmer with her, and she’s been nice as pie to my face. 
Now she’s being really weird, every conversation I’m having with other people, she’s interrupting and taking the subject away. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone without her butting in. 
But then she’s doing me favours and trying to make sure I’m okay in work (I’m getting shafted a little bit by my manager)
To be honest, it’s making me uncomfortable how she’s acting with me, and how she keeps talking about me. It seems like she’s escalating and she’s trying everything to get what she wants. Which i don’t know what she could want from me. I’m being civil with her but yet she’s not relenting. 

Should I confront her or try to talk to her about it or just try to ignore it? It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to see her.

I have read all the statistics etc. but when a rare accident does occur, (like the recent Ethiopian Airlines flight), the anxiety of flying just gets worse and worse.

474,"I'm not going to freak out by assuming the worst, so I want to ask if someone else has some similar symptoms to me.  (the doc just gave me anti-anxiety meds and nothing else, btw).  So when I'm cold, tired, or hungry (and other times too) my brain sometimes has a thought like ""curl hand"" and it automatically curls to an awkward position.  I look down at my hand and try to turn off the signal, but it's like someone's holding the on/off switch behind their back and switching it from hand to hand as I guess and fail.  Eventually I get it right and my hand returns to normal.  This is just one of many symptoms, but it seems to relate to many of them.  One related symptom is that I can be mid-thought and blurt out whatever word I was on in the sentence I was thinking about because I guess I switched tracks from ""think"" to ""speak"".  Can anyone relate?  An interesting note is that I can almost feel the pressure of public so the speaking one doesn't happen then, but the hand thing still does.

475,"So one of my best friends for nearly ten years lately has seemed just really cut off and like she doesn’t tell me anything anymore. And really I suppose so far from what I know it’s not like it’s anything too big that she’s not telling me just small things that we would normally tell each other and it’s getting really frustrating. And when I ask her about these things because I know theres hidden things she lies to me and I just can’t confront her about it because she would get defensive if I did and I just don’t know what to do so I just pretend to go with it. And so I myself will end up not telling her as much because why should I given that she doesn’t? But if I withhold things then she gets upset with me like she has the right when she does the same thing. And I’m just so lost on what to do.


Also on a related but different topic, I’ll start out I don’t have many friends, in fact I have just 2. One of them is who I’m talking about above. I’ve been friends with both of them for the same amount of time (nearly 10 years) which presented a complicated problem as they never liked each other, which made things really complicated and frustrating and just in general upsetting, having two friends in the world that I love and would trust with anything, but not being able to hang out with the two of them together and in general pretending the other doesn’t exist when I’m with one. Obviously I wanted so much so for them to be friends with each other and just have a functioning friend group. Well be careful what you wish for. After trying for years since I’ve known them they are friends. Now isn’t that great? No. I feel like they are now better friends with each other then either of them are with me despite have strongly disliked each other before I even knew either of them. And now I feel like I’m always left out. Like I’m the third wheel. Like when ever all 3 of us are together like I’m just there, irrelevant and useless. As they just talk and laugh amongst the 2 of them and I sit there and end up feeling like I am just eavesdropping like I’m not supposed to be there. And it really hurts. I just feel like I’m losing everyone and I don’t know what to do. It just really hurts.",12Mar2019,2
476,"I’m an 18 year old guy and for the past 2 years, I am unable to wake up to alarms. I don’t have any idea what’s causing this and I don’t know what to do to fix it. 

I’ve tried everything in the book. Different alarm sounds, new alarms clocks every few months, multiple alarms set for the same time. Nothing works. It also doesn’t matter how much sleep I get or what time the alarm clock(s) are set, I never wake up to them. 

I’ve run late to school and work several times because of it. I even have to have my parents or my brother wake me up and they usually have to physically wake me up from shoving me in my bed. 

Sometimes, I wake up to the alarm clocks blaring several minutes and even hours after I should’ve woken up. Other times, I wake up and they’re silent meaning somehow I turned them off in my sleep or woke up and turned them off before I was fully conscious. 

Concerning my sleeping patterns, they’re not good. I may only get 6 hours a night during the week and I also have a terrible time falling asleep.

477,"Oh, boy, I'm sorry this is so long
We went to the same technology center together in highschool for 2 years, before then I didn't know him at all. The first year we were mostly acquaintances, but I hadn't had any friends since middle school so him even talking to me was a miracle. I ended up making friends with everyone in that class and am even living with 2 of them right now.

Him and I hung out a lot during that summer, that's where the friendship really grew. We would stay up all night talking on the phone and I told him my tragic backstory ™ and he told me his.

Next year of school starts and my boyfriend has gone away for college. Every time he visits me we just do sexy things and I feel like nothing more than a blow-up doll.
I tell best friend about this and he gives me plenty of advice. I appreciate it very much, but most of it obviously involves confrontation with boyfriend. Me being too scared of being left can't do it. Cycle for the next few months ends up being:
Update friend on situation, friend gives advice, me can't take advice, situation gets worse, repeat.

I'd like to say here that I never just dumped my problems on him. He was the one who insisted I tell him, but he never told me his problems back even though I wanted to help him too.

Around December he's starting to become distant. Not texting me as often at first, then ignoring me completely in class. I can't take this. I breakdown in class and leave. It was also right before Christmas break, so I had gotten him a gift before this started happening. His main in Smash Bros is Kirby so I got him a little Kirby figurine.
At the end if class I give it to him and say, ""Here's your present, you can throw it away if you want"". He says, ""Why would I throw it away"" but at that point I'm already in tears and out the door.
He messages me that night. I'm so salty and confused and hurt that I just point out that he doesn't have to text me because I got him a gift and he'll feel bad if he's not nice to me. He apologizes and says he's just been dealing with some feelings. I understand and after a talk we are now better friends than ever.

Shortly after my friend says that he wants to hangout and talk. We do that all the time so I don't understand why he's being so serious about it but say okay.

We're in my car in a bowling alley parking lot when he drops the bomb.
""I've had a crush on you all this time.""
Honestly to be honest not that surprised, as he was caring for me more than he was our other female friends.
Also am very surprised because at that point in time I didn't believe anyone was capable of really liking me. Or loving me. Hence the abusive relationship.
But that's exactly why he told me, so I would know someone could like me. Someone could love me. Not so he could get in my pants.
We both cry and I say thank you, unsure of how else to handle situation. It was a very sweet and brave thing for someone to do.

Time goes by.
He comes to my graduation.
That's the last time I saw him as my best friend.

We never really hung out over that summer. He had 2 jobs and my job was short staffed. I could feel the distance growing between us so I made plans to hang out at the bowling alley. We played pool and it was like the distance never happened.

That was the last time we hung out.

I didn't want to let him go. He was distancing himself from me just like before but now I didn't see him everyday so it was easier for him to do so. I tried so hard to text him and keep in touch, but once he decides to do something he is set on it.

I move away from home. Only 2 hours away, but I obviously won't be around much anymore. I ask if I can see him before I leave. He says yes.

I come to his house. His birthday was during the Summer and despite everything I still got him a present. He likes Sudoku and Math so I got him this huge book of this game that combines both. He says thank you. I also got him this pendant. It's one of those moon phase memory things you see advertised on Facebook and whatnot all the time. Cost me a bit of money, but I thought it was worth it for him.
What was the moon phase? The first day we ever met. The first day of school with him. He said thank you.
Then we parted ways.

I thought he would try to keep in contact after that. Nope.
Couple of months go bye. Out on the town with my roommate. Get home to a message from him saying.
""Sorry for being away so much, but can you call me when you get home? I have something I need to talk about with you.""

I call him immediately.
He basically friendship breaks up with me.
Says that he's constantly worried about me and my well being. Says he can't keep falling for me. Says he hopes my situation get better. I say I understand. He says he doesn't know if he will come back. And that I'm the best friend he's ever had so far. End of conversation.

Now, 6 months later, I still have dreams about him. About how we make up and are best friends again. Or at least friends.
I want for us to be friends again. I miss him.
But what I want more than that is to know if he's okay. If this really did help him. I can't stop wondering if he's still messed up because of me.
That's what keeps me up at night.
He hasn't blocked me yet. I could still message him.
But I'm also scared it will bring back unwanted feelings for him and ruin any progress he's had.
The selfish part is wondering if that will ruin any chance I had of getting him back. 
And that's the question for this whole story:
Should I message him just to see if he's okay, or would that hurt both of us in the end?

TLDR: My best friend of 2 years cut me out of his life and I don't know if I should check up on him 6 months later and risk hurting both of us, but getting closure.",12Mar2019,1
478,"So I'm gonna start from the very beginning. 
So there was this girl in year 4 I liked, its year 9 now, but it seems she has this effect on new kids that they like her first out of all the girls (like first crush), I went to this school in year 4 and there she was, I liked her duhh... In year 5 the whole class made easter cards and being the idiot I am I said I had no one to give it too, the class was empty and the teacher said well just give it to someone, so put of impulse I opened her desk drawer thing and put it in. It had my name on it think. So year 6 comes around and I know her a bit more I have spoken to her but my heart would race. It wasn't a good sight. Later in the year we took a flight as a class to go to another state. Off topic for a moment I was bullied a lot. Well there was a dumb f**k who was in the class and would make fun of me and my weight , I was a little bit overweight in my younger years but I didn't like hearing it. Well we stood on a bridge and the idiot said get if the bridge it's gonna collapse. Then out of nowhere my hero, the girl says he's not fat he can stand on the bridge it won't fall. He shut up. I thanked her. She smiled. Year 7 was a good year my grades were up she was in my class and we sat together, like all the time we had another friend who also sat with us which I was fin with she's also a girl. There was a boy who had a little bit of problems (seriously) he liked her and everyone knew it. She didn't like him. She didn't want to sit next to him so being the gentleman I am, I offered to sit in between she liked that, a lot. He never slid in again. I probs cucked him. Sorry not sorry. Year 8, a boy asked her out and she said yes it was a dry relationship but she was determined to make it work. He wasn't. In my head I said I could give her something better than him. He was a little on the unwashed side. I didn't want to make it obvious I was jealous so I kept my distance. I got so jealous that I dated that one friend that sat next to us but that didn't work but we are still friends. I thought she might get jealous, but why would a goddess get jealous of a mortal, huh? Year 9, my chance, oh wait theres a sporty kid she likes. S**t. He likes her but he doesn't want to date. So still my chance? Its weird, and I'm still young but I think I love her.

479,"I started in high school last year. I've been having really fun and had a good time with my new classmates. The problem, is that for the last 2 years, I've had cronical diseases in my stomach. I've missed busses and such, and even gone home from school (legally, I have a doctor-approvement). This makes me miss a lot of important lessons from school, and when I try to read at home I won't understand much. Im studying mechanism, so it's hard for me to get to practical when I'm not at school. This has demotivated me so much that I pretend to go to the bus at the morning. Instead, I go to a playground and wait about half an hour there until my other family members are out of the house. Then I go home and repeat. I tell my parents that I've tried to go to school, and then gone back home mid-day. (I make it through school sometimes, but often not) My teachers do not have enough from me to grant me a grade.

480,"Hey all, 
So.. this is going to be a bit awkward. 

Basically, I'm locked in a  pretty toxic relationship at the moment. I dated my best friend for a little over a year, fell in love, and then shit the fan. 

Ex moves away, finds someone new, cant seem to get over me so misleads me only to get back with her new SO everytime. I bought into every opportunity I thought I was being given and ended up begging her to ""consider giving us a week long trial at long distance!"" 

So dumb. So very dumb. 

Said theyd consider it, told me she did not intend to get back with new SO-- I get all happy and start planning a bunch of dope adventures for when she came home, and then suddenly they're back together. 

Cringing for younger me atm. 

Cute banter &amp; heartfelt phone calls continue on for a bit longer during this time and they ask about going to an old date spot when they come home.

I snap, tell her shes hurting me more than she knows and she ends up saying ""I know it hurts you but I don't mean to."" 

Snap again, say this doneskis. 

I almost blocked her but then quickly realized my stupid brain &amp; heart were having an emotional meltdown as this was indeed my best friend for so long. 

I collect myself, and realize weve never once tried wholeheartedly  to be just friends. 

I'm set on a friendship now, knowing that dating is just impossible and highly unhealthy. 

We were content on friendship for a minute, but I still needed time. 

Then, our would-be anniversary comes around and I get a message saying ""happy 10th, you're very important to me regardless of the title! (Or something like that). 

I spend the night out with some friends, sleep in late and then get hit up by her asking me to call her. 

I do, but then the conversation gets iffy. 

Says she wants to see me when she comes home and  has an ""idea"" for the summer.  Says something along the lines of ""it will be well worth the wait"". 

I ask the what the idea is, but she won't tell me until she sees me. 

Okay; I see where this is going. 

Basically, where I'm at and what I'm in need of right now is the strength and will power to avoid an oncoming disaster. 

My feelings for this person have changed significantly, but for whatever reason my dumb heart cant seem to shake it all of permanently. 

Fast forward after the phone call, and all systems go. 
 

This is where it gets awkward. 

Understandably, I have an extreme attraction to this person.

It's like 1am and my mind is going all over the map about what might be coming next, what it's going to take to avoid the conversation, how stupid this is etc...

Then, it's like 4am and I'm wide awake. 

I start thinking of a prrrreeeeettttyyy good reuniting hello (if yall know what I mean), and it hits like a brick.



I end up losing sleep, waking up super late for work and feeling all messed up. 

I'm single now, and I guess the vivid fantasies of affection were something my mind wired as comforting. 


I guess I'm in need of advice on how to stop thinking about things that arent even in my immediate future right now, and how to cut out those ""intrusive"" fantasy-esque thoughts. 

I'm also in need of figuring out how to just find the true desire of getting out of this loop, because the truth is it's harder than it looks to break away from a relationship like this. 

I know its dumb, but I definitely need some advice.

My partner and I have found a cat we would like to adopt but when we moved in two years ago, our landlord said no pets. Despite this, we know of at least two other tenants who have dogs.

485,"This is pretty specific but I don't know of anywhere else to post this. I'd feel weird posting in an adhd-specific subreddit without a diagnosis, as I wouldn't be ""a part"" of the community at that point. Anyway, here goes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I've recently come to the unsteady conclusion that I may be suffering from ADD/ADHD. I have a friend who has it and says that I likely do as well, which further adds credence to this theory. For some background, I'm currently 27 and begun noticing this behaviour about 4 years ago. However, I've done some introspection and realise this likely started around the same time as my depression (9 y.o.).  

Some examples of behaviour which leads me to believe this:  

* I frequently switch between multiple tasks and struggle to get any one task complete as a result, often missing easy mistakes in the end product. I once wrote an exam and answered a completely different question than what was asked and got a 0 as a result.  

* I often get bored and frustrated with things quite quickly (within minutes of attempting and failing), unless I enjoy it a lot (namely, only video games).  

* I often have to ask multiple questions (many more than my peers) before I understand a concept or process. This is especially limiting when looking for work, as many jobs have been a struggle to learn quickly enough (and the last job I lost was due to this fact).  

* I struggle organizing things in an efficient manner, often causing a lot of lost time either working around it, or trying really hard to organize things only to lose the organization system later on (i.e. I'll spend a lot of time working on a system, implementing it, then struggle to follow the system and revert back to the messiness). This is especially evident when others are not present, like in my room or other private work/play spaces.  

* I'll often misplace simple items like writing utensils, staplers at work, or even some more important things (sales orders that I forgot I had, that kind of thing at work at least). Just forgetful (on the short-term memory side) in general.  

* I'm generally very clumsy and people comment sometimes that I appear slow and ""methodical"" in my movements. I also have a stutter that appears more when I'm stressed/anxious/nervous, it's gotten really bad recently where I can't even finish a sentence and just give up and feel really embarrassed. Difficult especially since I have a daily meeting that I ""host"" at work.  

* I read passages from a book (at my friend's request) that document some lesser-known symptoms, and a lot of it resonated with me. I have extremely rapid and changing thoughts, I'm never thinking about nothing or even one or two things. There's often 4-5 thought trains that I swap between extremely fast, which is in part what makes it hard for me to focus. Also affects sleep - I listen to ASMR and other quiet noise things like it to allow me to sleep. I've had trouble falling asleep since I can remember (childhood) - often upwards of 2 hours.  
* I'm extremely impatient and get really frustrated easily, to the point where I've destroyed many personal belongings and damaged property (holes in walls). Never had the intention of hurting anyone (nor have I actually done so, intentionally or otherwise).  

I've also done some reading today and found that, along with all of the above being symptoms of (specifically inattentive-type) ADHD, my lack of social skills and poor handwriting are can also be symptoms. I think a lot of the reason I was never diagnosed is I was always a successful student. I only started to drop down from high 80s to low 70s in my last few years of schooling (Grade 11 and 12, still graduated, but then dropped out after 3 semesters in college). But I've since learned that the attention span of an ADHD child *is equal to or better than that of other children* for tasks or subjects they find interesting.  

I've always found ""learning"" interesting. So I always excelled in Math and Science, and struggled with Art and Physical Education, often getting low (but passing) or even failing grades (Art especially). I mention this because, I've been to two different psychiatrists to attempt to diagnose ADHD, and both have said the same thing.  

One, that I'm an adult and since ""most of my symptoms"" (lack of focus and organization) have only manifested recently (which I'm beginning to uncover isn't necessarily true), it's impossible to diagnose as adult-onsent doesn't exist (which I've also done reading and some psychiatrists in the early 2000s had found this to be false at times). And two, that as long as I have a depression/anxiety disorder, it's impossible to diagnose ADHD without first treating those symptoms. But the problem with that is, I believe the ADHD is what's *causing* those symptoms. So logically, to treat the symptoms you treat the root cause. I'm depressed because I can't seem to get anywhere in life, whenever I try I fail and then lose all discipline and motivation, escaping to my vices (gaming and movies/TV) to comfort me. I'm beginning to suspect this is more a result of biological function then just ""a personality trait that cannot be overcome"" like one other psychiatrist suggested.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So, I come to you to ask for advice. I'd really like to be able to try stimulants or other such medication (Adderall, Vyvanse, or similar) but cannot get it without a prescription. I'm willing to go a less-than-legal route, but don't know where to start as I don't/haven't even purchased cannabis illegally. Is there some way that I can ""prove"" to a doctor that I might have this disease, and attempt a trial prescription?  

**TL;DR: I've done some research and found that I have almost all the symptoms of inattentive-type ADHD. I've found this has affected me since I was 9 in some way, but more strongly recently (27 now). To the point that I've lost jobs and struggled with friendships. Any advice on how I convince a doctor that I have it, or otherwise trial the treatment (stimulants)?**",12Mar2019,0

I am having a hard time deliberating as to whether or not I want to accept a new job I have been offered at a different company after only being at my current company for \~7 months (the company before this I was at for 3 years). 

Context -

Current role = IT Consultant

Job offer = Sales Engineer

* Pay increase of \~30% annually @ new company
* Loss of flexibility - current role is highly autonomous. I work from home and at various client offices around town. No rigid office hours. One day a week I work from home. New role = firm 8 to 5 desk job, on calls/demos for 5 to 6 hours a day. Schedule set by sales reps.
* Current job is in career path I don't necessarily want to stay in indefinitely (more technically focused, would prefer to abstract into more business/management role in the years to come)
* New job is a mix of technical and sales, a blend that opens more doors after a few years of experience, especially if I go on to get an MBA as I've considered.
* Relatively unique opportunity to transition into new vertical without having to start from the bottom.
* New company Glassdoor score of 2.8/5 (which tbh is pretty shit in terms of tech companies). Quoted as a 'churn and burn' style of workflow by a current SE.

**Tl;Dr -** Considering a career stepping stone that entails more money but significantly more of a grind. No pain no gain, or should I stick with comfort while disregarding that eventually I don't want to be in this specific vertical long term?",12Mar2019,1

I'm an 18 year old male living in Europe, I'm a pretty introverted person so I haven't really been at parties. This friday my friends decided to go to a major city in my country (which is know for the craziest parties and bars) to go drinking and have fun. They asked me to come with them and I really want to try it. The problem is that when I go, I'll have to stay there until 6A.M. because there are no other trains or busses riding towards my town through the night. This means we'll have a full night of drinking but I don't have any alcohol tolerance. I'm very sensitive to peer pressure but my friends aren't really the type to pressure someone like me into drinking unreasonable amounts, sure they might offer me a drink and say ""C'mon have fun"" but that really isn't the problem.

First of all, a thousand gratitude to respondents! You have lessened the stress I carry. Once more, I come to your kind souls knocking for more opinions. 

Applied at one call center company after another and I passed interviews, but they kept rejecting me because they couldn't hire someone full time who still studies. Tried one last company; applied for a full time shifting customer service representative, lied about being a high school graduate (truth: I still have a week or two left), and said I intend to save up for college education MUCH LATER in the future. Passed interviews and will have my final interview tomorrow (followed by training).

Now, the problem: 

I have *zero* idea how to make this work for college next school year. I *prefer* to pursue college, but I highly doubt the school will understand my situation. Still, my parents have no idea about my job search (see linked thread for more information.) 

Currently, mom still believes I'll take that 2-year college course next school year. I do not know how to survive a full time shifting call center job along with college. The excuse I plan to use if she asks why I'm home less often: I'm crashing at a friend's house and/or his kind and wealthy parents sometimes pay for my college fees, but expect me to return it when I get a job. Pretty confident they'll buy that excuse.

Aside from that dilemma, I am also considering the alternative of not pursuing college altogether? Third option is to work for the next 3 or 5 years while saving up enough money to full pay 2-4 years worth of college. High probability I'll find a cheap college school here in the Philippines.- btw, yes, I am NOT in the USA. But, then again I have to worry about my mother again.

To summarize:  
1. I do not know how to survive a full time shifting call center job along with college.  
2. Mom still believes I'll take that 2-year college course next school year.

495,"I was recently hit in a car accident a week ago. Filed a claim to other driver's insurance (farmer's). Then my mom then tells me I have to file one with our own insurance (allstate). I called to do so and they said it was not necessary, but I filed another claim anyways. 

Allstate then asks me to download the mobile phone app to take pictures of the damages so they can get an estimate. My mom gets a check in the mail from them (we live in separate locations) for what I assume is the damage to the car. To my understanding, the driver at fault is whose insurance pays. 

I am with the Farmer's estimator now so they can look at the damages and assess. 

My questions are: 

Should I have gotten a check from Allstate (my insurance)?

If Farmer's (at fault insurance) writes me a check, do I send back the Allstate check?

I know there might be some comments on how toxic and bad the modelling industry is but I already have researched a lot into it so I really want to give it a go atleast. I'm a 15 year old girl who's 5'8, waist size of 27inches and hips 35 inches. My weight is 127 pounds.

I'd say looks wise, I'm average (by far not the best looking girl out there but not revolting either). I've had some guys interested in me throughout my life, but unfortunately in those cases either a)the guy was a total player and only really wanted a sexual thing or b)i wasn't into a guy beyond our friendship.

I think I just always want to meet a guy who I have at least a bit attraction to (please note I know it's not real life and I don't expect to find some perfect dude and that this is mostly in fun.... but Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec is my dream dude for a fake reference haha). I would love to get to know him well, develop a friendship/relationship (at the same time or friends before relationship), then have sex or whatever follows. I don't have it in me to have casual sex with guys nor has that ever interested me in any way. But lately, it feels as though that might be the only way I could ever possibly experience any intimacy.

I would hate myself if I were to cave and do something totally opposite of my values (like ""getting it over with"" and hooking up with a random just for the sake of experience).

500,"So, I suppose I'll try to put this as simply as I can.  Here's my mess in a nutshell.

✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️✖️


My current boyfriend {18} and I {16} have been in a happy, healthy relationship for three months now.


My ex Ethan {16} and I broke up 6 months ago, I'm not even comfortable calling him an ""ex"".  The decision to split  was mutual, as my parents didn't agree with my ties to him and basically forced us to cut things off... it made things increasingly difficult to keep our relationship a secret.  We've known each other for years, but only dated for 12 months.  We were both very happy, but our relationship was rocky because of my parents, as well as the miles between us, making it difficult to see one another more than 2 times a year at the most.


 He's still in love with me, I feel the same about him.  We've started talking almost every day.  Even though we can't be together right now because of many factors in our lives, we remain strongly connected.  I haven't told him that Im dating someone else... can't seem to bring myself to. I feel as though I can have a deeper relationship with Ethan, as we're closer in age and deal with similar issues.  My current boyfriend, Andrew, knows that I've been talking Ethan and is rightfully uncomfortable even though he trusts me.


Andrew and I are happy, the last thing I want to do is hurt him.  He's very attached to me and I'm scared of his reaction to my honesty about how I feel. Andrew has been through a lot in his life, he doesn't deserve to be heartbroken.  But it's not fair for him to be tied down to someone who is unsure about their feelings.  I've communicated this to him, but I can never bring myself to tell him that I need time away.  He's a very sweet guy and treats me very well, my gut twists at the thought of hurting him in any way... or hurting anyone.


I feel as though I'm dishonoring Ethan, as well as being dishonest.  Im also not being loyal to Andrew by having romantic conversations with Ethan.


Both relationships have their ups and downs, but I want to be fair to both of them.


I don't know what to do.


Im scared of hurting someone as I'm familiar with the feeling of being used and thrown away by those whom I love.


Ethan was my first boyfriend, I've never experienced dating anyone else.


Most high school relationships seem immature I know.

I'm pretty sure she dealt with depression at this time, to the point of throwing up dinner after reading a sad book.

My sister took after my dad and was a jerk to me, too. My mom and I only had each other. Except for the nights it got so bad my sister and I tried going to our grandmas house, but we weren't allowed.

At 14 I stood up to my dad and said he was abusing my mom. I dunno what did it, but he eventually cooled down after that and is better now. But my mom recalls at that point she stopped caring, which made my dad angrier. Divorce was probably a possibility.


But now? She forgives him, dotes on him and loves him. But the baggage I took makes me feel like I'm unloved. She's even admitted my dad is worse to her when I come home to visit. My sister noticed too. My mom would look hurt every time I tried talking to my dad and attention would be diverted. She carries a lot of abandonment issues from her childhood.

But I miss that connection with my mom. Ever since I left she's filled her emotional needs with my dad and I feel abandoned. She says my dad comes first, always.

So my sister (19F) is currently in college, and I (17M) am in high school. Normally my parents do not look at my grades because I have had a 4.0 GPA my entire life. However, 3 days ago, my parents decide to check my grades. When they checked my grades, as per usual I had all A's. My parents then decided to go into each category to see how well I was doing in each section. When they do this they noticed that I had a 50-70% in all of my homework sections. (I only do some of my homework because I am able to get all A's without doing all of my homework and I have a very busy schedule.) Once they saw this, they started getting very upset and started yelling at me for not doing all of my homework. During this argument, I  talked back by saying that homework grades don't matter for college, only the overall grade does. I also brought up how they treat my sister and I completely different which is the main reason I wrote this thread. My sister currently has a 3.6 GPA in college, and my parents don't care at all, but the second my grade gets close to a B, they get upset. Also, she got a 46% on her physics exam and they again didn't care. Lastly, my parents are completely fine with her being 19 and drinking. I brought up all of these points in my argument which gets my parents even more mad. Because of this I told them that I was leaving and would be back that night. After I left, my parents sent aggressive emails to every single one of my teachers, and also sent another set of emails the next morning.

All of this is really annoying me and I believe it's completely unfair considering how they treat my sister. I would be completely fine with doing more of my homework, but it annoys me that they are getting this upset when they are completely fine with my sister doing whatever she wants and I still have a 4.0 GPA.

I dont think shes feeding herself anymore even though she really wants food (I made a bagel this morning and she was downstairs and basically hovered right next to me staring at it, and when I asked her if she ate anything she muttered ""I dont know."" I gave it to her and shes been sitting on the sofa with a half eaten bagel for like 15 minutes). I know shes starting to get involved with religion again, and I'm worried that she cant handle this anymore since last time. I dont want to just sit here and let it get worse, I tried talking to her but it's like she isnt even there. I'm taking my little sister to college with me and I'll probably just hang out with her because I dont want to leave her with my mom, but is there anything I can do?

TLDR: I am a Philosophy major and I need help coming up with an original idea/concept for my final 20-30pg research paper because I am an idiot and am not creative in the slightest.
I’ve been a reddit user since my freshmen year of college but have never made a personal account until today.  I’ve seen a lot of kind people offer amazing advice and lend a hand to other members of the community so I thought I’d give this a shot! 
I am a Philosophy major and I am working on my Capstone (my final project) before graduating.  One thing that I struggle with is being creative and/or original.  It just so happens, unfortunately, that my Capstone assignment is this:
“Write a 20-30 ORIGINAL research paper on a philosophical topic and give a short presentation on it at the end of the semester”.
Can anyone help me out or give me a push in any direction that is original… 
I’m not asking for a paper or even a page just some sort of starting point.
I have taken a lot of philosophy classes (obviously because it’s my major) but I’m having a difficult time with this one final assignment.  I really just want to focus on studying for my LSAT and so I keep pushing this aside for that because I am much more comfortable with that material.
Idk if this helps but I’m particularly interested in the philosophy of time, the mind, and science fiction as well.  Brains in vats are cool too.

524,"So I live with my boyfriend and his mother. We've been together 6 years. I help contribute to bills and rent every paycheck. Both my boyfriend and his mom have received their tax refunds. My bf has already spent his on bills and necessities amongst other random things. I don't know for sure but I want to say his mom has already gone through half of her return, usually spent on random things. I'm still waiting on mine to drop in my bank account. As of yesterday, his grandpa (moms dad) died and is leaving her around $13,000. Its been a dream of ours to move to Colorado (we live in texas) and decided we will use part of her inheritance to move there. I feel like his mom is expecting me to use my tax return to help us move out there but I feel like it is unfair seeing as how everyone gets to blow their tax return but still expect me to save mine and put it towards moving. I don't want to be left penniless while she still has 9 to 10k still left over. Also, after we move there, me and my boyfriend plan on getting our own place, so I'd like to save some of that for a possible deposit, but I'd like to be able to use my tax return how I see fit. I need opinions from an unbiased party. What do you guys think? Are my feelings valid or am I being selfish? Also, it's not like I'm getting paid a whole lot, my refund is about $1,000.

Over the past year my mum has been drinking more, I am 25 living at home with my parents while I'm saving. I pay rent but basically end up being a live in baby sitter for the younger kids. My mum is a good, kind person but she is slowly slipping into being someone else. 

It started because she lost someone close but it's escalated and I am worried. Both me and my father have confronted her about it. I have been less direct but I have mentioned how often alcohol goes 'missing' in the house and caught her stealing some of my alcohol which I now hide in my room. I said to her I knew it was her and she admitted it. It did slow her down for a while but not anymore. 

She doesn't go out to work during the day and usually by the time I get home from work (5:30) she is making dinner. She used to have a glass of wine while she made dinner, then started needing more. She has found all sorts of ways of hiding her drinking from us but she is not very good at it so I always find it. There is hardly a night that goes by that she isn't drunk anymore. I have mentioned it to my dad who told her not to do it anymore and is pretending to himself that it is sorted but I know it is not. It is beginning to make me hate being around her and I struggle to talk to her if I know she's had a drink.

533,"So I bought a book from an independent author/publisher. It arrived in a padded envelope that was torn, with some damage to the book itself. I have contacted the seller and he said that he won't be responsible for the USPS having done a poor job. He also stated that he's mailed hundreds of them with no problems at all. He has offered a replacement, if I choose to pay return shipping charges, or a $5.00 refund (on a roughly $70 purchase) if I choose to keep it.
 
I would really like a new, undamaged copy but I don't think it should be up to me to pay for return shipping. I also don't trust the new one to arrive in any better condition, given the fact that he has packed a thick, heavy book in a padded envelope that is not adequate. I have also seen guidelines from the USPS saying that envelopes should be no more than 3/4"" thick, and this package is much thicker.

535,"LONG TL;DR BELOW

I want a vocal booth for voiceover. I am currently a student in my junior year. My credit history is not long enough to be approved for a loan and i wont think about asking for a cosigner. I currently have no need for loans in college so i had no debt. 

Before junior year began i decided that i will apply for a loan as for some reason i was a couple hundred short of my fees this year and figured i could use the excess on my booth. And use all the money it generates from my voiceover to pay everything back (get it to pay for itself). So i decided, even though i hated the idea of having college debt, to bite the bullet and go for it.

My mother is horrible with money, absolutely atrocious. I had no bank account and my mother had set up excess college money to go to her account. I knew that if i had waited too long that she would spend it. I also knew that the amount i was getting back for both semesters (around 2.3k each) added together would be just enough to by the booth outright. 

In October of 2018 i get an email saying the money was sent to the bank account. I immediately call my mother and tell her to transfer it (i had created a bank account by this time). She says okay.....3 days later my aunt comes into my room asking for SOME of the money in order ro help pay for a new water heater. I agree. A month later i realoze i havent been sent a CENT of the loan. It is then told to me that the money was used to help pay the morgage. ALL OF THE MONEY the LOAN money that I will have to pay back WITH INTEREST that i got specifically for my BOOTH, my CAREER....i digress.

So flashforward to a couple weeks ago and the spring semester loan comes in 2,458 dollars. But i only get sent 2k.... my mom brings it up saying her account was negative and it cleared her account and she'll have to pay me back. (Still havent seen a cent of the previous 2k mind you).

Flash forward to yesterday and we're all getting all of our taxes done. And she's getting about 5.3k back. She said in the past she would help to get my booth but that was when the booth cost 8k. Im getting one for half that now and wont need her help. But i still need the $2,458 that she used in order to do it. 

How do i ask for this without her expecting me to pay her back? As quite frankly i think she's forgotten about the 2k she already owes me. I hate to ask for money back from family but this is a LOAN. She basically just swapped me in her place for debt. Considering her and my aunt frequently use each others money/accounts i dont even think she finds it wrong eaither. Getting told by your son that he wants half of your tax returns definitely wont sound good but i want her to know she owes me that half anyway without making it an argument. This post makes it sound like i hate her but i teally dont, shes just supee ignorant about how to spend money and doesnt think too long about how it affects others.

Or am i in the wrong in the first place for having this idea?

TL;DR - Mother used over half of the Loan i applied for to kick start my buisness in order pay for the morgage and hasnt payed me back. Shes getting 5.3k from taxes and she used 2.4 from my loan last year, how do i ask for the money without it becoming an argument?

536,"The 12 year old brother of an internet friend I play games started talking to me over discord for whatever reason, no problem there. Actually had rather good conversations with him. He invites me to a video call a few weeks later and goes into a tangent about how exactly how to make cocaine (speaking like someone 30 years his senior with prodigy-level knowledge of chemistry) He then crushes up over-the-counter DXM tablets and snorts them.

 He starts weirding me out from then on, basically any message he sends somehow relates to manufacturing drugs or him combining shit with stolen alcohol (likely bullshit?

537,"A few days ago I decided to reset my discord profile pic to the default icon, set my setting to offline, stopped talking in all of my servers except the one without any of my friends on it, and change my username to a bunch of random symbols because I was just emotionally done with everything. I don't know why or how it got to this point but I just felt emotionally done with these people which doesn't make sense. I care about my friends that I met deeply, but sometimes it gets too much and I hate it. I have a few ideas on why I'm upset but I need sometime to think, so buckle the fuckle up for a long and possibly confusing story.

So about a year ago, I was one of the first members of a discord server dedicated to a really small fandom with people I knew from tumblr and a few from another discord server. Over the months I noticed that more people were being promoted to modship while I was fine with it hoping that I would be next since I was very active and others weren't. This never came. I was also heavily involved in other servers were the same people resided but I had a feeling that there was more, it turns out that they were keeping whole servers hidden and doing everything right under my nose, I don't understand, but I started to try and fix it.

At the start of the year I was more aware and decided to stop waiting since that was getting nowhere in their social hierarchy. I would ask to join group calls and discussions but they still left me out of a lot. I think the last straw was a month ago when I asked to join a server and one of them said I couldn't and provided no explanation despite seeing her as a nice person. A few other small instances and I just got tired of it, tired of being excluded, tired of not being treated as an equal despite everything I've done, so I left.

Today I checked back in and spoke to one of my closest friends about being in a one sided friendship, he told me to either confront the person or if it is emotionally bothering me to break it off altogether, which I still need to think about. The possibility of losing these people still upsets me because I've talked to them about everyday for a year, and I don't hate these people, I love and care for them but I just don't feel like I'm getting anything back. Also, I checked back today and nobody even was concerned over me or wondered what I did, while if it was with another person higher up in the social hierarchy, they would be concerned immediately, this makes me feel like leaving since if they didn't notice me in the first place and they wouldn't notice me if I was gone.

It’s made me super self conscious and I try literally everything to hide it when I’m in public (covering it with my hands, turning my face so people don’t notice it, smiling, etc.) I feel like it makes me absolutely weird looking, and I know I’m not making it up because it’s absolutely there. While it’s not as bad as some weak chins I’ve seen on the internet—it does come out from my neck—it’s still pretty bad, since there’s no part where the chin juts out, it’s just a diagonal line. It’s absolutely awful and I try to ignore it but when I do remember it I obsess over it because I hate it so much. It’s also bad because I’ve seen people on the internet make fun of weak chins all the time and it just makes me so sad and self conscious. People have told me I’m attractive, and so on, and I don’t know if that’s true, but I really feel that my chin just takes away from all that and it puts a huge hole in my self confidence. I have a larger nose too so I feel like that makes it worse. I’ve also noticed that neither of my parents have a chin like mine so I don’t know if it’s genetic. I breathed a lot through my mouth as a kid due to sinus problems, and I have TMJ. I would love to get surgery, but it’s so expensive and I don’t think my parents would be on board with it. I have a job but I feel like it’d be practical to save up for more essential things, like a car, etc. Is there any other way I could fix this? Or is there a way I could bring it up to my parents?

541,"I'm a college sophomore. Because of  depression and suicidality my therapist wants me to go on antidepressants. 

If I tell my parents, I believe they would stop paying for me to go to therapy at all, and/or make me switch therapists (last time I tried to tell them I was depressed, they decided my therapist must be brainwashing me and making a mountain out of a molehill). They may also harass me and/or act like I'm a drama queen and generally make me feel crappy.

I'm on my parents' health insurance so I couldn't hide antidepressants unless I paid out of pocket. I believe I *could* find a way to do that even though it's really expensive. However, I would have a lot of guilt about hiding it (my parents are rather over-involved in my life). Additionally if my parents found out they would lose it, and the fallout would probably push me over the edge.  

Personally, I want to skip antidepressants because (a) I think therapy is my best chance to get better, (b) there's only one therapist in my area who's methodology works well for me, and (c) I can't pay for him without my parents. Yes I tried working for a while but it's not feasible at this time -- I eventually fell apart because of the depression and other issues. 

Even if I get antidepressants secretly, it would probably come out at some point (I'm terrible at/hate keeping secrets) and I'd end up losing my therapist.

I'm fine with a handshake, but if I don't know you well, please stay an arm's length away from me, please. I've stopped hugs by saying something along the lines of ""I'm not trying to be rude, I just don't like hugs if I don't know you very well.""  It sucks that I have to say that, because there's a chance they'll be offended, even though I don't intend to have that result, but I don't see why I have to subject myself to something that makes me very uncomfortable. I'm worried they'd be offended by my not wanting them to hug me. I just don't like the invasion of personal space unless there's a solid relationship between me and the other person.

At the local special needs school, the students are taught ""the first 3 times you meet a person, greet them with a handshake. After that, you can greet them with a side hug."" I really like that. It's polite, it's not space invasive. I wish more people went by something along these lines.

544,"Hello guys, it's your boy Daedalus.

You see, I have an issue. First, let me explain some context. I'm a 9th grade student (freshman) that loves video games, gets exceptionally good grades (not perfect) like all As and one B or two A-s, that type of stuff. The problem is, I'm set on one dream: to become a gamer. It's like my whole life depends on it, yet my circumstances make it nearly impossible. Here, this is how I look at things.

* Video games makes me happy, and is everything to me
* Any other kind of job would dissatisfy me
* I don't care about money, money is not what makes me happy
* I only want a job that I'll like to support myself, I don't have to make a ton
* We're going to die anyways, sooner or later
* School is pointless.

Aright, let's start off with school. I truly believe school is pointless. There's only a few classes that actually have meaning, slightly. I mean, come on, biology, world history? 0.1 % of jobs will have anything to do with world history and biology. You should be able to steer your career path at an early age, if you decide what direction for you to take, you should be able to jump right at it. Not learn stuff about nucleotides, seriously. Rarely anyone actually enjoys school, it consumes so much time. Let's say I want to be a doctor and make tons of money. I would have to work so hard in school, maybe even pay lots of money for college, study for important tests, get into med school, and get my job like in your 30s. People tell me all the time to find a job that you truly enjoy, not a job that makes you lots of money. That's not how I would want to live my 1/3 of my life! For me, I'd want a small house to live in, a nice gaming setup to have, and a decent job that'll support me, maybe even make money off of streaming and/or from a gaming team when I'm well off. Anyways, as a 14-year-old, it's very difficult to find any money for a gaming PC, my parents would NEVER buy me a gaming PC let alone a nice PC, even though they make good money. I can't find any jobs that would hire a 14-year-old, and that's for the summer. I'm not sure if I even have enough time to make enough money for a proper gaming setup. For now, I have a PlayStation 4 and I just hook up a keyboard and mouse to play some video games (Fortnite mainly). My mom always takes my PS4 away for no reason, like now actually. Now she's starting a thing where she takes away my PS4 on the weekends and I'm only allowed to play on Friday and Saturday. It's freaking annoying dude. Once I said again, I can't picture myself to be happy with any other job, I just can't! So guys, I need help. Any advice could help. I don't know what to say honestly, there's a lot going down in my brain. Hope you guys are doing well too. You can check out my Twitter as of now, see my desperate efforts in growing to be something.

546,"My parents won't take me to school and threaten me when I say i'll walk/bike to school because ""I don't care about school"" and ""I have missing assignments"". I'm in 8th grade and wondering what I should do. I wouldn't say my grades are good but they definitely arent that bad.",12Mar2019,10
547,"So, I have an aquaintance on FB. I am friendly with both he and his fiance, as we all worked together at one point. They have a little boy together, several years younger than my 5 yo daughter. I am raising my daughter as a single mother, having left an abusive marriage to my ex husband several years prior. Unfortunately, the ex and I have to maintain joint custody per the terms of our divorce. 

Currently have an attorney to hopefully remedy this situation but family court is a nightmare. I work very hard at two jobs to support my daughter and I, and generally just feel run down and discouraged frequently. Constant guilt that I have to send her to her father's half the time, constant worry over her welfare while she is with ex. Not to mention the guilt I feel having to frequently work such long hours, during which time my Mom watches her. 

Anyhow, have never really been keen on sharing too many pictures of my daughter on social media. Have somewhat mixed feelings about doing so, feeling like many parents overshare simply to put forth the image of being a perfect parent. Also, feel that since my child is a minor her online presence should be limited somewhat. The time that we spend together I prefer to be completely present, sans phone,  so as to give her complete attention. Yes, I do post the occasional picture and some cute anecdotes. But the majority of my (very limited) social media accounts are focused on news articles, personal thoughts, music I enjoy, and photos of myself and my friends.

Male half of this couple messaged me last night, saying something to the tune of, 'wow, if I didn't know you I wouldn't even know you had a child. Why not more pictures of your daughter?' This is the second time he has said something to this effect, the first being in person. I inquired as to why it bothered him so much, and quipped that I don't have the luxury of having my daughter 7 days a week as he does. Which is honestly heartbreaking to me. 

I asked what he was trying to insinuate, and I admit became defensive when he asked if I was 'just trying to get myself out more and show off being single'. ?!? WTF. Feelings are really hurt, compounded by the guilt I already feel as a single Mom. How to respond or get over parent shaming? I know I shouldn't let it get to me, but it's a bad time right now and I am especially fragile when it comes to my daughter, and my parenting of her. Advice, please. ",12Mar2019,1
548,"Sorry, this is a bit long:

I’m a senior in college taking a course where we do nothing but work on a simulation for 2.5 hours a week (all of our class time). Everyone in the class complains about how we really only need 20 minutes for it and that the class is super boring because we don’t do anything productive. On top of that, we recently had a case study exam where the average score was a ‘D’. Keep in mind that this is 1/4 things that will be put into the grade book.

The other day in class he brought up that he had been hearing some complaints about having too much downtime so he suggested lecturing instead. Of course people weren’t into that and decided to continue doing nothing.

This teacher makes it seem like he’s open constructive criticism and ideas so I emailed him. Basically it said that I would be willing give up simulation time if we were to use the class time to work on assignments that will be put into the grade book (I and a lot of other people would benefit from it). 

Today in class he called me up and said that he wanted to talk to me about my email and my case study exam grade (I got a 51%. Sue me.)

He seemed really serious and I’m sure that he was kinda offended. 

How do I go about having a productive discussion with him?

We intellectually matched which is quite difficult to find at our level, enjoyed spending time together, played video games and worked together, got very thoughtful gifts for eachother,  supported each others interests, etc etc. However, we had avoided talking about deep/ argumentative topics because he communicated very differently than I. I ask a lot of questions and play devils advocate, while he simply likes to let his position be known. One day, he came over and just sat for two hours hanging out. I don’t mind silence however I wanted to start a conversation but it soon derailed into him feeling attacked I believe and he went silent. He left and we broke up over text due to this. I tried to fight to fix things saying I will make more efforts to find a middle ground but his mind was made. It’s been about a week and I see him everywhere. We have not spoken because he needs about a month to get over any feelings so we can be friends. He did not wish me a happy birthday even though I gave him a gift and wished him one. I am just lost as to how everything else was perfect, he even bought some things for us to improve our bedroom life that day as well and made all these efforts in everyother place but the one that mattered.

554,"Hi everybody. Throwaway, just in case somehow I manage to get found out by my coworkers (lol)

  

  

I'll try to keep this short, but I feel like maybe I just need somewhere where I can get this off my chest and I hope it doesn't come across as too ""first world problems"". :/ 

  

I'm 28, in the technology sector, and I'm in a spot right now where I just really do not enjoy going to work. I work at a large technology company (think Amazon, Netflix, etc.) as a software developer and have been at this position for about 2 years.  

  

I enjoy software development, but nothing about the team or culture surrounding my company.  At the risk of coming off the wrong way, the majority of my team are transplants from SE Asia, which maybe is not all that unusual in the technology industry. Not that I particularly care, everybody on my team is nice enough and friendly, but I just don't relate to a single person within my department and it's left me feeling a little bit isolated. It seems super cliquey, and I don't feel like I fit in with any of my team outside of casual small talk before/after meetings, whereas they all hang out outside of work. I'm not exactly a social butterfly, but I do enjoy having at least some resemblance of camaraderie with my colleagues - which is nonexistent and has been since I started.  

  

On top of the social situation, I handle a super large volume of work, mostly supporting our production pipeline and am usually the one that is in charge of dealing with issues that occur after business hours. I'm on-call a lot, usually 2-3 days per week and at least one full weekend per month. It's not unusual for me to work 60-70 hour weeks. It's really stressing me out, because I feel like I can't even go out on a Friday night with my friends without being attached to my cell phone, in fear that I'm going to get paged and need to be within 15 minutes of a computer. It's causing me issues with my sleep, because I've missed a few phone calls come in in the middle of the night, only to get chewed out for it the next morning, even when I was not on call that night and had my ringer turned off. I get about 3-5 hours of sleep on average per night and it just doesn't feel like enough.  

  

The upside to this, is that I am an hourly employee with fantastic benefits, and am overtime eligible. Company health insurance premiums paid, paid phone, work from home basically whenever I want, excellent retirement matching, etc. The money is phenomenal and I have to say, if I wasn't getting the comp that I am there is not a  chance in hell that I would have stayed in this role.  

  

I guess my question/need for advice is, what do I do? Stay? Try to fix things work/life balance wise? Quit and find something else? I love the benefits that my job allows, but I \_really\_, and I mean really, loathe going in to work and am getting more stressed out by the day, and can feel my mental health deteriorating. I feel like an ungrateful shithead complaining about any of this, but I just don't know how much longer I can hold myself hostage in this job just because it pays so well.

  

So much for keeping it short, lol. Thanks for reading and if there is any advice out there, I'd really appreciate it.

I run all the the sales reps, i run our phone room, i run the labor. I do some bookkeeping, and i basically am a personal assistant to the boss.

&amp;#x200B;

I have received raises for taking on more work, but not substantial in any way. I am now doing what 3 or 4 people would typically do, for the pay of 1. I work anywhere from 45 - 60 hrs a week, and dont get compensated as i receive salary, which i'm not complaining about as i do understand that i work whats needed for the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly get belittled by the owner for not doing a good enough job, but it is then followed by ""i know youre doing a lot and i dont expect you to be able to do everything"". The next day its something else that either didnt get done or wasnt done to his liking and I'm getting yelled at again. He will call me 10 times a day and have me stop what i am doing to complete another task that he needs done, this can range anywhere from calling / texting somebody to adding things to handbooks, basically anything. This then makes me lose my train of though on the first project and move on to another and so on and so forth.

I also have jobs (we are contractors) that i have to manage, i also will help manage my sales peoples jobs, and also run jobs for newer sales people.

I like cooking, and because all of us are friends we sit around the table and eat together - it's respectful and builds relationships I think. At first I didn't notice our friend's manners - he's a dude who's never been married and hasn't spoken of any relationships - he's been living on his own for longer than I've been alive so I don't think he even realises that what he's doing is gross and unpleasant for everyone else. He slurps when he eats, extremely, uncomfortably, loudly - sauce flies everywhere while he stuffs his cheeks full of food so that they're bulging, smacks his lips etc. Several times in one meal he'll groan and belch (again, obscenely, unnecessarily, loudly.) And speak with his mouth full.

I've tried everything I can think of to avoid sitting through this - I've broken pasta into bite sized pieces(he slurps anyway), I've thickened sauces(But that only results in thicker sauces all over the table (and in our drinks (and on our faces))), I've even tried hinting at it by exaggerating my own habits (I eat in absolute silence, except for when I'm spoken to - but he seems too oblivious to catch on.)

569,"Firstly, I would like to apologise for possible grammar mistakes since english is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin recently moved to town and I have been spending alot of time with him.

We mostly spend our time smoking weed at his place and watching tv, talking, sometimes cooking etc.  
We are not just cousins, but really good friends.

&amp;#x200B;

\*For Context\*

I am 23 and my cousin is 32 and he used to be a dealer through his younger years. He spent a few months in jail once because someone ratted him out. That was couple of years back and ofcourse everyone in the family knows that. He is genuinely a great guy, fun to be around with, great work ethics, always in a good mood and has very good relations with my parents and rest of the family.  Also, Ive been smoking before he moved in.  
We both have well paid jobs and are doing really fine financially. Im still living with my parents (who dont charge me rent) because they told me I shouldnt rush moving out. So Im saving up money to buy a new car(happening in a few weeks) and move out next year. What Im trying to say is, I think we are responsible.  


&amp;#x200B;

So it all begins when I started to go to my cousins house more often. Parents asked me a few times why am I there all the time and what are we doing there. I told them everything except the weed part.  
Time goes by a few months, they asked the same question a few times more and I realised they are suspecting that we are doing something in that house.  


One day, I decide not to go at my cousins house and stay home. My parents were at work and after a few hours my father walks in, says hi, we small talk, turns on his tv... everything is normal.  
Next day my cousin calls me and says that my father walked in his house, started looking around and asked him wheres was I. He stayed for like 2 minutes and before he left he said that he can only smell cigarettes in the house. Implying that he was expecting to smell weed?  
 Thats made me furious because I feel like thats my private manner but my cousin said we should lay low for a while.  
Cousin said if my father cathes us that it would be his (my cousins) fault because everyone knows he went to jail and would make him the bad guy saying that he was getting me weed and making me smoke with him. We argued about that for a bit because I was annoyed thinking that everyone sees me as a 7yo kid thats pressured into things.

We decided to lay low, I wouldnt come so often anymore and now, few days ago, my cousin calls me and says that my father visited again.  
Said that he knows whats going on and that he is going to cath us sooner or later and left. I never heard a thing from my father.

I was blown away by this and didnt know what to do.

I want to confront my father about this, telling him it shouldnt be his business how I spend my personal time.  
But knowing both of us, I dont want to argue with my father because we would both start shouting at eachother leading nowhere good. I HATE bringing stress to our house.

You might say try talking to him calmly. But he is a conservative type of guy who gets easily pissed at things like this and its usually hard to talk to him without things escalating. And also, usually I get pissed at him cause he gets pissed, when Im trying to be calm about it. Its weird, I know.

I was thinking about talking to my mother about it since I have better relations with her. She doesnt know much about weed, she knows its a drug and its illegal (=BAD). But she is more understandable than my father and I feel like I can talk to her about it and convince her its not such a bad thing. She might then try talking to my father about it but Im afraid how will that turn out. Like I said, I hate bringing stress in the house.

My cousin says to not say anything since he feels he would get in trouble, and he might be right.  
He advises that I should just lay low and be more careful until I move out, then do whatever I want.

570,"My fiance and I genuinely rarely have a fight, have never really but we of course get into the occassional small argument or heated discussion.

When I was growing up, with Irish parents, we never witnessed them show any sort of affection or any kind of arguing. It was all done behind closed doors unless the fight was massive. I remember 2 sights where my parents almost walked on eachother, but that's the only time.

My fiances family.. communicate arguing? If that makes sense. Always yelling and seem like they are fighting at it is just somewhat normal to them.

So I notice whenever we get into heated disussion or small arguments, I get really upset. I even ask him after (hours later) if he is still mad and he will always so, ""what? no way, I was never mad"". Whereas I am dwelling and so upset.

Just wondering if you think being raised this way has made me like that. I would love to not have to overthink every arguments or feel as if every minor fight is going to lead us to breaking up. I KNOW it's not, but just the feeling I get!

That should have been the first warning bc i never remember him saying he would be looking for me after the game. But I was just getting creeped out by him so I told him I had to go (via snapchat). (This isn’t really important but I  also mentioned that I don’t like it when ppl save messages if there talking to me on Snapchat.) Nonetheless, after I’d stopped talking to home the next day he sent me a message saying He’d “waited all week to talk to me and the conversation he was having with me was anticlimactic and that (my) vibe and personality didn’t match the way he said mine was when we were talking in person"". At this point, I was worried bc he clearly was trying to start a relationship with me that I am NOT wanting. I made it clear we were not dating, but he said i shouldn’t be bothered by saved messages. Meaning in a 2 page Snapchat message. He also said that I « had been a jerk to him when he hasn’t been texting me that much“ to which I lamented I was not interested in him plus I don’t like ppl saving messages bc some ppl r shady and I can’t trust them. **Then he said « you can’t trust me but you told me something that I can get you fired?? “ to which I almost said I can get you reported for following me around my job, but instead I asked what he was talking about. And he said I called one of the ppl I work with a “dumb piece of shit“ when he was talking to me at the show. At this point I know he’s trying to be controlling and annoying so I briefly explain that that would be creepy, I never said that, he’d asked me at my job what was goung on bc apparently I’d looked « concerned” and I said someone I was working with was being rude.

What the fuck can I do?  I told him to stay away from me and never to threaten me or my job but other than that what should I do? This guy is trying to scare me (was) into doing whatever he wants, and I’m really bothered by it. Thx for reading.",12Mar2019,1
576,"So I majored in Finance with a minor in Economics... 

I work at a medium sized firm that helps people with their finances, stock portfolios, and all else financial plannings. The clients are awesome, the nature of work, not so much... 

The first sign that this job might be one worth quitting was the fact that my manager made me come into work during a snow storm, even when travel was ill advised for the area. All the schools, daycares, and many other businesses were closed. 

The reasoning? I’m the new guy. The work for that day? To do everyone else’s work, AND clean the office, despite having a cleaning company regularly scheduled to do that. What was my manager doing on this day? Lounging with his family, and wouldn’t take phone calls or texts when I had a question. 

The second sign was out of boredom, me reading the “house rules” for the company that I skipped over when first joining “the team”. One of the things that stuck out was the fact that we have a rule that states how we’re still obligated to work on personal, sick, and vacation days, and follows up recommending investing in a laptop. 

The third sign is that the coworkers are ones who don’t like to converse much, it’s insanely awkward how none of them don’t wish to talk to one another during downtime.

And then we have the two issues that drove me to making this post. 

I keep getting more and more clients that weren’t originally mine, and I’ve actually reached out to these clients asking if they’ve requested my services, and they’ve said no. I had to awkwardly explain to them how because I’m getting more clients than usual that my services might not be readily available. 

The second snapping point was the fact that my manager effectively neutered lunch hour for us “new guys” (aka, just me, if I were a betting man) to 10 minutes of a “free time lunch period”, and then report to the conference room for a meeting. I’ve protested this, but the manager just states how I should be thankful I work there. 

I want to quit, but the fact that I’m going to be jobless, and the thought that I won’t be taking advantage of what I went to school for (even if it could be a brief period) puts me in a bit of a depressed mood. Work similar to mine would require that I move to a different towns well. ",12Mar2019,0

580," 

This is a pretty long story but let me try to make it short as possible. We were married for 2 years and was together for about 6 years. Exactly a year ago my wife left the marriage, one day just got up and left. Left all her things, quit her job, drop out of school out of the blue. She told me she needed to be alone and went home. We never had an official separation agreement.

She suffers from classic case of borderline personality disorder and depression, currently seeing a therapist for her depression. About a year before our separation, her brother died from a heroin overdose a bit later her grandma who she was very close to suddenly died from a fall. She was always emotional and depressed since she was a child, but these incidents put her in a dark place. She attempted several times to commit suicide and she has scars on her writs and cut marks up and down her arms from cutting herself in high school. She was also raped summer before our separation which was the breaking point of our marriage.

Here’s the long story of her rape I posed while back.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7y1pfy/my\_wife\_was\_raped\_my\_marriage\_is\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7y1pfy/my_wife_was_raped_my_marriage_is_over/)

Back to just before she abandoned the marriage. Everyday in the home was like walking on egg shells, she would constantly blow up in anger for the smallest of things. Such as opened cabinet doors or socks on the floor or if I asked her help for something. It was almost scary to see a grown adult throw such tampertantrum, you just don’t know how to react. She also became very moody, telling me how we have nothing in common, she hates our home and how she wishes she was dead. She blamed me for her unhappiness, she blamed where we lived... everything was a problem but her. She became completely overwhelmed with life in general, she couldn’t handle anything in her life anymore. Her self-destructive behavior led to her quitting all of her life out of the blue and just running away.

Looking back now she had more red flags than a communist parade. I remember one time before we were married at a friend’s party, she completely lost her top because I was talking to a female friend I’ve known forever. She walked out on me then and wish I could’ve and should have let her leave. But I loved her, and I was blind to it. These little incidents happened frequently enough that I should not have proposed but I turned my eye to it because I loved her and her family was amazing to me. Only reason I married her was running up to our engagement, she practically begged me everyday for a ring which I did.

Fast forward to today. We decided to see if we can work it out and have a 6month separation, which was a year ago. 6 months passed, and she said she was not going to move back home which was august of 2018. I sent her the first separation agreement. She told me that she still wants us to work it out. I don’t know why but I agreed. I allowed this charade to run another 6months. A month ago, I told her lets get a divorce if she does not want to move back home. I sent the second separation agreement.

I live in DC and she lives in outskirts of Pittsburgh. It’s a town I do not like. If the situation was different, I would have no problem moving there for her. Knowing that she has abandoned me once and speaking to her and seeing there was absolutely no improvement in her, I wasn’t risking being abandoned the second time in a place I do not know leaving a good life I have here with a good job.

We had bought my townhome in DC in 2015. She could never hold a steady job due to her illness, I had made all the mortgage payments, but house is in her name also. Her mother is well off and she helped paid half the down payment which was roughly 50k. All though our marriage I supported my wife financially, mortgage, health and auto insurance.

I had drafted up a separation agreement, which returns her the down payment and we go our separate ways. We agreed that I would refinance the house and remove her name long as I pay her down payment. This was over a month ago. My house is set to close on march 20th and I’m getting the run around. The house can not close without the signed separation agreement because it is considered a liability to the bank.

If I end up contacting a lawyer, it will cost me $350 an hour. I honestly do not want to go to a litigation route but with her mental illness, lack of self awareness and her anger to hurt me I do not believe she is capable making a rational decision. What’s the worst that can happen to me if I go to litigation? What are the chances I can keep her down payment for the house? If I have to spend thousands on a lawyer I want to be sure I can recoup my money by keeping her down payment.

Whatever love and sympathy went right out the window when shes trying to hurt me.",12Mar2019,0

583,"I was given a cigarette by a friend once completely unpressurized or anything, and I liked it a lot, so every second weekend or so my friends and I meet up and just have 1 or 2 cigarettes, for me it is more about the social aspect of being with friend and just talking, sometimes I do feel a craving for a cigarette but it's never been that bad. My girlfriend knows I smoke and is currently going through a huggge family crisis and says she wants to try smoking, and that she wants me to buy cigarettes for her, I'm not sure what to do, I know it's wrong, but she allows me to smoke and doesnt get mad at me for it as long as I control how many i have. I know i can buy cigarettes easily at this one shop so i know that's not a problem but the thing is, I dont want her to start...I know that's hypocritical as fuck, but I know it's not good for her, shes such a sweet innocent girl and I dont want her to have to get caught and feel stressed or get addicted. I know I shouldnt smoke, but I've started already and I cant stop straight away, I want her to be healthy.

Overall I know it's wrong for me to smoke, and it's wrong to even consider buying cigarettes for someone else the same age as I, but she has said if I dont get them for her then she'll ask my friend to get them for her as he is ""reliable""

I'm torn, I dont want to give her her first cigarette, and I dont want her to go to someone else to get them. Regardless of what I do she says she will get cigarettes.

I ended it eventually, I was tired of feeling regretful for doing it, and she left me alone. Everything was fine honestly. But she told a friend about our “relationship” and when I was asked I lied and came up with a story, honestly I’m not sure if she believed me or not but I know she told a few people, a boy actually joked with it about me, but after telling him what I told the other girl he stopped. 

The thought of everyone knowing literally makes me feel terrible. I’m more disappointed in myself then anything, but I know it’s healthy to talk about it all so I did. I’ve only told a few people that I’ve actually done this, they were shocked. But they don’t think of me any different, but I know others won’t be so understanding. Honestly I’m not sure what came over me. Is it normal to have a sort of man hoe phase? 

This whole thing happened in like October of 2017, but it’s affected my life so much. I can’t even be in the same room as them without having to look over my shoulder worrying about them talking. I just seem to always think about it, and it’s lowkey tearing me apart.

585,"So I suffer with some bad mental health issues (depression, PTSD, anxiety, bulimia.. etc) and they were getting worse so I knew I needed to switch my meds. I went to my psych who is an amazing doctor and always listens and helps me out. He put me on a new set of meds and sent me on my way.
I had been having a few issues with my local pharmacy lately but nothing horrible.. they just usually were really slow with their pick up times and never had the perception when they said they did.. but I digress.. 
I wait a good 20 min at the drive thru, get my meds and finally head out. Within the week I start feeling funny. Bad headaches, horrible nausea, less energy than I already had, horribly vivid dreams, night sweats, the list goes on. But I figure that I’m getting used to the new meds and just to deal with it.
But last night I had a horrible mental breakdown. Mood swings of physically wanting to tear my eye balls out of my own head, to sobbing because I’m ashamed of my own existence. There were times I didn’t know if I was real. I was deathly frightened. To the point that I called a crisis line at 2 am heavily suicidal.. etc etc I’ll spare the details here
Been feeling like that all day and finally contacted my doctor. We went over how I was feeling and he told me to grab my bottles. Turns out all the meds I picked up were wrong. They had my name right and were on the bottle properly but every single medication was wrong. My doctor was floored. He dialed the pharmacy for me and is getting it straightened out so I don’t have to deal with them. 
It makes me afraid of what would have happened if I didn’t call him.
So do I have a case against the pharmacy and should I sue them? Or is this just a common error and I should let it go?

TLDR: Pharmacy gave me the complete wrong meds despite me doctor virtually sending them the prescription for the right ones, leading me to be suicidal. Do I have a case to sue them? ",12Mar2019,1
586,"Didn’t know what else to put for the title but this my problem I need help with:

This made it difficult when she returned and our chemistry wasn’t good. Today we had a big argument. The reason being she wants to live in the city thats beside my current city. Meaning I would have to change schools, so I tell her I either stay with you here or my dad here and the problem is she has full custody of me. So why is the title so misleading u might ask, well to be front she’s still young and I believe I’m smarter (no offence mom love u).

587,"I'm 24 years old, I've been cleaning toilets since I can rember and I just can't get a job/career that would make me finally happy and on my way to a better place.

I moved to another country when I was a kid and the level of education in that country was so poor that I never had to learn anything throughout school to get good grades.

I went to 'college' and did a subject that I barely had any interest in. I was under time pressure to pick something so I went with something I was familiar with. Again for years I didn't learn anything because I already knew everything they were trying to teach us.

I didn't want to continue my education, but couldn't find a job no matter what I was trying to do, other than cleaning toilets. Also my mother was pressuring me to get a university degree so I decided to do it. 

Because of the subject that I did in college my university choices were very limited. I went with something similar and yet another time in my life I didnt learn anything for 3 years, but at least I managed to get a good class degree.

It's been maybe 4 years since I graduated and here I am, still cleaning toilets since I was 15. For the love of me I can't get a different job. I've had interviews, I've had positive feedback and never an actual job offer.

I have so many degrees that I could be a thermometer and they're not helping a bit. I was never asked about my education, nobody ever cared, people just want experience and they don't care if you went to Harvard or if you didn't finish school. 

For years I've been trying to find something that I actually like and I'm unable to. Countless people told me to just do what I like and it will be alright, but that is impossible.

My interests changed 180 degrees from when I was a kid and I hate my life choices sooo much. I've been trying to change my passions and hobbies, but everything that I find interesting requires a NASA brain and years and years of education in specific sectors. I was trying to convert into astrophysics because I find it interesting, I was too stupid and couldn't do it. I tried converting to physics, too stupid couldn't do it. Programming seemed very interesting with many job opportunities, couldn't do it, I'm too stupid, Finance, couldn't do it, too stupid, computer science, too stupid, 3D too stupid, business, too stupid.... I can name sooooo many different things, but it's always the same. Things I could potentially do are not interesting to me and anything interesting I don't have the education required and if I'm trying to learn I would have to catch up 14 years in any subject. 

It always comes down to me 'stopping' my education at the age of like 10 because everything was easy and didn't require any of my input...

The only way for me to get a job in my industry would be to do internships, apprenticeships and tons of voluntary work. I can do as much free work as required, but it would have to be where I live. I have a lot of debt and I cant afford to move somewhere to work for half free or even free, I simply have too many bills and debts. Unfortunately my town is too small for any jobs in my field, which i actually truly hate and I wouldn't want to do, because I'm a different person now to who I was when choosing these stupid subjects.

Up until now I kept looking and thinking and thinking how to get out of this slump and get a career that will make me happy, something I will want to get out of bed for, something putting a smile on my face, but there is nothing.

After years of trying to convert to different subjects, learning and exploring different options, today is the day that I gave up. I ran out of ideas, it seems like I tried everything, nothing works. I accepted that I will be cleaning toilets for the rest of my life. 

So before I sign out and get going cause someone has to clean, has anybody any advice as to how to find a career that will make your dreams come true? ",12Mar2019,5

So the girl repeated what I said and laughed. I belive I just laughed as well and it was really funny and it got into a inside joke and it was great.

Now if she did that now I feel like I would get sad and feel bullied because it would feel she laughed to me. I have gotten soooo sensitive it feels like. I'm almost impressed by the old me.

593,"Hi everyone, so I’m really not sure where to start with something like this and honestly I don’t even know what I want to have happen or do and just could use some advice. So I guess the best place is at start or as close to it as possible. Over this previous summer (2018) I had a family reunion with my family parents, siblings and all. I’m 28, single and my parents were very kind in letting me have my own room as my older siblings are married and brought spouses. We took a Nordic cruise out of Amsterdam, which had always been something my dad wanted to do.  

The trip started out fine, without any major issues. There had been a lot of animosity the last 2 years over politics as my parents support one person and my sisters support someone else (I’m not here for political debate). Anyway the trip had been going fantastic and I had been enjoying every moment. So on the third night of the cruise (it was a 7 day trip) I was at the casino playing roulette, I had played every night prior and seen the regulars at the tables when this guy who was my age, tall, quick witted and funny came over and started playing. We were casually flirting and he was hitting on me heavily, he bought me a couple of drinks as he sipped his and eventually made his offer to go up to my room or his. I told him lets go back to mine

Now normally I’m not one for one night stands but it had been a really long time since I had been with anyone and I thought that with him also coming from a nice family it would be fine. I want to stress that I was completely receptive to being flirted with and wanted to have sex with protection back at my room. However when we got to my room things went differently. It started very fun, with us kissing, I had placed a $100 dollar chip in my bra and had him get it out while we flirting and kissing in the entrance way of my room, and I had even given him some forplay when he suggested we move onto the main act (which I was down for!) I was on the edge of the bed when he pushed me back ( I really feel like it was playful! ) but I hit my head on the night stand and went out cold. When I woke back up he was top of me and I could feel him trying to push it in me, I started to struggle and ask what was going on when he grabbed and pinned my wrists while telling me to relax, I kept struggling until he let go and said he was leaving, I asked him to wait because I was really confused as to what was going on and he asked if I was going to let him finish, I said no my head is hurting really bad and he told me that there was always another girl on board and left.

I was really shaken and unsure about what to do and honestly I don’t really remember but I called security and said I had been sexually assaulted but said I couldn’t come down since my head was hurting too much. That morning I tried to pretend nothing had happened, I took a shower and blew out my hair, did my make up to be extra cute and when I went to leave the ship, they told me I had been red flagged because of the call I made the night before. They forced me to go to security to report what had happened and when they did, I told them about how he had taken my poker chip, and when they said I had said I was sexually assaulted I told them they were wrong and that I just wanted to be on my vacation and to let me go.

That afternoon was hard but I got through it, but that night on the boat at like 5pm, right after getting back I went to the bar and he sat across from me and proceeded to wink at me. I freaked out, I couldn’t take it and left immediately down to the security office where I told them everything that happened and that I just wanted him to be kept away from me, they forced me to do another interview and reporting process where they ask very intimate questions and have to write a detailed report. It was hell.

The next morning I was told I needed to follow up for my interview, they had me come in and told me that he denied doing anything like that with me and they asked if I could identify him. I said I should be able to. They pulled out 3 pictures of incredibly similar looking men. 2 had glasses and one did not. They all looked very similar but he didn’t have glasses on the night we met and I didn’t think they would show me a picture different then how he looked. I guess they were showing me the boarding pictures in which he has a pair of really big square glasses on and that I had picked the wrong person, I felt tricked and worst mad at myself and like I couldn’t trust or believe me. And on top of that, they said the camera in the casino had only seen me put a $25 dollar chip in my bra. I started freaking out and questioning myself so much.

That night I just made the situation better, as I was walking back to my room with my brother-in-law, we passed the guy. I started freaking out and he asked me what was wrong and I made him promise not to tell and told him about what happened.  That morning my sister came to me, because her husband told her that “something really horrible happened to your sister but she made me promise not to say what”, she would not leave me alone until eventually I blew up at her with what had happened and she told me I needed to tell our parents. Because yes, that’s exactly what I want. The whole family to know what was going on. But she told me if I didn’t, she would. Because I needed the support.  So there I am on this trip with family and thanks to this, now they all know.  I met a variety of answers from well that’s what happens when you go with strangers, maybe this will be a lesson on screening? Nothing really happened since he wasn’t actually fucking you, just move on.  It became the debate for the rest of the trip and my family still doesn’t look at me the same and I hate it.

The next morning I got the final follow up with security, the casino confirmed that they were wrong and it was indeed a $100 poker chip I had left with, and that the night we met and he didn’t have glasses on. I said I wanted to press charges and they said if I did they would require me to do another interview and report stating as such. So I filled out a final report stating everything that had happened. Now it’s been 9 months since I was told I was would be followed up with, I tried after 2 months to get a follow up and told I would be getting a phone call and nothing, I finally called again last week and still getting nothing. I called around and asked and attorney and was told that if they filed charges properly the fbi would have a record since it involved 2 Americans oversea but that just sounds so dramatic. But I wanted to know so bad that I called them, and they didn’t have a report open for it.

Honestly I don’t know what to do. I was a victim of actually being raped 4 years ago, I don’t know who it was and I never filed or report. Part of me is worried that this is just being vengeful over that. Another part of me is just confused, because I want to think the best about people and what if this was just a onetime mistake and it’s not like he actually was raping me and everything up to that point had been consensual. But then I cry at the thought of what if I had woken up 10 minutes later or not at all! Would he have just left me knocked out?  And who even tries to put it in someone when they are knocked out! And I keep having nightmares about waking up with someone on top of me or just generally not sleeping well the last few months

But this all leads back to me, do I even want to press charges? Like that means interviews, lawyers and testifying in court, and if it happens he will be labeled a sex offender but then his life would pretty much be over and I’d just feel so guilty about it. I don’t want to ruin his life over 2 minutes but I do want him to pay for it. And I feel like such a hypocrite because I’ve always said there needs to be evidence but in this case all I have really is what happened to me.

I don’t want to make a big deal out of this, but I also don’t want it to be nothing and forgotten. I just want some advice

TL;DR I got knockout during sex and it lead to a  complicated situation. ",12Mar2019,1
594,"My co-worker and I get a long pretty well. I feel like I or she has something to say to one another everyday. 

Now, I've been down this road before and it was the absolute worst, it went to the complete extreme (I fell in love) and it was too late, I had to leave a job I loved.

I don't really feel anything for this current girl, but its constantly on my mind -  that is, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole again. 

Also, both girls share similarities, and the biggest one is that they are both taken. 

I probably should just avoid this girl, but like I said, I have stuff to say to her, but idk if I just hold on to it. Sometimes I feel like holding onto it might make it worse, until I eventually let go of it. ",12Mar2019,1
595,"Not sure what to do regarding a situation with my parents. We haven't always had the best dynamic with each other, for reasons I won't get into here, other than there's a lot of toxicity that goes on. I do love them dearly and try to help them in whatever way I can, as long as it doesn't infringe on my boundaries/way of life. That being said, they helicopter, a LOT. I am a grown woman and married (have been married for three years now), and my husband and I have our own place and don't live with them. But if my parents don't talk to me every single day, for even ten minutes, they immediately think I'm injured/dead in a ditch somewhere/mad at them, etc. The truth of the matter is that I am busy, which they know. Weekends are my only time off, and even then, one of those days is almost exclusively devoted to housework. That's why when I get home from work (standard day shift, full-time hours), all I want to do is make dinner and spend time with my husband. And then I want to just take the weekends for myself, as much as possible (which rarely happens, due to housework/errands, etc.).

I have tried to set boundaries with my parents before and tell them to talk to me on my lunch break at work...which they do, but then when I get home and am trying to spend time with hubby, or when I am in the middle of making dinner, they will text me. And I feel obligated to reply, because if I don't, they will blow up my phone with messages, and if I don't respond soon enough, they'll call me, and then I have to stop what I'm doing to take the time to talk to them, because I'm a horrible multi-tasker. And it's not usually anything that needs an answer right this moment. It's usually something like, ""hey, can you help me with this errand tomorrow?"" Or ""here's an interesting thing I saw on the news,"" or ""I just want to chat."" So while it's generally something that needs an answer THAT NIGHT, it doesn't need to be answered the second they send the message. And with stuff on the news, that could wait til later, if it doesn't directly affect me. 

If I am not very talkative throughout the day, or have strings of days where I tell them I can't/don't want to talk, then they sometimes think I'm mad at them or am not doing ok. If I start texting and get interrupted and don't reply to their messages right away, they say, ""why aren't you answering me?"" Or ""hello, I'm still here."" Or they think they have said something wrong and now I'm mad, when really, it's just that I got interrupted by someone asking me a question or wanting to have a conversation with me at work while I'm on lunch. I feel like I HAVE to respond to my parents, because if I don't, they overreact. If I've started a conversation with someone at lunch and can't reply to my parents' texts, and I don't reply, they get upset. So I end up having to text them WHILE I am having my conversation with someone else, which I hate doing. They also guilt me into talking to them more and when I say I don't want to, they make me feel like I'm being selfish. 

I just found out last night from my dad that they want me to call them for ten minutes every night. I really don't want to. As it stands, I have to give them my schedule every week so they know why I'm not contacting them on certain days (only because I would get no peace if I didn't tell them). Am I being selfish? Is it selfish to not want to take ten minutes out of my day to call them every day?  I feel like once a week to bring them up to speed on my past week/what's new would be better, but they don't like that idea when I suggest it. But once a week is about what I'm comfortable with. They don't respect my boundaries, no matter how often I set them. When I try to, I just get the ""we're your parents"" schpiel. I feel like I HAVE to call them once a night, just to keep them happy. 

Any advice is much appreciated. Am I being selfish? Or am I justified in feeling frustrated here? ",12Mar2019,1
596,"this is going to be a long story, but I'll try to keep it concise. 

Four years ago, I met my best friend, Em, in high school. There was this other girl, 'Vi', who was in a lot of our classes and we ended up being friends with her. 

Vi was universally disliked. She wasn't bullied or anything, in most cases she was the bully. She was bossy and domineering, but she was still a part of our group. It's hard to say if me and Em liked her very much, she was mostly nice to us but we did get into a fight every now and then and I'm really not the fighty types. However we had fun together and I do consider her a friend. 

Two years ago, Em moved to a different state but we stayed in touch. Vi held a huge party for her 16th and invited pretty much everyone except me. She did initially invite me but later told me that it was only meant for close family or whatever. Em, who Vi was closer to, told me that Vi felt I wasn't really close to her anymore. Not a lot of people went for her party, except the new kids. 

As childish as this sounds, I was upset about not being invited and I took it to mean that she didn't want to be friends anymore. 
After Em left, me and Vi drifted apart and I found new friends. 

In the last couple of months, Vi tried to get back in touch. Send a few messages now and then. Whenever we'd meet, she'd always mention how much she missed being friends with me and how we should start hanging out again. I know she meant it. I was always polite, but never really intended to get back with her. 

Last month, she invited me to her birthday, and she genuinely wanted me to come. She sounded sad and desperate over the phone, and I felt horrible but I couldn't make it. Later found out that no one ended up going. 

Em didn't really stay in touch with Vi either, except the odd message. 

Vi called me a bunch of times but I never answered. 

I met her for a couple of minutes and she mentioned that she was sorry we weren't close and that she was going through a tough time. I said something generic like we should meet up someone soon. 

Em called me up saying Vi attempted suicide, fortunately survived, and will be home soon. 
Em was crying and regretted not being in touch with her. 

It suddenly struck me that I was the only friend that Vi had, and that she had desperately been trying to seek help and I wasn't there to help her. 

I need to make amends and tell her I'm sorry I wasn't there for her. I'm going to call her up tomorrow but I don't know what to say.

I know I sound like a shitty friend and a shitty person, but I thought we'd moved on and I genuinely didn't realise something was wrong. 

Please help me out.

For background, she left her old job after they kept dropping her hours every week until she was loosing £400 a month from her promised hours (6 hour contract but promised 32 hours).

Currently she has a guaranteed start for 2 maybe even a 3rd place of work. 

One is 48 hours as a carer (3 on 3 off guaranteed) 

Second is a job in a pub which she would enjoy a lot more but they can only offer a 10 hour contract but said she would definitely be able to get 32+ hours. ( I said this is exactly what her last job did and look how it ended up ) 

A potential 3rd would be 9-5, 5 days a week on a salary (she prior had an interview with the same company but through an agency and was offered the job and had the interview today with the same person that offered her the job 6 months ago, the only reason she didn’t take the job as with the agency she was only guaranteed 6 weeks work with a chance at 6 more weeks renewal. So not guaranteed work if the agency pulled out or they decided they didn’t need the extra employee)

607,"Hey reddit-advice - I need a word of advice.

Today, my BF and I said “safe journey” to a friend of his who was visiting us for a week. Let’s call this friend Mark. Mark is early-30s fairly average looking tall guy, with a nice british accent, well-educated, middle-class background etc. Mark and my BF have been friends for about 12 years - they met when they were in their early 20s volunteering for a community in Europe. Young men, lots of free time, weekly cash allowance, paid living - those two bonded over football, girls, sex, drinking etc. After their year of volunteering, both returned home to continue their studies - at the opposite ends of Europe. During the past 12 years, they’ve only met about 3-4 times, talk occasionally, but both insist they’re quite good friends. Also, important to note that my BF does not befriend people easily.

I do not really know Mark, this visit was his second visit to “us” in 5 years and this is the second time I have seen him. But he had aslways seemed nice - well-educated, good family background, seemingly good career etc. 

A couple of years ago BF told me that Mark had lost his job in London (either made redundant or left or was fired) and has had difficulties in finding a job he would be paid well enough for his experience and education, and that he would also like. Mark himself said that job market for any job is tough in London (his current residence at a time) and that wages had been stalled for years. 

Some more quiet passed when BF mentioned that Mark had moved back with his parents and was doing a requalification in another subject just in case he cannot find work with the specialty he originally graduated from. (Sidenote: I thought the job market in London must have been exceptionalky tough as Mark seemed to be well educated enough)

Now that Mark visited us, however, we found out a little bit more. Mark - in his own words - has said that he has had “quite the rough last years”. We found out that Mark had a long term GF, he was planning to propose and marry, but they broke up around 3 years ago because she was most likely cheating on him. Phrasing “most likely” since the girl started texting and messaging with another guy (in secret), did not stop going out with him, and upon repeated questions started accusing Mark of cheating her instead. They had a fight, where she wanted to leave their shared apartment, and he wanted to finish their talk about this guy, and *supposedly* she started yelling that he was abusing her, asked the neighbours to call the police, and he now has an arrest record for domestic disturbance/abuse on his name, barring him from certain positions. This was the same time he moved in with his parents and did a requalification. 

Yesterday, Mark told us about a guy he knew, who had everything going right for him, when suddenly things started to go downhill. He lost his job, his girlfriend, couldn’t get a new job and he ended up committing a suicide. Mark sounded... sad and affected by this, even though he claimed himself that he didn’t know the guy that well. During his visits he would throw “jokes” about himself and sometimes when BF and him were playing card games or video games, and he would lose, he would start berating himself for “being an idiot and doing idiotic decisions”. Today, before leaving, he said he does not really want to go back to his work since his boss is an asshole and job does not pay very well. 

I strongly suspect that - if what Mark has told us IS true and he really did not want to cause a domestic violance, but it was a misunderstanding (but I do not know him personally and my BF claims he has never been violent or aggressive) - Mark is depressed. I know the symptoms, having been diagnosed several years ago myself. A lot what Mark said (berating himself for small mistakes) and how he said those things reminded me of myself. Also statistically men do not share their depression and are more prone to “suffer quietly”.

My BF does not see a problem, says I see problems where there are none - says I play like a mother to him. I am simply worried my BF’s good friend may - at one point - commit suicide since he does not see the point in living anymore.

Should I message him or should I leave it be? Would it be too weird to contact him? ",12Mar2019,2

617,"So I'm in first year of college and I'm in the same class with the brother of my high school best friend, let's call him Josh. At the beginning of the year Josh talked with the new classmates and tried to made friends, and kind of got into their group. I'm not a very social person and don't really feel a need for new friendships so I didn't really talk to any of my classmates. Now, the second half of the year started and I guess the other classmates kicked Josh out of the group. I kinda understand as Josh was just following them everywhere and randomly commenting kinda useless things. They would be talking and he would just abruptly interrupt thier conversation, etc.

Now he's following me around everywhere and it's getting somewhat annoying. A few examples:

Example one: Students can find their lesson schedule on the school's online learning platform, yet almost everytime Josh asks me where we have to be for next class, he sometimes even texts me asking where we have to be. It might not seem that annoying but I mean, he has a phone, internet, and logging in takes like 10 seconds.

Example two: I always make lunch at home and take it to school and just find a random chair somewhere to sit and eat, first half Josh would go to the caffetteria with the people from class, I never eat in there as it's always extremely crowded and I like some peace while I eat. But then Josh keeps saying things like ""you going to eat in the hall again?"", ""why not go to the caffetteria?"", etc. Then he says he'd like to go to the caffetteria, I mean just go there without me?

Example three: Sometimes I decide to skip a class (either because I'm not feeling well or I've already done it at home). So the minute I don't go to the next classroom Josh be ""where you goin??!"", then after telling that I'm going home he decides he's gonna go home too. When I go home because I already did it at home, he asks me ""is it hard to learn at home? I guess not?"" then I tell him that for me it wasn't that difficult but for him it might be harder, yet still he also goes home, even though he already failed 2 classes this year that he thought he could learn by himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in high school right now, and up until about 5 years ago life was great, I was very socially involved in middle school, then I moved to a place where I didn't speak the language and entirely shut down. Not only did my development stagnate but I feel like I entirely regressed mentally, and I don't exclusively mean socially. Ironically, my strangely voluntary isolation has led to me losing my personality entirely, making it basically impossible to connect with someone or drag myself out of the isolation. Now, writing this I realized that it definitely looks like I'd be generally seen as a loner or weird kid, this is not the case. I look entirely normal, talk entirely normal (until it's time to move up from small talk) and act entirely normal. Again, ironically, this lack of recognition on the part of other people has left me spiraling further down with nobody to reach out to because no one's aware of any of this. To top it all off, no one ever really even took me for someone who might struggle, given that I'm really tall, naturally athletic and generally just look big and stoic. And for so long I believed that I was and just pushed every problem away, recently I realized however that I'm pretty much an overgrown toddler afraid of everything and everyone, even though it's perfectly clear no one is remotely out to get me in any way. This is so extreme that I've literally never interacted with someone first. Never asked someone out first, reached out, I don't even say hello first.

Not only has this weird self ""mutilation"" prevented me from making any new friends, it's preventing me from considering my own friends friends. Out of however many people there are that I'm close to, I see a total of one as a friend, and even that's only because I literally grew up with this person, I'm talking sandbox to today. Everyone else, I feel like they don't really know me at all, which once again is my fault. I've noticed that I'll go to hell and back to convince someone I don't care about something the more I care about it. We had a school trip a couple years back where we all had to describe ourselves, put it on a whiteboard and then others would add to that. Carefree and relaxed was added to mine by others. I'm not, if anything I'm constantly stressing out and worried about every little thing that's happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has even seeped into my love life. I've never in my life reached the point of saying I love you to someone or having someone say it to me, my romantic experiences are basically exclusively alcohol fueled one night stands or short term FWBs. Recently I tried to push through all the aforementioned issues, started dating someone and that lasted less than a month before she broke up with me. According to her, she's extremely into me but just can't connect with me like that. Again, I went yeah it's fine, better that it happened now than months down the road, right, who cares no harm no foul. Inside, though, I was pretty much having a full on meltdown. Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't heartbroken because someone I loved dumped me, we dated less than a month. Thing is, she was overall extremely sweet as a person, I'm talking about literally one hundred percent entirely exclusively always positive, smile on her face, supporting, etc., even while she was breaking up with me funnily enough. The reason I was crushed was because she as a person was basically like giving a furnace to someone who's 20 seconds away from catching hypothermia, being around her energized me in a way I haven't felt in 5 years now. On the other hand, I was extremely happy for her because I don't think I could possibly be a good experience for her when all is said and done.

What I'm looking for is advice on how to fix myself and reconstruct my personality before it's too late. This isn't just a matter of call people - go out, I function completely normally at functions, parties, whatever.

629,"I was sat in a cafe yesterday listening to music and studying. I looked across the room and I saw a group of students holding up posters. I was not aware of what they were up to, but on it asked ""What is your purpose?"" It struck me very quickly with hints of ignorance, I don't have purpose. I wake up everyday doing the same thing, wake up, study, talk to friends, occasionally go for a run, eat, sleep then repeat. Everyday I put so much energy into my life for what? 

I feel like I need to get this off my chest. My life summed up very briefly, leading up to where I am now.

I was born in England, some my family live in South Africa. My whole life has been a complete mess, this is what I believe at least. At the age of 4 my family moved to Australia in hopes of a better life. I will not go into specifics but for my more important part of education I was constantly moved back and forth to Australia and then back to England. My parents could never decide where they wanted to live. I ended up missing important years of secondary school where I ended up massively falling behind in subjects such as science, math and English. When my family finally decided to stay in England I began my journey, trying to catch up with all what I missed. My school were not aware of the implications of my moving, they were not aware I had very little education for 2 years of my early childhood. My mom was not great at homeschooling me in Australia. I lived there for 10 years, but my parents decided in the final 2, that I would be home schooled under the British curricular. Bad mistake, my mom had no idea how to teach me and I didn't learn anything for better part of 2 years. Anyway, after moving back to England in my middle teens I struggled at school. Teachers put me in the highest graded classes with no realization that I was so far behind. By year 10 I think they realized how far behind I was, but by that time nothing much could be done. My GCSEs were approaching fast and I had to stay behind at the end of school most days to catch up. My teachers warned my parents I wouldn't even pass English or math, great encouragement right. 

I have never really had much encouragement in my life. My parents were very disconnected from me. They never really believed in me or encouraged me. 

Moving on, I finished secondary school achieving 12 GCSEs ranging from C-A. Science was not one of them, I blame this partly on my 2 years of failed homeschooling, sorry mom. I had enough GCSEs to move onto college. The only time my parents encouraged me to really do something in my life, was to go to college. I did in the end. There were 2 options in college for me. I was a super computer nerd so these options were either Computer Science or a slightly (in my opinion) easier one, which I think was just called computing. I found this 2 year course incredibly easy and finished with the highest grades possible and some awards for helping students in my class. In college, teachers did not really explore career aspects so when I finished I thought the only logical thing to do was go to university. I had the required grades from college, so why not. I looked university, mainly degrees like Computer Science and Cyber Security. I think I picked Cyber Security because my family pushed to me to take it. This sounds ridiculous but my parents just rammed down the idea of a career in cyber security to be the best and most profitable. So I started my Cyber Security degree.

I currently study criminology at university, not by choice but because my parents told me I would not be welcomed home if I didn't study something at university. Initially, I studied Cyber Security at university which you know. But within the first few weeks I made excuses to give it up. I thought for half my life I wanted a career in computer science and I set my sights on Cyber Security, ever since college in fact. This was all some illusion I created to express the fact that really, I didn't have anything solid that I wanted to focus on or strive for. 

I am half way through my degree now and I get asked all the time why I picked criminology, I smile at them and tell them I have always wanted to do it and that I want a career in this field. In actual fact I don't. I feel like I have been lying to myself my whole life, I have. 

So here I am right now. Being told my teachers at university about all these interesting career paths, mainly through the police or criminal justice system. I listen, I study every day something that I do not want a career in. My first year of criminology went surprisingly great, I achieved very good grades. Currently, my second year is good too. But, I always feel out of place, like I don't deserve to be in the place I am in. 

I don't know what I want to do in life. Ever since I was little I had always been afraid of living a boring life. To me that's working in a job I don't enjoy, starting a family and growing old not enjoying the things I want or living the life I want. I feel like my life is just this one boring cluster. I know many people have this type of life, some people enjoy it. I also realize that in life you have to work to live, I just don't see any career aspects in the future for me.

So here I am on this Reddit page. I really wonder what I am doing with my life. 

I want my life to be great, everyday an adventure. I love talking to people although I am sometimes in my own bubble.

- a group experience in which all the applicants will watch a video about counseling or a counseling session
- a writing sample

I don't care for small talk or really, most things that my co-workers happen to go on about. Either it's not a shared interest or it's just way too much detail for me to care about.

I'd rather just work and go home, you know?

It's awkward after they laugh or have whatever reaction to another stupid fucking story because they expect me to react in kind and usually I just try to get away with a feigned-interest ""hmm"" or the like. My one co-worker does it so much I get to thinking I might just tell her straight-out one of these days. Kind of harsh to say ""I don't care about the mundane minutiae of your life"" but it's true. 

So (and I am serious), people who are good at pretending to care (or maybe you're a talker and you actually do care), what do you do? I feel like I should get better at it if I'm going to be in the situation.

649,"Hey there, 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I’m not sure if this can be helped through advice but any input is appreciated. 

I recently went through a very unhealthy relationship. The person I was with was extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive, and even though I’m happy and with someone kind now I still feel the lingering results from the previous relationship. I’m very accustomed to being disregarded in relationships and I don’t want to come off as weak or unstable, because sure I have moments of anxiety still, but I’ve grown a lot and just want to be part of something healthy and  chill. 

But the point of this is that I’m an artist and I want to make a comic about this past relationship. The idea of condensing it, putting it on paper, having it all make sense and just the cathardic relief that creating gives makes me want to do this. However, I’m worried that mutual friends of ours will see this as me digging up drama or as an “attack” on my ex. I don’t care for drama (part of why I left my ex who lived off it) and I don’t want to give the wrong idea. I never really do autobiographical comics so this is somewhat new territory,. 

I wouldn’t use names or even likeness and the images would probably be really vague and sketchy concepts. I’d like to focus more on the warning signs of being with someone manipulative/abusive/toxic alongside my own thoughts and feelings on my individual experience. 

There is a lot of incriminating stuff, things that if friends of ours knew they might have second thoughts about  the kind of person my ex is. I don’t want anyone to not be his friend just because he was horrible to me; he treats his friends better than his SOs anyway. But more importantly, he needs friends if he’s ever going to mature. While it’s not my responsibility to care about this, I still don’t want to propagate any negative feelings about anyone who hasn’t had them about someone themselves. This doesn’t stop me from wanting to make this comic though. 

I could just not post it, but another reason I’d want to make it to begin with is to warn and educate people about the kinds of behaviors that are not okay in a relationship. If I could prevent someone from falling into the same trap I did, I’ll be happier. 

So I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation and has any advice to offer about how to go about this if at all. I appreciate you reading this far and thanks in advance! ",12Mar2019,2

653,"  

Hey, Reddit. Some backstory: I (23 F) live with my mom, who has what I believe to be pretty severe anger issues. I work as a writer, and I have a lot of deadlines to meet, so my mom’s anger issues have become a huge frustration and distraction for me since I primarily work from home.

The worst part is, ANYTHING can set her off. Whether it’s something small like a pair of missing scissors or not being able to email an attachment from her phone so she has to get out her laptop, she starts screaming loud enough for the neighbors to hear and often times will hysterically cry. To quote Drake, she goes from 0 to 100 REAL quick, and vice versa. Her motto is yell first, assess the situation second.

Just today, she couldn’t get the thermostat to work. Immediately, she starts yelling about how much she hates the house we’re living in (it’s a new construction with a lot of issues). She started stomping around the house, complaining about the fact that we have three stories and begins throwing objects around.

She usually never yells directly at me, so I wouldn't call it abusive, but it’s still really stressful to have to listen to her fits. I’ve tried calmly going to help her work an issue out, and she still finds ways to make it worse. If I get mad and yell back, it, of course, escalates to screaming matches between us. 

I’ve tried explaining her fits are affecting my ability to work, and her attitude about is kind of like, “Well, \*shrug\* what else do you want me to do? \_\_ wasn’t working, so I’m well within my rights to get mad and scream and throw shit.” It’s almost like she believes getting that angry is therapeutic, so she doesn’t have much of a drive to change that.

I’ve gotten her to admit once that she had a problem when she was calm. She talked about possibly going to therapy, but any other time I’ve talked to her she says she doesn’t have time or that it’s not worth it. Her mom died last year and her father is now on his way out, and she always blames her general stress on that without taking any steps to fixing it. I don’t believe those two things to have set it off though, this has been going on for my entire life. 

As an adult, I’ve began realizing how much her yelling has affected me. When I was a kid, it was a rare week where I wouldn’t be woken up by her screaming. I remember being 6 yrs old and having gotten sick overnight, and I was terrified to wake my mom because I thought she was going to yell at me. I’m now a light sleeper, I deal with issues and bottle emotions up to avoid inconveniencing anyone, and I hate, absolutely hate, when people yell, for whatever reason.

I know the easy option is to move out, or to go to a café or library to get work done (which I do occasionally), but I also feel like this is a problem she *needs* to fix. This can’t be healthy for her. She's jobless, has no friends, no hobbies. The only person my mom talks to anymore is her widowed, alcoholic sister, who lives alone and feeds on racism, homophobia, and other forms of hate and negativity. My mom is not racist or homophobic, but I can tell her instant reaction to things she dislikes is becoming one of unapologetic hate or anger, just like my aunt.

I have the opportunity to an honors thesis next year in the biology lab I’ve been working in since second year.

My supervisor is really hard to be around. He’s “old school” meaning he’s very demanding and kind of mean. He likes to put people in stressful situations and see how they respond. His theses are so much harder than any other theses in the department. But he’s the only one there who does the research I care about.

Also the grad school programs I want to apply to require a thesis in this area of research.

My friends and family are basically split in their advice. Some saying that it’s just not worth it for my mental health to put myself through the daily abuse and stress and anxiety for another year. Some saying it’s worth it for one more year for the opportunity it affords.

My therapist thinks he’s really bad for my mental health, but acknowledges the reality of the situation and the limited choices I have.

I could really use some perspectives from people on this. It’s hard to make sense of things sometimes when you’re in the thick of it. Like, everyone in college is stressed and anxious all the time tbh.

TLDR: If I want to do the research I am interested in, my only option is a supervisor who has made my last two years of school extremely stressful. I can’t tell whether it’s worth another year of constant anxiety and getting yelled at so I can apply to the grad school programs I want.",12Mar2019,1

(Sorry if my English is bad not my mother language)

Lots of stuff happend and We don't talk anymore
He left this workplace, I left too, but I wasn't expecting that we will be almost next to each other at our new work places and I see him every day when he's in his break which sucks. He passes my work place fast so I won't see him but I do. And he never looks over.

Yesterday I saw him with two female Co workers and I got mad and this is when I realised that I'm still not over him and it pisses me off so much.
Because I want to forget about him but I just can't.

He tried to talk to me again when I left my work to get to work with him at his new workplace and of course I said no thank u obviously. 

For me I always push him away even though I kinda like him IDK why maybe my pride even though he tried so many times but I just can't talk to him and I can't forget him and I live in this constant hell.

In the last year or so as people around me have begun relationships and i have matured i have really wanted a girlfriend. I go on a lot of dating app dates and have had little success so far, a total of 7 dates with 3 different girls. I think i am scared to leave college single as i have put a lot into getting one whilst at college because of the ease of meeting girls. I am scared that when I leave college I will be single for a good few years before I find someone when I want someone now. Is this dumb or actually normal? Should i continue to pursue dating for the next few months before i graduate? I don't even enjoy single life in the sense that I don't go out and get with girls all the time or particularly enjoy it when it happens...",12Mar2019,1

The office admin sounded positive about the salary request, said she’d get back to me before noon last Friday, but since then I’ve heard nothing.

672,"i commented this on my other post ab my other crush but felt that i needed to do a separate post for it. 

i reallllyyyy like this boy and i’ve liked him since last year. then i stopped liking him for some time. THEN my best friend tells me she likes him. (we are all really good friends) i really like him atm too but she doesn’t know and i’m scared to tell her. she’s a very sensitive person so i’m not sure how she will react. 

and my friend has 4 guys she likes. the first guy is her main crush and then the other 3 are sides. the guy i like let’s nickname him “mike” is a side. she already told him her feelings but he doesn’t know he’s a side crush lmao. 

i will probably bring it up later. the fact that i really really like mike even though he’s her side crush. maybe even after her and her main will start dating. as i said they’re great friends even tho he’s rejected her a bunch of times, i feel he will give in sooner or later. they’re relationship is great. 

mike and i are good friends. but he talks to a lot of girls ig? 

in my school i’m not labeled popular, but i’m not in the lowest status either. my friend group is right in the middle. and he talks to many “popular” girls even tho him himself isn’t popular. 

so thats the thing. there’s so many better people better than me he probably likes and even tho we are great friends i feel a slight drift is happening. we small talked a bit the other day. 


starting the conversation isn’t a problem. i have no problem with it. i just have no idea what to say and even if i want to tell him i have deep feelings towards him, what will he think? my friend already confessed to him and that will make me look bad. 

so i just need some insight on what i could possibly do here. thank you!

673,"Ok so I when I entered secondary I had this magical period called ""Entrepreneurship"" where the teacher literally blew my mind with her hotness. She was nothing like my other teachers or classmates. Of course 11 year old me was just infatuated with her and didn't think much of it but as I spent more time with her,by my third year in secondary I began to realize that I began falling in love with her. Of course 13 year old me who was at his peak of porn watching thought that women were easy but I did nothing. Eventually when I fortunately grew up, by my fourth year I knew I wanted more than just having sex. Just seeing her meant the world to me and I swear to god I would have offered both my testicles for her smile. But that year, having matured a bit I realized that she is this majestic creature who is happily married married and I am a worthless piece of shit. So of course this made me feel awful. I wanted to move on but I couldn't because I basically saw her every day. My grades basically plummeted due to my ""self-diagnosed Depression"" and I cried myself to sleep every night. I refused to talk to anyone because I felt quite embarassed to talk about this. 

Of course to this day, currently in my 6th year, I am still madly in love with her. Hell I don't even care about sex anymore I just want to be with her. Of course that will never happen. For 3 years now I have tried to move on but can't so please can I have some advice.

675,Okay. I'm turning 19 in May. I graduated highschool and tried to start college. I tried but they kept kicking me out of classes cause I hadn't paid yet the first year is supposed to be free. All my friends got in so yeah I'm the only one who hasn't. I've been staying home trying and trying. Always end up getting kicked. I wanna be a animator but I gave up on that dream. Don't know what to do really. Even if classes related to animation in college I would just have one year and that wouldn't be enough to become a animator. And I don't have the money to continue my studies from that point. I've been thinking about getting a job but my parents want me to stay in school.

All my friends know exactly what to do and I'm lost. I don't understand how they know exactly what classes to take and I don't. I'm scared I'm gonna go to college and still end up getting a piss job.

Lost that job due to mental breakdown

I move back home

I'm just going to say it, I'm a dick. I'm an asshole.

She doesn't (and has never) been good about cleaning the dishes, being clean in general, keeping up with laundry, etc.

I came home to dirty dishes that have been in the sink for a while (they reeked) and I told it was nasty. I washed them, but I feel like I'm being too hard. I criticize her for talking/chewing with her mouth open, not cleaning her dirty laundry in the closet on the floor (where we could store are bikes if she folded them and put them on the shelves) and not washing her hands after using the bathroom.

I intend to pay her rent. I was going to wait to help her with a car because she had a bus pass and uber gift card, but she went ahead and bought a POS chevy for 1200 that probably won't make it to may.

I'm not here to ask for comments that justify my actions!!

I criticize her too much and want to stop. I want to be more gentle.

687,"In the area where I live, we are experiencing a housing crisis. Rent is super expensive everywhere and only expected to get worse, and I am currently renting a place I can barely afford. I also got divorced last year, and have been struggling personally and financially since then. I also have health problems, particularly dental problems and mental health problems. I am being treated for the mental health issues, but I cannot afford the dental treatment that I need and my mouth is in pain every day. My job pays about as well as any job that I’m qualified for will, but I hate it and I feel like it’s destroying me.  I didn’t graduate from college, so there isn’t a lot I am really fit for, especially due to my health problems and I both can’t afford to and really hate the idea of going back to school. If I don’t re-sign my lease soon, the rent is going to go up and I won’t be able to afford to live here anymore. But if I sign it it will lock me in until July 2020, and I just really don’t want to stay here that long, either in this job or in this town. I just don’t know what to do. And apparently that’s not something a therapist can help you with, making major life decisions. I guess I just wonder if other people would play it safe and re-sign the lease and stay in a job that they hate just to make sure they have a roof over their head, or if it makes more sense to aggressively start looking for something else somewhere else. I have to have a job with benefits and I have to have a job that pays at least as much as I’m making now, but my options are so limited and I know the job market is tough, I feel like I should just feel lucky to have the job I have. I worry I wouldn’t be able to find anything else before the rent goes up and then I don’t know what I would do. my sister is really pressuring me to move to the area where she lives, but she would be the only person I would know there and she has a whole life of her own that I don’t really want to intrude on, plus I’ve never been really big on the town where she lives. In some ways though it would be better to be close to the only family I have left, since I am very lonely where I’m living now. There’s no guarantee I would be able to find either a job or a place where she lives and it would be very expensive to move there, but she has been really pressuring me. I don’t know what would make me happy, part of my mental health diagnosis is that I have a very weak sense of self and I am trying to work on that really hard. i’ve never made my own decisions, I’ve always just done what somebody else wanted me to do or what I thought they wanted me to do, so I never really developed the skill of thinking about what I want and making my own choices. I have really severe anxiety as well which makes every option feel like certain disaster and in the past I have stayed in bad situations because I am just too afraid to move. I feel very trapped and I feel very unsure. if anyone has any words of wisdom or any advice or any tricks or tips for helping me to make decisions I would be abundantly grateful for them.

I'm 16 years old, and a junior in high school. I have an alright life so far, although I do struggle a bit with depression and possible OCD. Other than that, it's all good - great girlfriend, great friends, fun hobbies.

But yet I'm still crushed by the idea of adulthood. I'm terrified of having to get a job. The only stuff I'm really into (music and writing) is very difficult to make a career out of, and having a job I dont like sounds like Hell. I don't want to spend most of my life doing shit I dont like, but it seems like that's how adulthood is. 

I'm also terrified of independence, as I've always been a very dependent person. It just sounds so terrifying with being responsible to even have a place to live.

Thinking about adulthood just makes me incredibly anxious and depressed, mostly because of the whole ""slaving away at a job you hate for most of your life"" thing.

Her boyfriend even used to look back, before they broke up. I don't know what to do. I can't confront her for just staring occasionally, I mean I could have last year, but she could just have staring problems.

Today I found out he got me a new cheap keyboard and didn't let me use my old keyboard when he was in the living room (which is 90% of the day, hes retired). I got really mad because I paid $40 for it, and I'm too young to get a real job so it takes me a month to get $40. When I tried using it, gaming didn't work because after about 5 seconds of holding down the walk forward button, it just stops and I need to press it again. After I told him about this, he just said that if it's broken, I broke it, despite barely even using it for 30 minutes. He told me to stop complaining and that I cant buy a better quiet keyboard with my own money, and he doesn't care that my old keyboard costed $40 and that I can't use it anymore.

699,"Pretty much all of my free time is dedicated to being productive or at least attempting to be. I have a lot of aspirations and things I want to get better at. Right now, I'm mostly focused on learning to draw and also learning to speak better (I want to gain a career in narration, but I'm not a great talker). So my daily routine (apart from my part-time work) is mostly comprised of focusing on improving on these two departments. Here's the big problem. I can't bring myself to set my mind aside from my goals.

Every waking hour, I'm determined to get better at things like these and as a result, whenever I watch a movie or play a game, I can't fully relax myself, because the nagging feeling that I could be productive right now is always in the back of my head. For over a year, I've felt like I've never proven myself to my family members or friends. With the exception of 1 kid, everyone in my family is older than me so they normally have more to say at family gatherings and more achievements to look back on. Part of my determination to be more skilled is a result of my desire to finally prove myself to people. 

This can do horrific things to a person's mental state. Every other day when I'm practising on bettering myself, I'll feel that I'm not making any progress. When drawing, I'll be fully aware of how I still spend up to (and potentially over) 30 minutes attempting the same stroke over and over. Or when speaking, I'll note that I'm stumbling over the same words that I was messing up a year ago. And when I realise that, there's a decent chance that I'll just completely lose my will to live. 

I'm extremely aware of how quickly time is moving and that bothers me further, because I'd quite like to have some achievements to look back on this year. 2018 was a year where I grinded through the repetitive motions in the hopes that something would come out of it, yet at the same time, barely nothing noteworthy happened then at all. I think that's the main reason why I'm so painfully focused on trying to better myself. Cos if I so much as blink, it'll already be 2020.  I'm terrified that 5 years from now, I'll be exactly in the same place that I'm in now. ",12Mar2019,2
700,"I just want to state that I respect my girlfriends feelings and choices, and that I am not planning to break up with her or anything like that.

My girlfriend of almost 4 months told me that she wants to stay a virgin until she is ""older."" This conversation came about when I asked her if she ever thought about us having sex and it eventually evolved to her telling me that she wants to be a virgin. We are both in high school (I know, blah blah blah, we are too young etc.) but im very much in love with her and she feels the same. 

While I am a little disappointed that she doesnt want to lose her virginity, nothing is going to change in our relationship. I still completely intend to stay with her without sex.

She is a very horny person, and we have done everything except go all the way. She initiates sexual contact most of the time, so she is a very willing participant all of the time. This confuses me on the virginity thing, but I still respect her choices and I love her.

As most men would be though, I'm a little disappointed in her telling me this. I want to have sex with her and now im a little sad that it isnt going to happen.

Without sounding like a douche,

Any advice on things I can do or say that might make her consider it? Any advice on ways to get over the no-sex thing? 

Any comments and questions are appreciated.

Thanks

707," I am a college student and am writing a debut fiction novel. I want to self publish it but since I am boycotting Amazon, I plan to publish through Smashwords and have my book in Barnes N Noble and Apple iBooks as well as on Smashwords. I have stopped selling and purchasing things through Amazon and now do it through Ebay. Its not hard for me because I do the majority of my shopping at retail stores in person. I wrote a essay about Amazon last semester and stated my reason for boycotting them was because of how their factory workers were abused and because I fear their rapid growth. Amazon makes Walmart look like a mom and pop store. They own Whole Foods, Washington Post, Twitch, Goodreads, IMDb movie database and of course Amazon Web Services is even bigger than Microsoft Azur. I feel they are even more dangerous than Walmart because retail stores such as Office Max, Target, Toys R Us, Radio Shack, Payless Shoes, Mattress Firm, GameStop, Sears and Kmart are either closing permanently or downsizing and closing hundreds of stores. Pretty much every retail store is hurting except Walmart and Costco. This is bad because lack of competition will inevitably lead to ridiculously high prices. Like you'll go into a store or order online a gallon jug of milk and guess what? It will cost $20 because they can get away with it.

708,"So, some background first. For the past 4ish years, I asked for a PS4 on my Birthday and Christmas lists. (I am currently 18, going to college in the fall.) My dad never got it for me, so I got a job and saved up the money myself. I’m on the autism spectrum, and video games are one of my special interests, so it’s one of my prized possessions. 

Yesterday, my dad and I had a chat about college. My dad is a constant critic of me, and my therapist has said his treatment could qualify as emotional abuse, though I’m hesitant to call it that as people may not take it seriously. Simply put, he’s unsupportive and emotionally absent, favoring my brother and stepmom over me. So I expressed a desire to live on campus, not with him and his wife. My dad thinks I’m retarded. Kept telling me I need him and can’t survive on my own. I know I can, as he’s basically been leaving me to fend for myself for the past 9 years. I cook my own dinner, wash my own clothes, and basically do everything except pay bills. 

He was offended by the fact I thought I could live without him, and today all my PS4 games were gone. Every single one. 8 games, plus all the games from my brother’s Xbox. He won’t tell me where they went, and I’m afraid he might have sold them or something. The one thing I actually own in his house, and he took it. 

Should I apologize? I don’t think I did anything wrong. ",12Mar2019,1

I need some reassurance and advice for my self this time in regards to her. So we set boundaries about guy friends and all that and she said she would respect them. For some reason my overthinking stupid ass brain always tries to think worst case scenario. Its not just because im an overthinker, its more so because she had like a history of doing some unloyal things (not exactly cheating but entertaining another man while in a relationship) and despite her reassurance of fixing things and setting boundaries for guys to respect our relationship i still worry. She has a lot of guy friends, but she also has a lot of girlfriends too so she isnt like too much on one side, shes like friends w everybody in a sense (we are in High school still senior year) i am pretty busy, so until about 5-6 at night ill be distracted from worrying but when i text her ill sometimes worry and think worst case scenario because sometimes she’ll leave me on read unintentonally while talking to her friends mostly when shes w girls or she wont respond back right away when shes with friends both guy and girl, however i dont suspect any foul play as this is usually after school practice and such/they dont leave campus grounds. Also theres like rumors that she slept around and such but i try my best to not believe them because they were started by her enemy and rumors especially in high school are usually vicious and untrue, however my overthinking gets the better of me in this sense and will draw weird ass conclusions connecting the rumors and her past. She has told me numerous times the rumors are untrue and even told other people while i was with her that they were untrue.

714,"So. I met this guy a little less than a year ago at his cousin‘s birthday party. We got along really well, talked a lot and just had a fun evening playing games with a group of people.

He added me on facebook, then asked me out for coffee like a week later, but I didn’t have time and we ended up meeting again to go to the cinema with his cousin and another friend. He started messaging me asking to meet up for drinks or to do sports together more and more. So at this point i probably should/could have realized it‘s more of a date-type-situation for him. But I had kinda recently broken up with my first boyfriend of 2 1/2 years just before i met him and i was just looking to meet new people, make new friends and have fun. Dating wasn’t on my mind. At all. In addition to that, i dont feel attracted to him whatsoever, which kind of made me think it must be the same for him. 

Anyway, fast forward a couple of „dates“ and months, my brain turned on and i realized he might be interested in more. So when he asked me to do something again i told him that, yes we could do something, but I just wanted to also tell him that im not interested in more than friendship  because i was not in a dating mindset atm, and „i dont know if its inappropriate to assume anything but i just wanted to tell you so that you dont expect something different.“ 
He replied nicely, telling me not to worry and that he enjoyed spending time with me and liked that we could talk to each other so easily but then ended with „but i guess you dont feel the same :(„ which i kind of ignored by saying no i did find talking to him easy too, and thanks for understanding.

We met for drinks a couple of times after that, (without any awkwardness) and then stopped seeing each other for some months because i had a lot to do at uni and he had a new job etc. - i invited him to my birthday party like a month ago, we had fun again and said we‘d go out for drinks some time.

Thing is, i‘m pretty sure he still has feelings for me and i dont know if he thinks that now time has passed i might be interested in dating, since i never told him i wasn’t interested in him ~specifically~, because i just said i didn’t want to date in general back in the summer. 

Should i address it again? Should i not say anything? I really do like him as a friend, we always get along great and i dont want to lose that. But i also dont want to be shitty and get his hopes up or hurt him.  ",12Mar2019,1
715,"Some context: 
When she was younger she was a chubby child so as many children do, she grew up with some self-image issues. As she grew up, it evened out throughout her body but not perfect.
Now for the last few years she had been skinny (read: flat stomach) but the way she had gone about to get there wasn’t a healthy way. From what she’s told me, she worked out a LOT, ate little to nothing, lo and behold it worked! But anybody that’s done this before knows this doesn’t last, I can relate to her in that I used to go to great (unhealthy) lengths to cut weight for wrestling and that’s why I know it was very easy to put weight back on through this method.

Recently, she started gaining some weight, only about 5-10 lbs or so I’d say. I still thinks she’s absolutely beautiful, I’m very attracted to her and I see no issue with this but I’m well aware this isn’t my body, it’s not my perspective, it’s her situation. I’ve got a fairly good build and I frequent the gym, and up until recently she did too. Now, she says she hates her body, she’ll get frustrated every time she looks in the mirror, gets dressed, etc. and doesn’t feel comfortable going to the gym because she just compares herself to others.

&amp;#x200B;

To give some context: my girlfriend has already had her birthday recently, and Christmas has passed, but I want to really show her how much she means to me. I like giving her gifts that I have made myself, or at least have put a lot of personal thought into, but I am sort of running out of ideas that are not all the same! 

For Christmas I gave her some normal gifts, as well as a box of silly hand-written and drawn notes telling her how I feel about her, and she seemed to really enjoy them. I also wrote her a series of love letters (including a silly poem) in the months leading up to her birthday, even before I organised Christmas presents. I was quite proud of these, but now that she has had her birthday, I feel like that cute little project I was working on is gone, and I want to find something else to prove to her that she's as fantastic and wonderful as I think she is. 

I know that this may sound a bit silly, and possibly crazy that I constantly have to show her that I love her, but the whole point is that she would never ask or expect me to do these things for her, and I just love surprising her. This may not be the perfect platform to get advice on such a vague subject matter, but I really just want to find something I can do, or make, or create, that will reflect once more how much I love her.

If it helps:

\- She likes musical theater (we both do, and are both singers)

\- She already knows that I have written some songs about her (I know, it's a lame cliche thing to do)

\- She is studying make-up

\- I am too poor to suddenly take her on a holiday (Sadly)

733," So tomorrow I am supposed to meet with a higher up at work to discuss a sexual sexting relationship I had with a superviser but not my superviser at my work. This superviser is best friends with the guy who’s the manager of Human Resources so I am having to go around him. 

The relationship didn’t end well. There were several occasions he reminded me things would never go any further because we were coworkers and at the time he was married. He said his wife wasn’t sexually interested in him and he liked the attention and he told me 3 times that he liked me. I made frequent sexual advances and sometimes he would shut it down and I’d apologize and other times he would tell me it made him hard. When he said he no longer wanted to flirt or anything with me and it was clear it all stopped. 

After that I became concerned about being gossiped about (I’m also married). There were two occasions where I went by the office and needed help from another superviser and my once playful leader would barely make eye contact with me. On another occasion another one of my supervisors randomly began talking to me about the person I had the relationship with and her tone and the way she was looking at me made me feel like she was trying to get me to engage in a conversation about him. Just a few days ago I had to call the guy because he does repairs and there was an issue with a work vehicle. Well at the end of my shift he finally told me a plan for the vehicle. I told him I’d see him tomorrow and a half hour later the plan was changed and when I asked my supervisor about it she just Reiterated the new plan. 

Additionally, the girl he was involved with prior to me and is now involved with again called me because she knew we had been talking and wanted to confirm his story. 

I feel so paranoid that everyone knows and I’m so scared about this meeting because I feel like he’s going to call it sexual harassment. 

I tried to ask him about it and he told me I had no proof and that I was being unreasonable and told me to take it up with the appropriate person (his best friend).

734,"She [F16] sometimes texts me [M15] on social media about what I post. She laughs at my silly jokes in class. She sometimes has that shy smile when we bump into each other. We were supposed to go to a concert together next week, but her family had recently planned a birthday on the same day. We were both very sad about it.

We don’t talk very much irl though, even if we are in the same Spanish class. I guess we are both pretty shy. And I think she’s a very nice and cute girl.

I would like to go further with her, but I’m not exactly sure if she really likes me (maybe I’m over interpreting of all of this) and scared of rejection if I try something.

Any advice? Thanks!",12Mar2019,1
735,"This is sort of long, but I will try and make it as brief as possible.

I am currently 3 months into a masters in teaching program at my college. A teacher had cancelled class a significant number of times so a classmate and I separately emailed one of the admin thinking that he could offer some advice or help on how to resolve having missed so many classes. 

That admin forwarded my classmates email to the program head (PH), and that teacher requested an in person meeting with my classmate and the head of student affairs. I went along because I also sent an email that, for some reason, wasn't forwarded on.

Since the emails were sent, the teacher who had cancelled class made an announcement that he would make more of an effort to hold class from now on, which resolved the issue within the email. The PH who got the forwarded email still wanted to meet.

This classmate and I go into the meeting expecting to say that our issue was resolved so there is no need to have this meeting. As soon as the PH and the HSA (head of student affairs) sat down, they belittled my classmate and I saying that this is ""just how teaching is now. You have to be flexible."" They then went on to berate my classmate saying that her email was ""hostile"" because she voiced her concerns about a program and missing so many classes

When we tried to explain our frustrations, both the PH and the HSA told my classmate, to her face that she “will never be a teacher” if she continues on this way. We both feel that her email was not hostile, but rather appropriate in voicing the different levels of her concern.

The take away from the entire meeting was that we, as students of the program, just have to deal with any issues that we have because the PH and the HSA say to. We were also told that we have to change our “personalities” or we will never be teachers. Both the PH and the HSA mentioned that being open and able to have conversations is important, yet both of them were incredibly defensive and rude when we tried to explain our situation. 

How can we deal with future frustrations and concerns when the PH we are supposed to bring issues to disregards them? We can’t go to the head of student affairs, because she backed the PH we met with. The person we emailed initially (who we thought would support us) is required to forward our emails about the program to the PH. How can we have our voices and concerns heard?

737,"I'm 18 and a senior in high school, I desperately need to get a job ASAP so I can save for college.
I quit my old job at a restaurant as school was starting up because I wanted to focus on sports, school and college admissions stuff, as well as the fact that it was a small family run thing and I was maybe getting 10 to 15 hours a week and making 2 dollars an hour less than the metro area minimum wage because the place is just slightly beyond a point on a map.

Anyways all the things I needed to worry about are winding down and I've applied to Safeway, Fred Meyer, Starbucks and Walmart. I ended up getting a response from Fred Meyer and even an interview and they said they'd get back to me and say yes or no on a certain day and they've just gone silent. I haven't heard back from anyone else yet. I may apply to more places , but the only other things are fast food places and I really don't want to work in a restaurant again.

I don't want to sound like an entitled prick, but I am an eagle scout, valedictorian (decided after the first semester senior year), bilingual, and made all state athletic teams. Along with 3 years in the service industry, if I had to guess I am most likely more appealing to a manager than all the other candidates for the job. Why haven't I heard anything back from anyone, what am I doing wrong? The unemployment rate is super low right now shouldn't this be easy?",12Mar2019,2

Since moving to a different state, I now have the option to transfer or opt out of college altogether. Now the college I went to wasn’t an Art school per say. It had a very underfunded art program, so my poor experience could have attributed to that, but for the most part it wasn’t very helpful

742,"So on Monday this week my friends and I decided it was a good idea to sit in the front of the bus (where the teachers sat). My friend took out his phone and I asked to use it and started messaging my friend. The teacher caught us and asked for the phone and me as the genius I was didn't turn off the phone and he had started reading the messages between my friend in another state and I. It included a lot of swearing and racial slurs which WAS NOT sent in school or while I was on the bus. I take full responsibility for using my phone in the bus but they're targeting me for using ""aggressive"" language. All the language used was not targeted towards my friend nor is it used as a threat towards him and nobody in the school was involved in the conversation between us. They say that I don't understand the history of the word. The friend I say this to is partially black and is fine with me saying it and saying racial slurs himself too. We both know that we're joking and that it's not something we actually meant towards each other. They are trying to punish me for something I did at home which I believe is something they shouldn't be butting into because it's my parents responsibility to punish me when I'm at home not the schools nor does the school rules apply every where I go. I have to meet with the director of our school tomorrow and I'm just trying to think of what to say and whether or not I should argue with him. The day after that my Japanese friend had his phone and he hadn't realized he had it and it rang in the middle of class. They think that it was because of us that he didn't turn in his phone and now is facing the risk of being suspended from school. ",12Mar2019,2
743,"So this has been going on for a long time. My friend(BF) recently has had some struggling at home...

Backstory
My friend and I met in 6th grade(we’re freshman right now). Back then he had a dad that had promised him anything, but didn’t live up to it, and from then to 8th grade was an alcoholic and an abuser. Now they don’t live together but there is a new problem.

BF’s mom is really mentally abusive. Not physically. Recently they got evicted from their house and has moved in with his uncle. BF’s siblings are also the spawn of satan. They often beg for stuff, and if they don’t get what they want, they ask the mom and the mom gives them what they want. Not only that but his mom will seemingly punish him for something stupid as not doing something he didn’t know he was supposed to do, or for no reason at all. He has talked to his mom about this but most of the time he gets a shrug or a “go back to your room!” Because of anxiety and the stress he often deals with at home, he’ll often come from school stressed, and his mom just says “you don’t know stress” or “You’re just grumpy”

It’s not as simple as calling CPS because if me or my dad called CPS, then his dad would get his kids back and that just leads to an even worse household. I don’t like not being able to help my friend of 4 years.",12Mar2019,1

She said she really wanted to start a relationship with me. 

Since we began to “talk” in terms of a relationship, i’ve noticed some things. She does hang out with her ex still but lies to me about it and gets mad if i ever bring it up, she has a couple pictures of them together around her room, and it just doesn’t seem like they are broken up. She tells me all the time that they are not together and they’re just friends now but i simply can’t trust that because of how much she’s lied to me about it, and all of her friends and her ex’s friends say they are still together. We hang out maybe once a week and do everything that a normal relationship does, except when i ask her if she’s ready for a relationship she tells me that she isn’t ready yet because she likes the freedom, but she still wants a relationship soon. She’s been telling me soon for the past 5 months. I believe she doesn’t want a relationship because she’s still stuck on her ex. What do i do? Im so deeply in love with her but i hate the way it is right now. ",12Mar2019,2

But every time I try to tell him he says people do care and ""the truth is too harsh for me""

I think it's because he points out what people wear a lot all the time but I swear normal people dont do this. Help me guys? It's really annoying especially when he has the fashion sense of a fking old sports guy with random mismatching neon colors",12Mar2019,2

Yeah, I know this is crazy. I know this is childish. I know this is riddiculous. Maybe a jealousy that turned to self disgust. I want to change that, but first I need to figure out why this happens. Yes, it is low self esteem. Beyond that, why? Any thoughts? Advices?",12Mar2019,1

759,"Working where I (25f) work has it’s perks. I’m in the field I studied for in college, I get tons of free stuff from coworkers and sponsors, the atmosphere is super laid back, and my coworkers are absolute gems. There’s one person I work with (30m), we’ll call him John (creative first name, I know. 🤣)

John is quite charismatic. He’s pretty much friends with everyone in the department we work in. We work on the same shift together most days, so we spend a lot of time together. He disclosed to me that he’s actually quite introverted, and that he doesn’t express himself too easily. I’ve picked up on this when we’re working in groups. He’s pretty calm and not too emotional... unless we’re alone. 

When he and I are together, it’s almost like he’s trying to impress me. His calm, quiet demeanor turns into extroverted and expressive. He’s always cracking jokes, making me laugh, and showing off how smart he is about not just work related things, but things that he is passionate about. We get along very well. 

He has invited me out to places multiple times. Once to a bar, once to go hiking with him. He’s told me his plans for the weekend and for nights unprovoked. We’ve never hung out outside of work, but for only being coworkers, John is quite open with me and we’ve talked openly with each other about our personal lives. He’s told me he is single, at the time I had a boyfriend, but I’ve since told him that I’m now single. 

The other thing I’ve noticed is that he gets into my personal space quite often. Whenever we’re in a group, he stands right next to me, and whenever I ask him for help, he gets super close to me. 

He has told me that he’s not very good at flirting, and that’s he’s afraid to at work anyways. I’m wondering what next steps would be. He’s a really awesome person. I would date him if I knew for sure he was interested in me. 

TL,DR: This guy I work with is single, not good at flirting, but is trying really hard to impress me. To date him or not to date him?

Hi. I just posted this on a separate subreddit (r/raisedbynarcissists), but I'm also asking here because I really want a lot of different opinions on this. I've been thinking myself into a spiral, so I feel it would be best for me to step back and get an unbiased opinion from someone who's not me.

I'm typing this because I honestly *don't know*. I don't know if I'm blowing this way out of proportion or something. Anyway. I would like an unbiased opinion about this, so thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. I only started thinking about this because I was recently sexually assaulted, and I really started remembering things when after that, I had to share a bed with my sister where she would masturbate next to me. I was still very shaken from being assaulted, so my sister doing that scared me a lot and I guess jogged my memory. 

On a side note, my parents pretty much refused to get me help or therapy even when I asked for it, instead telling me that I should just 'bounce back' and that the best thing would be for me to 'ignore it'. I suppose I should also note that anything involving sex or dating or, for that matter, sexual assault is just *not* a topic with my family, and my sister has always been one to rebel against that, having secret boyfriends and sending nudes and having sex when she shouldn't.

When I was about 5, I remember that my 12 year old sister would initiate oral sex with me. I don't remember how it started, but I do remember it happening and it ending. We shared the same bedroom with two different beds each on opposite sides of the room. I remember once it got late, she would come to my bed, or I would go to her bed. Usually I would go to her bed, because I remember her saying I was too loud when she gave me oral sex. I remember maybe making a sound once because it tickled, and I remember her telling me to shush because I would wake up our parents. Whenever I had to go to her bed, she told me what to do and how to do it. I'm pretty sure that she was moaning, so I assume she was aroused by it.

Eventually, and I'm not sure of the time frame, my sister ended it. She sat down with me one day and ended it. My memory is a bit fuzzy here, but the general gist is that she told me we weren't going to do it again and that we shouldn't speak of it anymore.

I don't know how it started, but I'm absolutely sure that she initiated it. I had literally no idea what was going on or what it meat, so I guess I went along with it because I adored my sister. I went along with it. Since I don't remember how it started, I don't know if she threatened me or forced me or anything. I never said anything against it. Maybe it was voluntary? Maybe I totally consented to it? I don't think I ever explicitly said no. I'm just unsure if I'm making a big deal out of this just because I was recently sexually assaulted and that I just see everything as something bad.

So, yeah. I'd really appreciate your opinions on this. Thank you in advance.",12Mar2019,1

762,"Hello r/advice.
For context, I’m a young female university student studying abroad in Western Europe. 


Recently, I moved into a building of small, private studios. While we have our own bathrooms, kitchens, and living areas, we share several common spaces, including a laundry room and parking area. Those living in the building consist of students my age. 


Soon after I moved in, a man who appears to be around 45 or so years old moved in across the hall from me. Almost instantly, his behavior was strange. He began leaving his belongings and garbage in the hallway, as well as in common spaces. I’ve found baskets of laundry left in the laundry room for days, slippers left on main hallway steps for months, and so on. He also has been seen painting strange patterns on the walls of public spaces, and leaving assorted, confusing notes in several places. The most alarming note was left on the message board of the building. It said several things, including “the walls have ears” and some word salad about always being on time. He also hung a massive wall clock above the note. Worst of all, a strange smell began to permeate the hallways soon after he moved in. The source appears to come from a large puddle of what looks like dried urine somewhere near the laundry room. While this puddle could be from a leak, I find it strange that the smell only appeared when he moved in. 


I assume that he’s a mentally ill individual who needs some sort of care. His presence has made me feel uncomfortable coming home late at night, or even venturing to the basement to do laundry alone. I’ve done my best to remind myself that he most likely isn’t going to hurt me. 


I’ve just come home from a night out, and I’m genuinely shook up, and I’m not sure why. I came home around midnight, and went to park my bike in the common parking space that we all share. This resident’s window faces the parking area. As I was chaining my bike, I look up, only to find that him staring hard at me from his window. Out of nowhere, a current of ice seemed to slide down my spine, and that little lizard part of my brain started flashing all kinds of danger signs. He didn’t stop staring until I left the parking area. I have no idea why I had such a strong feeling of impending danger. 


Reddit, what do I do? Am I being paranoid? I’m not the only resident in the building who finds his presence uncomfortable, and several of us have sent complaints to the company that owns the building. Nothing has been done yet. I don’t know what to do. He hasn’t actually done anything directly harmful towards me. It’s just that whenever I see him or signs of him, I suddenly feel unsafe. I feel terrible about passing this kind of judgement on to him for no reason. Moving out is no way an option for me, so I have to find some way to cope. 

Please advise! ",12Mar2019,0
