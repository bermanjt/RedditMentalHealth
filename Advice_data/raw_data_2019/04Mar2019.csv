0,"'m a 20 y/o female music teacher at a private music academy franchise. My boss and franchise owner, ~38M, has caused me to be uncomfortable because of his inappropriate and sexual comments. He calls me babe and honey, which could be inoffensive and explained as being friendly but he also confides in me his personal problems (ie: he's getting divorced). He also has shown me inappropriate music videos and songs with very sexual connotations. I'm often there early because of the time I am able to get dropped off at, and last week he showed me a song about female oral sex because he said ""as a female, I would appreciate it."" He also once called me over to his desk and said ""this is kind of dirty but it's so funny!"" and shared with me a picture of a girl holding a used condom and a straw with the caption ""kid's meal."" He also comments and tells me I'm too thin, or that I look nice, or that he likes when I bite my lip.


I've shared these incidences with my parents and boyfriend and they both say I should quit but I work there five days a week and feel guilty leaving the company and my students high and dry. I also have done nothing to discourage his behaviour, as he is my boss and I didn't want to be confrontational. My dad suggested I ask him for severance or speak to the owners at head office, but I am nervous to burn this bridge. My boss has also said that he's very vindictive, and that it's good that we're friends because he is revengeful to people who cross him. I'm very shy and non-confrontational so I'm scared to stand up for myself. 


I was offered a job at another franchise location owned by somebody else so I do have another job lined up if I say the word, but it's within the same company so it's likely that I would encounter my boss again. I have been at this company for three years and his behaviour had escalated but I also want to do this strategically and responsibly in a way that will work out well for my future career. Do I respectfully give my two weeks and accept the other position?? Do I ask for severence and report him to head office?Any advice on how to handle this would be helpful and welcome.",04Mar2019,1
1,"I feel kinda weird, I feel like my social life is falling apart, I’m failing a-levels because the pressure of doing the huge amounts of homework for all 4 subjects, my time management and organisation has completely gone out the window.

I often find myself sitting in my room bored out of my mind but I never want to actually do anything, the only thing I don’t get bored of very quickly is guitar and piano but everything else I just don’t wanna do.

I wouldn’t say I constantly feel sad but I haven’t felt properly happy in a long time and I just seem to feel nothing and be completely void of emotions.

I’ve just become almost lazy and I don’t want to get up in the morning, I’m not feeling suicidal or anything but I don’t enjoy live even though I should. I have a great girlfriend and awesome family and friends, I have an unconditional offer from a university to peruse my dreams but none of this makes me happy, I just don’t really want to deal with anything right now.

Please someone help caus I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Sorry for going on a bit and thank you for taking the time to read this.",04Mar2019,1
2,"My cat has an obstructed urethra.
Brought him into a vet hospital, they did a 2k procedure to get him unblocked.
Was about to take him home but he got obstructed again.
They have to do another catheter to get him unobstructed. If he gets obstructed one more time, he'll need a $7,000 surgery to survive.

4," The wife's dad passed away. Him and his wife separated 20 years ago. The dufus forgot to update his will. Mum has 3 daughters. She's obviously entitled to the dirty cash and she has taken it. She is close to 2 of her daughters. My one doesn't even want the money but shes annoyed that the mum has taken the money and not thought about the wishes of the dad. Mum is justifying it by saying they were still close (they absolutely were not - particularly when he was going through his illness).  Wife wanted to just get rid of all of the money in a massively lavish funeral to stop this happening to the family.  She then thought better of it, wanted to give her mum the benefit of the doubt.

They have now fallen out - mainly because the mum is acting all offended because my wife had the audacity to say that perhaps she shouldn't pocket all of the money.  Its not even a big estate.  Certainly not life changing.

This inst an ask - its a bit of advice for any youngsters looking for a life partner. Pick your wife. Monitor the in-laws prior to signing up to the marriage because this family is absolutely insane.",04Mar2019,1
5,"My best friend and I had our first huge fight Thursday and had a minor one earlier today. We have resolved both and both fights were unrelated but I was wondering is that normal to have a 2 different fights in such a close time frame? We hardly ever fight, counting these two I think we've fought about 3 times. I'm just worried our friendship is this something we need to talk about or am I just letting my anxiety get to me?

6,"I have trouble with talking to people about what I like. I like playing video games but I play kind of weird stuff so it's hard to talk about them, and if I do I get worried the person I'm talking to will make fun of me.

I like listening to music a lot too but some of it comes from video games or anime which ties into my first paragraph. Other stuff I listen to is foreign.

Even the images I laugh at are weird. I showed people at my table in one of my other classes an image I found on another sub and they said what I was laughing at was kind of stupid.

I like talking with people but if they ask what I like it's really hard to talk about and I feel really stupid about it and I don't know how to get over it.",04Mar2019,1
9,"Long story short I quit medical assisting (which doesn’t make much, but I actually liked) to get a job in insurance (that makes me feel trapped with more pay) about a year and a half ago.

Medical assisting, you chart, work with patients, give shots, etc. Its a structured job and you pretty much know what you’re going to do when you go in. There’s more connection to people and a sense of helping others. 

With the company that I work for now, it’s insurance. I assist the providers with whatever questions or concerns they may have (claim issues, website issues, etc.) and I also credential and back ground check on these providers. I don’t hate the paperwork but I do hate: 

- management has had a stick up their butt about me since I started. A back ground on this is that I’ve NEVER had issues with management or authority. Im a hard worker, always on time, and never take off. I’ve actually been complimented on this and have been well liked at past jobs. For some reason they either ignore me, or they’re snooty to me. I don’t get it. I also get left out a lot. It’s super clicky at this job. Gossip flies through like wild fire. 

- we literally rip off our providers and I’m tired of lying when I totally sympathize with them. I’m on the front line and I hate it. I can never close my tickets because their claim issues last six months. (That’s how long it takes for them to get paid when our policy is 30 days.) It’s ridiculous. They only fix the updated fees when a provider calls into complain, so if a provider doesn’t have a really good manager that checks everything they think it’s okay to rip them off. I know this and I HATE it. I’m on the phone with the managers and doctors and I have to LIE. I say “yes we are aware and we’re going to get this fixed as soon as possible.” While knowing this has been going on for a year and they have no intentions to fix it. Why would they? They get to keep money. But it makes me feel like crap. I’m not cut out for that. 

- We do stuff outside of our pay grade. I’m not a claims processor, but we process claims because they’re so overwhelmed. I don’t mind doing extra work at all. I actually really like claims processing. But with everything else I have to do that has time lines it’s super overwhelming to try and fit someone else’s job in with mine. We do this a lot. 

The only good thing about it is the pay. I’ve been out of medical assisting for a year and a half and I guess I just need to know that I’m not being wishy washy on this. The job stresses me out because I hate it. They’re perks which is why I think I stayed with it for so long, but I also just miss human connection and feeling like what I do matters. ",04Mar2019,1
11,I have been out of work for 2 years. For the majority of that time I’ve been volunteering at cafes. At 29 I find this thought depressing as I am high school educated but I feel so far behind. I’ve had some jobs I was content in. Currently I earn a good amount for my mental health diagnosis. My condition has improved though so I’m not sure whether to just carry on doing what I’m doing. I will still get a small chunk while I work. But if I was to get a minimum wage I’d be on the same pay as I am now. If I had no disability money coming in I’d be on less in a job and I’d struggle. I guess I’m just looking for motivation to actually get a job and become ambitious again. I’ve been out for so long I feel a bit hopeless that it will be alright. With the money I’m currently on I’ve been enjoying breaks with my gf and things like that and it depresses me I won’t get that once my disability runs out,04Mar2019,1
12,"I moved to London in October to go to university and I had to move away from my boyfriend who I had lived with for 2 years. We’ve been together over 4 years and lived together over 2. He has been struggling with the distance and he broke up with me a couple of days ago. 
We were so close and I consider him my best friend. Now I feel like a family members died and I can’t sleep or eat. I keep myself busy but whenever I stop I get this sinking feeling and I start feeling sick. It wasn’t an angry breakup but i wasn’t expecting it and it’s absolutely broken my heart.

13,"My wife and I have a four month old girl. Her parents live in town, about a 10-15 minute drive from is and mine do not. 

The in-laws are clearly in love with their granddaughter but only want us to go to their house so they can see her. They have never asked to come over and the one time in her four months of live they have, we had to do some in-depth planning to find the right date. 

They tell us we can come over any time but they never want to come to us. We live in a smaller apartment but it’s entirely comfortable for four people and a baby to all hang out for an evening and our dinner table is a perfect size for four people to eat together. 

One of the persistent issues is my mother in-law’s mild-to-moderate agoraphobia. She won’t drive at night and won’t drive on the freeway. My father in-law doesn’t have this issue and will drive whenever they come down to us but last night he and I went to a sporting event and my MIL wouldn’t drive to our place to hang out with her daughter and granddaughter because she didn’t want to have to drive at night. 

They suggested we plan ahead to have them come over but they seem to think it’s easier for us to go to them instead. It’s not and we’ve made sure to tell them this.

I wish they wanted to come over to spend time with us. My parents would kill for that opportunity and they spend more time with us on FaceTime with our daughter than my wife’s parents do. 

We don’t really know where to go from here other than creating a schedule to have them over, we just wish they would ask to come over on a whim. We’d love to have them, they know that, but it just doesn’t happen. 

Thank you to anyone offering suggestions ",04Mar2019,1
14,"Ok so this is weird, I was going to post this on r/autism but I'm not sure if this is anything to do with my autism or if I'm just crazy...

I have a lot of problems with sleep due to my autism and basically I never get a lot, it takes me a loooooong time to fall asleep and I'm constantly waking up so I'm perpetually exhausted.

My boyfriend doesn't have any problems sleeping and I feel angry at him for it and it just makes me find it harder to sleep... I've never said a word about it and I always smile and kiss him goodnight but then when he's asleep I sit on the sofa feeling abandoned. It's not just him, if I stay at my mums and she goes to bed I feel annoyed and I have had my brother to stay and when he says he's going to bed I feel really upset... 

Like I said I've never said anything to anyone but lately my insomnia has been worse and a couple of times over the last few weeks when my boyfriend has said he is going to sleep I have had panic attacks and then he wants to know what's wrong and I can't tell him because it's ridiculous that I feel this way.... 

Why do I feel angry about it? If we are watching something and he nods off on the couch I feel furious and just go into silent mode when he wakes up, he just puts it down to my autism I think...

I don't know what to do it's horrible I don't want to be like this it doesn't make any sense that I feel feel anger that people have to sleep? How do I make it go away? ",04Mar2019,1
15,"(Should probably add that the autobiography would be a webcomic but I don't know where that fits into the story.)

So I've been wanting to make an autobiography for a while. I feel that it's important to share my story for those who may be going through similar circumstances. However, if I make it, I don't want my family to read it.

I don't want my dad to know that I have no respect for him. I don't want my mom to know that I wasn't okay for a long time. I don't want my brother to know I was molested. I don't want my ex to know I feel like he took advantage of me. I don't want my family to know what how I really feel about everything.

But I also think they should know. They should see me for who I am and how they made me feel. It would be their choice to read it or not. I'm not making it for them. I'm making it for people like me who are in need of hope and empathy.

Should I still make it? Does the hope it would bring outweigh the potential problems with my family?",04Mar2019,2

I weigh about 150 and im a female 5’4 is about it.

How long would it take to be able to pass the urine test? Or how many days. I know working out and water helps (which I’ll be doing w my best friend) but I overthink a lot and I pretty much messed up Friday and regret it but to those who have good knowledge?

19,"So I have been living with my roommate for 7 months now and it’s been pretty good . I have four roommates in total but my dilemma is with just one. To keep things secret (even though I doubt he will ever use Reddit) I will call him Mack. Mack was dating a girl for around year and four months ago he broke up with her. My other roommate who is my best friend hung out with his girlfriend a lot while they were dating but it wasn’t anything bad we just hung out as friends. While he was working an overnight at work his ex came over to watch his dog because they didn’t think I was home . Instead of leaving we just hung out and watched a movie . While she was playing with his dog a looked at her and felt very attracted to her . I considered making a move but there was a lot holding me back . The biggest reason for me was that she needs friends and doesn’t really want to lose any. Also I don’t know how Mack would react. But I do think she deserves better than him they are talking again but one thing to note is that he was a bad boyfriend and has cheated on her . I’m  confused and stressed

22,"So, I'm a college student, and I was interviewed by a company that was searching for students to offer work placement. They ""hyped"" up what they do and actually made out their company was more than what it actually is (looking back they described their vision, but they're early days) but anyways I was offered the placement, accepted it, and I feel like I've digged myself a hole which is  no fault but my own.

It spans over the length of 100 days and they would expect me to turn up 4 days a week (8 hours a day), this would leave me with one day at college, then at work over Saturday and Sunday.

Honestly, I respect that a small, start up business would risk me (a potential liability) at their office and offer me a work placement. It's just I don't know why it's 100 days for free - I feel it's too long. I'd have to balance a 7 day week, plus extra college work at home for something I feel wouldn't benefit me as much as people claim it to be. I'm stressed about getting my work done for college as it's coursework based - parents are saying I should do it even through they don't really know what the company does (not describing company as maybe someone will see it) but won't let me do a 7 day week. Trust me, I can do a 7 day week, but it would be difficult and I understand why my Mum won't let me do 7 days a week.

My Mum is suggesting that I reduce my hours even more to one day a week or quit, but I am not doing either of those, I enjoy my current workplace and the people I work with - not to mention it's well paid for my age (16) and I've been there for little under a year now. I don't want to quit because at the end of the day it's just a placement and I really really really don't want to let my work down as I've already said I need to cut my hours to just weekends over the placement.

I've visited the office, and they're expecting me to do some tasks while I'm there, but honestly it doesn't seem like they could offer anything that I could benefit from.

So I'll just cut it short - Should I do it? Do you believe I'm being narrow minded? Do you have any experiences in taking up work placement, was it good or bad? Finally, would a work placement really tip the iceberg on a CV and make me ""stand out from the crowd"" or is it really just exaggerated? 

I don't know, maybe I'm just tunnel visioned and have a completely incorrect mindset. Anyway, I look forward to reading your replies. Appreciate it, thanks!",04Mar2019,2
23,"I've been friends with this girl for 3 years now and it turns out in November she started to like me which I didn't know even tho she was dropping hints but I didn't think she liked me just because she would always tell me she sees me like a cousin before she liked me so I just assume she was just being really friendly with me. Also in November was a rough time period for me a lot of stuff was happening at home and also didn't help of feeling alone for so long. So December comes along and my Disneyland Jazz trip was coming up for my high school band so we go and this girl that's also in the band just hits me out of no where not literally but it turns out she also liked me too so we hit things off following that night in the hotel room I was talking to my buds about what's happening. Turns out that day to people kept calling my best friend who is the girl about what is happening I mean it spread like wildfire so after the trip was offer the new girl I was talking to, we decide to date which only lasted for 2 months we broke up two weeks ago  and now she just told me yesterday that she would have dated me but I messed it up and dated another girl who I barely knew compare to her so now her ex is coming back in the picture who is treating her nice now but you know how that works it's all nice for now but later on its just gonna end up the same and no one likes this dude either.

27,"I have dachshund, named Daisy, she's 13 years old.
My husband and I had our daughter 7 months ago, she's starting to be mobile and trying to play with our dogs (we also have a small yorkie mix). My dachshund has been aggressive all her life, I've never trusted her around anyone, she's bit 3 of my friends before, and has snapped at absolutely anyone that tries to touch her before she feels comfortable. Before my husband and I were married I was at his apartment while my dachshund was at my moms. My mom and I were living together before I was married. Anyway, my mom invited her friend who has 6 young kids and instead of locking my dachshund outside, she put her behind a gate and no one was watching the kids and a 4 year old decided to go behind the gate and try to pet my dog, well he got bit on the lip and had to get stitches. My mom called me and I rushed over to the hospital. The mother decided not to press charges so we never had to put my dog down. Daisy's aunt was put down because she had also bitten a child. I'm pretty sure aggression just runs in her family. 
So my husband and baby were alone one day and he decided to let our baby pet Daisy and of course Daisy snapped back to bite her (no growling or anything) and my husband kicked her away. This was a month ago. My husband wants to train her and I want to give her up for adoption or have her put down if they can't put her up. My mom also thinks we should put her down.

28,"At my job, my boss and I switch places a lot. Sometimes when I sit back down in my chair after he has been using it, the smell of his butt envelopes me. It’s the smell of a butt that has gotten sweaty and leaked a little. I know for sure it’s his butt because sometimes I’ll smell it just by being around him and after he goes to the bathroom (and wipes i assume) it’s no longer a problem. 

So here’s why I haven’t simply talked to him about it yet. TL;DR it’s hella awkward. This guy is so sensitive to confrontation or even addressing problems upfront that it’s borderline  a personality disorder. It’s painful to see him frequently talk about annoyances in his life that could be solved simply by talking to a person. But other than this he’s generally a good, reasonable, and talented guy. Also, he is super opposed to bathroom talk. Like we’ll joke and talk about all sorts of stuff. But people casually talking about bathroom habits? That’s a total no go from him. 

So I guess my question is... how do I address this? It’s happened more frequently in the past year and it totally totally disgusts me to the point of almost breaking. 

I’ve thought about talking to him about it privately... but i literally have no idea how I should do that. ",04Mar2019,0
29,"When I met my wife, she already had one child and was pregnant with a second. I love her and both kids like my own, even with the addition of my newborn.

My wife's EX was a drunk/addict and physically assaulted her while she was pregnant. Needless to say I do not like this guy at all. He left the state and went to rehab across country. He has stayed out there and lives there currently.

I have kept things extremely civil and have never denied him or his parents anything when it comes to his biological child. Obviously we can't always just let them see him, but we have been more than fair and make it work whenever possible.

Recently he filed paperwork to get a paternity test and have his name put on the birth certificate (which he almost refused to sign at after the birth, which I was there for and he was not) as well as mandatory visitation whenever he comes into town. He has maybe met the kid twice and has never helped with anything for 2 years.

This isn't the entire situation, but a pretty good summary of what's bothering me currently. I'm just so angry and confused about this. I feel like I might lose a child, even though the odds of that are low, but who knows with the court system. Even with a lawyer I am terrified of losing.

Does anyone have an experience like this? How do I deal with the anger which I feel is justified? I want to contact him to find out what what he is thinking in all this, why he did it, and to let him know how my wife and I feel.. should I do that?

Panic and anxiety attacks are also common, and due to his problems, he never even finished middle school. Now, the problem is this; he lives in a seriously abusive environment.

Due to disabilities on my part as well, I’m stuck on social security making just enough to feed the two of us plus a little extra cash while living at my parents’ house. However, he can’t stay at my place full time as his parents hate my parents for some seriously stupid reasons, but at the same time, I don’t want him going home to a place that makes him feel so horrible to the point he doesnt even want to leave his room when he’s there. So the only option is to get our own place, right? However I don’t make enough to get a place on just my money, and we have no idea if and when he’s going to get his own social security, and if he can even wait that long with everything they do and say to him when at home.

A month at Party City 6 months at Tj Maxx and now at a grocery store for almost 8 months. The job I work now has had its ups and downs like any job does but I work hard and even earned employee of the month. The job has been something I've enjoyed but now I've started to hate it. After our department got a new manager he has expressed that he only cares about the shifts he works which is the morning crew and not our nightly closing crew. He ended up moving all of our best employees who had morning availability and left the closing staff in shambles. I'm attending community college for 2 years to save money which will allow me to have a job throughout this time but I worry about the jobs inconsistency of times we get out. My scheduled shift usually is 5pm-10pm but sometimes we will get out as late as 11 which I feel will have a hindrance on my class work and sleep schedule going into college. I don't want to be ""that guy"" who burns through jobs really fast but I'm also looking for something that is more laid back. I already didn't show up for my shift on Saturday something in me just told me to drive past my work and go to a friends instead. The biggest point of contention for me has been disappointing my mom.

Express to my mom the situation and risk her temper flaring? Seek out a new job on my own without telling my mom the situation? ",04Mar2019,2
33,"I’m gonna start off by clarifying this: I have kind of an obsession with money, so a high and stable income means *a lot* to me.

I was keen for my whole life to become a doctor, mostly because it’s the only science field with such high salaries. (Cosmetic plastic surgeon to be exact, to have a somewhat normal time-table)

But then came physics. I get very fascinated by theoretical physics. It challenges my intuition, it tries to explain the deepest truths of the universe, and it requires some heavy and revolutionary thinking.

However here’s the catch. If I do sacrifice such a high salary (medicine) for physics, I really don’t want to be just a high school teacher/ lecturer. I’d much rather be involved in paid research, but I’ve heard that’s very unlikely to get such an offer. Hence why a vast majority of physicists are teachers, lecturers or something less relevant to the field. If that’s true, what would be your suggestions/alternatives.

Points to notice: I’m not stellar at either biology or physics. I‘m confident I have the intelligence required for theoretical physics (that will be amplified since now i am dying out of boredom in class), but I’m not sure I have the patience required for medicine. Mainly because I’m afraid it won’t get more interesting. 

To anyone who might go on about my unhealthy obsession with money, I don’t think I can change it. It’s well rooted in me.

Any advice is appreciated. Even ones outside the box.

34,My grandmother was like my mother. She raised me since I was a baby. We were close but we weren’t talk about sex close. She also was a “don’t have sex before marriage” person. I miss her dearly but it has been 2 months and I’m scared to be intimate with my boyfriend. I feel like it’s really straining our relationship. She was a person whom believed after you died you watched over loved ones and she always told me she would watch over me (she really wanted to see me graduate from college but passed 5 months before my graduation). I always considered myself to be non-religious but I can’t stop thinking that she IS watching me all the time. And how she wouldn’t approve of me and my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do. ,04Mar2019,7
35,"I'm 18(M) and never been extremely close to any brothers or my father so I don't really have anyone to go to for advice about it but here's the story. I've been in a ldr with a girl for a couple months, a girl who wasn't just my girlfriend at the time but someone I'd consider my best friend for about 2 years, distance was never really and issue and even before dating we've always been really close and kinda interested in eachother. we finally decided to try things out and for the majority of the time I felt great, I loved her more then I ever have any previous gfs and we clicked so well, spent almost 24/7 together. But recently I found out from her mom and my best friend that she lied and has BEEN lying to me about a ton of things, doing lots of sus stuff. we ended up deciding to go back to just friends and the same day we did she was already dating another guy who was ""just a friend"" when we were together. to cut to the chase things got really toxic between us lately and when I tried to cut her off for good and block her she's both threatened to kill herself and begged for another chance saying she's changed. Do I let her back in? Do people ever actually change or is it just a saying born of pure desperation?",04Mar2019,1
36,"Is this strange? I'm a straight guy and sexual attraction is no issue but I've never been romantically interested in anyone, to the point where I don't think I've ever had a relationship with anyone quantifiable as anything more than a fuckbuddy.

I feel this sort of hampers my prospects for a proper relationship because I just don't have any real desire to be with anyone in particular for their emotional value. I hope it's just because I haven't met the right person yet, but surely I would've had *some* innocent crush of another by now?

I'm concerned I might be aromantic, which would be a shame because I would like a long-term partner at some stage (not right now, I'm happy enough enjoying my freedom for the moment).

Before you ask, I watch porn infrequently and my testosterone is fine. Good diet, good fitness. Have been depressed a lot in the last but think I'm alright at the moment (?)",04Mar2019,1
37,"I’ve been laying awake for a couple hours now trying to think about what to do now, but I think that other people know best.
My grandad has two types of dementia (I don’t know too much about it) and is seriously unable to function. He’s probably worse than a 1-year old at this point. Basically what I am saying is, he’s incapable to do anything.
It’s about time for him to go to a care home now, but they are REALLY expensive and my family isn’t the richest. My grandma and grandad (before the dementia) used their retirement money to buy a house and get rent from it, they own it 50/50. So, the only way to afford for him to go to a home is to sell the house, but he owns 50% of it and can’t sign any documents to give it away or anything, so I don’t know what to do. I’m 16 and only know this through overhearing so I’m no expert.

39,"Im 17, last year before uni right now and going to make it through with decent grades. I have usually always been like this, I love videogames and I’m pretty much very introvert (I would love to hang out with someone, but I ain’t brave enough to make the first step and ask to hang out cause I have been rejected more than once)

So I had a gf for like 6 months or so and we used to flirt a lot at class (we were sitting right next to each other) and that was good as we had a special bond in which she was like my best friend and she knew all the stuff someone usually hides to people not to feel embarrassed. Long story short we ended up dating, she used to have loads of friends to hang out on weekends whereas I had some friends but didn’t hang out with them very often, this led to us not meeting a lot on weekends. This wasn’t a problem as we did see each other every day at school.

Months go by and we are starting our last course of school and with the stress of having to achieve the best mark to go to a good university. My gf kind of starts to focus a lot on studies which I totally agree with as that would benefit both of us. Sometimes we would meet but not much, only st school. I was okay with it though.

A few rough things happen and we kind of give each other some time to realize what’s best for us right now (note I am going abroad to university, and long-distance relationships aren’t great at all). This was back in October.

We were kind of ok at class acting as friends and laughing, basically having a good time, but from time to time I would say something unconsciously and she would be mad again never really getting to “love” each other again. Now we are in January (so I’ve been about 4 months in “stand-by” to finally start talking again about our relationship and realizing breaking up is the best idea.

At this point I’m kind of sad and impotence cause I could have done many things to not fuck it up. Then I realize I actually have been going out and socializing because of her, I used to hang out with her friends and all that. But since we broke up I have just met one girl which we still come along pretty well and that’s it. I mean, breaking up with her has “broken” almost all of my social bonds with her friends, which now are colleagues rather than friends I would meet. And although we ended in good terms our relationship she has been pretty weird with me, she loves hugs but as soon as I come close to her or she comes close to me is almost impossible to hug her (only happens with me, she hugs everyone else) and we haven’t hang out as friends since then and she will not take the first step. Now I feel I should ask her if she’s okay with us being friends, if she is okay with me right now and if I am really that annoying wanting to hug her. 

And this does make me think a lot - why not fuck it all, only 2 months left (roughly) of school and I won’t see them again, I will go to another country and start a new life.

What can I do to still be relevant to her as a friend as I don’t want to lose bonds with her and her friends but it might look like the best idea as things are right now.

TL:DR: my girl broke up with me and I just realized how “lonely” I am when I can’t be with here anymore. But I am going to another country to study next year which makes me believe I should just leave it all and don’t give a fuck about people anymore and start a new life again there. 

Thanks if you have read the whole text

40,"So my gf is currently living with her sister and has been looking for a new place because said sister is wanting her out. The main thing is that my gf is not on the lease and this morning her sister told her to be out by the end of the week. Some time goes by and I guess she decides to be a little nicer and tell her she has a month. But is currently threatening to take all of my girlfriend's animals (probably about 10 give or take) and surrender them to the Petco she works at.

i been lurking for a bit too
i guess a little profiling right
hm i’m 16 
i have a decent amount of friends (but no friends friends if you know what I mean). I like to be alone in my bed just watch youtube or play mobile/playstation games. I play basketball. The last years I felt different because my childhood was a lil rough. What I mean is that I just now realised that I have gotten something of it. I think it’s anxiety but not sure because I never went to a therapist.I think i got some other illness to but I don’t know for sure and don’t just wanna throw them all out. So yea...lately i’ve been noticing that I don’t care that much about certain things as I should. I mean it’s like my brains a dark cloud. People that my father and mom knew died and when I was younger(12,13) I didn’t gave a fuck. I saw my mom cry and wish she would just stfu. It made me angry and I don’t know why and i still have the same feeling. When someone of my family just fake cry’s or something sad I just get angry idk.And with other things like getting presents or getting a new console I know that I should be grateful but i’m just not... And I don’t even know how i should feel because of it. Been dealing with this for a while (4 years i just discovered maybe longer).

43,"Hi guys, just kind of at loss and starting to feel really depressed and helpless. Thank you in advance for reading and for any help.

I was living above a restaurant/bar in Brooklyn, NY that kept me up every weekend. I complained to the landlord, the city, the cops, everyone I could. The landlord gave the establishment a cut in rent to get the place properly soundproofed but they didn't do anything. I called cops all the time, and that led to cut inspectors coming, which led to fines and violations, at least $20,000 total, but that didn't help either. I ended up breaking my lease and moving out.

Fast forward to my new place - it's a wonderful space, has a yard for my dog, and I'm not feeling claustrophobic. I searched really hard for this place and paid a lot of money upfront ($8000+) to be able to move in ASAP. I wanted to get out so badly I didn't complain about a few things I had a problem with, like how the yard was in a totally unusable space before I spent hours cleaning it, but I'm happy now and settled in. However, I'm having a new issue now.

My neighbor in the next building who shares my bedroom wall plays music that has a lot of bass. It woke me up a few times at 9am because it's literally against my wall. I thought I was going to get some peace and quiet but now I'm dealing with the exact same problem I had before. From the frying pan and into the oven. I've tried approaching them and talking to them, but they won't answer their door. I even asked someone going into the building to knock on their door for me, but they didn't come out to talk to me. So I've never even had a chance to talk to the neighbors.

I don't know what to do now. I feel really helpless and depressed, as I just moved into this apartment a week ago and signed a 15 month lease. I didn't hear any noise the few times I came over before moving in so this was completely unexpected. The neighbor has been playing the music off and on since 9am today. Someone please tell me what to do.

Thank you. ",04Mar2019,1
44,"So essentially, I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now. The conversation has been good, flirty, sexual, all types of stuff. Constant msg back and forth. A few days ago she started getting distant. So, being the straight forward person I am, I just told her that I felt the vibe was off and wanted to know if she was alright and wanted to keep continue what we had going on. She told me that it’s been a pretty stressful week for her, as she is in the lasse stages of her midterms. This I can fully understand. She then went on to say that we still don’t know much about each other, and she wasn’t entirely sure if I was  into her. Side story, we did hang it and I was about nervous. I reassured her that I was into her and she said she believed me. She then said she wanted to keep getting to know each other and keep hanging out. After that we texted for a bit more and then she ended off with saying have a goodnight boo with a bunch of heart emojis. Today’s it’s been continuing, responses from her take hours and it’s always more or less response to w.e I said and then some statement. No real effort from her to carry on a conversation. Now, I obviously know what’s going on as we did meet on tinder and she did upload a new picture there which I do get notified of since we did match. My question here is what do I do? I’m trying to show her I care and still would like to peruse her. But feel like she’s not even giving me a chance to do so! Meh I sound pathetic! ",04Mar2019,0
45,"This girl (19) and I (21) have been talking for two weeks now. Matched with her on Tinder and met up with her a few days later, we hung out all day and had a lot of fun. Before I had to head home we ended up making out and I've never gotten intimate so quick with someone but it just happened, I can't really explain it. Nothing weird or out of place happened the whole day, it was just normal and then that happened (not complaining, but I think you guys get my point). Well, fast forward and we'd been talking and getting to know each other throughout the week and she came to my place, took her on a little date (nothing fancy), she met my parents (which I was really trying to avoid but they somehow found time to come home early), and then got in the hot tub with a friend and his girlfriend. So far this girl and I have a lot in common, she doesn't seem clingy or anything, comes from what sounds like a good family, and she's pretty smart. We seem to have a good bit in common too. She even told me she's never liked someone so quick like she likes me. We haven't been talking as much because she's been busy I guess but she's been less flirty with me after coming to my house the other night. I don't want to screw this up and I've already told her I'm not trying to rush into anything and she agreed having the same intentions. What do I need to look out for?",04Mar2019,0
46,"For background, I am 21, she's 20, we met on tinder and have been dating for 4 years +5 days. 

For the past 12 months of our relationship I have been stuck in an emotional rut. Whenever I am with her I am happy, but when I'm alone I feel anxious and confused about what I want/need in a relationship or in life in general.

Our relationship has been very loving and she is amazing. We've never had a fight or an argument. The only times we have had issues is due to my own confusion or selfishness 
Eg: I went on an exchange last year and used tinder to try meet new people. I have an ego that makes me crave attention from women I don't know. (I feel like it may have stemmed from being totally ignored by girls throughout my childhood) 

This year I am on an exchange again and I got very drunk while out with friends. I saw a girl who kept looking at me and I went and danced with her. I kissed her.

I told my girlfriend what had happened and basically all my personal issues spilled out and I admitted to having doubts about being in such a serious relationship while so young. We came to a semi-agreement and we broke up. 

I love her so much but I don't know how to interpret my own feelings let alone express them to anyone. I feel like I just constantly flick back and forth between happiness and sadness at the flick of a button. 

We said that once I am back home that we would see if anything has changed. Whether or not we have moved on. 

Right now I feel like I've made a mistake but I don't know if it's just grief that is making me feel this way. 
I can't guarantee that I won't resort back to my feelings beforehand about being confused if we were to get back together now.

48,"Ok so when I was in second grade, I made friends with these 3 people. We've been friends for years now and the four of us have become really good friends. So one of these friends, I'll call her GG started hanging out with new friends. They were new people at our school and there was nothing wrong with it. GG didn't leave us, she just added more people to our 'friend group'. One other person from the 'original' group, I'll call him BB, isn't happy with the new people joining us.  I have also become friends with the new people and they're good people. He thinks GG is leaving us and that she doesn't care for us anymore. Now obviously, this isn't true but I can understand how BB feels that shes kind of leaving the OG squad. Fast forward a few months BB and GG get into a fight. GG says she's still friends with us and she can make friends with whoever she wants, but BB disagrees. He takes it to the internet where he starts to talk shit about GG on a platform they both use and follow each other on. GG catches the post about her and confronts him. Then BB goes onto one of their mutual friend's account and defends himself. That resulted in them agreeing they should no longer be friends and GG deleting her account. They stopped talking to each other in school which made it difficult for the rest of us because none of us wanted to pick sides. Because of this, they eventually made up and everything was back to normal. That was last year.

&amp;#x200B;

GG later made a new account and gave it to only a few people. This did not include BB. Nobody told BB because we wanted to respect GG's wishes. Another few months later, the word got out and BB found out GG had a new account. He questioned her about why she didn't give him her new account and claimed GG does not trust him and they can't have a friendship without any trust. Now they're in another fight and both of them are coming to me and telling me how much of a friend I mean to them and how they're going to stop talking to each other. I'm leaning more the GG's side because she has the right to become friends with anyone and nobody should be able to tell her she can't be friends with people. And I understand why you wouldn't want to give your account information to someone who talked shit about you on that very platform. But BB has also been a very good friend to me and I don't want to take anyone sides. I feel like it's gonna be the same thing where since BB and GG are going to ignore each other you could only hang out with one or the other. Like one of them would sit at a table and the other at another table and it just sucks seeing someone sit alone. How can I mend their friendship or should I just wait and see what happens. Maybe I'm just butting in too much.

56,"I'll explain everything I can. So, my dad is from Argentina. I was born and grew up, and still live in America. I don't speak spanish, and even after 4 years of spanish class, am still pretty bad at speaking it. My brother who is 2 years older than me, decided to go to Argentina for college. He has been having a decent time there apparently. I'm 18 right now and graduating highschool this year, but I don't know what to study in college or what college to go to. I want to do something with music and art. 

Anyways, my dad is making me decide on if im going to Argentina or not, within like 2 days. Its because of money reasons, but I wont get into that. I've been thinking of if I should go or not, but I have no idea. I have lots of fears of going there,  but I don't want my fears to keep me from going, and maybe I will like it there. Idfk. Ill explain my reasons:

**-For junior year of highschool, I moved 2 states away to go to highshool there and didnt enjoy it.** I won't explain the details but I had basically no friends, and an *awful* time there, and I still regret going. I moved back for senior year of highschool. So I don't want a repeat of what happened, and to go through another hell of self conflict. 

**-I suffer with depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues.** I don't want those things to get worse by moving to Argentina, because of how stressful it could get with learning a new language, trying to make friends, and doing schoolwork, all with dealing with my pre-existing problems. Everything could get alot worse than what it is right now.

**-I'd be living with my brother, who is a dick to me, narcissistic, and who makes me feel like shit about myself.** This is pretty self explanatory. Also i'd probably be spending alot of time with him because I wouldn't have any friends at first and am shitty at making friends.

Basically i'm worried about not enjoying it there and going there being a mistake. If I did go, and everything went fine, then I think it would be a great experience, and I would learn a second language, learn a whole different way of life, probably be more independent, and get better at taking care of myself. But I feel like the whole decision is based off of *if everything goes well,* and if it didnt go well, i'd be pretty fucked, and the stress of that happening would probably do me harm.

This year i picked up my balls and started trying to get a date etc. Im a third year in college and its near impossible to get laid/get a date. My friends who are sexually active tell me the girls here are 'sophisticated' and you need to know them beforehand to get any response (social circle, etc.). Despite this I see wispy guys pulling at the clubs and i cant help but feel jealous. I can talk to anyone but I have no game (outgoing-somewhat socially awkward?). I wasnt raised amongst white kids (not trying to be racist) so they probably can tell i dont have their mannerisms. To make matters worse i dont have an instagram (shits important sadly) and im half asian. I have never felt bad about being half asian my entire life until now. They probably just see me as just another chinamen. I feel like Theon Greyjoy, a man with no place. Too white and rich to belong with the ghetto kids from my neighbourhood and too poor and ethnic to mix with these college girls.

68,"This is something that’s been bothering me and making it hard for me to move on in my life and something that I need advice on. Thank you to those that read this long winded post and thank you even more to those that give me advice. I am really struggling here and not sure where to go or move forward in life.

Anyways looking back on my life I feel as though I have made a lot of mistakes and have a lot of regrets. Recently about a year ago, I realized that I needed to make some changes to my life and so I did. I started going to church more often, started eating better, started working out regularly, and things started to improve. I started to have more time to spend with family and friends and not just spend time with them but really try and be there for them when they needed it. Through church I also finally started to make better friends with those that had more similar interests to mine. I feel like that’s something big that was missing from my life - I have suffered from anxiety and depression which made finding friends difficult for me,

Roughly 6-8 years ago, I was around 20-22 and started working at a retail store.  Now this is the part that’s been haunting and bothering me the most. Again I could deal with everything else in my life, all those little mistakes, etc., but I’m not sure I can ever move on from this part in my life. I started working at this store as an associate and quickly became an assistant manager. My store manager at the time decided to leave his job and him and his wife moved to a different city, So my company started looking for a different manager. Me being in school, I was uninterested in the position so didn’t even apply. Eventually they hired a lady to run the store, we shall call her Mabel. She was nice enough and we got along well but eventually things started to get weird.

Mabel started opening up to me about the weird open relationship she and her husband were in. This should have been my first clue to leave the job. For some reason I didn’t. I was a poor college student and just needed the money. Then she started to make remarks to me about how she thought I was attractive.  Again this should have been another clue to leave this job, I didn’t for some reason. Eventually I started to let her do things to me, sexually. Maybe 4-5 times total. I am not sure why I did, but I did. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe because I didn’t realize the seriousness of the situation. I had never been sexually active at that point in my life growing up in a very religious family.

I just remember Mabel trying to pressure me to do other things with her. I would just tell her no. Eventually I had to leave that situation as it just got to be to much for me. I’m not sure if I quit or what. But I stopped answering all texts and calls from Mabel. Essentially cutting her out of my life. At that time in my life I thought “no harm or foul” no one knows and I can just move on with my life. I eventually graduated graduate school, and like I said earlier started to take better care of myself.

Now officially having tried to make a lasting change in my life, trying to be a better person. I am not sure how to move forward in my life,

I’m wanting to start a family, get married, have all of those things that people want in life - but I mean I feel as though I can’t. I mean should I be allowed to? If I were to meet someone in my life how do I tell them about this past? Should I just keep it in the past? Should I be honest and face these things head on?

No one knows about any of these things except me. So I suppose if I wanted to I could always just keep it as part of me and never share it with anyone and just keep trying to move on and keep trying to be a better person. 

But than again recently I started dating someone and she had asked me about my past relationships. Should I share this with her? And if I didn’t share this with them and we ended up getting even more serious, would it be fair of me to not tell her? Especially if I decide I want to spend my life with her.  Growing up in an ultra conservative background this is something (dating history, sexual history, etc.) that potential mates and within my culture whom I consider to date are very forward about asking early on. I obviously don’t feel comfortable sharing this very early on.",04Mar2019,2

He says he loves me and I've known him for so long I do really care for him as well. 

I changed jobs about 6 months ago and I haven't been seeing him as frequently. In fact I haven't spoken to him in person in a month. There is a guy (mark) at my new job who just admitted to having feelings for me. We went out and had a nice time. I do like him, but I fear he's placing a lot of expectations on what could happen between us. He heavily hinted at wanting to be bf/gf.

Kyle and I never made things official. He never called me his girlfriend and I've never referred to him as my boyfriend. He has said that if he didn't have me he wouldn't have anyone else in his life in that way.

Right now I'm on a family vacation and it's really hard to pretend like I'm having a good time and not hurting as much as I am. I feel like people have no clue what I feel throughout the day and just think I'm doing alright (I'm aware that this is completely my fault) 

We've been here for 3 days so far and everyday has been hard for me as I keep getting these obsessive thoughts (usually about things that are wrong in my life) which lead to me feeling extremely down to the point where it physically hurts and I constantly have this feeling in my chest/throat. It hard to deal with because I'm really never alone throughout the day so the whole time I have to act like I'm not feeling completely awful. There's several points in a day where this emotional pain just feels unbearable.

I guess I mainly wanted to make this post as a way to vent and let it out, but it would be nice to know I'm not the only one who is feeling this way as a reminder that I'm not completely alone here. Any suggestions on how to cope with these feelings and enjoy my vacation would also be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this guy via a dating app, we didn't date but for some time we talked daily online and we did sleep together twice, I was okay with that. Every now and then he'd stop making sense during online conversations, I'd end-up frustrated/upset as he'd say things but not clarify what he meant so we'd go around in circles - I was concerned he was messing with my head, it often felt like we were having two different conversations - I suspect he's an alcoholic, plus English isn't his fist language so that may be the issue. On one or two occasions I blocked him due to this behavior. 

He had issues and so his family decided to visit to straighten him out, at this time he went MIA for around two weeks - he expected me to wait for him to sort himself out (I think he wanted to date but acknowledged he wasn't in any position to date at that time, for the record I wasn't interested in dating so wasn't waiting for him), yet he couldn't even so much as text me during that time. Shortly afterwards I found him back on the dating app and so I blocked him. 

Fast-forward ten months and we reconnect, I wanted to see how he was doing - he's got himself a good job, has lost weight, made new friends, and is drinking less - at first it was great, he said he wanted to see me in person to explain what happened before, but then the same behavior came up where he'd go MIA for a few days and started saying things that made no sense but wouldn't clarify. Our last conversion I was upset about him saying weird cryptic things but right in the middle of this he decided to suggest he come to mine (not for sex) as if nothing was wrong and I'd want to see him, just like before it was as if we were having different conversations. He ended by saying he wanted to be there for me, telling me he'd had sex since we last saw each other...I responded pointing out I'd no interest in either of those things.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been around a month, no contact from him since. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've unfriended him on social media again and I'm thinking about blocking him again on WhatsApp.

79,"(18f) For my whole life I've always laughed when I'm nervous, I laugh before I take tests, I laugh when I watch scary movies, and I laughed when my cousin was admitted to the hospital after her bulimia nearly killed her. There have been a couple serious moments in my life where I couldn't stop laughing, and it's not even a giggle, it's damn near hysterical. When my uncle came to visit my family to update us on my cousin's condition, I started laughing, and the more I tried to hold back, my laughter got stronger. My parents knew that I didn't think this was funny, but my uncle didn't, I remember him on the brink of tears yelling at me, ""Well I'm glad you think this is f-ing hilarious"". I didn't, I was terrified that I was gonna lose my cousin and best friend, but I couldn't control my reaction.

I have a question regarding dependency for the 2018 tax year, hoping to get some purely logistic advice. In 2018 I graduated from college and I started my master's degree this past fall. Through the whole 2017-2018 school year, I lived independently, paid my own tuition, rent, utilities, and food expenses. Quite literally the only thing my mother paid for was the cell phone up until May of 2018. She's telling me that she needs my tax information in order to file her taxes, which I didn't think was necessary, even if she claimed me as a dependent. No matter what I say, she keeps insisting that she needs my information, because I was ""technically"" her dependent through May of 2018. As far as I knew, because I paid for virtually everything my own, I am not a dependent. But who knows, I could be wrong(?). 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My mother wants to claim me as a dependent, but hasn't paid for anything in well over two years.

Is there any clear answer as to whether or not I am her dependent? Can I file my taxes separately/independently without effecting her taxes at all? Does she really need my tax information in order to complete her taxes?

Okay so my mum has stage 4 breast cancer that she found out last early year but didn’t want tell me and my two younger sisters. But accidentally blurt it out once when I was having lunch with her one day (after me and my Sister quarrelled with my younger Sister, that is really spoiled by my mum and has a bad princess attitude.)
So after I found out I really wanted the family to stay tight and support my mum as much as possible so I got both my sisters down and told them about it, at the start everything went really well my mum was happy that we were all getting along together, then after we decided to book an overseas trip to japan about half a year in advance so that we can enjoy and spend time creating memories that we might not have the time to do so in the future. So we worked hard for part time jobs so we could afford this as my mum wanted to go to japan for a Long time but didn’t get to. And it might be one of our last few trips we would ever have, me and my Sister worked hard to plan and work for this trip all the time while my youngest Sister was still having full time studies. So we didn’t want to trouble her, then as time goes by my youngest Sister’s princess attitude came became worst. Making my mum angry/sad and which in turns make me and my Sister angry. And when we(sis &amp; me) scolded her and ask her to be more thoughtful for our mum she just gave us a worst attitude. 
This squabble has been ongoing and everytime we quarrel my mum’s chest hurt and I can’t do anything about it. My Sister also has been working hard to juggle pay for her studies and for this whole trip. While my youngest Sister keeps spending money like buying music festival tickets etc when she knows we’re barely having enough for the trip. Which makes us really angry and frustrated as we are trying our best to make as much money to treat our mum the best we could afford even paid for her ticket and laccommodation. But when we confront her she just turns all bitchy, I even tried to talk some sense to her literally begging her to spare some concern for my mum and have harmony between us siblings that my mum wants us to have. My Sister has been trying her best to accommodate to my youngest Sister even she has angry management issues but to avail again. Honestly I don’t know what to do now, it might have been a mistake to have the trip. I’m not even sure if this post can be posted on this reddit, as i am a noob that browses reddit with no account. So just hope i can get some advice somehow, sorry my English isn’t good and this might not even make sense to you guys, but I really want this to whole trip to work as it’s the only thing I can look forward to at the moment.

 I'm worried because ignoring the situation isnt helping. And that's what his family seems to want to do. My boyfriends younger brother, I'll just call him A, has never been short of issues. A is not attending school anymore and currently lives with this girl. This girl is not a good person at all. I hate to be insensitive but, she's trash. She has threatened me and a close family friend multiple times. On top of that, she has drug issues. Like meth. She also physically assaults him and is very controlling, like not letting him have a phone. Not to mention she is 26 and having sex with a 16 YEAR OLD CHILD. Obviously she is scum. I am also worried because she already has a child of her own too, who seems in danger. 

I understand that it is not my place to talk to A or try and get him to come home, or to insert myself into my boyfriend's family drama. But of course, A got her pregnant. My boyfriend and I have offered what little money we have to pay for an abortion but she declined. 

If the roles were switched, if A was a girl, the police wouldve already have been called. I am also worried that nobody will take this seriously either. He is only one year away from the legal age of consent too. 

My boyfriend is worried about his little brother but does not want to get him in trouble. We're not positive but we think she is controlling him with meth. Anytime we talk about this and I tell him we should go to the police, he says no. But it's disgusting and A does not deserve to be in this situation. Their home life was never great but it can't possibly be worse than what he's living in now. Their mom just went through a divorce so she hasn't been much of a mother lately. She doesn't understand that A needs help. She says A is 'grown' but hes just a child. He should've known better but he did what he did already, and leaving him alone is making the situation worse. 

I just don't know what to do. Because if it were my sibling I wouldve called the police by now or wouldve done something. I am trying to be considerate of how my boyfriend is feeling but I can't keep quiet anymore. Especially because A's 'girlfriend' wants to come around the house and shit. 

It's getting to the point where my boyfriend and I argue about it. I told him that we NEED to go to the police not only for A but for the child she already has, and the one shes about to have. He doesn't want his brother to get in trouble and I get that but I just don't know what else we can do. Should I try to convince my boyfriend to go to the police with me? Should I just mind my own business? 

Not sure if this matters but my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. 

TL;DR: My boyfriends brother who is 16, is dating a 26 year old meth head, pregnant with his baby. I want to go to the police but my boyfriend does not want to. Should I try to convince my boyfriend to go to the police with me? Should I just mind my own business? ",04Mar2019,2
101,"Things have always bothered me about how she interacts with me but I could ever put y finger on it. We're super close and she's always been weird. She never really had friends so I always balled it up to ignorance but after taking a step back I'm not so sure:

- she compliments me excessively (ex: answering the phone saying ""hello gorgeous"")

- she bought me a rose for Valentine's day 

- she wants to do everything with me (ex: if she needs to go shopping she'll wait until I'm available to do it so I go with her)

**Something my gf noticed that I didn't:**

- she goes out of her way to be affectionate and close to me if all three of us are together (ex: hugging me a bunch and trying to sit next me at dinner)

Right now I'm pissed at myself for being blind to these things for so long and I'm pissed at her for doing these things. It seems like a blatant disrespect for me and my girlfriend I can only hope that these things have nots been done intentionally, even though I don't see that being possible, because I don't know how I can continue being friends with someone like that",04Mar2019,0
102,"S, I am a 28 year old female who was two young kids)- they’re 2 and 9 months. I saw a psych doctor a little bit before I fade birth, but for some meds from my PCP.

Currently, I see a male psych doctor. I was given 14 weeks of ECT for depression.  ONE day in the midst of it, I drank 1 mikes harder lemonade , took 15mG ambien and then had treatment. I cut my wrists then, but not too bad. 

I was hospitalized Monday before last for a suicide attempt via overdose. I’ve been out of the ward for a week. 

The reason I tried to kill mgawlf was becaus ECT has ducked up my memory and it made work ( I’m a RN) impossible. I felt like an idiot. Nursing is my talent.

Friday I had my f/u with him and he said that he doesn’t believe a thing I say now. He said I need divine intervention. He took me off all of my sleeping meds and left me on Effexor and vistaril. He told me divine intervention is the only thing that can save me now.  I’m atheist 

We are NOT a good match. I want a doctor who can discuss this being PPD. I had prior major depression and two traumatic births (one hurricane evacuation less than 24 hours I had given birth. I technically needed a blood infusion. The second I was preeclampsia and had mag.

I got fired from my job. So no insurance. We can’t afford to pay out of pocket. 

I don’t want to psych doc jump, but three I’ve had brush off my condition like it’s nothing.

I’m going g to talk to my therapist tomorrow. But I wonder how to fo about this. Do I cancel all appts? Do I just call and cancel? 

My primary doc would fill my meds, including the ambien (I am trying to stop. Now I’m going a few days a week without it. 


What he said to me made me feel horrible. He won’t respect my privacy and calls my husband after everything. I want to find a female doc that will help me- since he doesn’t have to do med management with me if my pmd prescribes them. . What should I do? Thanks guys. ",04Mar2019,1

106,"I volunteer at a horse rescue, and we often have birthday parties as fundraisers. Mainly pony rides, paint a horse (with a white miniature horse), and visiting the petting zoo.

We had one last yesterday, and before that, I think it was few months ago. There was this condescending woman who showed up to volunteer both times. Usually I try to ignore people like them.

And I had the horse for painting. She gets nippy and impatient from time to time. I know her well enough to know when she's done and needs to go back.

Anyway, when we had the birthday party, the horse reached the limit so I was about to take her back for safety. The woman just turned to me and says condescendingly ""Just go walk her around a bit."" Like she knew the horse well enough. I was like ""Excuse you?"" and just took her back.

Then yesterday, I also had her to get her cleaned up and was waiting around a bit. The woman approaches her with hay and started reaching out. Before she could do anything, I quickly said ""Do NOT hand feed her."" For people who don't know, handfeeding a horse can make them nippy (or nippier). I'm not dealing with a nippy horse around birthday kids.

107,"I want to start this post by saying that I’m not here looking for sympathy, but I also am not looking to be criticized or attacked. This is a really tender subject for me but I feel the need to talk it out.
I got completely shitfaced on my vacation, hanging out at the pool bar one day and my friends left for dinner while I stayed to drink. I’m going to say I had about 20 shots throughout the day, with complete strangers just chatting it up. 
My memory is very fuzzy, but i remember flirting and clinging on to several different men I met. 
The next image I have is being clung to a mid aged Cuban man, and his penis inside me. It was dark by now and the pool had basically cleared out. 
Side note, I had been on my period and wearing the diva cup, so it was lodged way up there and I had to fish it out in the morning. I would never have done that in my right mind but in that vulnerable state i’m sure I was pretty agreeable to everything. 
I remember us kissing and he bit my lip so hard I was bleeding, and I yelled out in pain and he laughed.
I don’t remember anything after this so the rest was pieced together from what my friends said.
When I didn’t turn up they started to get worried. The pool was poorly lit and they panicked when they couldn’t see me but when they called out my name I came swimming over. I was yelling “rico swave” at the dude and he stayed creepily in the shadows and wouldn’t come out, so nobody got to see his face, meet him or know his real name. I don’t even know if he spoke English.
He muttered something Spanish at my friends. Probably pissed that someone interrupted his taking advantage of how drunk I was. 
I fell getting out of the pool and ripped off my entire pinky nail. My friends brought me to the room and I passed out by 8pm. 
I’m 99% sure I was a willing participant in the sex but for some reason I still feel really violated because I can’t remember how it all went down, and the  bits I do remember really gross me the fuck out. 
I’m going to the doctors tomorrow to make sure I don’t have any kind of infection or std, and I’m sure knowing the results of that will bring me some peace. 
But in the meantime does anyone have any advice on how I can get out of this hating myself slump. Or has anyone had a similar experience that can make me feel less empty and alone right now? ",04Mar2019,1

114,"Ok so me and my bf have been together for 4 years and we are both 22.

We have a hard time communicating but it has gotten a little better.

So..

Every time we go hangout at his moms brand new house, we drink beer, play darts, cook food and have a good time. Afterwards or days after he will bring up something I said and nit pick everything I do. Trust me I’m a self-reflective person and the things he nit picks aren’t offensive, mean, rude or anything above. - so after multiple times of him doing this (which is every time) I told him if I bother him so much I won’t come along anymore.. which hurt me but I was hoping that would make him realize how shitty he was making me feel. Nope.. he was like okay that’s fine.

Now every time he goes to his moms he leaves me alone at the house and stays the night over there, leaving me with house duties and alone.


Every time I go out with my girlfriends he humiliates me. One time me and my girlfriend were celebrating both our birthdays and she brought her brother along, when her brother left he shook my bfs hand and winked at him. My boyfriend says in front of everyone “are you sleeping with one of those guys!?” Plus one of my friends were dating them so it made it even more embarrassing. Then he continues all the time about how my friends are sluts and aren’t real friends. And I would admit if my friends were sluts... most of them just lost their virginity, don’t drink and have long-term boyfriends. So I don’t want to bring him around my friends anymore.

Then my family, he doesn’t care to be around them or make an effort to. He talks shit about them and makes it seem like I don’t have one.

So after that building up till last week, I emotionally shut down. I’ve been miserable, I haven’t been wanting to make an effort in our relationship, I just felt completely defeated. (We live together) 

Why would I want to be with someone who I can’t bring around my friends? Who doesn’t want me around their family? Who doesn’t want me around theirs? Who won’t make changes like stop judging me off their insecurities. I’m a loyal, hard-working woman and I don’t deserve it.

I finally lost it today, packed half my things and moved back home. I told him this and he still doesn’t get it. I’m hurt and confused and feel like I’m not good enough to be anyone’s girlfriend, that everything he said to me is my life.

121,"So I ordered a NSFW item and it actually got ""delivered"" by USPS at 23:56 on March 02. Perfect and discreet right. This is why I don't think anyone took it. I only get the actual e-mail from eBay at 01:56 on March 03, so two hours later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I check outside, walk around... absolutely nothing. Even check the driveway, maybe they just tossed it there and walked away. Nothing to be found. Mailbox is a bit further away although I only checked it just now, and I'm not even sure the package would fit inside, but nothing was in there expect paper mail anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I checked eBay, as well as the USPS website and with the tracking number it has all the tracking steps except for ""Delivered at \_\_\_\_\_"". The very last update was at around 15:22 March 02 where it arrived at a parcel locker. 

&amp;#x200B;

Never had to deal with this kind of issue before, so I'd like to know the steps to take before doing things like contacting the seller, etc. Seller doesn't have a huge amount of experience, but has nothing but positive reception praising discreet and secure delivery in covert packaging.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a really shitty situation because the USPS says it's delivered. At near midnight. And I checked. Twice. There's nothing. So I feel it's a burden on me to have to prove to them that I'm not lying because as far as they know, it's been delievered, and that's such a pain in the ass to have to do. 

If only Amazon had these items, I'd have just gotten this off of there with Prime. Never miss any packages with Amazon. 

Chances are if the item got delivered to the wrong address, then well it's not something I want anymore as it's probably tampered with. And I don't want to go around to the post office telling them about my NSFW item that got mis-delivered. So I don't know if it's worth asking the post office or making a fuss about anyways.

This past summer, I was hired as an intern for an insurance company, and after the fall semester I did well enough that they said I could stay as a legit associate. Now, this position is essentially like owning a business because the income is entirely commission based. I loved the idea because I’m good at this, and have the potential to make good money.

These classes aren’t even required, they’re just for the sake of meeting the credit hour minimum. However, I underestimated the stress of a full class load and now my work/income is suffering, as well as grades.

My mom got cancer and is still recovering. So she is emotionally and physically pretty unstable from all that she has been through. It doesn’t help much that my dad left their 24 year marriage when she was in the middle of fighting cancer.

My brother tried to kill himself a few months ago and barely survived. I barely see him because he doesn’t want to spend time with his admittedly messed up family. Instead he drives hours to spend weekends with his girlfriend.

I am unsure of everything at the moment. I was raised Mormon but my dad’s awful behavior contradicts everything I was taught growing up. 

I am overweight and depressed. I took the semester off from school to live with my mom and save money while taking my classes online. I am just so exhausted. I feel like I just try and try to get back up, but life just keeps kicking me down. I am a straight A college senior. I want to go to law school. I speak Chinese. I want to go places. I just feel so down right now. I need advice on how to be happy. I don’t have any answers....

138,"I've decided I want to have a stable income stream for the first time in my life. This may seem small to a lot of people, but feeling insecure about earning money in a way that feels nurturing to me has been the bane of my existence. I'm sick of homelessness, fear of complications of poverty, and feeling stuck in abusive relationships. I'm tired of not trying out ideas because I judge myself harshly for failing.

I want to begin exploring freelance work/a home business project but I am stuck on how to decide on and commit to one idea....how to know when it isn't working and when I should adjust or try another idea...how to know how complex or simple my idea needs to be before trying it...

This feels intimidating but I know I need to at least try, for my sanity, my future. I see myself as not having any marketable skills or areas of expertise/proficiency but its against my values to tell anyone including myself that I am incapable of earning money in an ethical and self nurturing way.

l also need to seek support to feel like what I'm doing is real, worthwhile, and valid to commit to even when I feel overwhelmed. I'm not sure where to turn to for encouragement and support in this way. If there are some supportive online communities I am interested in hearing.

So TL;DR is 
a) any supportive freelance/home business/blogging income online communities or resources?
b) what process or guidelines can I use to hone in on what exactly I believe I can offer/the format to offer it in? Especially when I have no degrees and unsure in what ways I may be seen by other people as ""qualified"" or ""valuable""
c) any other input on my approach to trying to develop an income stream ideas is very welcome

They'd like to have more people in the company learn this technology. The trainer who trained me isn't available. I'm not the only one in the company who knows the technology, there are a couple of them. Yet I, the junior most among them all was chosen to train people.

They think I'm capable. I am not sure I believe it. Sure, I have a good understanding of it and know the core concepts. But knowing something doesn't mean that you can train people on that, that too to people far more senior and experienced compared to you.

I tend to get really anxious when I have to address a group of people. I tend to lose focus and I zone out when in the middle of talking. I feel I'm not qualified enough for this.
But the company insisted saying that they felt I was the best person to take up training.

 I knew my girlfriend joining a sorority would be a bad idea. I just knew it. Everyone on reddit said I was overreacting, my girlfriend said it was going to be a big deal. Six months later it fucking suuuuuucks. I wish we would’ve parted ways if I had known how it was going to be. 

  I had a talk last week with my girlfriend where I kinda just vented about how much it sucks, because I felt her sorority was more important than our relationship. She agreed that she was really trying, but it was clear that I got the short end of the stick. I understand it’s difficult to balance grades sorority and a relationship, but I can’t be the one getting the least attention. We came to an agreement, and I’m glad that I had that conversation because I was starting to resent her. She would always talk about how mixers weren’t all that fun, but it she would never miss one. 

Anyway, so today she was sitting next to me texting one of her sisters, and she was saying she finally made a Twitter and she doesn’t really want people to know, which is why it’s a random name. I send her twitter memes all the time through text and she always said she didn’t want to make one. I didn’t realize until after, but I got a notification that she made one because she’s in my contacts. I don’t care that she made one, but she still hasn’t mentioned it. I could just wait a few days, I could send her a screenshot of the notification, I could do nothing. But I just don’t understand why she wouldn’t say anything at all.

In my first few months of sobriety i cheated on him and wasnt a good person yet still with my active addictive thinking. I admitted this to him and we werent together for a while. We decided to get back together and move foreward. I told him i wanted to put 100 in and so i did. I went out of my way, through hoop after hoop trying to assure him that i was in it 100 this time and i worked alot on myself. It seemed he regressed and started treating me the same way i had treated him those first few months (swearing at him, running away from important conversations, talking to other people, etc.) I put up with this for over two years feeling as though i deserved it for my mistake. Well, Ive been going through a hard time lately and there are alot of big unexpected changes in my life and i finally broke down 5 months ago and outright told him what i needed, emotional security while going through this. I practically begged for affection and reassurance and lost self respect i had gained for myself these past few years working on being a better person in begging him for these things. I didnt get them. 

So, I play alot of video games and this guy and i had talked for quite a while as he helped me figure out how to play this new game and gave me pointers. When I finally had enough of begging for attention, and this guy gave me his number i decided to call him. We've talked back and forth as friends while playing the game for months now and ive told him what all is going on in my life and i realize i have been emotionally relying on his support and its made me feel a certain way. Guilt. I admitted finally to my boyfriend a few weeks ago about this guy and how i was finding security where he wasnt giving me any. (Mind you this gamer guy lives 7 states away. No physical contact.) Now my boyfriend is mad and obviously says he wants me to have no contact with this guy. I told the guy and he was completely understanding and told me he didnt want to lose a friendship over that but he understood. Im all sorts of confused now though. Im having trouble giving up contact with this guy who has been here and for me albiet through the phone through these hard past few months. I feel connected to him somehow and feel like he is meant to be in my life somehow. And i feel guilty more so about my significant other who is now trying hard these past few weeks to change his attitude and be here for me, that i still crave the attention this other man was giving to me after my life lacked it for a few years.

148,"Hi everyone, so a little bit of background info.  I’m a 19F and I’m in my first year of college.  I live with my parents and one of my sisters who is 22 years old.  (My other sisters are older and moved out).  So my 22 year old sister, lets call her A, has been with a 21 year old guy on and off for about 3 years, let’s call him C.  She is currently pregnant with his child and will have her baby within the next week.  C is actually the worst human I have ever met.  I’ll list some of the things he does/has done here: 

- Abuses A verbally and physically (not physical while she’s been pregnant, but before he did).
- Last year, he posted some nude photos of A online.
-Gave A an std or some type of sexual disease.
- He slashed my moms tires in the middle of the night.
- He kidnapped our cat without us knowing
- He threw eggs and various things at our house
- He used to be a drug dealer (I have no idea if he still is).
- Has been arrested multiple times
- Cheated on A, and I also saw him come out of a girls house who lives down the street from us early in the morning one day (so clearly he was with her that night).
- Saw him in an Instagram photo at a party with high school freshman girls.  They’re 14/15, he’s 21, as a reminder.
- Hasn’t wanted anything to do with A for the majority of her pregnancy, and suddenly the last few weeks of it he apparently does.
- Doesn’t have a job or go to school, so it seems like he doesn’t care for supporting his child.

So, anyways he is a horrible person and I have not seen him at all because for the longest time, my parents wouldn’t allow him in our home.  Fast forward to now, he started coming over my house and sleeping over often the past few weeks.  My response in my head is: what the actual fuck.  I immediately confronted my mom about this and said, “why would you let this man into our house? do you not remember all the things he has done? I don’t care if he is the father of the child, that man is cruel and letting his negativity into our house is a horrible decision”.  My mom is basically giving me vague answers and tells me that she doesn’t want to hurt A by telling her that he can’t come here.  I literally can’t comprehend why both of my parents are okay with their daughter seeing this horrible person, let alone letting him come over and sleeping here?  A’s room is right next to mine so knowing that the only thing separating us is a wall makes me feel so uncomfortable and unsafe.  I have a very high heart rate already, so in stressful situations such as this, it becomes even faster and I just want to cry because a home should be peaceful and where you feel safe.  When she has the baby next week, this will only get worse bc he will probably want to come here to see him all the time.  I feel so powerless because my parents seem to not even care about how I feel or the well-being of me or A.  I wish I could kick him out myself but I don’t even want to look at his face nor do I have the power to do so.  He is even here as I speak, and I’m scared he’ll sleep over once again 😔 How do I handle this? Please help me :(",04Mar2019,1

150,"So currently I am living in NW Montana by Glacier National Park and I’m loving it! I spend my summers working in the park and the winters traveling or just laying low. 
I’m 26m and enjoy hiking, being by mountains, traveling, but the problem is, living out here is EXPENSIVE (I’m originally from southern Michigan) and it is impossible to ever own a house or property cause that is even more expensive (think 180k for a 900sqft house IN TOWN, 70k+/acre)
Back in Michigan (Kalamazoo) by where my family lives things are dirt cheap by comparison, but it’s not as great as being out in Montana. 

I spent my early 20s working really hard at factory jobs to save money and have amassed about 65k, but the saving has kind of stopped ever since I moved west. I’ve always wanted to be financially stable, pay cash for a house, all that great stuff, but I’ll only be able to do that in the Midwest (there houses in town are decent and go for 50-60k) 
I don’t have any skills except hospitality management and that doesn’t pay really well... 

I really want to be out in Montana, but I will always have to rent, work like crazy to pay bills, never be able to save money, I just feel like I’ll be spinning my wheels and by the time I get tired of it, it will be too late to do anything else. 
It’s either that or move back to Michigan and pay cash for a house (or close to it),have a decent job with no expenses (besides utilities and stuff) and save/plan for a future where I can be financially well off and have extra money for things.  

What would you guys do? Would you stay in a seasonal/contract job that made you happy in a place you love,but you have no future, or would you move somewhere that isn’t as great and be financially stable and have a future?

Hello,  
I am in the state of Pennsylvania and as mentioned above, I had to call the cops not too long before writing this post. My friend who lives just with her abusive dad as her mother has passed asked me to because she was terrified he'd hurt her badly.  
EVIDENCE  
In the past he has hit her many times across the legs, face, buttocks, thighs, stomach, and really any other area with his fists and with a belt. He has threatened to get a hammer in the past. He has destroyed 2 of her phones, and has broken a school Chromebook because she has not done a chore or just because he felt like it. He is extremely bipolar. While she takes her away to Puerto Rico and ignores her to go out drinking, the one time she was sleeping in shorts and he hit her inner thigh with a belt to wake her up. There was blood and there is a scar left over, that she did not reveal to the police this night for unknown reasons. He verbally abuses her and calls her a pig, a slut, and many other things. He also takes away her freedoms and pushes her to do everything around the house, and often times forgets to feed her.

INCIDENT

On March 3, 2019, 8:33PM I called the police as he came home from being gone all day presumably drinking and due to her not doing laundry he flipped her bed and I was told as of writing this smashed her phone again. The girl was scared, and asked me to call the police (we've had a plan in place if I needed to so I had info on what to say to them, address and all), and I did. 2 or 3 state troopers were dispatched and I was asked by her to get there as they asked her if she was being picked up. My parents drove me and when we got there, we were told to wait as they had to call CPS. After waiting for a while, one of the troopers returned looking disappointed and told us that due to the fact he didn't hit her this night and that there were no bruises nothing could be done and he was just parenting. So this was completely chocked up as fine and everything continues as normal.

OUTCOME

I am very scared for her and my safety. He does not like me for some reason and knows where I live. I'm worried that he will be worse to her and hurt her with a hammer, or just hurt her in general. I am also worried he will come to my house and do something as he does not seem mentally stable. The only other person she has to go to closest is in Nebraska and my parents have both stated they are okay with housing her here as they have gone through abuse themselves.

158,"Parents of reddit... mothers and fathers (I hope I can post here asking for parent advice)... I’m emotionally drained and torn. I feel like my mother will always be right and all I can do now is sit there listening to her bashing my head in, and know I have to accept it because everything I may say is just back chat or attitude and it’s just me being in denial.

So in brief context, my mum hardly has a job and is too lazy to work hard but cries about having no money. 
Like me, she is a student doing nursing and in her final 1.5 years now. I personally, feel the timing of it all was selfish. My sisters were moving from what we call intermediate here in NZ (a senior in primary school) to becoming juniors in high school.

This period requires a decent sum of money to fund the new text books and uniform. My dad works hard. He has no degree and over the last decade has worked his butt off exceeding as much as 60-65 hours a week at times to make sure we have enough.

As a student, I pay for everything myself... I get no help from my parents. I pay for my car, my WOF, my petrol, my public transport, my food, my clothes, my laptop, camera the list goes on. I am not always the best at saving because of this... and because my funds can be high. I am however slowly gaining more and more as the weeks go by. I had a problem with gambling, which they found out about as I reached out. Instead of my mum being supportive, she was critical about it and always brings it up. It makes me feel low, and as if I’m not good enough.

The hypocritical part about it is, she spends my dad’s money and does earn her own money. She gets her nails and hair done, constantly eats out and sits around doing nothing but sleeping and watching TV when she isn’t at class. I’ve recently invested my money in things I enjoy, GoPro, new surfing kit, 3 pairs of shoes which I’ve loved for the last few months, some new clothes for university as well as servicing my car and getting it fixed up.

She came up to me and said “there’s so much better things you can do with your money... like a new car for instance”. The thing is, I don’t even NEED a new car! Why would I? I spend about $20 on petrol a week to get to my part time job and the gym, otherwise I’m using public transport in Auckland. 

She’s the one who came up to me asking for $1000 to lend her to buy my sister a new laptop, and would pay me back $50 a week. I said to her no (and my sister is currently borrowing mine and my mum refuses to give it back to me even though University is starting now), and she lashed out saying I’m selfish for it? She’s had 4 months to organise a laptop for my sister but did nothing but spend it on herself. And I SAVED for my own laptop. I got no assistance.

So essentially, there’s a whole lot more examples. The way I see it is, my savings is going up... at times it’s slowly.... but it’s going up. Yes I buy clothes and shoes here and there, but a lot of them have resale value! And I see it as a better investment, than me gambling it off or spending it on drugs and alcohol like some people my age would. I have had no assistance with any of my assets and I’m the one working more than she has the last 4/5 years. However, she belittles me. She always has to bring up money some how and how I’m poor with saving and I’m throwing away my future.

I’ve seen a therapist the last 1.5 months as I have mild depression... and I haven’t told my parents (even though mum has depression), because I know she will act all sympathetic at first, but she will bring it up in a negative way when I’m down and emotional. I’ve explained to the the therapist my past, the situations we’ve been through and my current position with money/study. He agrees with me.... that yes I could save more, but I’m young, I have my future ahead of me, and I’m investing it in things which have resale value. And that he sees it as my mum putting me down for something she wishes she could’ve done when she was younger. That she’s trying to make me follow the path she wished she could’ve taken.

There’s a whole lot more too.... she has not socially developed since her teenagers, avoids gatherings or invites by friends or colleagues where as with my girlfriend for 3.5 years, I’ve socially grown. Family gatherings, celebrations and even just casual lunches/drinks and she always makes me feel guilty for going. She has even stopped me from going out with her family and just my friends in general.... IM 21! I feel like I’m treated as a 14 year old.

I feel like I’m being controlled over my own money/assets as well as any activities I may do, while she’s sitting in 10k worth of debt, doing nothing to try get rid of it but instead my dad is working hard. I feel like even though she’s my mum, she has no place to tell me what I should be doing when she’s not doing it herself. I’ve offered to pay for board while staying at home, she’s declined that offer, but constantly brings up how I don’t pay rent...... it pisses me off.

Please... I need help. I feel lost, I feel like my life is just me being suffocated within her grasp. And that I’m nothing but unsuccessful, poor and a failure.

TL;DR - My mum is hypocritical and controlling over my money and a lot of my life activities, despite me working more than she does and having to pay for my own assets and bills with no assistance. As well as me investing it in assets with resale value.

My dad's injury wasn't terrible, but there was a lot of blood and I just felt a *whoosh* in my head. I could hear my pulse in my ears and my vision blur. I nearly collapsed and my sister had to help him. I was super embarrassed afterwards and kind of shocked at my reaction. 

The immediate reason for my making this post was just a few minutes ago when I had to wake my dad who'd been sleeping on the couch. My dad has had a colorful medical history, so his health has always stressed me out. When he opened his eyes from his nap, he looked around wildly, asking where he was in a sleep-drenched voice. I already felt a bit of a panic come on as my pulse noticeably resounded in my ears. I kept my voice calm enough when I told him where he was and that I just needed him to go to his bed. Still totally out of it, my dad lifted his arm and grimaced in pain. My anxiety again shot up as I thought of all the warning signs of a heart attack like a numb arm. I felt super lightheaded, though not as bad as the previously mentioned experience. Even now, a few minutes later, I still feel woozy and anxious. My dad seemed to regain full consciousness though and thankfully is fine.

Now I'm just lost with thoughts of ""What if..."" racing through my head? What if he was having a heart attack or another stroke? What if he just collapsed? What would I do? Would I faint? Would his death be my fault because I couldn't handle a stressful situation?

I'm just very frustrated with myself because I'm known for being level-headed but these events have made me realize that in times where matters of life and death are in my hands, I will likely panic and fail everyone. How can I learn to handle situations like this better? With my dad's fragile health, I feel like this is a skill I will need to master sooner rather than later. Thanks!!",04Mar2019,1

Ive been living with my dad he's an alcoholic and my mother is no better i don't see her that often.  My parents relationship  has never been great. Constant fighting and arguing. I've witness it every night of the week growing up. It never effected me too bad until highschool. I lost all my friends, stayed inside every-weekend playing videos games this doesn't bother me that much but its hard to be social now because of it. I literally have zero friends to hangout with. I want to make friends but I find it so hard. Im still going to school and working but besides that the only other productive thing I do is go to the gym. I have not found what really drives me yet, I really enjoy working out but thats like the only hobby i have. I just really need some assurance that im not the only one. I was thinking of seeing a doctor because Ive never been diagnosed with anything but I dont want them to put me on some whacky meds.

165,"I know this isn't going to fly well on this sub but I need someone to talk to about this. When I was about 13 I got exposed to child porn and became addicted to it. I had curiosities about girls my own age at the time and by the time I was 16 I had found the more hardcore stuff, but I was completely guilt ridden because of it. I absolutely hate pedophiles, hate them with every fiber of my being. When I felt a urge I deemed inappropriate, I would burn myself, or punch myself, or whip myself with a belt. This went on for years and years. I would keep watching it which would cause my urges to increase which just caused my anger at myself and anything resembling a sexual desire to rise. One day I decided to take drastic measures and sell my computer, not before reporting as many of these sites and users I had gotten in contact with as I could. I only read, and watched tv, those were my only sources of entertainment. For over a year. It was hell at first but I got used to it. its how I quit porn over all.

Scars were left. Oh, scars were left deep, both physically and mentally. I tried to get a girlfriend, at 23. But I felt a awful feeling in my stomach. Like I was trying to abuse any girl I was trying to talk to. If my intentions might lead to sex, it made me feel awful, I felt like I was damaging women by even attempting to do it. I hated the idea of sex, I hated anyone who did it, the idea of me doing it reminded me a lot of my pedo days. The wires were crossed, sex = guilt, disgust, hate.  Self hate in myself is pretty high because of this. I feel like I don't deserve to live a happy life. I forfeited that when I was 13. I do the bare minimum, I hate when good things happen and welcome pain when it comes. I am scarred with the memories of things I've seen and done. I saw the worst in humanity and had that coupled with me training myself to see sex as shameful, abusive and horrible. I can't tell this to a therapist, I don't know what to do.

168,"Hey fam! I apologize if my formatting is off, I'm trying to do this correctly but I'm writing from my phone so please bear with me. 

I never thought I'd have a problem worry of Redditors' advice but I have a situation that is torturing me and I'm losing sleep over and I could really use some insight. If anyone has advice from a legal background that could really help too.

A little backstory: I'm a 30 year old woman who recently moved to another part of the country because my husband is in the military. I have my own business but it's in the beginning stages, and it took a hit when I had to suddenly change location and lost my office space, etc., so I had to fall back on an old skill and take a bartending job at a pretty upscale, non-corporate restaurant to supplement our income while I rebuild my business. 

This restaurant is owned by a foreigner who is very misogynistic and unapproachable, and the head server at this establishment is a woman in her late 40s who has one of those personalities that seems kind of sociopathic...very self centered and two faced, yet with a certain charm that makes people want her to like them even though they see how toxic she is and are intimidated by her. She spreads gossip constantly and talks about everyone behind their back, yet acts syrupy sweet to their faces. I've tried to keep things simple and stay on her good side and maintain an uncomplicated relationship with her but despite my efforts things blew up this weekend and I was told by several people that she is spreading rumors about me being a cocaine addict. She is implying that I am dealing drugs and has told my new-found friends in the community that I shouldn't be trusted around their children. 

What this woman doesn't know is that I am a recovered heroin addict. I just celebrated 4 years clean and it's a time when I should be very happy and very proud of myself for what I have overcome, but I'm losing sleep over the fact that I'm being trashed by an authority figure at work. I'm scared to go to the owner because he's intimidating and unapproachable, and has fired people on the word of this woman before. I feel like I'm being slandered and my character is being decimated but I feel powerless to defend myself, I'm afraid I will get fired and I really need this job. We are stationed in a small town and there are very limited employment options; other than my business I don't have skills to obtain many jobs. I'm really scared, and hurt, and sickened by this person and at a loss as to how to protect myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated...do I try and contact something like the Better Business Bureau? Will that make me an outcast in a town where my husband is military and needs to have a professional reputation? Do I just say oh well and let people think the worst? What if that negatively affects my husband's career?

TL;DR: I am a military wife in a new town and a spiteful and jealous coworker is spreading rumors about me, and I feel powerless. ",04Mar2019,1
169,"I accepted an international program after German high school (I am 19) which gave me the opportunity to come to the US and work for a year. I'm having a miserable time. My interest in the US is decreasing, I don't get along with the people I work with and I generally do really want to go back home. 

However, the money is great. In 2-3 months I will be upgraded and will have the chance to make about 10-30k to take back home. This was my motivation to stay all along as I felt completely misplaced from the very beginning. Should I work through these last months to make the money or value my time and youth more and just go home?

Taking the flight back home feels like having a huge weight lifted off of me but then reality starts hitting me; I'd have no job for a few weeks, I am 2k debt that I could pay off here and then I'd need to start my studies soon but I wouldn't be able to fund myself, nor could my family.

171,"This might seem like an /r/personalfinance question, but hold on.

For background, I live in rural-ass, backwoods Maine, and it's kind of the worst. I understand the appeal, but I want out as soon as possible, especially ever since I lived for a few months in an NYC suburb for a semester school and absolutely loved access to an actual city. My ultimate career goal is Urban Planning, since that was the focus of the semester school and I really loved it.

I've been accepted to the school I've wanted to go to for years, Quinnipiac University, into their political science program. They do some of the most reliable and indepth polling in the country, so their poli-sci is outstanding because you get to help out with that. They gave me a pretty generous scholarship—26,000 a year—but college is expensive these days, and my govt. financial aid is somewhat lacking. I'd still wind up in debt, and I plan to go to grad school so that'll just be the beginning.

My dad is pressuring me to go to the University of Maine, which is close to Bangor. 3rd biggest city in Maine, with a whopping 30,000 people and no night life. Joy. But, it'll be cheaper. I'm still looking at around 20,000 in debt, but by today's standards that's pretty damn good.

If it was strictly financial, UMO is still a pretty good school, but with the added downside of remaining in-state and vaguely near my family, I don't really know what to do.",04Mar2019,2

173,"I am not entirely sure what I am asking here, as much as I’m hoping to find someone that can relate to this and maybe offer some advice on how to approach and handle this situation. 

I had a very close relationship with my mother my entire life. I am the oldest of 3 (23yo now). She was my best friend and my go-to when anything positive or negative happened. She was always my shoulder to cry on. Unfortunately, within the last few years that has changed, and the last year or so it has really progressed fast. My parents divorced 14 years ago. It was a very messy situation that definitely messed me, my sister, and her up emotionally. She remarried a great guy and had another child with him. I consider this man my dad and I love my brother a lot. There’s no underlying resentment there at all (just to clarify). 

My mom has always had a lot of stress on her. I was homeschooled from k-12th grade (thanks columbine). My sister was homeschooled too, on top of the fact she was my grandmothers caregiver from pregnancy with my sister until 2007 when my grandfather retired. That’s a lot for one person. At 8 years old I remember asking her to let me go to school to allow her more time to care for my grandmother, because I felt my education was starting to take the backseat. That continued to the point that I just quit doing work and it’s almost like she never noticed. I was around 12-13, so of course I’d rather play video games all day vs school work...I’m in college now don’t worry.

Eventually, my mom, being so focused on everything going on, pretty much let herself be absorbed by her caregiving, and parenting to the point that she has 0 friends. No social life whatsoever, and is incredibly paranoid now about having friends because they will “stab her in the back”.

Fast forward to 2019, I am now grown up. I’ve never been into any trouble, no run ins the law, I laid low and just did my own thing. I know a lot of people say it, but I was pretty close to being the model child. I followed every rule, never back talked, never questioned anything, did my chores plus more, and always tried to help in anyway possible.

So here’s where my issues begin. 

My brother is now in the situation I was in at 12. He is showing a few developmental issues such as speech impediment, isn’t that quick on the draw, and definitely undereducated for his age. My mother no longer cares for my grandmother but I suppose she doesn’t know how to manage her time. She spends a lot of time now on Facebook with her pyramid scheme business. She is almost impossible to hold a conversation with. She is very strong in her opinions and it is to the point that she all but covers her ears while screaming “lalalalala I can’t hear you”. No matter what I try to talk about I am wrong and she is right. There’s no middle ground to be found. I could tell her a statistic and show her physical evidence and if she disagrees “whoever told you this is wrong, they don’t know what they’re talking about”. I cannot carry on an adult conversation with her anymore without being questioned about my motives. I wish I was exaggerating, but simply going to the store is a game of 21 questions. “Why are you going? what do you need broccoli for? I don’t think now is a good time to go, it’s probably busy, etc”. It’s beginning to go beyond our household as well. I am embarrassed to even bring my fiancée over because she’s starting to get the same treatment. 

My sister still lives at home too, but she has built a wall and does her own thing no matter what anyone says. I want to provide some form of help, I’ve even talked to my stepfather about it and he knows there’s an issue but I think he is intimidated by the situation/potential outcomes. I am at a loss and do not know what to do to help. I know that moving out is the most sensible option but that is unfortunately not an choice at this time. I’ve looked at every option I have and financially cannot do it currently. I currently am enrolled full time at school, and carry a full time job on top of that, which I’ve realized I do this so I’m rarely home. When I am off work, I try to stay gone or lock myself in my room. I get a lot of passive aggressive jabs for spending so much time with my fiancée when I can, instead of spending time with the “family”. 

I have brought up these issues before and it ends in a argument about how I am “attacking” her and how I “hate her”. That is so far from the truth and it hurts to hear that. I am the only one in the home that makes an attempt at talking to her, but I’m tired of subjecting myself to that. I am tired of never getting to have a conversation with my mom without having my ideas, plans, or opinions completely dumped on. It blows my mind how often I hear how great of a son I am, how proud of me she is, and then 10 minutes later I’m being interrogated for leaving to go to the store. I am afraid my mom is inducing herself into some sort of psychosis. She is definitely detached from reality, I just don’t want it to get too far. I want the relationship we used to have, and more importantly I just want her to be in a good spot mentally, and as of right now...she is not. ",04Mar2019,1

Well two weeks ago she found out and dumped me...I felt really empty and depressed the first couple of days but I went back on tinder, trying to get myself back together and move on and talk to other girls. 

My ex is also back on tinder and started talking to my best friend. I said I’m okay with him going for it. My best friend and ex gf only met once before. I did tell my ex gf a lot of personal things about my best friend which I now regret. They’ve been texting a lot and suddenly, in an act of pettiness, she starts telling him things she knows about him that he confided in me with. Then he got angry with me. 

At this point I haven’t spoken to her in 2 weeks but I texted her asking if she’s trying to start shit between my best friend and I. I tried calling her and she didn’t pick up, so I left a voicemail calling her pathetic and saying what she did was really petty. I told her to call me if she has a spine.

SO I'm a sophomore and I transferred colleges this semester. I'm really into improv and comedy. I've been doing it for a long time and I'm pretty good at it. My new school has four improv groups, but only one was having auditions this semester. I auditioned, I got called back, and I haven't heard yet whether I got in but judging from callbacks I'd say it's likely.

HOWEVER, the group I auditioned for is on the lower end of quality. The girl who runs the best group on campus told me today that if I get in to the one I auditioned for I should turn it down and wait until the fall so I can audition for every group and have more choices. She also sort of implied that I could get in to her group. She's seen me do improv because I'm in a sort of informal improv class that she teaches. The class is fun but I'm not that great in it because most of my classmates are brand new to improv and not very good at it, and it's hard to be good in a scene when the other people aren't. 

If I can get in to the better improv group next semester it would be worth waiting. HOWEVER, I'd probably be burning my bridge with the group i auditioned for, and I'd have to wait until I was a junior to be in any group at all.

What do I do? I know it sounds like a silly thing to be this stressed about but improv is really important to me and i have no idea what the right decision to make it.

My Wife and i have been together for four years now.  I moved from another country to be with my wife and the only family i have is hers due to the vast distance. Over the years i integrated nicely into her side of the family.  I should mention that her side of the family is quite religious. I have never had an issue with it until now. (i personally don't have a deity/religion. I honestly just don't care)

  
So My Wife has a sister (we can call her Mia) that currently  has 3 kids, ages 4,2,1 (1 boy 2 girls)   
I baby sit them regularly so that the parents can go and bible study. This is on workdays so it is a huge inconvenience but i love these kids tons! (i have babysat of and on for about 2 years)   


So Mia called my wife the other day and requested me not to baby sit any longer. Mia asked if it was okay for my wife to reschedule her evening shifts so she can babysit in my place. 

""The reasoning was that i am not christian and that there has been some cases of child abuse lately, sp it has Mia a bit concerned about uncles""  


I am currently so filled with rage... The amount of love i have shown these kids.. And that Mia would ever think that i would ever hurt them or take advantage of them sexually makes me SO ANGRY!!   


Anyhow.. Mia called today and requested my wife to babysit coming weekday. She has it scheduled for work and asked if i could sit instead.  Mia pondered it for a while and said she would be okay,  Mia asked if i could send her text msges for when they have supper/tvtime/bedtimestories/prayer/ so she could make sure im on schedule.

A little background: Back in November I started talking to my RA. We instantly hit it off and started spending time together, fast forward to winter break she invited me to a small party in her town (about an hour drive) and I had a great time with her. Fast forward to spring semester, we began hanging out weekends and a couple days during the week, usually staying up until 1 or 2 in the morning. Watching movies, playing video games or just talking we always had a great time. 

So here’s where the problem comes into play... We never really talked about how we felt even though it was clear we were both into each other. And although it’s totally against the rules for us to be a thing she said she was fine with it as long as it was a secret. About two weeks ago she became really busy with the school musical that she’s in. I gave her space and assumed things would pick back up after the musical was over. During the week of the musical we barely had any contact besides a Snapchat or two. When we texted she could barely hold a conversation.

I play in a local community orchestra and I noticed that at our next concert, there is a piece with a piano part (not typical for orchestral music for you non-musicians). Conveniently, my principal instrument is actually piano (I play violin in the orchestra).

My thought was ""oh I play violin so I'm pretty much a 'renewable resource' in the orchestra and it would be easier to get someone from the orchestra to cover the part instead of calling someone in so I'll ask about how it works when there's a piano part and just casually mention that I could do it"" (I've only been playing in this orchestra for about 6 months). Here's how the conversation goes (OL = orchestra librarian):

me: ""By the way, I was looking at the program for the next concert and noticed there was a piano part. How does that work because I could play it if it's more convenient?""

OL: *doesn't seem to understand entirely what I mean*

At this point, I should mention that OL is quite old and seems to suffer from a bit of hearing loss and also seems to suffer from slower cognitive function from old age.

OL, after having worded my question differently: ""usually we get someone in to cover the keyboard instrument parts but we'll keep you in mind""

note: he seems a bit dismissive

After that, I feel quite embarrassed and almost don't want to go to rehearsal next week because if I could go back I'd just not have offered or even mentioned anything. Was I awkward for bringing it up? What should I do at rehearsal next week if it's brought up (we get our new music then)?

I never do that, I don’t usually say hey look at the nice thing I did. I just do the nice thing. Someone says thank you. I say you’re welcome and we move along. ",04Mar2019,1
189,"For backstory, my mother had me at 21, and my biological father cut off all contact immediately after he found out and began a relationship (eventually married) a woman he was cheating on my mother with. Because my mother and grandparents were some combination of ashamed/embarrassed/too proud to take him to court, he was never required to make child support payments. Because of this, myself, my mother, my (awesome) stepfather, and two additional siblings have had to live with pretty tight finances between them paying off student loans/purchasing a house. I had to turn down an offer from a prestigious university for undergrad to attend a less reputable state school on a merit scholarship because my parents didn't have the resources to save for my school, and I am now amassing student loans from a graduate program. As I am about to enter the ""real world"" after graduating in May it struck me how unfair it is that he essentially got off scot-free while my family and I have dealt with the burden of 100% of the consequences. It doesn't help that after some google searching I recently found out that he is very well off, easily makes six figures and has children of his own who is, by all internet accounts, very involved with. Part of this is my own feelings of abandonment, however irrational they may be, and part of this is wanting some sense of justice, but I need advice on how to get over the strong resentment I feel for this person. What's more fucked up is that based on my internet scoping we seem to be incredibly similar in terms of interests. Part of me wants to meet him but the other part of me wants to forget him entirely.

190,"So me and a good friend from childhood both recently got married and we set up a vacation with just both married couples in a rented house. Buddy said he was bringing Molly, me and my wife tried it in college so we were okay with it. We enjoy the first two days of the trip but eventually we get to the night we decide to take the Molly. We're all rolling and feeling great then we decide to get our bathing suits on and get in the hot tub. Soon after entering my buddy's wife started grinding up on my wife. My wife is visibly not into it, pushes her off and says ""umm, nope sorry"". The awkwardness faded quickly and we started rapid conversation and jammed to the music. Soon we start rolling hard and eventually we start getting intimate with our respective partners.getting touchy feely, kissing, saying ""I love you""... But then I feel that my buddy's wife is grazing her foot up and down my legs, even getting up into my butt and gooch area... It felt kinda awkward as my buddy is just sitting there as is my wife. It doesn't last very long but periodically she will graze against my leg again or start grinding her butt near my leg/feet for a quick second. It starts getting even weirder as my buddy and his wife start saying suggestive things like ""isn't love great, we love both of you so much"", ""it's so great to be sharing this experience with you, hope we can do it again and all the time"". I'm getting kinda weirded out and feel like their trying to initiate  something sexual between all of us and even getting worried because my wife is looking really happy and responding well to the things they arer saying. At some point I even think they're talking in code and I'm out of the loop... My wife says to my buddy's wife ""I really like your tattoo"", ""this is just what we needed, I've been putting too much stress on you"". I'm really worried things are about to escalate, and my nervousness shows. Everyone kind of scales back, nothing else happens and we go to bed not long after. I spoke to my wife about how weirded out I was the next morning, that it seemed like the other couple was trying to start a foursome or something. My wife said she didn't see it that way at the time. I reminded her about my buddy's wife jumping all over her when we first got into the tub as well her footsie stuff on me. She said I may be overthinking it, and that she would never let it get to that point anyway. I told her I would not be okay with sharing her with any other man, but that I actually thought it was sexy how another woman was so obviously attracted to her. I'd told her before that I fantasize about her and another woman but she did not at all seem interested in the idea of adding another person and sharing our sexual escapades with anyone else. This is why this seems so weird because she didnt seem as bothered as I'd expect about the events of the prior night, especially considering another woman was playing footsie with my butt... but she wrote it off as probably just the effects of the Molly making her touchy feely. We both agree that we enjoyed the experience and she has actually said multiple times since how much she enjoyed it and would like to set something like that up with them again... However we have specifically had a discussion about wether either of us would be into this kind of thing since our last encounter with this couple, and my wife is adamant that she does not want or need anyone other than us involved in our sex life. 

So I have several questions nagging me about this... This is the first time I've encountered another couple who may be swingers. Is this actually pretty common amongst married couples?? Are my buddy and his wife swingers? Were they trying to start something sexual with me and my wife? Also, based on my wife's reactions, was she as aware of what was going on as I was? Does it seem like she was into what was happening? And what if I am overthinking it and they aren't swingers, do I need to talk to my buddy about what his wife was doing to my wife and I?",04Mar2019,1
191,"I'm not sure whether this belongs here or on /r/relationship_advice, so
hopefully this isn't considered off-topic.

Short version of my question: I feel like I'm wasting my life despite doing
objectively well by some metrics, and I'm not sure how to go about fixing that in my current situation. This is a bit long, so I've tried to organize and break it up as well as I can.

# Background

I'm a 26-year-old guy, went to school for engineering, have a well-paying STEM job, and have never been in a relationship (or really had anything beyond the kind of situational friendships you find in school that then dissolve after you stop seeing each other every day). My brother died several years ago, which precipitated my parents' divorce shortly thereafter. After that, I shared an apartment with my mother; partially because I was in school at the time and couldn't afford independent living arrangements and partially because she was in a bad place mentally and I wanted to be there to help her through it.

In many ways, that turned out to be a poor decision. She's never been the most emotionally stable person; she's always had trouble coping psychologically with the realities of functioning in the world. After my parents divorced, she ended up latching onto me for emotional support. Pretty much every night, she unloads everything onto me over the course of 2-3 hours. As you might imagine, this is pretty draining, and after it's over I end up doing something mindless for the rest of the night if I have any time at all. Any indication on my part that it's a problem leads to her having an emotional meltdown. On multiple occasions (even before my parents divorced) she's talked about suicide, and has told me multiple times that if I weren't here, she'd have no reason not to follow through. Any independent action on my part (e.g. going out with a group of coworkers after work, going to the store, etc) leads to a meltdown unless I tell her in advance. In some ways it seems like she still thinks I'm 15.

I'm not a psychologist, but this doesn't seem normal or healthy; my dad didn't
act like this. That said, my social skills are... not amazing; combined with the
fact that my field doesn't have a great gender balance, and the only people I've
ever had more than superficial interactions with have been male. I have no
concrete evidence aside from a general feeling of wrongness that this *isn't*
normal and expected.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that she couldn't afford to
live in the area we do without me paying for the majority of our living
expenses.

# Abstract problem

I feel like I'm wasting my life, or somehow failing in an abstract sense, at
least partially. I'm fine on the ""financial/career"" axis, but for everything
outside of work I feel like my life is a trash-fire. My days consist of ""wake
up, go to work, do stuff, go home, help my mother work through her mental
distress [described above], maybe read stuff online for 30-45 minutes, eat, go
to bed, repeat."" Zero friends, no time (or energy, most days) for anything
constructive, and very little independence unless I'm okay with my mother having
an emotional meltdown. The vast majority of my time on a daily basis is
dedicated to work, biological necessities, or dealing with my mother's emotional
problems.

By comparison, the other people around my age I work with seem to be doing fine
on most of those metrics. There's definitely some concrete attributes about
myself I need to work on and changes I could make to my life in order to fix
that, but my current lack of energy and agency makes it difficult to do so.
Which leads to the more immediate problem.

# Immediate problem

I'm not sure how to get away from my emotionally-unstable mother without causing
her to break down, kill herself, or lose the ability to support herself
financially. The current situation, where she's living with me and consuming the
majority of the limited non-work time I have, isn't sustainable. It's breeding
resentment on my part, and I honestly don't know how long I can just take it.

At the same time, she couldn't support herself in the area without me, and she's
not stable enough for me to be confident she wouldn't try to commit suicide or
otherwise break down if I told her I was leaving. Thus far, any indication (and
some things that she *perceived* as indications but weren't) that I might want
to leave or otherwise be more independent is met with severe anxiety or
paranoia. I'm pretty sure she has abandonment issues as a result of some bad
shit that happened when she was a kid.

I know the end result I need to accomplish, I just don't see any path to get
there that doesn't involve catastrophic fallout as a side effect. How do I even
approach this?",04Mar2019,6

198,"Eleven years ago, when I was barely 20, I was raped, and I ended up getting pregnant. I knew I wanted an abortion, but because I was in a vulnerable place, I went to my mother for help. That was a mistake. 

Instead of being supportive, like I’d hoped, she threw religion and her “beliefs” at me. She told me that she warned me this would happen, and it was basically my fault. Already at rock bottom, now I was feeling guilty. 

I begged her to help me get an abortion. She lied, saying it was too late at 6 weeks, and being an uninformed, scared, naive 20 year old without internet access, I believed her. 

Bit of a backstory, I was not a strong person at 20. Yes, I was over 18, but mentally still very much a child. I was molested starting at age 2 up until age 5 or so by a family member, and my mother was always telling me that I was such a burden to her.  So my childhood was not the greatest. I see now that my mother most likely suffers from some type of personality disorder, but at the time, I viewed her word as though it were the word of God. I was afraid to make decisions without including her because I felt I would make the wrong decision, as I had other times that I hadn’t included her opinion. 

I was miserable and unconsolable during the forced pregnancy. Even my doctor ignored my pleas for an abortion, just laughing and saying that this wasn’t the place for that. I was so ashamed, that I didn’t leave my mother’s house, and I felt terribly nauseous the entire pregnancy. I wanted to die. 

When the child was born, I was initially happy that I was no longer pregnant. I dreamed of returning to college and getting my life back. But then my mother decided it was best that she adopt the child instead of letting someone else adopt it. 

The child is now 10, and my family is dysfunctional as ever. The child knows I’m their birth mother, but my mom has told them a very sugar-coated version of how “I wanted them, but couldn’t take care of them.”  The worst part is, after 11 years of my mother trying to force this relationship, I now am disgusted by kids in general, and suffer from intense anxiety/panic attacks, and sometimes extreme nervous breakdowns where I kind of go crazy and start screaming if I get set off. 

I’ve seen countless therapists and psychiatrists, but I either seem to get someone who isn’t qualified, or thinks that I should be this child’s “mommy”, despite the fact that the child was adopted. 

I feel like I’ve had to fight just to have any happy moments over the last 11 years. Then, it gets to be too much, and I just snap. My boyfriend is worried that I will kill myself, because I have talked about it. Sometimes, there doesn’t seem like there is any other solution. What can I do to just be ok? My mom is a trigger, this child is a trigger, and sometimes other children, like my boyfriend’s nephews, are triggers. In addition, my boyfriend was hoping to have kids someday with me, but although he is amazingly understanding of my situation, we’re both skeptical about that being a good idea.  What can I do to be happy and not be triggered by these children?  I can’t seem to move on from this when this child is constantly being forced into my life by my mother. 

Also, I suffer from four chronic illnesses, and am unable to work and support myself. Right now, my parents unfortunately pay for most of my expenses, and my boyfriend helps with the rest. My boyfriend is currently in college to try to be able to get a better job in the future so that he can support me instead of my parents. If I wasn’t sick, I probably would have left long ago.

199,"It never really occurred to me now to actually pursue any sort of action regarding this oddity but it bugs me nevertheless so i might as well try for some kind of answer. 

Back in the summer time of July 2018, I was at work minding my own business when I check my phone on my break as I was bored. I found myself with a voicemail from an unfamiliar number, as I later found to be somewhere in the Indianapolis Area of the US, that had such an odd tone to it. The voicemail contained [this message](https://clyp.it/qok35wew) which I found to be odd. As far as I know I didnt piss anyone off and to be quite frank I believe it to be simply a prank call or troll that did some kind of number masking idk

Yet a little bit of me is paranoid yknow? That healthy dose of paranoia about whatever this is and why I got called. Dunno what I should really do, I pretty much ignored it for 8 months now, I probably will continue as its most likely too late to do anything more unless a new development arises. Im curious if any of you guys had some similar message or whatnot and what you guys did; if this happens again what should I go about doing?

Chapter I: The Dick

Anyways, this all started about 5 months ago. I was hanging with one of my guy friends in after school, and we were just talking about how puberty sucks and what not. Then he says to me ""Your boobs are pretty small, huh? Did you ever even go through puberty, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"" I just kinda laughed it off, and it didn't really bother me, I know he hated his body (He had told me how he thinks he's too skinny, not muscular enough, etc), and we both sulked in our own pity party.  This same, 'friend' had also made fun of my other friend (let's call her..  Lucy). He'd call Lucy fat,chubby,slut, and a pig.  Lucy told me it bothered her and that my guy friend, Richard, (because he's a dick) didn't seem to care. So I told him off, and that was around the end of it. He still makes fun of me sometimes ( saying I have a veiny nose, skeleton fingers, etc), but I just make fun of him. I won't deny that what he says does hurt me a little bit but, I try not to think too hard about it because I know he's just joking.

Chapter II: Peter

&amp;#x200B;

Part I: Hentai Haven

The second domino to fall was the first time I had an open conversation with this kid named Peter and a few other kids.  It was in after school, and the discussion of anime came up (anime starts all unholy things). I said how I tried to watch this anime, Citrus, which I thought wasn't sexual, alas, I was wrong. Then, the topic got switched to hentai, and Peter said, and I quote, ""Damn, I'd like to grab those juicy titties, I  always like girls with huge jugs"" (The epitome of the human thought process). He went on to talk about how girls with huge boobs are hot, but how hentai isn't fully accurate because most Asians have small boobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Part II: I think Peter has a porn addiction

&amp;#x200B;

On a different occasion, me,Peter, and a couple other kids were at after school. Peter was talking about how Marshal just got a girlfriend. Peter made a comment about how Marshal's girlfriend was very flat chested. I said to Peter that being flat  chested was normal for girls going through puberty. Peter responded by saying that Latinas, like Marshal's girlfriend, were usually bustier than other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Part III: Aesthetic

&amp;#x200B;

On another different occasion, just me and Peter were in after school. We were just chilling out, maxing out, and I was letting a little bit of my questioning side show. Talking bout I thought girls were aesthetically more pleasing to the eye, and Peter agreed. We had a long conversation about how we were both questioning ourselves and he told me that he thought slim thicc women were hot. And, that one of our teachers (mind you she's 35, married, and has a kid) was really hot in Peter's eyes because she was petite and had big boobs. It made  me really uncomfortable, and thank God that my dad picked me up before he could continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chapter III: The Art Room

&amp;#x200B;

In Art class, a couple of girls were talking about cute boys from other schools that they had met at sport competitions. I overheard one of the girls saying about how a guy told this girl that he wanted to move from his school because there were only ugly girls at his school. Now me, having seen the girls from this other school, I thought they were perfectly attractive, and I don't know why, but I felt like I just had to throw up right there and then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chapter IV: Makeup

&amp;#x200B;

I don't do makeup. Why? I don't have the time or the skill. My friends do, and it's usually very natural looking. One of my friends does like to branch out. She usually wears a more red lipstick and glitter highlight. A lot of the guys in my grade make fun of her for this, and say that she's ""just ashamed of being ugly"" and that ""Natural is better than fake"", when they don't even know what a bare face actually looks like.  I feel pressured to do makeup because of people like Peter and Richard, but if I do wear makeup, I'll just get laughed at. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I just feel so insecure about myself. I feel like, I'll never be perfect. And, I don't even know why I care in the first place. After all, I don't have a crush on anyone, and I don't really care about romance rn. But, why is it bothering me so much?  And, what can I do to combat always wanting to kill myself or think about saving up for plastic surgery every time I see my reflection?  ",04Mar2019,5
206,"Hey all,

I need advice on an issue I've been running into for a year now. My boyfriend and I moved into a non-smoking apartment complex two years ago. A year after we moved in, a family moved in below us. I've only seen them outside once or twice, but they're pretty problematic.

They have fights in the middle of the night, got their door egged one night and worst of all, they smoke inside their apartment.

We constantly get hit with really strong smoke in every room in our apartment (but especially the bathroom and living room).

Neither of us have had the guts to confront them because we hardly know them. But we've told the landlord several times. He just goes down and knocks on their door and asks if they're smoking. Of course they say no. And he insists we're just smelling someone else's smoke even though they're the only smokers that live remotely close to us.

Anyway, it hasn't stopped ever and out landlord hasn't taken any further action. But we personally hate it because both of our parents subjected us to second hand smoke when we were kids and we just feel powerless and disgusted. Not sure what to do or where to go from here. ",04Mar2019,1
207,"I'm going to college next year at a school that offered me a substantial merit scholarship. The problem? I have to maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to keep it. I want to be a veterinarian, so even if a scholarship wasn't involved I would need to maintain a high GPA. I just don't know how. I also don't even know how a 4 point GPA system works. My school only does percentages. Does GPA correspond to percentages or is it calculated differently?

I go to a small, rural high school that has a history of not really preparing students for college. I work hard and I've done pretty well in school so far, but I'm worried that I won't be able to keep the scholarship, which covers over half of the tuition cost. I've done some thinking but I'm really overwhelmed. 

How do I get good grades in college? High school has been easy for me and I'm really bad at studying as a result of it. My brother also recently got told to take a leave of absence from his university for poor grades so things aren't looking good for me. 

I had a few ideas. I thought about just starting with easier gen ed classes the first semester or even year so I could acclimate to college more easily, but I want to be a veterinarian and I need to take the prerequisites for that, some of which are really difficult classes.

I also thought about taking a summer class there before the fall term, but I'll be working over the summer and hopefully shadowing the vets at the local animal hospital so that just can't happen. I also thought about taking a class at the local community college to get more used to a college setting but that costs money and I don't think the credits would transfer. I take ""college classes"" at my school through the community college but they are taught by high school teachers and I don't think any of those will transfer either. I don't really want to transfer the credits either, since I don't think these classes are even comparable to an actual college class and without an AP exam or anything like that they seem pretty sketchy. I want to be prepared for higher level classes even if it ends up costing more to get my degree.
 
I know that I need to have a balance between studying and schoolwork and other activities as well. I want to at least play in the concert band there and probably participate in the pre vet club. I don't know how to do that. Currently, I have an almost non existant social life and I'm absolutely terrible at managing time. I set aside giant chunks of time for small assignments because I have such a hard time focusing and manging time. I get really easily distracted and I'm afraid that will screw me over. Like, in physics class, if I get points off it's because a) I typed the wrong numbers into my calculator b)I got the write answer but wrote it down wrong c) I did half the question and never finished it because I couldn't stay focused or d) I forgot something silly, like writing down the units, the equation, or even the answer to the problem. How do I get better at concentrating and staying focused?

209,"Please help with advice. 
I work at an insurance agency. Small business, boss lady, her son (50something) and me (28yrold) I’ve been there for 4 years. Money is decent, steady paycheck. My boss (the son) is barely ever there, busy with running his other business or vacationing with his clients. I basically run the whole business for him, from A to Z. The story is, I am 5 months pregnant. My fiancé booked us a vacation to Miami, aka “baby moon”, before I get “too pregnant” to wanna do anything (he knows me).  
Before my vacation, I had to make an excel spreadsheet for my boss of logins and passwords for different websites and portals we use, because he has no idea about any of it. I left last Wednesday. Now, I have my google account logged onto my work computer, for email etc. Today, I how curious of whether my boss used my computer (all the websites logins and passwords are saved on my computer) for any reason. I noticed he used my computer on Wednesday and Thursday. The usage started with email. And went straight to my Google
Account photos. He went through every single one of my photos. Trips, pets, food, screen shots of conversations, explicit photos. EXPLICIT. Lots of them. My fiancé likes taking pics, but that’s besides the point, right? Now, my boss went through them on Wednesday, and again on Thursday, so it wasn’t accidental. I can see it in my browsing history. So what the fuck do I do? How do I go back to work, do I confront him? I’m not embarrassed that he saw them, IDGAF if he saw me naked, but I’m ANGRY that he would go ahead and do this. I’m fuming. And do I tell my fiancé? It’s Sunday, we still have 4 days left of vacation, and I don’t wanna ruin our vacation, because he’s very protective of me especially now, and he will freak. I can’t quit my job  yet, because I’m relying on maternity leave before my bf starts his job as he just got licensed to work (PA-C). I feel trapped by this situation. What the hell should I do?

210,"I’ve been talking to a girl I met on a dating app for the past 5-6 weeks. We originally planned to hangout four weeks ago, but she had to cancel because of plans her family made and didn’t tell her about. The next weekend I had friends in town and couldn’t hangout. This pattern goes on for the next few weeks, but only on her side. We talked every day and seemed to actually have a connection, so I didn’t think she was bullshitting whenever she had to cancel (That and the details she gave me seemed way too on point to be made up)....

We finally were going to hangout today, and I texted her this morning as I always do, only to find that my imessages were being sent as texts. Basically she blocked me. Weird part was at one point imessage went through again but calls weren’t going through, so imessage wasn’t blocked but my calls were I guess. Regardless, I can’t seem to understand why she would do this. We talked every day and it seemed like a real, genuine connection.  At the same time I’m not even sure if I can be upset because we never met in the first place. 

I don’t really want to tell any of my friends who knew about this person because I’m so embarrassed. Every time she cancelled plans before I believed her, and now I just feel like a fool. I guess I just need advice on how to approach this situation / not feel like shit / at least try to find her some other way and see what happened.  Any sort of advice helps. ",04Mar2019,1

Over the years I've gained a number of people in my life that I'm close enough with to call my brother. Family has always been my #1 priority however recently I've been focusing on making myself happy for a while. I work very hard blue collar labor for what I have, motorcycles, trucks, guns, and whatnot. Just wanting to knock a few things off the list of things I always wanted and build a solid savings account before I go start the college kid life. Prior military so college is free but the concept remains the same.
 Seems like through lack of time, jealousy in some cases, distance, and long term relationships I'm gradually becoming isolated. I go visit whenever I get the chance and yet it's rarely reciprocated, if at all. Every time I get something new and fun it's either knocked down as not necessary or complimented with an underhanded jealousy. And every time they see I get something new to make myself happy it seems to isolate me further. They'll burry themselves in their girlfriends or wives since I dont have either and I guess that's some kind of one up on me or do overtime until they can try to keep up with what I have. 
I dont want to lose my friends, but I also prefer to live a more loose and carefree life. I guess this is more of a vent than anything but if anyone has any ideas please let me know. ",04Mar2019,2
214,"I am a high school student and I have recently been accepted to two different universities each for a different program and I really do not know which one I should choose.  The first one is a degree in Chemical and Physical Sciences while the other was a degree in Information Technology. These past few years in high school  I have enjoyed my time in chemistry, even though my marks are not the best (mid 70s to low 80s) and so when it came down to the time to apply to schools, I chose Chemical and Physical Science as a degree because I believed it would let me do something I was familiar with while also letting me explore other possible options. As fort the school that accepted me for Information Technology, my first choice was Computer Science as it sounded a tad bit interesting. I chose Information Technology as my second choice as it was easier to get into. I also felt as though it was similar to computer science as they both use computers, though now I feel like I wouldn't get many doors open for me if i take a degree in Information Technology. 

Both of the schools are away from home so that does not affect my decision. I want to accept a degree that can open up more doors for me whether it be while I am still in university in case if I want to change my degree, or when I finish school and either go back to continue learning or just to get a job after school.

 I understand that its my decision at the end of the day, but I still feel like I need some advice to help guide me as I don't feel like I know much about either path. I would gladly appreciate it if you guys gave me your input on this situation. Thanks Reddit! ",04Mar2019,1

218,"i guess i will just start at the very beginnig, please be kind english is my second language and it is really early.

I never had many friends. Kindergarden, elemantary school nor in middle school. This was fine to me til 5th grade, I experienced bullieing since 4th grade because I got glasses for the first time. Unnecessary to say that i wasnt to happy about needing glasses and beeing harasses for it.  It got really bad when I was in 5th grade. New school, old bullies in my class but none of my friends. I think nearly every day smth happened, nothing special but it always included that they (the bullies) called me names, resulting in an Action where they pulled my Shirt up without my consent. If i remember right i tried to fight them but couldnt do much. I wasnt beaten up or anything real bad but still Not good. I should mention that i was and am tall and slim. That giving me insecurities about beeing strong enough. Given the fact i hadnt much to do at Home i started to flee the real world. I hadnt Access to mobile phones or consoles at that time, another reason why i was an outsider, so i read books. A lot of books. I was somewhat proud of me because I could read so fast and the reading improved my writing skills(benefits me still). At some point beeing so sick of having to stay in that class i started talking to my parents and teachers. 
I felt so sick and unworthy of this world that i just wanted to die. I didnt have plans but imagined how nice it would be if a plane crashed right in my room or a atom bomb hits the city(prefered imagination because all others including my perpetrators would die with me).
I had 2 people i called friends in these 2 years. (I was like 11 or 12). 
At the start of 7th grade i was finally moved in another class. I quickly made some friends but for obvious reasons i couldnt really trust them. I also had no PC to play with them. So i countinued reading books.
Finally on my 13th birthday i got my first laptop. I was so happy. Played with a friend of mine a lot of Rome: Total War and later Stronghold. That's when my father steps in. A few days after my birthday he installs a sowftware to lock the laptop  after a certain amount of time. 
Nightmare.
Still read a lot of books bc i cant do shit. Later another kid i know a bit comes back. J. He is someone extreme. Always doing bad things. TLDR we arent friends anymore and i really hate him nowadays. 
But befire that happened other people introduced us to WoW. I loved it. I loved the grinding. I loved to just be able to forget everything and play. Remember what i told about the Laptop ? Yes that was still going. 
So my friends played WoW and i was at home not beeing able to play with them. Not because we had no money no. I even paid that 12.99 myself. ~55% of my money for like 20h a month. 
With a lot if begging i could convince them to let me play more. (My mother is completely ignorant when technic is in play, not like asshole ignorant but 'i dont want to know neither learn about this'. I was still very shy and had my problems in school, like everybody know who i was etc. 
I didnt had a relationship with a girl(i believe a girl tried to date me and even wanted to come in my room but it was way to scary for me that i could be betrayed, she also asked me a really awkward question during PE class, i dont remember exactly but smth about menstrution. We had sex ed at that time in biology). This just bothers me for know reason(Greetings to Katha if u read this pm me xD). 
Nothing special happened the next years. Got a Bit of my convidence back, had funny Times. Had A crush on a very christian girl in 10 grade. Obviously she didnt love me back.
Started watching yt bc my Internet is blocked by my father but yt works for some reason.
Started talking to a girl about 600 km away. Crush. She is kinky, we talked a lot about sex. I visited her. First time I touched a girl. She has depression and other mental illnesses. I repeat 11th class. Because my grades suck. (I live in Germany. Realschulabschluss=1.5, Not the best but from beeing very good to repeating a class. Puh. Damged my confidence again). 
Then i have this crippled long distance relationship. Still with the girl i met on yt. Lives alone bc her parents dont like her. Talks to me about killing herself. I couldnt help her, my parents are emotionally VERY cold altough beeing nice people. Just dont care about emotions that much. I cant help her. I am very sad. I cry about things she does to herself. Cant express that. Beeing rude because i need to get earlier in bed. Feeling like my behaviour made it worse for her. Fear she kills herself. In the time before we were relstively Happy, altough we talked so much about sex i really wanted it. She doesnt. Turns out she has issues with her body. I stay with her somehow. At least we didnt lost contact. On/Off relationship, visit her occasionally. Petting. Getting accused of sleepwalking. Touching her in her sleep. She is really into BDSM and i am just a vanilla guy. We never had like 'real' sex, only an accident. We somehow loved us.

At the Moment we dont speak much. She is in an BDSM relationship and i got no one. Feeling like nobody unterstands me. Got my own PC but my Internet access is still restricted(I am 20 years old). My A level exams are about to happen. I dont really study for them. I feel powerless. Dont habe really contact to my friends. I dont even know what they think rn about me and her bc relationship or Not was very often changed.

I will move out this Summer(550km away Fr Im my cureent home). It doesnt matter if i I get my A levels for the education as a mechtronic. 

I question the purpouse of my life again. I use some dating apps to find someone to watch anime with. Asking if i can consider my friends still as friends. Every one of them has his own group if friends. But i dont i see them as friends and see them only 4 times a year. Maybe 40 min per month we play together. 

I still use yt very much. I want to play more use my pc more etc... but cant bc my father doesnt like it. (I bought a second mobile phone just to be able to use WLAN at home, blocked for my first phone).

I ounce saw a therapist for an hour on demand of my ex-gf. (I talked her into seeing one, it helped her). But i feel like my Problems arent important enough. I may think of suicide but i dont have actual plans. Only spontanuse that i knoe i wont carry of because i really hate pain

Should i Go and try to see another one ? 

I also dont have much fun in my life. Hearing my mother/father laugh is smth i experience once or twice a year when the netiquette is required aka we have guests. My dad liked to threaten me that He will beat me, he stopped saying this to me but still tells my brother.

The final moments of this twisted relationship arent gone and i really feel like i shoudent search for another person i still do it.

I dont know if i can trust myself bc i apparently misremembered things i wrote. I change my mind very quickly. If u are a stranger i am really nice and try to help and so on. I would tell every stranger that SEEMS trustworthy my whole Story but i dont tell this people i really want to know.

But what i learned about me is that i am an complete as§hole that tries to manipulate others. I dont want to be like this. 

How do i Change myself? How do i motivate myself ? I know i should learn. I know how good i can be. But i never was it. Alwyas mediocre at everything i feel so replacable. I think the people that would care the most right know if i jumped would be my parents and my ex. My 'friends' probalby too but i wonder how long it would be till they know...
 
Sry for bad grammar and spelling. It's late. Pls dont delete this. I dont think i will write this a second time. 


Thank you for reading this unnecessary long explanation. 
I just dont want to assume i got smth and then i dont got it.",04Mar2019,1
219,"(For the sake of his privacy, I'll call him Jack. Also, if there are any subreddits that you think could help in this situation, don't hesitate to let me know).

I met Jack during my freshman year in college, and was instantly drawn to him. I don't know what it is about quiet guys that always gets me, but Jack was everything I look for in a partner - never cocky or domineering, an excellent listener, observant and extremely intelligent. I was quickly integrated into his group of friends, but he was always on the outskirts of every conversation, occasionally nodding and smiling but rarely speaking up. He was the type of person who would disregard his own problems and pour his attention into solving his friends' instead. He was selfless, and he never expected anything in return... in fact, I soon realized that he was surprised when he received anything in return. I asked if he could help me with my English because he was a literature major (I'm from Central Europe) but he was always too polite to correct me when I made mistakes.

I quickly realized that much of his personality wasn't simply due to being a ""nice guy."" I noticed how he flinched when people touched him, how he avoided being alone with people he didn't know. He was never assertive; somebody could probably walk up to him and steal something out of his hands and he wouldn't do anything about it. Even when we were barely friends, he would stick around me at parties if I was the only one he knew. I brought these habits up to his friend, who I'll call Steve, and Steve seemed very relieved that he wasn't the only one who picked up on it. Steve also added that Jack always wore long sleeves, and he'd never seen him undressed. They'd take a guys trip down to a lake near campus on weekends when it was sunny, and although Jack always tagged along, he'd politely decline going into the water, always saying that he was bad at swimming or he just didn't feel like it. Steve had tried asking about it before, but had noticed how uncomfortable Jack was when the topic was broached and would just let it go.

I wasn't sure how to mention it earlier, but Jack has some facial scars from injuries. Nothing too severe, but scars down one cheek and on that side of his lip. He'll often try to turn that part of his face away from whoever he's talking to. I feel like such a piece of shit for joining in on his friends' taunts about how he must have gotten in a motorcycle accident, or what a badass he was. We'd say he got it in a fight and he'd respond with something like ""You should see the other guy."" but I could tell how uncomfortable it made him. He never told anybody how he got them, and it was only months into our relationship that he told me.

When I told Jack that I was interested, he thought I was joking, and it absolutely broke my heart. He was certain that one of his friends set me up to say it, or that I was acting out of pity because, he said ""No girl would ever look at me."" It took him some convincing, but he agreed to give the relationship a shot after admitting that he also had feelings for me.

This was six months ago, and little by little he's revealed bits of his past. He hasn't told me everything, but what he has told me has been so bad I've wanted to throw up. He was severely physically and sexually abused throughout his childhood and into his teenage years, until he managed to run away and get out of the situation he was in. He successfully cut all ties with his abusers, and has even managed to press charges with the support of friends. However, I can't even imagine how horrific it must have been for him.

I've seen him undressed, and there are burn marks from cigarettes on his arms and scars from beatings. He also has self-inflicted cuts running up and down his arms. He's rarely undressed so I'm not sure how often he cuts, but I know it must still be regular.

We've been together for half a year, and he's not ready for intimacy yet. And that's okay. I've told him I'll wait until he's ready, because I love him and I wouldn't pressure him into doing anything he doesn't want to do. He told me that whenever he thinks of sex, he can never associate it with anything other than fear. He asks if I'm mad that we don't have sex, and I say no, because I'm not. It can be a bit frustrating at times, loving someone and not being able to be close to them in that way, but I'm willing to wait.

The reason I'm posting this is because I don't know how to help him move past his insecurities. He's ashamed of the scars on his body, and he thinks I'll leave him if he tells me everything he's done in the past. I've assured him again and again that whatever happened to him wasn't his fault, but although I think he understands that logically, he doesn't really believe it. Sometimes he flinches when I kiss him, a lot less than at the beginning. Slowly he's started to initiate things, which makes me so happy! But still, he's self conscious of his body and past and thinks that he isn't worthy of being in this relationship.

I can't convince him to see a therapist, and he hasn't sought professional help in years. I'm worried that pressuring him into it will only make him angry and frustrate him, but we both know that he can't get past this by ignoring it and hoping it goes away. Should I try to encourage him to talk more about what happened to him? How can I make him believe that I'm attracted to him when he doesn't see the positive qualities in himself? I knew that this relationship would be a commitment, and I went into it ready to stay long-term. I would just appreciate any advice I can get, because seeing the person I love hate himself is devastating.

(This post isn't about convincing him to become sexually intimate with me: I know that will take time and I don't want to rush him. I just want advice on how to support him as he copes with what happened to him, and how to convince him that he's safe now.)",04Mar2019,0

He has been increasingly aggressive and has been making several posts to his social media about guns and murder alongside references to me and my partner. I haven't told my partner about this because I don't want him to worry, but I'm honestly worried that this ex wants to kill me or harm my family.  Should I be worried? What should I do?

221,"Hi. I’m a 19 year old girl and even typing this up makes me want to fall off the face of the Earth, but I’ve got to know— how do you all cope/deal with a secret about yourselves that isn’t really common? When there aren’t many other people who relate or understand, how do you not feel so alone? 

Explanation of my own obscure disorder below, skip if you can’t handle blood/self harm: 

I’ve got a weird...thing I do. Google says it’s a stress disorder called onychotillomania (dont look it up if you’re fainthearted, it can come up with blood/gore, technically) that means to pick/tear at the nails of your hands and/or feet. 

I compulsively rip off my toenails. Like, to the root.

It’s bloody. It’s nasty. Sometimes I hurt so bad the next day I can’t walk because I’ve injured myself so severely. 

I don’t do it for the pain— I actually really, REALLY hate the pain, and I wish it would stop. It’s just that the urge to tear the nail off is so strong I genuinely can’t stop, and will sometimes sit on the floor crying and gasping from how bad it hurts, yet continue to do so. 

It’s awful, and I hate it. It’s the worst part about myself, I think. And I feel like I’m getting to the point where I don’t know what to do about it anymore. 

My toes/toenails (when they finally scab over and try to grow back) are fucking horrific. They’re lumpy, discolored, uneven, and in some places don’t grow back at all. My feet are hideous. I feel disgusting and I’m ashamed of my body. I almost NEVER take off my socks, even in my own home, and I don’t wear open toed shoes ever if I can help it. If I do, I have to try and paint over the skin and nail to look normal— the entire time I’m out, I feel exposed, like everyone can see my filthy secret. I feel like possible romantic partners will hate my feet and be repulsed, and I’m especially nervous because so many people out there have foot fetishes— what if my partner has that fetish, and I’ve got literally the ugliest, nastiest fucked up feet possible? 

Sometimes I wish I could just get my feet amputated and have little metal prosthetics, that’s how bad I hate my body. 

I know this isn’t a heathy thought process. But when I talked to my last psychiatrist about it, she made me feel like a fool; she said my disorder didn’t exist, and that I must be doing it on purpose or because I liked it, because I could ‘just stop anytime I wanted.’ I no longer see her, but her words stuck around. 

Am I crazy? How do y’all cope with things like this? Is there anyone out there like me? How do y’all do it???

222,"posted a similar reply to askreddit 

A friend of mine met a military guy one night, was clear on boundaries (she wasn’t on Bc, talked about getting tested, allergic to latex, wasn’t keen on aborting, asked about gfs/families) he agreed there was no issue with still having sex. 
Shit happened,  bad decisions were made — She realized he didn’t pull out (despite him saying he did, who lies about that??) and made him Venmo her for the plan b. 
Fast forward 2 weeks: She finds out She’s pregnant, &amp; informs him. He’s dramatically sobbing about how he’s trying to get his ex back (“she would never go for this”), just had a buddy die overseas, has been “barely holding on at work” and that’s the reason he got so drunk the night they met. Eventually he tells her he’s “not going to let her ruin his life and hurt the people he cares about” he’s moving his ex down to be with him,  he will not be around to parent this baby, not to put his name on the birth certificate and she should block his number and contact information. 
Why would a soldier set themselves up for a situation like this? does this happen often (with the secret families)? and what can she do going forward? (Aside from abortion)

TL;DR girl gets knocked up by military guy who claims he was too drunk to be safe.

She seems to love me in such an exceptional way and I feel that I love her but that I'm more just ""making it work"" and unlike her I don't really think of a future together or things of that nature. Basically, I want to feel the way that she feels about me, and I don't know why I haven't been able to feel that way with her. I am trying to figure out if it's an issue with me (e.g. I will never feel that way about anyone) or an issue with the relationship (in which case I think we should probably consider breaking up), so I'm wondering if you have advice on how to figure this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this may be unrelated but I've had an abnormally high number of parasocial relationships over the last 2 years and these seem to be more intense at times where I feel this sense of something that I'm missing.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I don't have a ton of people that I feel comfortable talking to about this (our social lives are fairly entwined so it's hard to talk to any of my friends about this, I'm not that close with my siblings, and my parents are kind of manipulative and not useful in times like this) so I was wondering if you knew of any ways to find people to talk to about this sort of stuff.

231,"I don’t really have anyone to talk to, and this seems like an area I’m able throw down what’s going through my head and can rant. So here’s a quick run through of where I’m at in life and what I’m stuck with hopefully get some ideas and maybe see how those experiencing similar issues can relate.

Right now I’m 19 just recently quit community college because I felt it wasn’t for me even though I chose a degree program (accounting) even though I never had an interest in this field. I finished the semester though for two reason one would be so I would be safe from having to repay my financial aid loan which could’ve costed me thousands, as well as in case I wanted to try again and actually be accepted for financial aid. The main thing going through my head from this experience is that I keep thinking maybe if I tried something I liked than I’d enjoy it.

Semesters over, come my 19th birthday and a little bit of thinking about my life between this time, I have come to multiple conclusions about where I should lead my life from here. My first option was to attempt another semester of community college with a field that I may be more optimistic about (computer science). My second idea is that I could join the military since I’ve always felt a small desire to serve and I know I have a timer when it comes to this decision. My final decision was to go to work with my dad who is a window installer.

I chose that I’m going to join the work force with my dad and all is going well. It turns I’m pretty good at construction who would of thought, I’m got a pretty good paycheck at the end of the week, and my dad who usually settles for bad employees has me who actually is catching on really quick so he making more money than he ever had in a long time. I’ve been construction for about three months a beginning to feel as if this isn’t something I can see myself doing for a career. I’m starting to think about my ability to still try college again, as well as I still watch military stuff in the internet and still feel the desire to serve. But now I’m stuck at the thought that if I should do what I think what is best for my future but my mind counters this idea with the fact that worker with my dad has built a stronger relationship between us, he’s been noticeably happier, and he’s not as financially stressed which decreased many of the arguments between him and my mom. The first thought that comes to my head is that if I quit working for him than it’s all going to go back to how it used to be and I’d immediately blame myself.

I like working with my dad because we spend more time together since I’m normally cooped up playing video games in my free time. The money’s good and Im not following the footsteps of immediate gratification but I feel but something in my heart tells me this is not what I’m meant to and there’s more for me out there but I find it difficult to stomach the idea ruining the progress that my father is making now as well.

232,"I'm right now an intern at a film production house in my city and I'm not liking the vibe here too much. People are extremely stressed out and I feel like I need to watch my back every time I want to laugh.  I was looking for work with the intention of sticking on to it because I felt like I hadn't committed to anything fully my entire life. But now I really don't like the place, the people or the kind of work they do here, but I also don't want to tell myself that I quit again. I understand that stress and long hard hours are part of the film life and that's pretty much why I joined, but I don't really feel like putting in those hours here. Should I power through it for some time or should I quit in a month when my internship ends?

235,"I'm 16. I'm going through some shit. 

A while ago my dad was drunk and tried to take our car to the bar, my mom tried to stop him but got shoved by him. He left a bruise on her arm and took the keys and drove while under the influence to the bar. This was the last straw for my older brother, being 23 and all he just up and left, it was heartbreaking to be separated from him.

Me and my sister are left alone with our parents now. Just being in the same household as him has me scared and anxious.

This wasn't my dad's only fuck up, he's cheated on her numerous times, forced my sister when she was in elementary school to sign him up to a dating site, beat me till I've been bruised and had my mom force me to miss school.

A few other fuck ups have been him waking up in the middle of the night, drunk, and wiping his ass smearing shit all over my mom's best friend's jacket. He constantly comes home late and throws up and shits himself.

I've had enough.

My brother plans to get us out of here, he's saved up a bit of money and is currently applying to apartments.

My mom told my dad and my dad agreed that it was for the best and said he doesn't want to be with someone as jealous as her and was already looking for a room anyways. He said he'd leave in 2 days (this was 2 days ago, while he was outside getting shitfaced)

The same 2 days ago my mom was blaming my anxiety and depression and my wanting to see a psychologist on my gf (???), I called her out on it and she found out that my sister was the one who told me (I wasn't home at the time) and went ballistic. She started talking about how I went out and wasted my money with my girlfriend (which isn't true) and how I didn't give her any of it. She then said ""I might as well leave you too"", I put on my clothes and ran out. I intended to just go out for a few, and I did. I came back in less than 30 minutes as a mess, I was crying and could barely breathe. My mom came out and started screaming at me for crying, ""I didn't give you a reason to cry"", she said she might as well get back with my dad because If not I'll walk all over her (she said that me walking out of the house due to her threatening to leave us was me walking all over her).

Now, 

my dad's constantly going into my room (she's been sleeping in our room), and trying to convince her to go sleep with him again. After he returned to his room I tried to convince my mom to go stay over at my aunt's because I didn't want him to persuade her. She didn't want to. It looks like he's making some progress too, which has me furious. 

If she forgives him this easily she'll not only lose my older brother but she'll lose the respect we have for her.

I can't stay here any longer, I want out.

Emancipation is confusing for me.

I live in the Bronx right now.

How can I leave without getting in trouble with the law? Can I leave without getting in trouble with the law?

236,"Because of my state of depression, I'm going to be withdrawing from my university at the end of this quarter. My original plan was to go back home and work until summer when I would start taking classes at my community college. However, recently, I've been thinking about just packing a suitcase, using some of my saved money to buy a plane ticket to idk where, and not telling anyone where I'm going. I would just be gone for 10 weeks max and I fully plan on coming back, and although it's just a random thought, I've been thinking that this may be the only time in my life I get to do this, just disappear for a while. I don't have a job or school to worry about missing, and no relationship holding me down. I'll just leave behind a note saying I'm not missing and that I'll be back. I love my family and my few friends but right now I just want to cleanse and let go of everything.

237,"So, to start off, I am a full time college student. I could have graduated early but decided to stay the extra semester for research experience(which is really sought after in my field). My lab is great and I really enjoy being there, especially since it currently counts as a class for me.

However, I do also have a part time job at school. On the first day of the semester, they kind of blind sided me and told me that I could only work a maximum of 10 hours a week, as opposed to my usual 18. Me being me, I freak out and start job hunting ASAP because I provide for myself and my boyfriend and I had finally felt financially stable enough to get a pup to help with my anxiety. I am really attached and would only give her up if we absolutely cannot provide for her or care for her.

Fast forward a bit and I find another job within a couple of weeks, also part time, but more hours and it’s a long term time commitment because of the nature of the job. However, my first job has also given me a raise that makes me hesitate to leave (~$4 up from what I was making before). So now I am working ~30 hrs or so a week, with school and research on the side. Of course, with graduation only a few months away, I decide to talk to my PI and he tells me that it’s possible for me to stay over the summer and even for the fall in a paid position if funding allows for it. I figure this is a great compromise for me, so that I can get more experience and still finish up at my new job.

One of my bosses from my original job likes to check in on me with my schooling from time to time and she really likes to push grad school (which I have debated but it’s not for me). She pretty much tells me that she thinks that I shouldn’t stay at my second job if it’s not a full time job and that I should focus more on my career and not jeopardize a job in my field to work there. 

I find this extremely frustrating because I know she made the call to cut my hours (funding issues apparently, but I was never given a proper reason why) and I was put in a very difficult position because of that and the new job is such a good atmosphere and it’s helping me be a lot more sociable with people. I just really did not want to live scrounging for money because even with the raise they gave me, it barely pays my rent and utilities for a month and the new job will allow me to save up a bit before I move to a bigger city for a job in my field. I get that she’s looking out for me, but it’s making me overthink my decision and I have debated leaving my original job but the connections and money are a little too hard to pass up.

Am I making a mistake in doing this?? Is it better to jump right into your field as soon as you graduate? ",04Mar2019,1

About 7 months ago, I (27F) found out my twin sister (fraternal) had been spreading false rumors about my boyfriend (28M) of more than 5 years. Rumors so bizarre and bad that she looks like she’s trying to break us up. She even sprinkled in some lies about me. Bf has been an angel to me and all my family including her (everyone adores him), and this would break him if he found out. She knows how serious we are and that we’ll be getting married soon. I confronted her about it, asked her why and to stop, but it fell on deaf ears, she just laughed it off and still hasn’t stopped. She says she’s “entitled to her opinion” which doesn’t make sense because what she says isn’t even true.

She’s made it clear in the past that she won’t have a problem with us becoming estranged in the future and I’m doing everything I can to make sure that doesn’t happen. She’s hot and cold, we have an amazing r/ship when she’s up for it, but all hell breaks loose every time she feels my life is going too well.

245,"THIS IS GONNA BE LONG.
There’s a girl I’ve really gotten to know well, and I want to ask her out, but it’s complicated to say the least.
We’ll call the girl Crush.
There’s another important character in this story; I’ll call him Jay. You’ll hear a lot about him later.

BACKGROUND: 
I’m a 15 yr old freshman in high school, and I’m somewhat quiet and reclusive. I also run cross country and track, which is important later. Idk if this is really so, but I feel like I may have a developed a reputation for asking a lot of girls out. For instance, in 8th grade, I sent notes to a girl’s locker because I though she was really nice and etc blah blah. When she found out it was me during the 8th grade dance, a search party of 10 girls were sent out to hunt me down. Being me, I hid in the bathroom. Eventually, I came out, was found, and was peer pressured by practically everyone at the dance to ask her out. So I did. And she DIDN’T EVEN ANSWER ME. Instead, she walked away, sent a friend to tell me it’s a maybe, then never heard anything about from her again. That is, until next August, when my friend asked her about her thoughts of me, and she said I was creepy because of the notes, which destroyed me. While the notes can be justified as creepy, in my defense, I intentionally did all I could to make the messages light, funny, and NOT CREEPY. Besides, my friend told me what her locker number was. I slipped the notes through the little slits, so it’s not like I knew her combination. All in all, creepy? Well yes, but actually no. 

To make my possible rep more likely, I asked a girl I have only known for a month to homecoming the beginning of 9th grade. Why? Again, peer pressure. Two of my friends, who have heard me talk about her before, set up a group chat for the three of us and basically nagged me that I should ask her until I finally caved in , asked the next day in the weirdest way (I would rather not clarify this; it isn’ t terrible, but it makes me cringe to this day.), and get rejected. On the bright side, she said she couldn’t go because she wasn’t allowed, and otherwise she would say yes. 

Then, at Homecoming Dance night, I heard from my cross country friend that this other girl (who also does xc and track) supposedly had a crush on me, and, well, it sure did make my night. I grew obsessed with finding proof she liked me. She would text me, and I would text a lot back. And I mean A LOT. If she ever liked me, my relentless texting was probably why I drove her away. At one point I sent her something, and after it still said ‘delivered’ a week after I sent it, I grew worried, which led me to a pretty bad screwup.

Enter Crush. Note that at this point of the story, I don’t like her, although we are somewhat good friends. She’s very friendly, always smiles at me in the halls, and is the fastest freshman girl in xc. Whenever I would post a story about running, she would always start a conversation about how fast I was, while I tried to return the compliments to her (she didn’t want to take the compliments; most of the time she would keep talking about how much faster I am than her.) Another thing to know about Crush: a guy (ALSO does xc) asked her to homecoming; apparently they’ve liked each other since 8th grade or something. I figured she didn’t like me since she was dating and she’s just an all-around kind person. Here’s where the screwup happens.

On the second to last day of school before winter break, we were texting and I asked if I could ask her a question, to which she said she said sure. At the time, I was still confident that the girl I heard from homecoming liked me, so I asked her why that girl’s been ignoring me. The conversation as follows went something like this:

“Aw :( sorry to here she’s ignoring her. I’ll ask her if you want”
“That would be great, thanks so much”
“Np. Wait do you like her”
“YES” (I really wish I didn’t put that in caps locks; I only did because I was certain the girl liked me)
“Aw that’s so cute! I don’t really know how she feels about you though..” (This was really concerning to me, since they are really good friends and I figured she might have even mentioned to her about me)
“Well my friend told me that she liked me, he said it seemed really obvious at the homecoming party, so I kind of wanted to get to know her”
Apparently the only reason why I was invited is because she likes me; I’m the only one who went to the other middle school
“I thought she invited you because she though her friend’s date was good friends with you” (This is peculiar because I only kind of knew the guy)
“Oh. Well thanks for listening to me though”
“No problem. You sure got guts for talking about this. Sorry she’s ignoring you.”

I did this right before winter break on purpose; I would be able to escape to vacation at my grandparents’ house. Something seemed off, though. Crush (the girl I had the conversation with above) didn’t text me through the course of the whole break, which was weird and made me anxious because she would usually text me at least twice a week. I began to worry that she talked to her, heard she doesn’t like me, and didn’t have the heart to me the bad news. School rolled along, which I was not looking forward to. When we passed in the halls, instead of her usual smiled, she LOOKED AWAY. This solidified my theory about her not wanting to tell me bad news, but then I began to think about an even worse possiblity. What if I told her about this girl, and turns out it was CRUSH who likes me? Sure, she has a boyfriend, but I never really see them together, even in the same room. If this was true, I might have just fucked up TWO CHANCES with a girl.

The weird behavior from Crush continued. The other girl I thought liked me FINALLY opened that message, FIVE WEEKS AFTER IT WAS SENT. LEFT ON READ. I was confused, then happy, then confused, again, then pissed, then just gave up. We haven’t talked since.

Then one day, Crush texted me. I did a double take on my phone. It was her! We talked about track, which was starting up soon. Apparently, it already started for her, and she was confused why boys’ track hasn’t started yet. This conversation ended up going on for hours, until 10:30 P.M.! It was really great, I felt like we weren’t as awkward anymore. The next day at school, she saw me, and gave me a smile. Seemed like everything was back to normal again, or even a little better than before.

Boy, was I wrong. In a good way.

We had more text conversations. Some common topics we talked about were running, geometry honors (TERRIBLE CLASS), and most of all, the kid who in this story I am referring to as Jay.

Jay is... well, a character if I’ve ever met one. We know him from cross country. We’re not sure if he... has something. He has little common sense, likes to dab a lot, hits up all the xc girls, and says a lot of unusual words. He says “Aguamade” when he’s drinking water, “OYOYOYOYOY” is his battle cry, and his most well known word is “Finland!.” He says it at the end of any run because it sounds like ‘finish.’  In short, he’s a hilarious kid. Jay seems to bother a lot of the upperclassmen because of how different he is, but most of the freshmen love being around him. Jay really means well, and he makes my day. 

More and more nights of the week, I found myself texting her until at least 11:00 P.M. One even lasted until 1:20. We talked about Jay because he’s very easy to converse about. We don’t really make fun of him as much as we talk about how funny, silly, and intelligent he is (sure he doesn’t have much common sense, but he’ literally a walking encyclopedia.) We also began to talk about more personal stuff when I let it slip that a girl had been bullying me (she showed so much concern and didn’t let me change the topic until I clarified, bless her soul) Then we began to argue.

Don’t worry though, our arguments were light and friendly. They are as follows:

Her: Omg you’re so fast it’s mind blowing!
Me: Not as fast as the other guys. Besides YOU are fast too!
Her: No but you’re so much faster

We also debated who Jay’s best friend was. We found out that all three of us had the same lunch hour as Jay. Crush then had the brilliant idea to meet at his lunch table and ask him who his best friend is. So then next day we met at his lunch table. His answer of course was that everyone was his best friend. Crush then said “we should meet at his table every day. It just makes me happy to be here with him,” to which I wholeheartedly agreed. THIS IS A GAME-CHANGER Y’ALL!

We texted more than ever. Nearly every day, I spent most of the lunch hour with her and Jay. Jay’s great because he so easily lightened the mood and always had something to talk about. We still are to this day. My friend’s been trying to convince me to ask her out, but a couple things are holding me back.

1. I’m bad at that shit
2. Idk if she’s still dating (though I did later find out she broke up with him)
3. If she says no, I probably wouldn’t get to spend time with her at lunch anymore.
4. I don’t want to make making my possible rep worse.


I’ve decided that I’ll probably ask her out the last day before Spring Break (March 22). I want to hear from you guys: Do you think she likes me, would it be wise to ask her out? This whole thing has strangely made me kind of sad. When we don’t talk I start missing her but I also think of reasons why she doesn’t like me. I’m usually sad during the weekends anyway, but I want this off my shoulder; however I don’t want things to be awkward between me and Crush. What do you guys think? 

Thanks for tuning in, I appreciate it.

And honestly for those who have seen friends, I think this is like when Joey thought he was in love with Monica but he was actually just hoping for a relationship like monica and chandler. I think I’m kinda the same in that way.

Sorry that this is going to be long.

So first some background info. So my best friend Leslie and I have known each other since the first day of grade nine, when we met there was an instant connection and that connection has lasted for as long as I have known her. For example, when we would hang out with a bunch of people, even when we were all talking in a group, it was like her and I were talking and everyone else was just surrounding us. People always thought we were dating and we basically were, just with extra steps, but she identifies as aromantic/asexual (although she admitted on several occasions that she thinks she has romantic feelings for me). Plus her mom is kinda islamophobic and kinda controlling of her so that wouldn't work anyways. You get the point, Leslie and I were always inseparable, we had all the same interests, etc. Anyways, last year she left my school because she didn't like the teachers or something (although i don't really believe that), and even though she wasn't at my school, we stayed in contact with one another (she changed her number this winter and i was the only one she gave her new one to).

So around January 6th she texted me and asked me if I wanted to hang out later that week or the next (for the first time since she switched schools). We talked a little, it was all cool, but then she completely ghosted me going forwards. I tried to text her a few times before I realized something was off because she hadn't even read my texts. I would have just waited but I have anxiety and OCD so that was basically impossible. I texted her a bunch, at some points apologizing for my apologies, and eventually I couldn't take it anymore and i called her. she didn't pick up when i called with my own number so i hid my number and i instantly got a pick up. I asked her if she blocked me or something and her response was just telling me ""i was just busy"" a few times and literally didn't say anything else. I felt really bad afterwards so I texted a few more times to apologize but still nothing happened. I kept up this pattern of apologizing and trying to contact her until eventually it finally said she read my messages. After that my texts didn't give off a read or delivered message so i figured she blocked me and I gave up.

Something important to note is that we always text with a bunch of messages in a row. We agree that the most efficient way to communicate is by leaving long winded messages to eachother that explain what we are thinking so that we can express everything on our minds and respond on our own time. She has sent me over 15 messages in a row before and vice versa. The problem is that after a while i realized that maybe it was my fault so i tried to fix things with her but i think it just made everything worse


I feel fucking dead inside because she is really the only person I ever liked hanging out with and the only person I ever clicked with like that. Some of my issues make it difficult for me to find someone who I can relate to so I don't think ill ever meet someone like her again that i can connect with. Even if i can, my OCD forces me to get the perfect ending/closure to situations so I cant sleep at night because i feel like im being eaten alive. My marks have dropped from high 90s to mid 80s. Im fucked.

I blame myself for texting her so much (around 25 times in around 1.5 months with no response) and I think I ruined our relationship. Is there anything i can do to fix this?

I gave one of our mutual friends her new number and she responded to him the next day and seemed ""cool"".

Was it my fault? if not, what do you guys think? Why did this happen? What should I do going forward?

Also, sorry that a lot of that info was kinda irrelevant but i felt full context would help.

TLDR: My best friend of several years asked me to hang out, I texted her around 25 times over the course of a month because she wasn't responding and then she blocked me. Was it my fault?",04Mar2019,1
250,"He knows i feel this way and has tried to assure me she doesn't and she says she doesn't.

(my boyfriend is a very heavy sleeper) I tried prying her off of him but it wasn't possible so I turned over and just cried and slept.

251,"This is kinda weird, but whatever.

Anyway, I'm a teenaged female. I'm bisexual, it's not a secret but I'm not shouting it from the roof-tops. We have assigned seats in AP History and I started to sit by this girl.

We quickly got along due to a shared love of art, games, and opinions. She was very accepting of me, and openly discusses LGBT stuff. Soon, we talked a bit outside of class but it's not too strong of a bond. I really like this girl, and I was close to confessing.

Unfortunately, she's straight, but she said she kinda wants to figure things out, so she isn't 100% sure. I really want to confess, I never have the confidence usually but something makes me sure about her. But we're also in school, so things are confusing and I wouldn't want to confess if she's in the middle of questioning or whatever. ",04Mar2019,1
252,"So in high school I had a close circle of friends who I thought of as my brothers. We hung out, talked girls, gave advice, got into drugs and alcohol together, the works. But then towards the end of senior year I noticed they all stopped liking me. They seemed awkwardly quiet whenever I joined a group conversation and began not inviting me to events. At first it was just sleepovers and movies, small stuff on the weekend. But then I noticed that they went from not liking me to outright disliking me. They started to mock me behind my back (I know because one of them would tell me the others' jokes as my informant) and even began mocking me to my face. And then they began excluding me from big events, group travel trips, big birthday parties, etc. 

Finally the straw that broke the camel's back was prom night. They completely excluded me from the post-prom party while inviting literally everyone and anyone else. This was after I had asked each of them separately what we were doing after prom, and each and every one of them lied to my face and said they had no plans for after prom and still needed to make plans. After that something changed. I didn't think of them as my friends anymore; that was such a huge thing to do. Prom seemed like a huge milestone in our lives, and they didn't want me there. 

Anyway we graduated (they didn't include me in their post-grad photos or celebrations on grad night) and they invited me to some grad parties. However I knew that the only reason I was invited was because their parents expected me to be invited; no one actually wanted me there. So I stopped going to things, stopped going to events in general, and eventually stopped talking to them.  In fact I hadn't heard from them in three years, some of them in five. 

Recently however they have started wanting to reconnect, and multiple members of our friend group asked me specifically to go to a get-together. At the get-together they asked me why I had cut them off, and why I had stopped talking to them and hanging out. I told them that it was them who stopped hanging out with me and talking to me, and that I stopped talking to them because I figured they didn't want to talk to me. HERE'S WHAT GETS ME. Their defense was ""that was just high school man."" 

Now I agree we all change after high school and mature. I know I matured, as I used to be a little devil. However what they did in high school does not seem excusable to me as just ""high school immaturity."" They mocked me, excluded me, treated me like crap, and humiliated me. It's because of them I have anxiety issues. I don't want to forgive them, but part of me is wondering if their right, that it was just forgiveable high school immaturity. ""That was \[just\] high school man.""

254,"My life has always been depressing. Ever since I was a little kid, my mom was on drugs and I grew up in an alcoholic foster home far away and they treated me like an outcast. In my late teens I became socially anxious and then I started drinking. I made wrong friends in that time who I no longer know today. And the only thing that stoped me was when I met a guy and became pregnant at 18. I lived with him and now our son is 3 years old. His dad/my boyfriend and I had a very difficult heartbreaking relationship.. we were completely opposite from each other and there was times we broke up and he was with another girl which truly made an impact on me. I always been insecure but after that I became even more insecure. But we got back together, which almost felt like we had to rather than chose to.. it’s all a longer story but overall, I just feel very depressed lately. I had such a tough few years I don’t even feel normal anymore. I feel extremely unloveable and worthless. I know my precious little son loves me, and I deeply love him too. He’s the only one keeping me going. But it doesn’t fill the emptiness in me and I wish it did. I feel like my depression is ruining me and pushing everyone away. I’m scared I’m failing my little boy by being depressed, even if I’m hiding it from him. 
But I am happy sometimes, and sometimes it’s a lot of the time. Sometimes I feel fine for days which has only been since my sons dad and I got back together.. but all it takes is for me to remember to fall back into a slump. 
I’ve also been very obsessive lately. I find myself obsessing over girls he’s been with (like that girl he dated after me) and even girls who he had crushes on or was attracted to. I constantly look them up and try to “study” them.. I look at how their facial features are and how their body is and how I could achieve this.. i obsess about my body and how I could be skinny like them.. but they’re so lean and tall and I’m so petite it feels impossible sometimes and it makes me hate myself. I even secretly spent a couple hundreds of dollars on make up and clothes the other day so that maybe he’d find me more attractive. I started cutting my food intake down and tried working out a few times of the week. I obsess over my imperfections but sometimes I feel like it’s impossible to change them. I want to be skinny so badly.. because I can see he’s into those really lean girls. 
I often think back to the bad times we had together and the things he did behind my back and it stresses me out.. this family is all I have and i don’t feel good enough for anyone. 
I thought about medications for my depression. But I’m scared of meds.. I’m scared they’ll make me gain weight. I’m scared they’ll change me forever. I’m scared they won’t work. And sometimes I don’t think i have depression because I think anyone would be sad in my situation I have been in my whole life. I have felt happy and I know I’d be happy if everyone didn’t fuck me over so much in life. I’m scared of meds and I just don’t want to take them. I just want to be actually happy. I also heard of magic mushrooms being able to help out people with depression and anxiety and have been interested, but have also been scared to take them as I’m worried because my brother and uncle have schizophrenia and my dad is insane but I don’t know why. And I heard that magic mushrooms could make someone go schizophrenic/psychotic.. but that could be wrong and my half brother and uncles mental healthy may not be inherited as they were the type to do a bunch of drugs at a early age. 

I’m just very lost and scared and need advice. I need help so I could start living my life. 
I can’t afford therapy so please don’t suggest that.
I also do a lot of artwork (and I sell it for sort of a living) 
I live in Canada where it’s winter right now and so I just started taking vitamin D3 cause i heard it can help with depression 
If anyone knows a lot about magic mushrooms and if they’re safe for me let me know!

258,"Well, it’s cool this is a sub reddit.

Alright, my birthday is on the 7th this month and I feel horrible about it, I actually dread it. I want it to come and go and have it be like any other day of the year 

Some background: I’m a military brat who has moved 9 times, 4 times for the past 4 years of high school (a different high school each grade) and because of this I feel, over the years I just starting getting uncomfortable with my birthdays and anything involved with them. I don’t feel joy or look forward to getting attention, even from my personal friends I have met and stuck along with over the years and countries and places I’ve travelled too.

I moved back to the U.S after a last summer, this time from South East Asia. I grew up mostly in Europe and only briefly spent time in the U.S during my elementary and middle school years. 

That being said, I have already done and had my fair share of doing what Americans can do when they turn 21. Drink freely, party, go clubbing, etc. And from what I heard you are only legally a adult when you turn 18 in the U.S. It doesn’t quite interest me that I can vote here or be charged as adult or can make my own legal decisions. In fact, I looked at the U.S weirdly for having those rules and outlook, but to each their own. 

I’m an American kid who grew up outside of their home country, so I don’t feel as if I’m an American myself. My Dad is in the U.S army and had a U.S. childhood, so he keeps egging on that I can vote, and he’s proud of that.. but I’m not as invested in American government or politics as one would be growing up here..? (No offence to anyone, I just feel I don’t/shouldn’t have a say in a place I’m foreign too) so it’s not exciting to me for that right to be given to me when I don’t intend on using it. My Mom likes to keep specifying that because I’m going to be a adult doesn’t mean I can go do exactly whatever, which is understandable, decency and all that biz.

My gifts were ruined because I heard my Mom talk on the phone, and I feel horrible saying this but- I am disappointed in them. Sounds like I’m spoiled, right? They somehow got my girlfriend to come down to visit me for my birthday which I’m most excited for. But because of the other things that I’m getting, I know they will get me frustrated and just ruin it for everyone else. My grandmother is coming and I know I have to fake my happiness with her gift, she’s giving me the car my parents borrowed from her to let me use for the past 8 months. I am not interested in owning that car or investing in it (2005 Toyota Matrix) and they are getting a touch screen installed since I like listening to my own music. The radio I don’t mind, but I would prefer it separated for another car. 

And to top that of, Money. 

We had a argument last month about my birthday and told them how I feel and how I truly didn’t want anything, but yet here we are with this post. I don’t feel as if they are listening to me or respecting my opinions or thoughts on the matter, they don’t get what moving does four years straight while in High School, prime time for character growth. 

I mostly needed to vent about this, but tell me your thoughts on it. Am I making sense for thinking and feeling this way? Or am I just being a moody emotional teenager or “young adult”

261,"well, ya read the title. 

so a little insight on this, i have a very small friend group. it’s 4 of us mainly but 6 of us now. one of the girls in our group (let’s call her J) and her sister (we’ll call her K) and I have all been friends for a really long time. now K is in the same grade as me and J is a grade above (a senior). K is friends with someone who’s now in our friend group (this one is N, he is in the same grade as me and K). 

Now N and K have been friends for a few years now and me and N haven’t been friends for longer than 6 months maybe. we weren’t really close at first but when i first met him i realized i had a thing for him, but at the time he was going through shit with his ex girlfriend still so i decided not to pursue it at the moment. 

One day J and i are at lunch and she goes “N is really hot” and i was like yea he is???? and then she goes on about how they’ve been talking a lot and she really likes him so ya know i was kinda sad about it considering i had liked him for at least a month or 2 now (this is now late november or beginning of december 2018)

basically the two start dating beginning of january i believe. me and N started getting a lot closer at this point, we went from having a streak on snapchat to talking daily, to hanging out during lunch, to just always being around each other basically and everyone saw it as that we’re just really close now since he’s dating my best friend. 

i thought we were just getting closer but what i didn’t realize was that i was slowly falling in love with him.

about 3 weeks ago, him and my friend broke up. about a week ago i confessed i liked him and have liked him for a long time now. 

a few days ago he told me he liked me as well but wouldn’t pursue anything since his ex is my best friend and it would create problems. 

do you guys think he’s right or do you think that it doesn’t matter whether or not him and my friend dated (considering they barely dated a month).

264,"So to start this, I need to explain a few things. I can't go into too much detail because I know that my friend uses reddit also. We're both guys, we're both sophomores in high school and have been very close friends for many years. I'm going to just call my friend John for the remainder of this whole thing. 

So the story goes thus. John and I were hanging out for a get together. Usually there are more of our mutual friends there, but recently John's and my own interests have changed from theirs, and not to sound like an ass, but we've matured slightly more than them too (at least I thought we had. The wisdom of hindsight really messes with you). John and I enjoy our company together and there's a lot of close trust between us.

We had just finished a movie when John gets up to go get us some drinks. When he gets back, I joke about him taking some vodka from his parents cabinet, and he confessed that he actually, in fact, had. It wasn't just pure vodka that he was drinking, it was mixed along with some mountain dew or Sprite or something. He offered me a drink, which I refused, drinking some of the (insert soda here) straight from the can. John confessed to me that he had been drinking for a little while, but didn't tell me how often he had been drinking. 

That evening he got really drunk, which is what started this concern. He ended up texting his gf, and generally was very slurred in his speech. I tried my best to just kind of laugh it off, and tried to convince him that maybe he should stop for the night. After around 4AM or so, john finally fell asleep. I sat down for at least another 30 min trying to comprehend what had happened, I ended up cleaning out the cup that he had used (in case someone checked it? Idk how that works, I was just really paranoid about his parents finding out.)

The next morning he said that he really appreciated me and how I was cool with it and didnt tell his parents about it. He also told me that he realized that he should stop and I smiled and told him that if he ever needed to rant about anything, I'd always be there for him. After that, it was a slightly awkward breakfast until my dad picked me up. I considered telling my dad about it, but just said that we had a fun night playing games and watching movies. It felt like such a breach of trust to say something to my dad about it.

Honestly this has been more of a rant that anything else, but it really started to concern me because he admitted to doing it again, this time getting into a discord call with like 5 other guys and talking (apparently, according to them it was very obvious that he was drunk.)

tldr: my friend and I had a get together, he got drunk. Awkward 'bonding moment'. He got drunk again, but with more people present. We are both sophomores.

Honestly any advice would be greatly appreciated,  I dont know if I should confront him, tell his parents, or what. Thanks.

269,"First of all, English isn't my first language, so I apologize for any errors in grammar or spelling. This is VERY packed and VERY personal, but honestly, I'm just looking for answers.  


I am 15 years old(soon-to-be-16 in May), currently in high-school, and I've hated going to school with a burning passion. Ever since elementary school, my grades have steadily dropped year by year. I've gone to summer school three years in a row, but got lucky these past two years. My mom has never liked my academic performance, but she's not a really disciplinary parent and has never punished me for it, which I think is a little bit of a bad thing. She wants nothing else from me but to do my work and graduate. She spoils me with Subway occasionally, gets me what I want 60% of the time, and takes care of me somewhat decently. That is, until it comes to talking about my education.

  
To take a step back, last year November she apparently got a boyfriend. Me being the antisocial teenager with a sudden change in routine in his life, didn't like that very much. I consider him my step-dad, unofficially. The month after that following into January, I found out that my mom is losing her job. Which meant she couldn't pay the mortgage for our huge ass house, which we no longer live in and need to sell. Her boyfriend let us stay with him for the time-being, but he lived 4 hours away from where we did. Which meant I had to change schools... and this is where the fun starts.  
I could no longer tolerate the stress after moving once AGAIN(My mom and I moved from somewhere else in August previously), since I am a hardcore routine person. If you fuck up my routine you make me go nuts, basically. So I stopped going to school. This is where my social anxiety started to spike and so did my fear of people. And as you know, school is full of people. (I have more mental health issues, but would rather not get into them.)

My mom *tried* getting me to go to school one day in early February, but that failed COMPLETELY. I started saying I felt nauseous from the anxiety, and she just told me to ""get over it."" So I tried, to no avail. She was walking me to the bus stop where I had to take the bus, and I absolutely hated that mass of kids at that stop. Long story short, what followed was a bunch of crying, wailing, and fighting to get me back inside the house at 5 in the fucking morning. My stepdad woke up, my mom overreacted, and after that she no longer forced me to go to school, in fear that I would retaliate again, as she told me herself. She was right, I would. So I ended up staying cooped up in this dump of a house for a month, and it's still going on.

After the whole incident, I'm seeing a therapist, and in the process of being put on hospital home-bound. Basically homeschooling for those with issues going to physical school.  Thing is, my mom doesn't want this. She's been going rabid recently about how ""you cant stay homeschooled forever"" and ""you need to go to physical school otherwise you wont talk to anyone ever again."" Even my stepdad chimed in about this. He's gone with the whole ""my house, my rules"" and says if I dont go to school I'll get my PC and phone taken away. Goodie. Forget about my mental health, I guess.

To cut to the chase, I know it's just going to some dumb school. I've dealt with moving schools and it'll be better for me, making friends and whatnot. But with all these mental health issues in the way, as well as my progressively worsening grades, which are all F's from before I started staying at home, I'm not sure what to do.

Do I take my parent's word and risk getting some kind of awful punishment, or do I do my own thing?

TL;DR: Don't want to attend physical school, instead want to be homeschooled or get a GED. Parents disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, everything is fine, I guess my eyes just get red easier, and more often when I don't use the drops. 

 I want to ween off of them, or stop using them altogether but they make my eyes so purty. I might be addicted to them.

281,"So I am 22 and have never been in a relationship.

I have had plenty of female friends, and in most situations have zero problems talking to girls, and I have a close female friend or two.  

I really hadn't thought about the fact that I hadn't been in a relationship until recently, when both my parents, and their significant others have made comments about it. I don't consider myself bad looking, maybe fairly baby-faced for my age, but definitely not repulsive. I have even had numerous people call me handsome, both guys and girls. Not overweight or anything, but I maybe would like to work out, but I have other issues to tackle first, like getting a job and fixing my sleep schedule. 

I even overheard my mom and her boyfriend talking one day and specifically heard him say, ""how is your son still single?"". I don't know why, but this has sat in the back of my mind, and only really bothers me when I drink a bit and then get anxious.  Then this whole situation hits me like a ton of bricks and then and only then it bothers me. I should add that the only reason I am writing this now is that I am a few drinks in and need to get my thoughts out. I should also add that I drink fewer than 10 times per year. I do not have any problems with alcohol abuse. I have abused marijuana, but am currently off of it (7ish weeks, stopped counting really), trying to find a good job, and do not plan on going back to it, as my life is much better without it. 

I can talk to new people if I really click with them (which is a stupid thing to say I guess, cause I guess anyone can). If the game was making friends, I've got no problems there. I even am surprised people want to be my friend as I don't feel like I am contributing much to a friendship, but other people tell me otherwise.

 I don't go out a whole lot, as I live in a small town, and the idea of going out to bars is foreign to me, and feels completely out of my comfort zone, and I wouldn't know what to do unless I was with a group of people.   

Just to spew more thoughts cause, y'know, fairly drunk right now. 

I don't really get how to flirt in most situations I guess. I've talked to girls before and it seemed effortless to me, but I could never take it further than the initial conversation. Sometimes I feel too self aware and feel like an asshole even when I am not necessarily being one, and that leads me to cut things off early with people/ not follow up with them. I don't know how to overcome this. 

I guess i could talk to my close female friends and see how I could improve myself, and that is an okay first step. 

I don't know, I just feel lost. I'm really not an anxious person, but sometimes it just hits me and I don't understand it all. I have a lot of self doubt, and I just don't know how to get over it.

I feel stupid for even writing this all out. I appreciate anyone who read all of this and can lend me any advice. I guess this is more fitting for r/offmychest, but whatever, I'll take what I can get at this point.  ",04Mar2019,2
282,"Hey there. 

So, I’m in the midst of a situation that’s new to me. My mental health has always been a struggle, but I’ve never had an issue getting to class — until this semester. 

I have a particular class that’s been difficult for me to go to. My anxiety goes haywire. I get incredibly nervous, and it’s made things very difficult! It began as sporadic skipping, but I am now at the point that I have missed 6 classes in a row. 

This is not an issue in terms of content. I read all the assignments. I do all the homework. For the class I’ve been there, my grades are good. 

But that’s not going to stay that way. I have an upcoming test and I don’t know how to bring myself to go to class to take it. 

I’m eating myself alive. I panic about going; I panic about the consequences if I don’t go. 

The point is, I’m sincerely worried about my grades. I want to succeed and do well. I am not lazy and I don’t want to be construed as someone who doesn’t care, because this is *driving me insane*.

What can I do?

How do I even talk to my professor, especially when I don’t feel comfortable around him? Is there even anything I can do?",04Mar2019,1

A little backstory,at the moment i go to a nice 4 year college,the campus is pretty,and the people are decent too. My delmemia lies in the fact i feel beyond homesick and i can't get a job nor decent housing. Back home we have a nice 4 year college thats alot cheaper than my school now and they have a apartments for dorms. The perk of moving back home is i would have a car(i have really old car i didnt not feel comfortable driving the 3 hours from home and paying for it), i would for sure have a job whether its a paralegal or working at a restaurant,i have some community connections and ill be closer to home(less than 10 mintues from my own house). The downfall of going back home is the fact i havd to face people and tell them i stayed in my home town after being so happy to leave and i would have to leave some friends i just made this semester. I know its not the most dire decision but i need a little direction.

290,"I just got accepted into two universities and I'm super excited. I've been telling myself for the past year that I'm going to major in Psychology so I can get into forensics or something in the criminal justice field. I've been telling myself that it would be so cool to become a criminologist but suddenly I don't even know what I want to do.  I spent an hour just researching the jobs I could get with the degree I might pursue, and some of the requirements for them are pretty high or the salary isn't much. My parents are convinced that I've watched too many true-crime shows and am making the wrong decision. They're constantly asking me if I'm sure and keep trying to pressure me into going into medicine when I have no interest in it whatsoever. My twin sister gave into that idea and my choice not to has been driving my mother up the wall. My parents, more specifically my mom, only care about the salary I can get with with the different jobs from my degree. I keep telling myself that the money won't matter as long as I'm happy but I'm starting to doubt that idea a little.
I haven't expressed this doubt to my parents because that would be admitting to them that I was wrong. And, I may be a bit extreme in saying this but I'd sooner shoot myself in the foot than force myself to go into the medical field. 
Maybe I'm worrying too much or maybe I did watch one to many crime shows but I'm scared for the future. I'm only 17 years old. I can barely decide what clothes I'm going to wear tomorrow, so how am I suppose to to confidently make a life long decision? I really love the idea of going into the criminal justice/psychology field but I'm scared that it'll be the wrong choice in the long run. I would love to just say ""fuck it"" and go with the flow of things but I can't do that without being hit with extreme anxiety.
Should I take a more practical look on things and reconsider my choice? I don't want to regret my choice in the long run but I want to pursue something that I love. Please let me know what you think.",04Mar2019,3

What's weird is that I know I wouldn't last a day if I ever did join. I know for a fact that I would literally hate every second of it, but yet I can't seem to shake the desire to want to join. I feel it quite often, and even more so when watching military movies. Why would I want to join if I know I would hate it?

293,"Hello, reddit. 

Firstly, I got permission from my friend to ask this; she doesn't want to ask this herself, so I'm doing it for her. 

I'll try to provide context in the most basic way possible, and then I'll provide further information for each issue. 

First off, she's a minor/underage. The dude's at least 8 years older than her. She wanted to be ""just friends"" with this guy, but he later on wanted to have ""benefits"" with her as well.

The thing is, she doesn't like him at all, but he ended having a lot of feelings for her. So, he decided to ask her father if he could live in with her, and to my surprise, her father agreed. Her father agreed because the dude offered him money every month (kind of like rental payments); her family isn't at all financially stable.

All of this happened without her knowing, and she also didn't have any power in this either despite her wanting this to not happen in the first place.  

The two of them had sex, which at first was consensual, but later on, she started to feel doubtful of him. Why? Because he was taking pictures with his phone of them having sex, and also recorded her using a camera without her knowing.

Later, she found out about what he had done, and threatened to report him to the police. However, all he said was ""Okay, well, do what you want""; she ended up not doing anything because 1. she didn't want to go through all of the legal process, and 2. she was afraid of him and what he might end up doing to her. 

As a side note, the dude doesn't believe that she would threaten him to the police, so he's just going to do his thing... Right now, she wants him out of her life, but with him paying his father to live with her, and that she doesn't want to exactly ruin his life by reporting him to the police ... 

What should she do?  He has had sexual relationships with many other underage girls; his last ""girlfriend"" was 17. (according to my friend).

The dude has a bright future ahead of him; he's a f\*cking doctor.

I have a loving and supportive family, plenty of friends, money, a nice car, and a good job, and house on the river. It's all anyone could ask for.

I came to know that Y1 was a premature baby. She was born after 8 and a half month of her term. A caesarean child. She is currently 2years and 4 months and all she can say is ""aa ee oo"". She still drinks milk from the bottle, doesnt eat solid food at all. Once I gave her some steamed rice, and she literally started picking up one grain of rice at a time. When I feed her a little more, she starts crying and throws a tantrum. 

I have my own share of nephews and nieces. Though they are not premature babies. My sister is a nurse and she told me 8 and a half month is considered normal, and not as a premature. When I asked them about their kid's eating habits, their speech development etc, most of their answers were - speech around 10-11months ( usually papa and mama, basic words ), solid food at 1yr, potty training at 1yr.

I told my boyfriend once that Y1 might be a special kid because of her late speech development. I feel like at 2yrs she should at least say ""mama and papa"", and not ""aa ee oo"". I told him she should be taken to a hospital and check herself up. He got really offended. 

I'm just concerned whether it's normal for ""premature"" kids or even kids to have such slow speech development. How do I tell his sister how I feel without hurting her feelings?

307,"Hey Reddit, 

I help manage a small (under 10 people) co-working space. 

I’ve been here with the main people for over 3 years and I’m in charge of intake if a spot comes up. The space is open plan, and most of us are in similar creative fields so theres a bit of crossover if anyone needs help/ to borrow a tool. It’s common knowledge that we dont go into/use tools from spaces that are ‘closed’ for the day, and we NEVER use materials belonging to others without explicit permission every time. (Things like printing, adhesive, paper, art supplies) 

The issue: 

I allowed a family friend to move in to a small spot in the space, we’ve not had that much contact as adults until now. 

- He’s become really clingy, messaging me all the time about stuff in the space at non business hours. 
- He also has a tendency to go into and look through the other spaces owned by other people (the whole space is open plan and its just common knowledge that you dont go into other peoples spaces when they’re not in) 
- He also constantly asks to use my tools and materials, as well as my phone charger while I’m using it ‘When can I use your  charger my phone is out’ and refuses to buy one of his own. He walks into my space and rummages around before even asking if he can use what he wants. 
- He stands around me while I work, even though my behaviour is shut off and focused, and says things like ‘Oh ignore me I’m just observing’ and stretches himself so he can look at my computer screen. 
- He genuinely gives me the creeps as an adult male (I’m a female in my mid 20’s) 
- He leaves really late, like 10-11pm late, meaning I now feel uncomfortable staying late (which I’ve done for the last 3 years) because I dont want to be alone with him &amp; I need the quiet, empty space to record in (which the others know and i’ve also told him) I just end up trying to outlast him but he just loiters around 

He’s been here less than a month and already behaving this way. 

I really regret giving him the space/allowing him to get closer to me as friends, but our families still being in contact means I dont want to be a dick about it and just boot him out. 

What do I do?

308,"My husband and I (28 &amp; 26) recently received custody of his teenage brother (15). I am a parent to two boys (6 &amp; 2) but have no experience being responsible for a teenager. Coming from having no rules/responsibilities to having a set of chores, rules, and expectations, I feel has caused my brother in law to have some resentment towards me. I say me because for the most part, I am the rule setter in this home. My husband is much more lenient and it balances perfectly with our children, but when it comes to his brother, it seems like it is much harder for him to give me my place when it comes to parenting him because we are not actually his parents. We have had a few hiccups down the road and with him starting high school next year, I want to gain his trust and build a healthy relationship. ",04Mar2019,1

312,"My 3 nieces and nephew were removed from my sister and brother-in-law's home in June of 2018. Ages 10, 8, 3, and 1. They were placed with our parents first but with both of them working full time, and being older, they found it a little too difficult to take care of the kids the way they needed. After this decision, the kids were placed with my uncle who stays at home because he's technically ""disabled"" due to back issues. His two brothers have lived with him for well over a decade but they are felons. DCS told my uncle that he had to leave if the kids were going to be there because they could not be around anybody with a felony background. The two men were caught still living at my Uncle's numerous times before the kids were removed from his home as well. (Yes, I know the kids should have been put first in this situation, but unfortunately they were not.) Last resort, before Foster Care was myself and my wife. I'm 25 and she's 21. We also have a 3 year old of our own. We took the kids, of course, but it was kind of a spur of the moment.. we didn't have time to think about it or talk it over as a couple because everyone just started calling us, begging us to go get the kids from the DCS office. We are now seeing that 5 kids for us is way too much to handle.. Financially and mentally. We know we can get help financially so long as we get our Foster licenses. The case worker told us it could take anywhere from 6 months to a year to obtain this. By this time, we will be financially drained. Not to mention, we were in the process of buying a house when all of this happened, and we close on it at the end of this month. The stress has been so overwhelming. We know we can afford maybe 1 extra kid at this time.. but not all 4. We just know from a realistic stand point.. we'll drown ourselves if we take on this responsibility but there's so much pressure from our family to keep them. We contemplated keeping the two older ones and letting somebody foster the 2 babies since they're so young... but still are unsure if we can afford the two older ones along with our baby. Then I even contemplated just keeping the oldest because we can for sure take care of 1... But the guilt of sending the rest to foster care except 1 seems unfair.. I'm just not sure what to do.. Any advice would be helpful. I just feel at this point that there just is no right answer/decision at this point..",04Mar2019,1
313,"So I started interning at my cousin's husband's company. My other cousin is also one of the co-founders. I contacted them about finding work/gaining experience after graduating from college and I was only supposed to intern for a month. For some reason, I stupidly told him at the end of my internship that I want to start a proper position because I have done 3 internships already. I brought this up because he was talking about my responsibilities earlier that day as if I was going to be there for a long time. He then offered me a job as an executive but then he told me the next day it might be too difficult for now, so I should start as his assistant. I agreed, (again, period-brain plus anxiety caused me to give a quick answer) however the pay is about half than what is expected for someone with my degree and especially being a repat. Now I'm rethinking the job and I have to decide soon because he is planning to make me sign a contract. Would it be an asshole move to reject the offer?

315,"My cousin is sort of a spoiled brat. His parents give him anything he wants and now he's been demanding that they get him a new dog, despite the fact that he already has two living with him at home. He lives in a small house and the two dogs are confined to the small kitchen and aren't allowed to roam around the house freely. He only owns one of the dogs and the second belongs to his aunt but both dogs seem depressed. His own dog has been deemed the nickname ""depresso doggo"" by younger cousins because of how lethargic he is for his age. His dog is only 5 or 6 yrs old and only sleeps, doesn't have toys, and is shouted at for barking a little. This behavior is such a strong contrast to my old dog who lived to 12 years and was always playful and hyper.
 His poor dog is only allowed to stay in the small kitchen area and my cousin is demanding from his parents that they get him a German Shepard puppy. He leaves for university in one year so I asked him what the point of getting a dog was if he was gonna leave in one year. He just shrugged when I asked him and said he would take the dog with him. This made my blood boil because he would basically be replacing his other dog with a new one. I told him it was a bad idea and that he'd be swamped with school work and would want to go out with friends all the time and he'd probably wouldn't have enough time to give the proper amount of attention to a puppy. I love dogs and desperately want to protect them from his idiocy but I don't know how to change his mind. His parents hate dogs and I don't understand why they're getting him another one when he barely pays attention to the one he already has. I want to spare his dog of being neglected and replaced and save this new one the chance of having a terrible owner who'd only want to show him off.

317,"First off, sorry if this kind of post isn’t allowed in this sub. 

I was raised in a religious family where sexuality of any kind out of marriage was wrong. I learned about masturbation fairly early, at maybe 10 or 11. I got an iPod Touch for my birthday when I was 13 and started watching porn on it. I used porn almost every day throughout my teen years but usually didn’t use it more than once.  I’m 21 years old now.

Recently though I’ve been using it like 4-5 times a day some days and don’t know how to stop. I know I’m having negative side effects from it. I have lower self esteem and self confidence and I’m isolating myself more, but when the urge to watch it pops in my mind I can’t help myself it seems like. Sometimes I’m not even horny but just start watching it cuz I’m bored or something. 

I really want to stop because I know all the negative health effects of it but need some help/support. ",04Mar2019,6
318,"I work in customer service. I was recently flagged and given a written warning for not doing the proper task. (Customer service has emails/phone/chats.) (Like Amazon customer service) I've been mostly doing emails because we were backlogged to ~4-5 thousand emails (we are a pretty big company). I wasn't told to perform any other tasks, I was also not trained on the phone either.


Today was the next shift I had after the warning and boy I am starting to feel the micro-management. I went to the bathroom for 10 mins and when I got back to my desk, a ""support expert"" was there asking where I went because I was not answering calls for the passed 10 mins. (If you need to go somewhere you will set yourself to ""away"" or ""do not disturb"" status so you won't get any calls. Which I did.) [Here are the ranks](https://i.imgur.com/tC5MUHZ.png) 


I said that I was in the bathroom, and he didn't believe me. It seems like after the one warning everyone in the higher positions are looking and waiting for me to fuck up so they can fire me.


Later tonight, the ""lead support"" pulled me into a meeting and wanted to ""set expectations"" for time management.


I have mild/severe anxiety problems and can't be harassed or be worrying about the small little mistakes I make whenever I'm on shift. This will stop me from doing my job. 


Remember this was just one day after the warning, and I can feel myself being dragged down and feeling unwell because of it.


Is there anyway for me to have them stop this treatment? If I contact HR I'm worried they will believe the upper management and tell me to fuck off or fire me.

She found out that he had a gf and stopped talking to him, unfollowed him on snap, and insta, but sometimes she has someone look at his account to see how he is doing (and i told her to not ask the person to do so anymore).  It's been only 5 months (yea not too long) since she stopped talking to him but she cant stop thinking about him at all. I just really want to help her get over him especially because he is a minor and she understands that but she's really tried finding other distraction and keeping her self busy, finding new hobbies, but she still can't get over him.

322,"For context I’ve(27/f) been married 7 years to my awesome husband (28/m). Recently we purchased a 5 acre property and are currently building a house for my in-laws on part of it. 
The reason we did it was because although they’re not necessarily old they do have a lot of health problems, they lived far from us so it was hard to help them out. Also my husbands older brother has made it clear he is not interested in taking them on as they get older. They are overall very nice and generous people, but as this building process has been going I’ve seen a selfish side to them. For starters they were supposed to purchase the land from us, and we were going to use that money towards our own house. But they decided to add way more to their house than they said they would and have gone so far over budget that we won’t be able to do anything to our house now. Which is leaving me bitter. They also can be overbearing. They’ve walked into our house to “use our bathroom” when we weren’t home when they were here to look at the job site. But I know they are hanging out when they come in. And although it may seem harmless I’m sort of freaking out. When they’re here looking at the project they’ll see me coming out of my house and want to talk. And they talk for a loooooong time. I’ve literally left mid sentence without a word before because they disregarded my comment about not being able to talk and having to leave. They’re suppose to be moving onto the property in about 3 weeks and I really want a family meeting to lay down the law with them. 
I can see them creeping into our business and lives way too much now and they haven’t even moved in yet. Does anyone possibly have any advice out there about how to be stern but still kind with them? I feel like if I don’t get my space and respect I’m going to lose it and it’ll make this whole moving near each other thing awkward af. 

Edit *They’ve also already pissed off one of our neighbors because they went into their yard and started tapping THEIR maple trees for syrup. It all seems trivial when written down, but they have no sense for anyone else or their personal space and it’s pissing me off to no end. ",04Mar2019,2
323,"Backstory: There is this couple who joined my group of friends ~3 years ago and ever since I've been seeing them regularly. We play board games, video games, watch movies, and regular friend stuff. At first I didn't think much of her, she was pretty, but it wasn't a love a first sight moment. I tried my best to include her as much as possible because a female presence would do good in a group of nerdy men.

Fast forward ~2 years, By this time though, we're pretty close. We do stuff just the two of us time to time, without the group. A pretty big stepping stone for me. So I start developing a crush on her. I think, sure this makes sense, she's a beautiful woman who shares my interests and we get along well.

However, it has gotten in the way of a few relationships I've had. I found myself often comparing my girlfriends to her, and they would come up short. When I'd spend time with whatever girlfriend I had at the time, I'd rather be spending it with my friend. I knew it was bad then, but now it's terrible. I now think of her constantly and whenever I see her with her husband I get angry to the point I have to leave whatever we were doing. I'm starting to grow more and more frustrated and confused.

I know that I could NEVER be with her, for multiple obvious reasons, but no amount of logic I throw at this problem seems to solve it. It's been torturing me for a year now and I'm at the end of my ropes. The only solution I could think of is to just simply ghost the two of them the best I can(which would be pretty hard seeing as we have the same friends), but this would be completely unfair to the two of them. Why should they lose a friend because I couldn't get my shit together.

You see, my mom recently became the type of person that screams to me incoherently about... something, still not sure what, and then, right after, asks me for a favor in the most chill way possible. The type of person that tells me ***she wants to chuck mY*** ***SICK BABY BROTHER AT THE WALL. YES. THAT WAS A THING.*** She straight up ***ABANDONS HIM in an empty room with nothing but a TV and a hammock for entertainment. Sometimes she doesn't feed him lunch because she's busy working.

S***traight up, main reason I wanna leave, is  I want to take him with me. She also blamed me because my dad beat me till' I was filled with bruises and threatened both of us then put us in a near empty room for a hour or so. Speak of the devil:

Ah, yes. My father. The man I despise the most. The day after he beat me, he checked on the bruises and ***he laughed. He laughed after seeing my bruises. He called us ""dramatic"".*** Why did he beat me, you ask? Simple. **We were having an argument, and as he was carrying a fan along with my brother he nearly fell, and I, looking at the computer didn't**       

**notice.** Oh, no, no, no, no. **I'm the dramatic one.** He's done (arguably ""better"" yet somehow) more traumatic things, but I don't feel like talking about it. Cutting it short, he's a judgemental arse with a porn addiction *and he might be trying to rape me*. Yay for me.

So me and someone I was best friends with for about a year, I’ll call him Todd, got into a fight. This fight happened about 5 - 6 weeks ago. I was the only one who really had his back in my friend-group, so once I stopped talking to him my other friends collectively decided they wouldn’t bother talking to him either. 

Fast forward to now, things have simmered down and I don’t really care about the stupid shit we were fighting about. My friends however, have decided they like the friend group better without Todd. My thought process is; fuck it, it doesn’t make sense for me to put effort in rebuilding my relationship with Todd if none of my friends like him. 

The other night I’m feeling particularly alone in this world and decide to shoot Todd a message, without telling my other friends. I am weak, I know. We joke like we used to and agree we will meet in person to talk things out. 

The next day out of pure chance I stumble across Todd’s new reddit account. He kept this account secret to us because my friends used to scroll through all his comments and make jokes at his expense about them. (Same reason this account is private.) 

So I decide to do a little stalking, I know this isn’t “the right thing to do,” but I had genuine reasons of doing it. For starters I wanted to make sure he was mentally alright, I’m sure I don’t have to explain that losing all your friends can fuck you up. Secondly, I knew he would post about personal drama on advice Reddit’s, similarly to what I’m doing now lmao. 

I basically discover him saying some mean vitriolic shit about me. Saying I was the reason all his friends left him, which isn’t the case at all. He said I made a fool out of him and that I ruined his life. He downplayed what he did to me  saying “it was practically nothing” and basically making me look like a little bitch. 

Listen, I don’t care if he tells strangers on the internet that I’m a “soyboy” or what-have-you, if that gives him a little sense of catharsis by all means knock yourself out. What concerns me is the fact he said he changed, yet here he is showing a clear misunderstanding of what caused our fight in the first place.

Now with that all said, I assume what I want a second opinion on is the following.
- Is it really my responsibility to ensure that he has friends, even after he plotted against me?
- Should I cancel our meeting? If so then what clause do I give him? That I stalked a reddit he didn’t even think I knew about?
- My anxiety disorder makes me a very non-confrontational person, how should I go about bringing any of this up? 

If you stuck with this thank you! I’m really desperate for opinions of people and I can’t ask my friends because they don’t want me even talking to Todd. Please share any and all thoughts.",04Mar2019,1
337,"Hi guys!
 I didn't know wether I should post at r/relationships, but I think it's more of a personal problem here and less between us. My boyfriend doesn't use reddit and his English is worse than mine (we're both from a german speaking country) and so I'll try to get some help here.

 My BF is a very lovable, caring, friendly, funny and good human - if you know him. He's honest and loyal and watches everything that happens around him. He usually has a good sense of human emotions, though he tends to be a bit ""naive"" sometimes.

The problem is, he is very, very quiet. He seems cold and distant sometimes. People ask me wether he enjoyed himself or not and then I ask him and he assures me that he did. He really does enjoy social interaction but admits that he lost a lot of his ""people skills"" in the past. Before me, he had been single for over 8 years and as much as I love him I can kind of understand it. You really have to look closely to see his (very much) lovable core.

Some examples maybe... 

- When he's with me he rarely asks questions though he loves hearing about my day, my life, my personality. 

- He usually does not talk much about himself and I sometimes feel like ""investigating"" when asking about his day. He likes talking about his hobbies and stories from before me though.

- In group settings he talks almost nothing. Not even things like ""yeah I know"" or ""I agree"". He smiles and laughs at jokes, though.

- He cannot smalltalk. Not even 5%. 

I know he's an introvert - I am too, but I learned how to improve my social skills in the past. 
He sees it's a problem. He would like to get closer to my family, my friends, even HIS friends (they like him but him always being quiet is an obstacle anyway). It's sad when I see people feeling awkward around him because he can be so funny, there is so much going on in his head and is very intelligent....

He wants to improve this.... How can I help him? Do you know any resources. We both know that he's never going to be a big talker - but a quiet (and not silent) person would be enough...

Thank you!",04Mar2019,3

340,"(Just saying, a lot of stuff about our relationship isnt even close to the actual magnitude)

I only met her (let's call her E.B.) about two years ago. She was my friend's girlfriend and they would hang out with our group of friends all the time at lunch (we're in highschool). E.B. and I became friends and we would never talk except at lunch. Eventually those 2 broke up and i kinda despised her cause i knew she was partly a hoe. E.B. continued to hang with our group and i was fine with it, she was fun. 

Fast forward to around July 2018 (she already got a girlfriend), we had a class together and i basically only hung out with her in there, even though we had a bunch of other friends in there (including the ex). Eventually, E.B. gave me her phone number because i had a pic of something she wanted and we had started talking a lot from there. We got even closer to each other and traded info on social medias. Snap was our main though, and with it being our main, we reached bestfriend status on it in a heartbeat. I then said that we were bestfriends cause snap called us it, to which she didn't necessarily agree with at first, but grew into it quickly. We were unanimous bestfriends.

We would talk Every. Single. Day. From the moment we woke up, to the moment we fell asleep (often times past 1am). From these conversations i learned so much about E.B., including how she doesn't do great in relationships and isn't very monogamous. She's had many relationships and did inappropriate things, but had never gone far in person. I learned about her problems with her family and just in general and I've tried to help her cope with them, but there wasn't much i could do but be there to support her; she had to take initiative. She eventually figured i had feelings for her, which she was right, but i told her I'm fine with just being her bestfriend. Our relationship grew in the following months, and we started doing stuff outside of school (not much considering we live far away and neither of us have a car). We knew so much about each other and said to each other just how much. Then in December, it came.

Winter break had come and E.B. was considering dating me (she broke up with the new person), but then, at the final stretch of the break, it happened. She went to her grade-school bestfriend's place and basically had sex with her. She told me about it the day before, how they were most likely going to do it, which i told her to do what she wants. But then the day after, we talked, and things unraveled.

I asked her how things went, and they did in fact do it. I was hurt, but we weren't dating so it didn't matter. I was hurt more by what she said after. I jokingly said ""we are still bestfriends, right? 😂"" to which she replied ""idk."" There arent words to describe how i felt. I asked her what she meant and she said she didnt want to be bestfriends anymore. I asked her if she wanted something more, but she said no. She only wants to be friends. I was upset and when i asked her why, she didnt reply. The next day at school we walked together in the morning as we always did and we were just silent. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she just said no. We were in silence the rest of the time as we were walking around while i was sorta crying. I walked her to her class per usual and nothing happened.

From there we talked still, but things were just... different. Now she doesn't care about me. We still talk, but it's gone and its going even further. She didn't talk to me at all in the past 2 days she's just left me on opened. She had said she didnt want to date anyone when things first went downhill, but now she is dating the first ex fore mentioned above again (which just started tonight). I'm in so much pain and i dont know what to do. Ive been questioning killing myself for quite some time now, but this is getting to be too much. 

I need some advice if any of you have any. I just dont know what to do and im so lost.",04Mar2019,1
341,"So pretty much here’s the deal:

So a friend of mine managed to get me and her tickets to a concert.

This concert is pretty much a once in a lifetime experience for me and honestly I really don’t want to miss it.

I told my parents that I was going to this concert and they asked what day it was on. Turns out, my cousin’s wedding is on the same day and it totally slipped my mind.

They suggested I just go to the ceremony and ditch the reception, but me being who I am, I’d end up feeling bad about it.

Like my cousin’s only getting married once, and there’s always a chance I may go to a concert someday but honestly I’ve been dying to go to this concert for the longest time and I really don’t know what to do.

Also, my aunts are *huge* on gossip (and i hate it but what can you do) and I’m just afraid they’re gonna start talking shit and saying how I chose a concert over my family and shit like that.

345,"I’m sort of new and I’m not sure where to post but I have an issue regarding my friend. As stated in the title thingy, I feel like I’m going to get a anxiety attack whenever I see my friend. Let’s call her Bagel. Bagel and I became very close friends very quickly. She and I became friends because we both liked the same things. I invested a crap ton of trust in her and I respected her a lot. If the first impression of someone is good, I’ll usually deal with anything small they do to me (being annoying, being mean) Bagel’s ethics/morals are quite different from mine, or her view of things. I like to look at things with a half full cup way of things. I’m (sorta) optimistic and hopeful. (though sometimes I’ll go on sad rants of hating myself) I like to dream, I like to imagine myself being a billionaire and how I’m going to help a lot of people. But Bagel sees things differently. She’s very strict and rigid with her work. She thinks very realistically. It wouldn’t be a problem if she didn’t push it onto me. I understand she’s trying to help me since I’ve got my head in the clouds, but it’s stressing me out. It stresses me out bad and I’m not really good at handling stress. But I continued to ignore the little things, I think she’s a great friend anyways. But recently she sort of broke my trust and I stressed about it all day. It was something small but it bothered me like hell. So my friends and Bagel were doing our work and suddenly Bagel asks my other close friend, (let’s call her Chu) how she deals with me. Bagel teases me about how I’m so “imaginative” and how crazy I am. Bagel asks how Chu deals with it. She also made fun of me on a topic that before she had told me I was completely delusional for thinking of, but nobody noticed because she only spoke to me about it. Chu just laughs. (She’s kinda awkward lol) So I just pretended to go along with it but it just hurt. I pride myself in being able to make my friends happy and smile. It feels like magic when I can make my friends laugh with my weird antics. Chu (used to be??) depressed with neglecting parents but now she smiles more because she talks about it with me and I remind her that I care about her. (I hope it was because of me... is that narcissistic?) It makes me feel really happy. It makes me feel like I matter in a way. I like to think that my friends care for me and I’m important to them. But Bagel (basically) jokingly told me all of that was just shit and even though she was just messing around, it still hurt. It just made me think that I was just some sort of nuisance and I should just go away forever. 
In English we were supposed to make a mock diary of a book we were reading and I enjoyed the idea and put some sensitive stuff in there. Bagel asked me for it and I was like sure, I trust you. She was only messing around with me and started reading it out loud. I was pretending to be messing around too and told her to stop but she didn’t. When I tried grabbing it from her she kept reading and turn away. I only got it back because the teacher told us to stop being disruptive. It really hurt. I tried to distract myself by reading until class ended. I forgot it soon enough. Rest of the day I didn’t wanna talk to her but I just did so I wouldn’t bother anyone. She doesn’t know. Then I got home and I let out the stress by talking to my older brother about the issue.(thanks big bro &lt;3) But by doing that I attached all my insecurities with her (I think) so when I got home I kept thinking about it and I got an anxiety attack once I got alone. It was pretty poopy. I didn’t like it. Then I fell asleep and I felt normal again the next morning. I went to school, until second period when I had a class with her. I entered the class feeling fine until I saw Bagel. I felt really weird. I can’t pinpoint it. I just knew I felt uncomfortable. We had a test that day so during that time it wasn’t so bad. After was when the problem started. Bagel jokes and talks a lot in class so I constantly was reminded of her existence. I am usually talkative in class as well but I couldn’t formulate anything in my head since the entire time I was panicking and trying to calm my breathing. I could barely focus on my work. I just kept telling myself to calm down and I was just being dramatic and it would be fine if I just hung out with her more. The bell rung and I ran out. She called after me but I ignored her. I met my friend at my locker and she noticed something was up and I burst into tears. I went home early that day. Now whenever I see her I can’t calm down and I think about how much I’m just a nuisance and how I should just die. If I talked to her she would probably understand and be reasonable since she’s realistic and straight to the point. But I’m scared. So scared of how she’s going to respond and what she’s going to think. She suffers from depression so I don’t wanna burden her like that. I know she hates herself already, I don’t wanna give her another reason. It’s too much a broad question but I gotta ask, what do I do? Am I just being dramatic or is this a problem? I have class with her tomorrow and I can’t just avoid her all day, she’s in four of my six classes. (Also I’m not rushing you guys to respond faster or anything)

I got really angry but said nothing, thinking that he might have just forgotten. I asked him if he could fix his car, which he agreed. I got another appointment for next month.

This is important: I reminded him every week, for a total of 5 separate times. Every time he says ""Sure I'll do it soon.""

The exam is on Wednesday, so I call the Sunday before and ask him if it's fixed. He says he's taking it to the shop tomorrow. Monday night, he calls me up and says the car needs a new part, which will take a week to arrive.

I was so angry that I immediately shut off my phone to calm down. The first time this happened, it might have been an actual mistake. But the second time, I feel like this is an explicit ""Fuck you.""

I'm not sure how to deal with this. Do I just let it go and ignore it ever happened? Do I get angry and scream at his face? Do I just end my friendship? I feel like if I don't give an appropriate response, something similar will just happen again.

352,"So this story starts maybe a few years ago, when I had strong feelings for this girl, whom let’s say her name is sarah. Those feelings were on and off for a couple years, and considering I was very young then, (middle school) I can’t claim they were feelings of love or anything. Now about a year and a half ago, Sarah started dating my friend Joe. I was cool with it, and it actually didn’t last very long. Meanwhile however, I met a girl we’ll call Ellie and we began dating. 
Ellie and I’s relationship was really great, some of the best times I’ve had and honestly it was something really special.
A few months ago, things with Ellie began getting less and less great, I guess we began getting less infatuated and we broke up, on terms to which I agreed with, and was definitely not salty about, but were mainly of her will.
We decided to wait a while, and try to move on, but if we didn’t we could try again.
For the next month or so, I fought to try and win her back, her friends told me she was really sad, and I was too, so I thought maybe we made a mistake. But each of my attempts were sort of shot down (more or less) and I really didn’t want to try too hard which might blow things entirely.
So about a month and a half after the break up, I am at a very low point and beginning to think Ellie is really moving on. So after a party, Sarah spends a lot of time with me, and takes the long way home, passing near my place. We end up making out and decide not to talk about it.
A few weeks later, things with Ellie start to pick up again, and she surprises me close to my house by coming, and says she wants to try things again. I am really happy at that point, and we spend some quality time together.
But she does ask about Sarah, because she knows about my history concerning her, and over the course of a few parties,  it has become slightly obvious that something is going on.
I tell her that nothing happened with her, but that she has been sort of coming on to me lately.
The next day, which was really a peak day in our “relationship”, I feel like I have to tell her about what happened, even if it happened when we were not together. So I tell Ellie about Sarah, and she’s infuriated, she blocks me on social media, and the next day in class, I see her tearing up a bit.
For the next week or so, i spend a lot of time trying to make things right again, i go see her often, and give her a letter i wrote a while back.
Eventually, things sort of smoothen out, and we’re not really going out, so to speak, but we’re seeing each other, and its nice. 
Last week, Sarah and I were on a school trip together and, in spite of what I told myself before going, we were rather close. She sat next to me every bus ride, and leaned on to me and other sorts, and I wasn’t exactly refusing any of it. People noticed our closeness and on the way back from the trip, Ellie got mad at me for barely talking to her throughout the trip.
So yesterday I met and saw Ellie, and after the tensions from the fight prior died down, we got to talking. And she basically said that after what I’d done the month before, she couldn’t trust me anymore. Sarah had often been a concern when we were dating, and she felt that by kissing her, I had betrayed her. She said that for the remainder of school (senior year) she wanted to spend time with me, but that she couldn’t formally go out with me, and that sarah would often be a concern. 
The thing is, she doesn’t know about the closeness with sarah on the school trip and maybe she suspects it, I don’t know...

354,"Okay, a little bit of context here, I am a 20 year old programming student who is currently in third year of college. I am almost about to graduate but there's a huge problem... I know NOTHING about programming or making a program in general.

So how did it come to this? Well I'll give some background information. You see, when I was young, I love playing video games. Up until now, I still play video games and watch stuff related about games. You can say I'm addicted to it, you can say it's my hobby and passion. You can also say that I am really a spoiled child since birth. 

Fast forward a few years in high school, we need to come up with a course for our future. I researched things about courses that focuses on making games. and of course, Information Technology came up. Since then, I chose IT as my course.

But boy, do I regret it now... Programming is just too complicated for me.. I realize now that this isn't the thing that I want to be doing for the rest of my life. I am a type of person who is usually lazy, finding an easier way out of things and I always use my time entertaining myself through video games, Youtube videos, anime, manga and light novels.

I am also the type of person that always gives up halfway through. I've used to paint before, but I gave up. Used to draw before, but gave up. Used to play the guitar, gave up. The thing is just collecting dust in the attic. Used to self study about programming, gave up because I find it boring then and just proceeded to entertain myself.

You see, I never really dedicated my time self studying these things... I think that's a very huge problem that I find in myself. For some reason, I always prioritize the need of entertaining myself.

Whenever I see my friends and my classmates, being so talented that it often makes me sad that I am nothing compared to them. Whenever the topic is about programming, I always try to act smart just to join in on the conversation. Hell, my electronics engineering friend who just graduated and extremely talented, now has a job. My best friend at school, who is literally the smartest programmer I know, looks to have a bright future ahead of him even though his family's background is poor. My other best friend who is always the guy we tease and roast, is extremely talented in programming, drawing, and photo editing. I feel envious to these guys.. They pretty much have a set life ahead of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be just like these guys. Something to humbly brag about and be proud of. But today, I've decided that I wanted to change things. I never want to see my parents disappointed in me again. I have to set an example to my brothers as well since I'm the eldest son. 

I always think of myself as a creative type of person. So, I took interest in photo editing and video making type of stuff. So if you have any advice, video recommendations, guides, sites, about this topic, please feel free to do so. I really need wake up calls. So that I can live a bright future.

360,"Just so you know, I’m a freshman in highschool. And I usually have my hair in a braid, so it would be really wavy and curly whenever I remove my braid. But during the Christmas break my mom brought me to a hair salon and we got it straightened.

In all honesty I love my new hair, and so do other people. But I like the praise and all but this boy went a little too far. 

This boy apparently saw my hair and really liked it, he said he wanted hair like that (he’s “bi”) and so he’s been following me and my friends. He usually waits out my classroom just to watch me exit every dismissal. Whenever I see him I usually scream and hide behind the safety of my classmates who also don’t like him, but there were times me and my friends were hanging out in a mall. We saw him look at us and turn away, what creeps me out about the boy more, is not only does he love my hair but he thinks whenever I scream it’s cute, so he tries to creep me out a lot. 

About this boy, he disliked for being a bitch apparently. To a point when I told my classmates I got a friend request from him they literally yelled at me to delete it. 

Well why not just tell him to fuck off? 
Well you see, I don’t know him and I don’t want to. This isn’t the first time I was stalked by someone before but it was usually someone I personally knew. This guy is a complete utter stranger to me and I only know him from reputation (his rep is pretty bad). 

Why not tell your parents or the teachers? 
I did tell my mom, she told me not to mind him. And my dad doesn’t really want to get involved. Yeah I could tell the teachers but they wouldn’t really do anything since following another student isn’t an offence. 

A lot of people find this pointless, but I’m afraid he might do something more that could harm me or other people. Because he showed he wasn’t afraid to that when he got into a fist fight with another student for getting in his way. ",04Mar2019,1

363,"It's kind of vague, and I can't think of anything causing it, but for the last couple of months I've just been feeling physically terrible.

Everytime I eat I feel sick and sometimes throw up. i get headaches all the time but I never used to get them. my vision gets blury and I space out often- enough that some of my friends have been saying they're worried about me. I get random pains in my sides, kind of like the feeling after being punched, or poking a bruise, that's the best I can describe it. 

And I'm so tired all the time, no matter how much sleep I get. Even when i had lots of trouble getting to sleep in the past it was never this bad. Every day when I get home i just want to sleep, and I keep falling asleep in classes. It's really draining on my social life and my education.

I don't know what is making this happen and I don't know how to fix it. I'm really hoping it's temporary and not anything serious. 

i haven't been doing any drugs, I've been eating relatively healthy, im drinking water a little more than I used to, im not pregnant. I have no idea what's wrong with me, and I'm worried it's all in my head or something. 

i don't want to tell my dad because he tells me to just tough it out, but that's probably a bad idea if this turns out being serious. 

any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks.

364,"Hi, I'm very new to reddit, but there's something I need to get off my chest.

Situation sketch: I have a girlfriend with divorced parents, and her mother has been in a relationship with a guy for the past 1.5 years. Lets call him Steve and my girlfriends mother Bonnie (not real names). Bonnie found out last week that Steve has been using tinder as long as they have been dating, and he lied that it was just for 'seeing who would like him'. Apparently, the story is much more sickening than this, as Bonnie decided to check his PC when he was on a trip with a 'business partner'. She found hundreds of selfies and clips of Steve with other women, with whom he cheated throughout their relationship. The worst part is, that he tells Bonnie he is so sorry and wants to make it right, and he loves her, but in the mean time, he just departs with some random woman on vacation and keeps lying to Bonnie about it, while she can see selfies of him and this woman getting synchronized to his laptop. He doesn't seem to care about how she feels about it and only gets mad at her for telling this to her children. 

I find it very hard to cope with this, as I really would like to punch this man in his face for being the dick he is. But on the other hand, I can't really understand how someone can be so insensitive towards other people and I really want to ask him a bunch of questions. I really have the idea that he is a sex addict and just cannot feel what he is doing to Bonnie and her kids. Or there must be some other psychological problem he is coping with. I don't really know what I can do, as he is probably too proud to admit that there is something wrong with him, and you can't sue him or anything. 

If anyone would have advice on coping with this, or knows a way to get some justice out of this story without any fist ending up in his face, would be great! I live in the Netherlands by the way, if maybe someone knows a place where this man can be helped. ",04Mar2019,1
365,"Yesterday, I felt fine until work. I started coughing a little and was feeling under the weather, but my job isn’t necessarily one that lets you off when you’re sick due to short staff. I passed it off as poor air quality, because the smoke in there has given me issues before. One of my co workers was coughing a little, but I didn’t think about it, but I should have because I’ve been working with her the past few days. Progressively, it got a little worse. Said co-worker gave me some severe cold &amp; flu Tylenol and I think it made it a little better until after work. 

I started really feeling the affects last night, and I was really worried. Tomorrow, or I guess today, I was supposed to see my Mom. She lives across the country now with a new baby, but I like to maintain a good relationship with her, because I love her. I don’t see her as much as I used to, and I legally don’t have to because she doesn’t have any custody, but I’ve missed her a lot. Last time I saw her was last year, so it’s been a while. 

My mom was diagnosed with cancer several months back, just after giving birth to her kid, my sister.  My mom also suffers from an autoimmune disease that really screws up her body. With such a weakened immune system, I know she probably can’t be around me. But I’m really desperate and I want to see her. She’s super vague when she talks about her cancer and won’t even tell me what kind it is. She’s been very reserved with her illness and that really worries me. Maybe it’s because I live across the country and it feels weird to her to tell me over the phone, but I don’t know how severe it is and it’s been giving me anxiety. Because of her immune system already, I assume the worst, but I really don’t want to. 

Anyways, it’s 1:40 am and I woke up feeling the worst I’ve been. I can feel a fever and my body is shaking and extremely fatigued. Getting up to go to the bathroom was so difficult, even after lying awake for a while, to get rid of possible sleep-induced issues. I remember having a similar sickness like this last year, and it was really hard for me and I stayed out bedridden for a couple of days. I really can’t deal with this right now. 

I don’t want to compromise my Mom’s sickness by seeing her today, but I don’t know when I’ll be able to see her again. I really need to see her, but I’m afraid to tell her I’m sick. I know I have to, but I’m dreading it. I was really kind of excited to see her. This is the only day we would be able to hang out because she is only here for a few days, and leaves my city tomorrow/Wednesday, the days I work. (But I will definitely have to at least try to call out, but it’s unlikely I’ll get it off. Even then, it’s the same situation, I’m still sick.) I need to know what’s going on with her and if she’s going to be okay, because she can’t avoid my questions in person. 

So I’m kind of desperate here. I need to eradicate this immediately, or at least make myself as safe as possible. I want to take so many precautionary steps that she feels okay with seeing me. I am so upset, and I’ve been crying for the past hour, as it’s almost 2 am now, because I probably already know her answer. I just need to make sure there’s nothing I can’t do. 

Please help, Reddit.

366,"First of all im from argentina so sorry if my engliah isnt perfect.

Where do i start... Ok, i am 16 years old and my parents are divorced (they keep a good relationship so this isnt the problem), i mostly live with my mum and she has always worked a lot to pay my school. Some years ago she met a guy and started to date, since that our economy has improved because him working also helps (we've been living together for like 3 years) and she seems happier.
Here is where the problem starts. Since the beginning i saw that this guy likes to lie about everything, he would constantly tell bullshit stories and try to speak as if he knew how to do anything and how everything works when all he does is imagine a solution.
This annoyed me from the beginning, and i just ignored it. But i got tired a couple of months ago and started to correct him (sometimes because i know how things work, and sometines by searching on the internet) since that we've had discussions about stupid things all the time, and the environment at home would be really angry.
A week ago we had a big fight (about something really stupid he said like it was the truth) and i just realized that i have to stop correcting him because i don't want to be the reason my mum kicks him out (she always puts me first) even if it makes me get so mad when he lies, and i started to try that, but i just can't. Sometimes without realizing i end up in another fight, i tried talking this with him once but it ended in another fight. It's gotten to a point where i just can't control myself when he lies. I don't want to make my mum sad by breaking her relationship because of my own problems.
I'm sixteen (almost seventeen) and will finish school in two years, i'm planning to go to the university then and leave my house to solve things (i don't know if it will be possible though) but i don't know how i will be able to control myself the next two years. I know that people like this exist and that a part of growing up is getting along qith them, but i just can't. I need some wise advice from an adult because i just don't know what to do.",04Mar2019,1

370,"I have a friend that comes from a very religious and spiritual family. They are part of the Catholic groups called Regnum Christi. Personally, I'm not very religious and would consider myself agnotisc... If not, athiest. (but if I have to be honest, I don't really care) 

All of that aside, my friend usually talks about having bad dreams a lot. My guess is anxiety and lifestyle (but please correct me). 

This is the second time she's spoke about a bad recurrence. 

First, she had mentioned she might have had a demon attached because of all the sleep paralysis and vivid dreams. She reached out to her older brother who had a similar experience and suggested she see someone who has helped him, however this person was not from the church. This person rubbed oils on her and conducted a prayer, one that would cast out whatever demon or spirit was latched on her. Long story short, her parents found out and called an actual priest. Long story short, this all started from a a few recurring dreams 

The second time around, my friend was on a spiritual silent retreat and had more vivid dreams. This time she explained further what she experienced. 
It was the middle of the night when she became aware of her sleep paralysis, she mentioned she has kept all the closet Doors and bathroom cabinets closed, except in her paralysis all the doors were wide open.  I asked her if she woke up to them open or closed. She said only one door was open. 
While in her paralysis she said she saw a girl waiting in the back of the room. Note, this is the second time shes ever been on the retreat in the same room, but she was alone her second time. After she woke, she said she wenr to wake up the director of the retreat to call her parents and keep her company. However, the director didn't wake up. The morning came and my friend asked if the director had heard her knocking, her answer was no. 

The first time this has happened I was very interested in what was happening as everything was so detailed and a lot of people were involved. However, I still had my doubts but still continued to support my friend through it. 

Now that it's happening again, I am very reluctant to believe that all this demon related. (At one point, I was convinced that everything was real... Just not for long) I'm also not very... Supportive as I once was (for several factors). Maybe she is fishing for attention? Maybe she is leaving a huge chunk of the story out like clarifying if this was all part of her dream (seeing the girl, knocking on the directors door, or if she had woken up realizing all of *it was* dream... (Like waking up after knocking at the door or not). 

I noticed the first time she did get a lot of attention. Id hate to say that might be exaggerating a few things...
But it could be possible. 

How do you feel about all this? 

Tl;dr my friend complains about having vivid nightmares. She might be exaggerating a few parts but I can't tell if she's doing it for attention? 

Pls note that I respect all religions and beliefs. I myself came from very religious backgrounds, but I perosanlly don't believe or would care to think about it. I am still currently in a very Opus dei university, and familiar with Catholic and Christian theology.

I messaged my ex not long after to check how he was doing, as I played a big role in helping him get help for his mental health and wanted to see if he had continued with therapy after I left (not to mention he was my best friend and I still care about him a hell of a lot).

373,"Okay so about a year ago I (16M) used to regularly sell weed to friends and stuff. I did it very small time and was more for the benefit of my friends being able to go to someone safe rather than me making money. I used to buy like 1/2 an ounce (15grams) and resell it in  2.5 gram amounts, including petrol money I was making basically nothing considering the time it took (I have a real job as well). Anyway I stopped about 6 months ago and have since got regular texts from people asking to buy. Up until today I’d always said no sorry Im out of the game but got to *** and knock on the door (tin house location), i’d been there once to buy a tin (0.8g) for personal use and it’d been a kinda dodgy experience but I let anyone I sent there know that. 

Last week I was text by a girl (15) who wanted to buy some, I knew her through a friend and she seemed really nervous and scared. I wasn’t really comfortable sending her to the house like I do with guys (it’s run by a gang and i’ve seen their dark side) so I tried to shut her down and tell her she didn’t need weed to have fun.

She proceeded to buy it but later texted me like “this so isn’t worth $50 😢😭 can i buy another $100 worth but you give me extra” and I feel pretty guilt about it so i’m kinda inclined to sell to her but it also means I’d have to go and buy a large amount (invest all my current savings into capital).

No matter how high my sex drive is, I find it hard to get wet enough before sex since taking Depo, which makes sex painful for me. I researched why this could be, and apparently Depo causes estrogen levels to drop, and with less estrogen equals vaginal dryness.

The Samsung is a great phone, seeing as it was their flagship. However it's getting old and it might not receive new updates and I'm just worried it'll become obsolete quickly. The camera should be decent and the display is great.

377,"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

Mandatory first time poster, English is not my first language, I'm changing some of the details in case someone from work recognizes this post, etc. You know the drill.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** I got the perfect job offer in Australia, except I'm already employed in Paris, and the new job would start in May.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** I'm French and recently graduated in international economics. As soon as I got out of college, I tried to apply to a work program with the French ministry of finances. Basically they send young economists in French Embassies all over the world to work for two years with very good job conditions. I think I applied to 8 of these, and everytime I got really close (passed all rounds of interview) but got rejected at the end. After the summer I settled for an economist job in Paris in a (very) small consulting firm. The job is great, it pays well (basically as much as the Embassies) but there is one problem: it's very focused on France. I got into international economics because 1. I wanted to travel as much as I could (which I did during my studies) and 2. I wanted to work on global issues. In my current job I work in French for the French Government with French issues. I can almost feel my English level whithering away as I haven't written or spoken a single word of English in months (thankfully I still consume all my media in English so there's that). 

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem;** It's been 6 months since I've started my job. I was still checking the Government website for job offers and found one for Canberra (Australia). I applied out of curiosity, and after going through the process I got the job. I would really love to go as it's basically a perfect job for me and would kickstart my international career but there are two problems:

1. The job starts in May, which is awfully close. I won't be in any legal trouble for quitting my current job this early but it's kind of a d\*ck move. Like I said it's a very small firm, we're two economists currently working there. My colleague would like to take a paternity leave in a few weeks which he won't be able to do if I quit and they have to recruit/train someone else. I still haven't told anyone at my job by the way.
2. I still live with my parents (I was planning to buy my own home in a few months, which obviously won't happen if I go to Australia) and I am very close to them. They are pretty old (my father is 78, my mother 65) and I'm an only child. They support me and actually told me to take the offer, but yesterday night I heard them talking in their room and they had a very different outlook, basically saying ""I hope he'll decline the offer. Europe would be fine because we could visit often, but Australia is going to be really hard for us"". This really broke my heart.

**So here I am, I have until Friday to give my answer.** I've talked to my close friends about this and they all told me the same thing which is to go for it and to not let my job or my family weigh me down. But I can't shake the feeling that going to Australia would be extremely selfish on my part, both to my parents who will have to live alone after having raised and supported me for 23 years and to my colleague who will have to stay at work instead of spending time with his newborn.

378,"I am not 100% sure of all the information because it was so long ago. 

In a casual conversation with my partner while watching netflix earlier today, we got talking about sleep walking and people who wake up in a weird places in their house. I instantly started to feel emotionally sick when this memory popped into my head. I had to leave the room because I couldn't say out loud what was bothering me. 

I won't go into much detail, but when I was 5 or 6 years old, I straight up remember waking in the middle of the night, in our absolutely terrifying unfinished basement, naked on an old couch. 

I always wore pajamas to bed that covered my whole body. I would always be in bed early, and always woke up in my bedroom. I've never once had anyone tell me I'm a sleep walker. My bedroom was upstairs at the end of the hall. It was the furthest away from the back door/stairs.

379,"Hello everyone so I have a bit of a problem. Let me give some background information

I have two older siblings. My sister is 29 and my brother is 28. While I'm only 20 right now, so they are quite a bit older than me. My dad has a house that he inherited from his parents when they passed. It's completely paid for so the only cost right now is property taxes. When my sister graduated college he offered the house to her saying that she could stay there, rent free for as long as she wanted. She passed it up because it was an older house and she didn't want to fix it up or live in an old house. So, he made the same offer to my brother when he graduated shortly after her. My brother took him up on this offer and completely rennovated the house so it's really really nice and modern on the inside now. For the past 5 years (I think) he and his wife have lived there but now they want to build a bigger house because they want to start a family. 

I graduate college in a year. My brother hasn't started building his home yet, but I expect he will fairly soon. So by the time his house is built and he moves out, I probably will be graduating. 

See where I'm going with this? I'd like to live in the house myself. I don't mind paying rent but it's a super cute little place, with a fenced in yard (I have a dog and would like to get another) It's a one bedroom and I plan on it just being me for quite a while. So it really would be perfect for me. It's close enough to all of my family and I wouldn't have to worry about the struggles of renting and it would just work out really well. 

I've heard my dad talk about selling it but I don't know if he's never considered me staying there or just hasn't thought about it. Is it selfish for me to want stay there? Is it selfish for me to ask him not to sell so that I can stay there? Again, I don't mind paying them a reasonable rent price because I don't want to have to move back in with my parents after living on my own. What would be the best way to bring it up with them? I just don't want to come off as selfish or entitled but at the same time it might bother me at little if both my siblings were given the chance and I wasn't. 

I'm not asking them to just give me the house, but it would be nice to have a place stay that was my own until I find somewhere else to live/buy a home at. ",04Mar2019,1

383,"Ever since my mom's depression I hated my life. When my mom got depressed(I was 13 back then) I had to take care of her because my father was to busy working. I remember that I had to clean up her vomit(that's how her body reacts when under stress), cook and clean the house while she  yelled at me and threw stuff at me. She said thinks like:"" You are the reason I'm depressed and why I don't want to live anymore."" Even though she didn't mean it, it was still hard to hear that from your mother, especially when you have to take care of her. I hated that she refused to seek professional help, because I was sick of this life and I wanted it to be over. I never really left the house besides work and school because I was afraid she would commit suicide. Now, 4 years later her mental state has improved luckily. She doesn't have mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts anymore but she is just so toxic and negative. Besides that, I can't take her serious anymore after everything that happened. Because I can't stand staying home with her I work a lot to get out of the house(about 25 hours a week besides school). Recently I am not able to enjoy my life, everyday feels like a grind. I hate everyday and I feel like my mom's depression has taken a toll on me mentally. Luckily I have a few friends who share what I feel because they were also raised in shitty(probably even worse) circumstances, abusive alcoholic dad left the house when my friend was 5 and left him with his 4 siblings(1 handicapped the the other cancer) while his mom was to sick to be able to work. It's nice to have somebody who knows how you feel but because we both feel depressed and feel like life is meaningless it only contributes to this negativity.

385,"I wear a mask whenever I am outside at all times because I have an auto immune disease that recently has started getting worse. Sometimes people will smile and casually ask me if I’m sick. Others ask me if I have allergies (which is fair because I do. I have a shit ton), and others straight up give me nasty looks.

I hide putting on and taking off the mask whenever I go to and from class, in and out of the grocery store, and to and from work. Honestly sometimes I don’t even take it off if I’m going to be in a building for less than 10 minutes because it feels awkward and shitty trying to hide it or to hold it in my hand/I’ll often need my hands to hold other things. Also it’s uncomfortable to put on and take off, like it’s easier to just keep it on. So people notice.

When people make jokes about the mask and I tell them I have an auto immune disease, they’ll visually look like they feel really bad and some people will say they feel like an asshole. But I don’t want to make anyone feel like an asshole. 

But it also hurts to just go along with the small talk. “Yes, I’m sick.” “Yes, I have allergies.” “Yes, I am wearing a Bane mask in March for the hell of it.” 

I feel like shit all the time and there’s so much more to it than just, “yeah, just coughing a bit and I’ve got a sore throat.” 

Sometimes I’ll explain my disease to people and nobody ever understands/they act like it isn’t that bad. Like they take it light heartedly and it makes me feel like they think I’m just a hypochondriac.

Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest and could do with some advice instead of going over it again and again in my own head. Sorry for the essay, there's a lot.

So as the title suggests, I was with my ex for around 8 months. We broke up the other day. We weren't compatible, to say the least. Things got pretty serious pretty quickly, to the point where we'd even got engaged. However, I was passed over for a promotion at work and lost 2 grandparents in the space of a few weeks. This knocked me back a hell of a lot in terms of confidence, and I became very withdrawn and insecure about a lot of things, one of them being the relationship. I kept asking myself why she was with me, and why she was bothering with me. She did what she could to show me that she was serious about us, and that she wasn't going anywhere, but there was something inside me which just couldn't believe her, I don't know why. She'd never given me any reason not to trust her or believe her at that point. This went on for a while.

Fast forward a couple of months. We were in a better place, we'd been away together and I'd proposed, and she said yes! (We'd got together in June, I proposed in December) I was over the moon and couldn't wait to tell everyone and start planning the wedding with her! And this is where things started getting weird.

She went out one night with some friends from work (no big deal, I'd just asked her not to be home too late and to have a good time), and came back at around 3am, very drunk and with her make up running (she told me she'd been sick earlier on that night). I later find out from her friend that they went out and she ""disappeared"" with a guy we both work with (we work at the same place), leaving her other other friends on their own. I didn't think anything of it at the time because he's a guy we both know and he's a good guy, but she'd already told me she found him attractive. Cue the jealousy and the paranoia kicking in. I didn't make things easy for her, admittedly, sometimes I'd get drunk and shout at her, and accuse her of things, and she'd always tell me she hadn't done anything. I was wrong for shouting at her, and I always felt awful after I did that.

Just before getting with me, she'd been in a relationship with a guy who was very abusive, even to the point of hitting her with a bottle of wine one night (that's what she told me, anyway) and headbutting her. (This is relevant, I promise). They broke up just before we got together, and they were still living together. No big deal, I live a 10 minute walk away from the house they lived in so I helped her move some stuff into my apartment since it looked like that's where things were heading anyway. He stopped paying his rent and eventually got kicked out. She was still paying her half of the rent on her contract so I wasn't going to ask her to start paying rent with me as well.

She went away with a couple of friends from work, and from there her messages became more and more distant. I'd send her messages telling her I loved her and she'd reply with something like ""that's cute"" or ""you're adorable"". I'll be the first to admit that I can be overbearing, but I just wanted her to have a good time and know that I was still thinking of her. This distance continued after she got back.

Anyway, another night, a few weeks later, she went out with some friends and again, I asked her not to be back too late. She said what time, I said about 1am as I thought that was a reasonable request (bear in mind she'd have been out since 6pm). So she got back, drunk, and told me I was giving her a curfew and that she was having a good time. She told me she could have had any guy she wanted but still chose to come back to me, and that I repelled her. She said she enjoyed getting attention from other guys, and that she'd done some stuff I couldn't forgive. This of course only fuelled things further and I asked her several times what she meant. She wouldn't answer, and then the next day she apologised and told me that she'd only said those things to hurt me. I accepted this and we did our best to move on together.

Cue another night out. She met a friend she used to work with and went for drinks, and I went up to my friend's house for a gaming session and some beers. I was still messaging her, and she messaged me to say her phone was going to die, but asked that we'd both be back by midnight as we had work the next day. I said this was fine and left it at that.

I got back to my apartment for about half past 11. She hadn't got back yet, but I ordered pizza for us and sat down. Midnight came and went, and she hadn't come back. I thought she might have just lost track of time or something, so I messaged her friend to say I was back and I'd ordered pizza. Her friend then replied to say she wasn't with her any more, and that she'd gone to meet (guy from work) to get her work pass back as she'd left it at the office. So I messaged the dude to ask that he let her know, and didn't get a reply. It got to about half past 1, and I was getting worried, it wasn't like her to say something and not do it. I'll admit that I was pretty pissed off. I'd come home and was waiting for her and she was still out somewhere. I couldn't ring her or message her, so the only thing I could do was go into town and look for her. I looked in the bar she said she was in, and she wasn't there. I looked in a few other bars she enjoyed going to as well, and she wasn't there either. I got back to the apartment again and she still wasn't there. I knew she'd gone to meet the guy from work (the same one she'd disappeared with that other night), and wasn't all that sober so I got pretty angry and stormed out of the apartment. I suddenly thought she might have gone back to her house, so went there, and she was there with the dude. I don't know what was happening before I knocked on the door, but I could hear her giggling beforehand.

I knocked on the door, the giggling stopped, and there was silence for a while. I knocked on the door again, louder. She eventually opened the door and told me straight away that she knew how weird it looked that she'd gone to her house with another guy instead of coming home to me. She told me that she'd got pretty upset and had had a bit to drink, and that her friend had left her to go home to her partner. Whatever. She also told me that she'd known she'd lost track of time and that she didn't want me to be angry so she went to her house instead of coming back to the apartment. She also said that had she done that when she was with her ex, he'd have been angry and shouted at her, or been physical with her. We'd been together 8 months at this point, and she knows full well that I'm not that kind of person. I told her this, and that all I was worried about was that she was safe, so when she didn't come back I was extremely worried. We went back to the flat and went to sleep.

Nothing was the same after that though. I didn't feel like I could trust her or believe her any more. I didn't feel like she really loved me, or else this wouldn't have happened. I didn't feel like she was being honest with me at all, and I didn't feel respected. Things got bad. We argued, I shouted at her and made accusations (whether unfounded or otherwise), and even before I shouted she became very secretive about things, and very closed off. She would turn her phone away from me when messaging people (something she would NEVER do before), and if I asked her what she was doing she'd essentially tell me to mind my own business.

So one Saturday night, after an argument, she'd arranged to go out with some friends from work. Whatever. She went out, and this time another dude from work was there. She came back at about half 2, drunk, after I'd begged her to at least just come back to the apartment so we could try to sort things out. She went to sleep and so did I.

Since that night (this was last weekend), she's been messaging that dude non stop. She's been checking to see if I'm looking before looking at her phone and I've confronted her about it a few times, and she says he's just a friend and that I should trust her because she's always been honest with me. Needless to say, we're no longer together. We split up the other day, but I just need to know if I was being too harsh on her? Or were my feelings of paranoia and jealousy justified? There's been something in my gut for a couple of months now that's telling me I'm right, but I don't know.

Sorry for the essay, this has been weighing on my mind and bouncing around in my head for a while, and I feel like I'm going to go insane if I don't talk about it.

TL:DR - My ex and I split up, and I'm paranoid that she's not been honest with me, and that she's cheated on me. Could do with some advice as to whether I was right to believe it or not.",04Mar2019,1

Potential Triggers: Religious/Religion Issues

Handy Acronym Guide:
RM - Ringgit Malaysia (My country's currency)
EPF - Employees Provident Fund (basically a Government Pension Plan)

So here are a couple of things important for context. 

- The minimum wage in Malaysia (where I live), for a full-time employee (9-5, Mon - Fri) that is paid monthly is RM1100. 

- Out of this RM1100, around 10% is automatically deducted to go into your EPF account. Full-Time employees must pay and be paid EPF.

- Your employers must pay 4-5% (depending on age) of your monthly  salary into your EPF account as well. 
- I work in a church. I've been attending this church since June of 2010, and have been serving (voluntarily) in ministry since December 2010. I started working here (as an employee) in July 2018.

- My working hours are 9am to 3.30pm, 5 days a week (Monday &amp; Wednesday - Saturday), and I get paid RM900 monthly. 

- If you do the math, it comes out to being paid RM6.92 per hour, which is right around minimum wage. Barely.

- At present, I'm not being paid EPF. It's not likely that I'm going to be paid EPF at any point in the near future either.

- Outside of my employment, I serve in several ministries in the church, including worship, youth, and cell groups (Bible study). These are all considered voluntary. I don't get paid for doing any of this.

Here's what a weekly schedule for me looks like. 

Monday - 9am-3.30pm, working

Tuesday - Day Off, at home

Wednesday - 9am-3.30pm, working; 7.30pm - 10pm, Youth Ministry (voluntary)

Thursday - 9am-3.30pm, working

Friday - 9am-3.30pm, working; 8.30pm - 11pm, Cell Group (voluntary)

Saturday - 9am-3.30pm, working; 5pm-7pm, worship practice (voluntary, usually at least 3 times a month)

Sunday - 10am - 1.30pm, Sunday Service (voluntary); 8pm-11pm, Cell Group (voluntary)

Herein lie my issues:

There have been several occasions when I was expected to do things outside of my working hours.

For example, I hold a set of keys to the church - so when someone wants to go in, or hold a rehearsal outside of office hours, I'm the first person that gets called. 

This is expected to be voluntary, but I'm rarely ever in a position to say no since I live the closest and have the least responsibilities (other key holders are all married/with kids). 

As an employee and as a person serving in the church, it looks really bad on me if I say no. I have, on occasion, been stuck waiting in church (on Sundays- which aren't a working day for me) until 6pm for groups to finish up rehearsals or meetings because I have to lock up after them. 

I have also had to go to church at night, on my days off, to open the door for anyone holding a rehearsal. Again, all this is expected to be voluntary, with little room given for me to refuse. 

I often have to run errands outside of my working hours. Such as picking up bulletins or documents, dropping off materials to be photocopied, even picking up groceries for events being held in church. I'm not allowed to go out and do any of this during my office hours.

If a workshop/activity is ongoing in the church - I am expected to be there. Even if it's not within my working hours. This week there's a workshop happening on Friday Night, and all day Saturday. I'm expected to be present to open and close up for this workshop. This means I'll probably be going home at 11pm or later on both days. I'm not actually participating in said workshop. But I have to be there regardless. 

I understand that there's supposed to be a distinction between my work as an employee, and my serving as a church member, but ever since I started working in the church, there have been unspoken expectations when it comes to my serving. 

I have considered cutting down on my voluntary serving since it feels like I spend so much time at church, I might as well live there, but this has been met with a lot of disapproval and judgemental looks from several of my elders. 

I tried to withdraw myself from the Youth Ministry, and was met with very passive aggressive backlash from my youth leader and pastors.

I have been afraid to withdraw from several other ministries because I constantly get questioned by my Senior Pastor and my Associate Pastor as to why I am withdrawing. 

I once gave the excuse that I felt overworked (true), and I got an hour long lecture of how I needed to learn to ""separate my work from my serving"", and that they weren't the same thing, and I shouldn't view them as such. 

However, it's very hard for me to feel like they're not the same thing when I am almost always expected to serve. 

There have been several occasions where a new ministry/event has been planned, and I have been registered to help out without first being asked because people just assumed I would serve in it because I am a church employee. 

On one occasion, when I tried to back out of one of these ministries, I was literally asked:
""How can you be a paid employee at this church and choose not to serve in (so and so) ministry?"" 
Needless to say, I ended up serving in that ministry too. (Rather miserably I might add).

My parents are both Christians (they attend a different church for personal reasons) - and used to be missionaries, but even my mother has seriously been questioning my employment with the church, since I'm barely getting minimum wage, and no money is being contributed toward my pension fund (which is technically illegal, since my church is a registered company). I'm only 22 years old, but I need to think about my future too. 

And it's not to say that the church can't afford to increase my salary - they definitely can. They just haven't.

Am I wrong for feeling like I'm being taken advantage of? Is it wrong for them to expect me to voluntarily serve in ministries in church just because I'm an employee, and then be unhappy with me if I don't?

I mostly enjoy the work I do at the church. The workload is not dissimilar to the kind you would get in a normal office, but all the things being piled on top are beginning to feel like too much. 

Should I quit working at the church and find a new job?

TL;DR: I work in a church and spend all my time there, feel like they're taking advantage of me even though half of the work I do is supposed to be considered 'voluntary' - should I quit?

Out of nowhere she started to act extremely rude with me, which I was blaming myself for it. I couldn't see why, that time. She explicitly told me that what happened to me was my own fault. She shattered all my progress that I have reached with my therapist. I had to restart picking myself up, as she kept repeating that I deserved the brutality, and that people left me because I deserved it. As she was one of the only people I felt close, I kept saying she is right.   


Weeks passed, and under her pressure, I broke down. It was mock exam period, where we are trying out how the actual finals will play out. She kept Facetime-ing me, and telling me how stressed she is and I tried to keep her calm. I ended up saying that I can't pick up the phone all the time - several times a day - to calm her down, because I started to stress out a lot too... she yelled at me and called ungrateful.    
The next day, I experienced the worst panic attack of my life, during my mock exam. I realized that I need to admit to my therapist that this girl been pressuring me. I realized that most of my anxiety is coming from her - or at least - related to her.  


I decided to slowly distant myself, which was hard, because I don't really have any other close friends. I started to focus only on studying and on my online discord server, where I did have some people that I could talk to.  


Last Saturday, I got an invitation to a huge party. I decided to attend, since it was a very formal event, which I secretly really enjoy. I had fun, but decided not to drink. Others on the other hand yes. Several people came up to me and ask me how my therapy was going, and that they are sorry about what have happened to me....  
""Did you report him to the police?"" ""But you are over PTSD by now, right?"" ""It succkkkksss, am so sorry for you!!"" "" You are so strong, f\*ck that guy!""  


I was shocked. I felt like throwing up. I never ever wanted people's pitty or you know. ""The looks"". And suddenly, on my first going out night, since the past 8 months, there was I. In the middle of bullshit, as people were talking about what happened to me.  
I got raging mad. I decided to go around and figure out who was this person. Everyone kept saying one name: The girl who was my close friend.  


I cried for days, I felt observed, exposed, disgusted.   
Later, she passed me a note in class saying:   
""If you think I was the one going around and saying all this shit, you are very f\*cking wrong. I LIED to people about that I don't know why you look horrible, and why are you acting weird.  I HATE lying. I thought we are best friends, that we got each other's back. I never discussed you shit with anyone. I feel disgusted that you even think so. You completely broke my trust.""

401,"  Sorry, about formatting, on cell phone. This is a little long-winded, I'm a little upset.
  My best friend contacted me 2 weeks ago about the fact that she is having surgery, and needs somebody to watch her children as she will be down for 6 weeks. We texted back and forth, she told me her parents are footing the bill; I'd be making 20 an hour, she'll feed me, I can bring my youngest and oldest when needed. In exchange for me cooking, cleaning, running errands, and most importantly watching her 2 children under the age of 4.
  At first we decided I'd start a few days after she has surgery, and only be working from 1 PM to 6 PM. Then she decided she needed me here at 7 AM, but there's another person that is involved in the middle of the day for 3 hours. So I'll be here 7 AM to 6 PM, minus a few hours but seeing as how I live 40 minutes away, I'm not exactly going to go home. Plus she needs me 6 days a week. Last minute we decide it'd be helpful to come morning of surgery that way kids don't have to be dragged to the hospital while she gets checked in.
  I show up bright and early so she can go to the hospital; she then informs me that they are only going to pay me $15 an hour. She's my best friend, don't want to be mean; just feel like that's kind of bullcrap. She's already left for surgery. Don't really want to bombard her when she comes home home today, given how she's going to feel. I don't feel this is acceptable, am I wrong?

403,"Hi r/Advice,

A few years back, I fell into the worst depressive state of my life. Had been building up for a long time. Spent a few days in a hospital, started seeing a therapist, took antidepressants (which I support but will not be taking again), and eventually got to a great place.

Currently a university student. My first year at a school out of my state. I moved here and knew nobody, but have met a lot of people. I have 2 friends who I consider close, hang out with them every weekend and sometimes during the week. I stay active and am a fairly average student academically.

Ever since I moved states away from all of my friends and family, I have been fairly anxious and sad, but I assumed that to be nothing but a product of change. I was in a fine place for a while, but the past month and a half or so have been very rough. A lot of stress and anxiety had been building up over that time and about a week ago I exploded and had a terrible night, which of course, carried through the week. During that week there was a little bump for me in my relationship with one of my friends, whom I’d been having somewhat of a benefits situation with, and I realized that our situation was probably unhealthy for me. I want to remain friends, but I don’t know if I can get over my feelings.

I miss my friends and family more than anything. I play Xbox with my friends once or twice a week and call my family regularly, but it’s nothing like actually being in their company. My grandfather and father have just gone in together on a condominium close to campus where I will be staying for the foreseeable future. This is a stress reliever, as I won’t have to worry about finding a place to live and I’ll be paying fairly low rent to them. But, for me, I think that just sealed me into staying here for the next few years.

I am also trying to gain residency at my university, so my tuition won’t be through the roof for the rest of my academic career. This means I won’t be able to visit home until August. All of my friends will be living at home, as most of them go to school in-state. I fear I will miss out on a lot. 

My weeks have become me getting through classes while working out a few times per week, just trying to get to the weekend. When I finally make it, I drink with friends, which is fun and we are moderate, or I might drink a bit on my own and question everything. I make it to church on Sunday and try to get whatever salvation I can. I am part of a bible study group that meets once per week during the week, and I’ve met some great people and I am believing in the faith.

Overall, life has been a little dim and I think I am becoming quite depressed. I still have a decent outlook, but really I just don’t want things to get worse.

Any advice from someone whose been through a situation similar? Maybe someone who is in or a graduate of collage that could help? 

Sorry for the long post. Lots of love. xx",04Mar2019,0
404,"Hi reddit. I (24M) recently broke up with my friend (23F). In the beginning we already decided to be platonic, neither of us wanted to get physical with each other nor did we wanted to get into a relationship. But nevertheless, we became close friends as we see each other at least once every week, travel together occasionally and shared intimate details about our lives (family background, behavior, past relationships). This has been going for around half a year.

I don‘t have a girlfriend and went to several dates unsuccessfully. She, on the other hand, has been seeing a guy for months and now they are getting into a relationship. 

Besides her, I am meeting with my guys and five other female friends (platonic as well), whom she knows about (we are all mutual friends).

However, when I’ve met a sixth female friend, things started to go downwards in our friendship. Although I explained to my close friend that my recent friend is platonic as well, she insisted that the sixth has feelings towards me. So I asked the sixth directly, which she declined.
Nevertheless, my close friend still believes it and sent her own friend to spy on us in order to confirm that we were platonic. My close friend also met us both together on some events such as dinner. Both confirmed that we were not romantic at all.

In the end, she called me one day to break up our friendship forever, and blocked me on every channel imaginable after deleting every taken picture of us on her profile.

I was apologizing for the things she made me responsible in order to save our friendship. But here we are now..

I am still very confused and was told by her friends that I have to wait until the emotions are over, and we can properly work it out. But now, I see and hear that she starts to spread it through our mutual friends and somehow I feel that people are getting angry at or ignore me.

Our mutual friends are the only friends that we have and I feel helpless when she starts to turn our group into her favor, while I‘m still confused what I did wrong.
I am wondering, what was she thinking and what were her possible motivation? I want to understand.
Should I still wait until she and I can talk? What should I do?

When I was in middle school I did lots of sprints and was decent but I’m not sure now. End of the day I’m looking to have fun but also not get last and embarrass myself so any way to prepare and give me a better form would be great. I haven’t done any races since maybe lower high school.

406,"I'm genuinely in love with my best friend but she's stuck in an abusive marriage. 
We’ve known each other our entire lives, I’ve had a crush on this woman for decades now. I know it’s at least somewhat mutual because occasionally as teenagers we would get drunk and make out, but I was always too nervous to actually Ask Her Out, so eventually another guy did, they started dating, her and I stopped talking, eventually she marries this dude and has a couple of kids. I went through some dark shit completely unrelated to the rest of this situation and wound up a homeless heroin addict. She reached out to me on facebook last year and we started talking again. I never thought I would talk to her again because I assumed she was out living a happy life because it never occurred to me that anyone would ever consider mistreating this amazing woman. Meanwhile, I was out wrecking havoc upon local hardware stores (allegedly) and generally not appreciating life. Her getting back in touch with me after all these years was the kick in the ass I needed, so I decided to cut the shit and get my life back on track. I’ve since gotten clean, started a new job, been saving money and haven’t looked back. Turns out the only reason she married this other guy was because she got pregnant and he’s a lying, abusive, narcissist. She recently took the kids and moved back in with her folks. We have since started hanging out again, sometimes several times a week and talking for hours on the phone almost everyday.   I would like to point out that nothing has happened physically, between us since she’s been married. I told her how I felt about her without making an actual advance. She said she really admires that I am respectful of her situation, and she makes an effort to keep me in her life now. She also really loves her kids, which is so beautiful and sexy to me for some reason. We’ve known each other since WE were kids and now I’ve watched her grow into this amazing, stunning, hilarious woman and I’ve never been more certain of anything in my entire life that I’m completely in love with her. I help her take care of the kids, one’s a baby and the other one is a kick ass little toddler and he fuckin’ loves me. The other day she said, “I’m pretty sure he likes you more than his actual dad, haha” I bought him a toy, felt like being a part of a great thing worth working for. The only problem is she’s still married to this other guy. He constantly belittles her, lies about her to other people and some things she’s told me about him are downright scary. It’s not so much physical, but psychological abuse. She says being around him constantly stresses her out and being around me is very comfortable and relaxing. I always help her where I can and try and make her feel good about herself. Since we’ve been hanging out/she’s been separated she’s gotten a new job and I can tell her self-confidence is rising. She says, however, that she is trying to make absolutely sure her marriage won’t work before filing paperwork because he is the father of her children. I’ve always been a little weird about picking up on signals, but the other day she said, “...I’m super proud of the progress you’ve made in your life...if I were reading a book about you I would absolutely fall in love with your character.” (she words things weird like that, I think it’s beautiful) She also has a hard time looking at me and not smiling. 
I’m so in love with her, if I knew for certain we would eventually end up together I would absolutely wait another 20 years if I had to, but I can’t realistically just put my life on hold and wait around for her marriage to maybe end, right? ",04Mar2019,1
407,"Hi everyone,

  


this is a throwaway account out of obvious reasons. So today, while laying in bed and recently woken up, I played the good 'ol 'beat the living shit out of my dick' game and went really hard at it. I totally destroyed it and after the deed was done I layed in bed for a couple minutes and went up to clean.

  


After I came back I noticed the big ass blood stains on my bed (almost apple-sized) and found the problem.

  


I immediately went to shower and while walking to the washroom with dem bloody bedsheets in my hand, my mom walks past me and notices them. She asked me 'Where does all this blood come from?' to which I answered in panic 'I don't know, it just started showing up somewhere on my butt'. Now they think something's wrong with me and want me to get checked out at a doctor(which, out of obvious reasons, is a big no-no for me).

  


Can you guys help me out. How do I talk my way out of this one? Is there any medical harmless 'excuse' I can give to them? I could pretend visiting the doctor but I'? not sure what to tell them (which sounds plausible.)

409,"I've had a crush on this girl now for 4 years now, on and off. She dated a friend of mine like 5 years ago for a few months and he is already aware of my crush and supports it because he's completely over it. Every time I've worked worked up he courage to do anything it's been too late and she's started dating someone else. 

A few weeks ago she broke up with her boyfriend. I went to a party and she was there. We had stopped talking because he didn't like me at all and I didn't want to have to deal with him. At the party she drank a bit and revealed to me that she ""just wants to have sex"". Me being a massive autist replied with ""don't we all?"". Not a complete fuck up but I didnt know what to do, Ive never had a girl just come out and say something like that. This is followed up with ""I'm on birth control"". I was pretty shocked, she's very conservative and private, it's not something most of her friends would know. I didn't feel comfortable doing anything because she was drunk and it wouldn't sit right with me.

My main question is, have I fucked this? I've already reestablished communication and we talk every night pretty much. Are there any clear signs I can look out for to know if I should be taking it further? I did ask her if she wanted to do anything this last Saturday but it was her grandmothers birthday and she couldn't get out of it but seemed regretful. I don't really have any friends of hers I can ask, the only person who we have in common she doesn't really talk to much. I would like to ask her out for this weekend if possible, but maybe not since we both have exams.

413,"My son is 13. He is in honors classes, has never been in trouble n his life, is very mature, etc. just a nice young man. He met this kid we will call William. So William is not in honors classes with him but they are in gym class together. I would not say they are best friends but it was moving in that direction. My son recently go social media and that seemed to be the thing they were talking about most. 

William has spent the night over here before for a slumber party. He did not make a good impression on my husband and I. He just seemed less mature than the other kids. 

So when my son asked if he could spend the night, I was hesitant, but I allow my teenager to make his own choices regarding friends. 

Everything seemed to go smoothly. I let them make their own pizza and stay up late. 

Woke up Sunday and my husband has an alert on his phone that one of the credit cards was used. After asking our son, it finally comes out that William has bet my son that he could get 10,000 followers on his Instagram account. And he stole our credit card to pull this off. Needless to say my husband was lit up. 

This is the one of the hardest things I have been through as a parent and this is the part it became difficult. Listening to my husband yell at this kid and call him a thief and tell him to get out of our house and that he’s not invited back? It killed us both. This is a 13 year old that made the decision to act like a man and steal. But he’s still a little kid in my eyes. The mom in me wanted to just hold him and tell him it was ok. Watching this kid cry in my house holding his clothes by the front door with the fear in his eyes killed me. But we know he needed the lecture. 

William lives with his stepdad, grandparents and little sisters in a trailer. I’m not sure if he has a mom. They are not wealthy, Hell, I’m not sure if they are even stable. Like it’s the saddest poverty with kids you’ve seen. I have talked to the stepdad numerous times. He always sounds drunk. So I contacted his grandmother to tell her what happened. She says she’s had this problem with William before, and that she said she would pay me back out of her next check (I’m assuming social security). I was able to get the charges reversed (there were 5 attempts on my card, 2 were substantial). 

Here’s where I need advice. I do not want to take money from people who CLEARLY need it. But I want William to have some repercussions. My mom says I should call the police and get William in to deeper trouble. She says that would help him in the long run. What would you do? I know that we all have an opportunity to make William accountable but part of me just wants to stay out of it. 

TLDR: sons friend stole our CC info to purchase Instagram followers while spending the night. We got the charges reversed. Should the police be involved? Should we expect them to pay us back anyway? ",04Mar2019,10

Basically, the dream is that I've fallen in love with someone, and in the end, he died.

This started when i was maybe like 5 years old, I was going to sleep amd when i closed my mind I instantly saw my whole family ind the dark, everything around them and me was just pure darkness except that i could for some reason see them but not my hands or legs.

Just to be clear I was not yet sleeping, I only closed my eyes.

After i was looking at them for some time and asking myself like: What is this, Why am i seeing this

And then comes the scary part, i would start to go deeper and deeper, further away from my family like i am drowning and they are up there looking for me, but there was no water only darkness but something keeps dragging me down and just going further and further away. I cannot explain feeling i felt like my mind was sucking itself out of this universe, what i saw in that darkness, my whole body felt it like i was for real being pulled under.

I just didn't want to open my eyes for some reason, I wanted to go deeper to ""See What Happens"" but after like a minute of that i opened my eyes because i felt so scared that i could not close my eyes for like next 2-3 hours.

After I woke up I stopped thinking about it, tought i was maybe just tired, but then it would happend every single night from that point to maybe a year later.

Every night i would see some other people, sometimes really scary people staring right into my soul, with a scary smile like deformed face with a smile from ear to ear, long arms and fingers,...

And then sometimes they would start chasing me, and after they got close to me since i could't move, i could only watch then i would cut it off and open my eyes, and do not close them again for some time and then after relaxing I finally sleep.

After that whhole year passed i would have those visions more at random, sometimes whole week would pass and i woul'nt see anything.

And now after so long, it came back, every night i see it, but sometimes there are no people there is just pure darkness and me and i would keep going down.

Now i have it almoust every night and i don't know if it will ever stop.

Ok so like many people on planet Earth, I find myself stuck in the same boat as thousands, I’m sure. But why do I feel so alone?

I graduated last year with a Geography degree (2:1), and I am so determined to become an Environmental Consultant in the UK. I want to complete a masters degree in Environmental Consultancy by next year, but I have one underlying issue with my progress. I CAN'T EVEN GET MY FOOT ON THE LADDER. Even if I complete my masters, I’m always going to be let down by my lack of work experience, here’s my problem:

So since last July I have been applying for jobs that are relevant to my desired career but so far, 100% of my efforts have ended in rejection every time. You don’t even know how demoralising and worthless it makes me feel.

To give some background, I didn’t do any university work placements, so I have no relevant experience within environmental consultancy (my downfall). But I’m trying my hardest to get anything that can count as experience. I have written to at least 80 companies asking to shadow people, to complete even a weeks worth of unpaid experience. All to no avail, with only 1 response which ironically stated that I would need some experience to complete work experience??? I am so confused, what the hell do i do? To get experience I need experience. It’s so backwards?! I am constantly volunteering, doing things that are geography related. But obviously this just isn’t enough for an employer.

I know exactly what I want with my career, right down to the very accreditation’s (IEMA &amp; CIWEM). I know where I want to be in 5 and 10 years. I just feel like I have to win the lottery so someone will give me the chance. But I’ve never been a lucky guy so I have to make my own luck. But with my career aspirations, all I’ve ever had is rejection and people telling me I’m not good enough.

It’s got the point where I’m working temporary jobs because it’s all I can get apparently. Am I at that unemployable that all I can get is menial temp jobs!? I would say I’m well skilled and I am so ready to learn and succeed but the opportunity feels like it will never present itself.

443,"Me and my best friend (irl friend met in college 5 years ago) are incredibly close, we speak no less than 12 hours every day because we love speaking to each other

I've never been this close to someone before, and I'm a straight guy (I know this in my heart) but I've been more and more liking him more than a friend but obviously I don't believe I realistically want that it's just I'm not used to being this close to someone as I've always kind of avoided people so maybe this comes into play

I've also suffered a lot of body issues, from age 12 I've been a big guy, at around age 16 I topped out at 300lbs, at 21 right now I'm about 260 and dieting pretty hard to gain some confidence but I'm still pretty fucked up in the head

All the issues I have he doesn't, he speaks to girls regularly (not irl as he never leaves his house but speaks to them online, exchanges nudes with them etc) because he's a good looking guy with a regular body whereas I feel I'm an ugly as fuck guy (sometimes I feel I'm not, the weight doesn't help but my mind is all over the place') with a disgusting body

I find myself unintentionally manipulating him, doing things to bring him away from speaking to other people when we're speaking

If I see he's active on skype when he says he's going off to sleep I panic thinking fuck what if he's speaking to someone else then I'd feel sick imagining it and it's honestly ruining my life, I don't focus on anything I want to do in life because I don't want anyone else to speak to him and I want to speak to him as much as I can (because I genuinely love talking to him)

I think about things I'd love to do in life, hobbies I'd love to take up but then I think about how me being away from the call would mean he talks to girls while I'm gone and I stay to avoid him doing that

It's like a conflict in my head, I know he has the right to speak to other people and I'm more than happy with him speaking to other people but at the exact same time I'm thinking no he can't get close to anyone else or I'll lose everything I have you have to stay

I'm not ignorant, I know this is beyond insanity and I don't know how I got to this point, he's my best friend and I love him like a brother but this shit is tearing me up, I want us both to be happy, I'm trying to focus on weight loss and stuff to improve myself so I can be happy like him but once I see the things he can do that I feel unable to do because of my own issues I just lose all motivation and sink into as low of a hole as one can sink",04Mar2019,2

Her parents planned her a birthday dinner that I was supposed to go to, but will not be able to make if I work, as my shift ends too late. I tried to get my manager to let me switch days, but he said no. I told her this morning that I wouldn't be able to make it, and offered to take her out for lunch, dinner, or to a bar another day. She was pissed. She told me I was bailing last minute  (despite telling her a week ago I'd probably be working thursdays) and asked what she was supposed to tell her parents, because they planned this whole thing. I offered to meet up with them after I get off work, but she has plans afterwards. It sounds like she is really expecting me to call out my first day of work, but I feel this will make me seem unreliable and unprofessional, and could lead to me not landing the position.

It got to a point where I was on the edge of taking my own life. I'd wrote a ""will"", just an email about who can get my stuff and sorting who would care for my dog, I planned where, when and how. 

Then suddenly Kevin Feige came out and announced the schedule for every MCU film up until Avengers 4. This really put some color back into my grey world, the film which I really fell in love with the idea of was Civil War. I thought I'd put it off till after I saw this film. 

However, we are a few years on now and the MCU is going strong, but there is a feeling of an end coming with Endgame. I know they will continue to make films for many years to come, but I've grown to love and admire, maybe got over attached to the characters that are about to be retired. I'm scared that what if I no longer have hope and something to keep me going after phase 3 is done? What then? I don't want to go back to what I once was..

I'm respectful to everyone as much as I can. In school, nobody has a problem with me, I help everyone I can, I dont speak ill, until they make some stupid or rude remark. I find people who stay silent disrespectful in these situations. I think real respect would be to stand up. So, when someone makes a dumb move, such as shouting at his friend in a public place for 15 minutes, I feel the need to stand up for the dude, even if that person is like 20 years older than me. Of course I dont mean parental stuff. That stuff doesnt concern me, obviously.

I'll just post the situation that happened just now. So, there's a card in my country that helps elderly people take their pension. My granddad had a stroke recently. He feels numb half his body, he says %50 or so. He can still walk and eat no problem. But, the retards that live below me took the card from him ""because he cant use it anymore"" and wont give him any money. Just now, my granddad went to second floor and asked them to give his card back. First, I didnt say anything. This literal brainlet, tried to play dumb because stroke also affected his tongue, and he's really old, he speaks fast, but you can make up what he says if you listen close. Of course I didnt mind it and from the first floor, I kindly said that ""he wants his card back"" and this AGAIN, literal BRAINLET tries to play dumb and asks ""HUH?!"" to me like 4 TIMES. She doesnt have any health problems, including ear problems. Finally I snapped and said ""do what you want, shit!"" and left. She obviously shouted back my behind. She's 20+ older than me. I love my granddad. I couldnt stay silent, again. I tried to. I came back home, told my parents and they were mad at me. 

She's literally having a panic attack or something right now. Shouting and getting mad at his 30 year old daughter that still lives with her. Obviously, cursing at me. 

My mom plays the ""what are they going to think, we really raised a great son dont we"" card to me. Classic.

I bought a shotgun a few weeks ago. No intention to kill myself, but man a 12 gauge slug would be painless. I know it's wrong to think these things.

453,"This is most likely going to be very long. And I apologize. I will try to stay...to the point. 

My first love and I broke up in 2014. I left him because I was unhappy. I did not realize it was because I have mental health issues. (That I am now working on with a regular therapist) I thought it was just the relationship. I was too young to understand that I should talk to him about it and work things out. So I left. It was hard on both of us. 

It is still hard on me. I still love him. I still want to be with him. I still think about him daily. 
But I have a kid with someone else. I live with that person. But we are not together. No relations at all. 
My ex didnt do anything wrong. He was great. He is great. I miss him terribly and I love him with everything. 

I recently had a lot of dreams about him. And I was going to message him on Facebook and tell him everything. But I decided not to because I was afraid that he has moved on. I kept telling myself it isn't fair to pop into his life again. I don't know if he is with someone or what he is doing. I cry about him regularly. To the point where my chest hurts so badly my body shakes. About a week ago I went out drinking and was happy and just wanted to share it with him so I decided to FUCK IT I am going to message him. I am blocked. 
Which hurt me not so much because he blocked me but because it made me feel like after all this time he was thinking about me too and I didn't reach out when I had the chance. 

So I need advice. Should I message him? Should I reach out and tell him how much I love him and miss him? Should I let him know if he still loves me I'll drop everything and we can get married and figure everything else out along the way? 
Or should I let him be? 
I honestly don't know what to do. Part of me wants to reach out right now and let him know. But part of me also thinks I should wait until I get an apartment away from my kid's dad. 
Someone please just tell me I'm doing the right thing by waiting or tell me I'm a scared idiot and I need to let him know and stop holding myself back.

455,"I'm a grad student in the first year of my Master's. 

I'm currently navigating school like how I did during my undergrad: I focus on the requirements of upcoming tests/assignments, and I do the work necessary to complete them well. I usually skip the lectures if the class assignments don't include lecture content, which means I skip a lot of my classes (I find that when I do attend those lectures, I struggle to pay attention anyway). I always make sure to contribute at least equally in every group project. 

My program isn't a technical one like STEM. It's more theoretical in the Humanities which includes economics and a lot of philosophy. I don't want to work in Academia in the future. 

I've always been driven to finish school to get these degrees on my resume and move on, but it's clear to me that my classmates do not feel that way for themselves. They actually want to learn and absorb all of the class content, even though I feel like these teachings won't be relevant for the jobs that I personally want for my future.

458,"I got this job about 3 months ago. It’s a position and business that I know nothing about (trucking insurance), but they were willing to train me. It started out fine and I thought it would be an okay fit for me. After I finished my training and took on more responsibilities/started to work independently, I began running into some issues: 

1. I was not trained enough. I can pretty much get by on a daily basis, but I still don’t understand the trucking insurance industry at all. This is a problem because it’s insurance and I don’t know the specifics well enough, so if I don’t ask a million questions a day, I could make a mistake that jeopardizes someones coverage. 

2. The office atmosphere is wacky. There are only 5 people who actually work in the office, including me. My bosses are married. When they’re in the office, they are constantly bickering and fighting over work stuff. The husband loses his shit at the drop of a hat. Last week, they were yelling at each other so loud that someone from the neighboring office came in and asked them to stop.

3. The clientele sucks. They’re shady. Most of them are European and don’t speak english well (I’m not upset that they speak a different language, but the language barrier causes problems when we both don’t understand one another). They don’t want to report certain things, and they fly off the handle when I ask them to turn in reports. Full fledged yelling fits because I’m just trying to do my job. And when they DO turn in reports, they are completely incorrect and I have to go back and forth with them for days at a time about how to accurately and correctly turn in a report. It’s like pulling teeth to get them to turn correct reports in. They don’t care that there are deadlines for these reports. They blatantly ignore them and then it’s somehow my fault if any changes aren’t covered because the report was turned in way past the due date. 

It’s a bad fit. It’s not the job for me. I am unable to let stuff like this roll off of my shoulders. I cried at work the other week, which was so embarrassing. I’ve been having horrible anxiety for the past 3 months. It’s making me feel trapped and it’s taking a big toll on my mental health. 

So I’ve decided I need to put in my 2 weeks notice ASAP. I’ve been applying to other jobs but haven’t heard anything back yet. I have enough money saved to support myself for a year, so it’s not the end of the world if I don’t find something immediately. 

I have this gigantic sense of guilt about putting in my 2 weeks notice. after I leave, one of the employees will be going on vacation for 3 weeks. During these 3 weeks, I was supposed to take on her job (don’t even get me started on that....I have no clue what I’m doing but am supposed to take on another person’s job, in addition to mine, for nearly a month???) Then my bosses are supposed to be going on vacation. 

They probably planned all of this thinking that I would actually be there to fill in. Now I have to go in and pull the rug out from under them and that’s the thing that is making me so afraid. I feel like I’m going to royally fuck them over by putting in my 2 weeks notice. I don’t know how to even go about this. But I know that I need to save myself and leave. I’m just terrified of their reaction and the repercussions of it. 

I have this horrible vision in my head of going in on Friday, giving them my 2 weeks and having to deal with them losing their shit on me because of the position I’m putting them in. What if things turn hostile? Do I just leave right then and there?

So I just came back from vacation. I got wind that I was to be moving offices as there has been a change in organisational structure. I found out that i was being moved next to a man, I'll call him F, who has a horrendous farting problem. Its almost constant and his gas is....potent...to say the least, for example, if he has recently farted, people avoid going to that office if they can. 

EVERYONE knows about this guy and its become  bit of a running joke (which I don't participate in).
I have no idea why this guy farts so much, possibly a medical condition but everyone (besides me and one other person) has all been working here since the 70s/80s and everyone knows everything about everybody. As far as people are concerned, F just farts because he can. 

What I'm really asking is how do I deal with this? I have an anxiety condition that causes me to have nausea quite regularly (company doesnt know this due to health insurance purposes) and his farts are probably going to throw me over the edge at least once. As far as im aware, F doesnt know people make fun of him or that they are bothered by his gas, and if he does know, he really doesnt care. Apparently he has been like this for at least 15 years but only stopped having a private office over a year ago so up till then it didnt really bother anyone unless you were in his private office with him.. 

Can I report him? I mean I feel like management wont take me seriously (I was sexually harrassed 2 years ago and it wasnt taken seriously*). Also I really dont want to offend him so should I even report this? 

(Btw: I have tried the obvious, cooling fan to waft away smell, air fresheners, really strong smelling hand cream to sniff when the worst happens. Nothing has really worked) 


Please help! 

Tl;dr: my new cubicle neighbour has a really bad problem with potent farting. Its so bad that it makes me sick. I really dont want to offend him but is there any other way to deal with this besides reporting him?

Obviously I've said no (even if I weren't gay, I still don't believe in these kinds of arrangements) but that doesn't cut it for them, which is why I secretly rented a place and I've little by little moved my things there. I'm planning on informing them tomorrow about my moving. 
To be honest I'm just about to lose it. It's almost to the point where either I move out or I end up going on a downward spiral again.

Should I come out too or just move?
(They'd hate me either way simply for moving out)
Do I need to get anyone legally involved just in case?
(Might get physical I'm honestly not sure)
Anyone else in this situation? How did you go about it?

477,"I have Lyme disease and I get massages now and then as part of my therapy. The massages releases toxins from my muscles, etc and after a day or two of feeling bad, I feel a bit better. I'm in my 40s, married with kids.

I have been going to this local place for like 5 years without any issues. They have great Yelp reviews, half of which are by women, I see women in there when I go to get massages almost every time I'm in there, I have even sent my son to get a massage from there. I also researched and made sure they were not on any shady happy ending type review websites.

So, a couple of years ago, I'm getting a massage like normal, and the woman grabs for my penis. I push her hand away and tell her no and put my own hand on my penis to cover it and I ejaculate a little.

I left the place and never went back. I didn't say anything to anybody because I felt gross and guilty, like I did something bad. I felt sort of violated.

After a few months, I was feeling bad from the Lyme and wanted to try some other massage place so I researched Yelp, shady review sites, etc to find a place that didn't show up on any shady site, had good Yelp reviews and made sure a lot of them were by women.

I find a place and go every couple of months without an issue then one time the woman massaging me sort of grazed my groin area a little too close. She didn't grab my penis or anything but she came close. I froze and felt sick to my stomach. She didn't do anything more than that but I left and never went back to that place either.

I have given up on massages. I can't afford the fancy places that push for memberships, etc. I didn't tell my wife out of shame and I don't want to upset her. I just feel horrible. I didn't go to those two places looking for anything, I didn't ask for anything, nor was I asked for anything. The first lady just sort of grabbed at me and the other one came close (or it may be my imagination, I just don't know).

Anyway, I just feel horrible and ashamed like I cheated or something",04Mar2019,4

479,"Hi internet people,

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker, I don't usually post but at the moment I am pretty close to rock bottom emotionally and thought I would reach out for some advice because I do not know who else to ask. It is a long story as usual, and I do not write much anymore so I will try to give enough information so hopefully you can somewhat grasp my situation and offer some words.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I had a short relationship with a girl from the internet. Knocked her up, she refused to have an abortion. I didn't really speak to her during the pregnancy mostly just hoping it wasn't really mine. DNA testing proved otherwise. She turned out to be neglectful and unable to take care of the child leading to me getting full custody. After quite a drawn out legal process she decided she'd rather just bail and terminate her rights. At this point I haven't heard from her in 6 years or so.

&amp;#x200B;

Current overview: I am a 30 year old male, with an 8 year old son.  My mother and step-father have stepped in to help with him since the beginning, in fact my son calls my mom mother. He lives with them, which is about 20 minutes from where I live. I typically go visit him everyday after work and stay there until he goes to bed. This situation has never been ideal, but is the best option I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 8 years or so I have done my best to be there for my son. I give money to my parents whenever they ask to pay for his expenses. I spend almost all my free-time with him. Recently, however I have really started to realize how much I hate my life. I basically just work my 9-5 and then go to my parents to attempt to spend time with my son. It varies how valuable that time really is, like maybe sometimes we really play together but more recently I have had a hard time making myself do that and I end up on my phone more then I should. I have no friends, no girlfriend, and for the most part no real hobbies. I dabble in many things like biking, hiking, guitar, video games, etc. Mostly I feel too depressed to do much. This past weekend I didn't leave my apartment and mostly just slept and played on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to force myself to workout, or study to move up in my job. I just can't get myself to do it. I have gone on some dates on tinder here and there, but end up just more sad then before even if I get laid. Everything I do seems meaningless. The one thing I did have some hope for was saving up to buy a house. That hope has somewhat faded now as my mom has started to demand I pay more money every month on top of them now claiming my son for tax purposes, which they didn't use to do. That basically takes up the extra money I was saving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to ramble now, but I do not know how to organize this and I guess I just need to rant a little bit. The main thing for me is that I am an introvert and I really do not feel I can relate to anyone. I have no close relationships, when all I really want is to be in love again. Unfortunately for me, I was sexually assaulted when I was 5 years old and now I am only attracted to younger girls. I keep it legal, but even me trying to talk to an 18-25 year old is pretty strange especially when it comes out I have an 8 year old son. Due to all of this I feel doomed and don't see myself finding the sort of girl I am attracted to that will also be interested in me. I am just cog in the wheel, working to pay bills and not really saving much of anything. I do not remember the last time I had a ""good"" day. I would probably never kill myself because I am not quite that selfish, but I do often wish I could just cease to exist.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what I am expecting from this, and I know I just threw a bunch things in there and didn't unpack them much. If you are generally interested in providing advice and would like some more details about any part of this just ask. Anything would be helpful I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this, thank you for your time.

Me: why it’s boring? 
Him: you know just classes all day and everyone who work with me didn’t have to take classes so I was alone and bored
Me: well I am glad you’re home safe and you got your classes done.
A week later on the weekend, we’re watching tv and having our morning coffee, he got up to use the bathroom, his phone was on the table and it rings. He got this notification form his BOSS saying:
What is this receipt for 150$ at a club? You took people out to a club and you used the company card! That’s not nice! I am going to approve it but we gonna have to talk about it!
Now I was in shock but didn’t say anything because I was speechless. He came back I told your phone ringed, he read the text and didn’t tell me anything he started texting back and forth and looked mad! I asked him what’s going on he said nothing. I was thinking well damn I have to know what’s going on! I mean if he’s not going to tell me I am going to find out! I went through his phone one day and that’s what I found.
He texted his boss: it was not people out of the company it was (sarah). 
His boss: well we have yo ask when the company card was used in a club. 
Long story short he got so mad at his boss. 
I confronted him about it.
He said during his classes he met this lady that work for the same company but in (different state)
She wanted to talk about problems at work she’s going through. By the way ( it is not his job to listen to co workers problems) 
He said: I had already planned on going to this nice jazz restaurant to have dinner and listen to music. And she asked if she can talk to me about her work problems and I invited her to go with me. We walked from the hotel to the restaurant had dinner and drinks and came back to the hotel. (I found out it was around 11 or 12 at night). 
I got mad and I said: well if she wants to talk do you have to invite her to dinner? I mean you could have have coffee the next morning? 
Him: it doesn’t matter it wouldn’t make a difference, and we just talked about work! Nothing happened and I love you! I was just bored and alone there for 3 days! It was just strictly business. 
Me: but you’re not her boss! She just wanted to rant and vent about her work! 
Him: that’s still business and consider business dinner.
Me: ok why you didn’t tell me? Why did you say you were alone all 3 days?
Him: I didn’t want you to get me wrong and didn’t want drama.

I got an email that they are going to withdraw me this week If I do not pay off the balance so I went to financial aid to see what I can do. They said that I have a TAP grant from NY State for a small amount that I can take, and that you can take out a parent PLUS loan for some of it, but that the rest would have to be out of pocket which I know might just be impossible on short notice and is completely my fault. They said that you could talk to the bursar (not financial aid) and they are happy to set up a payment plan so that you can have a couple of months to pay off the balance.

One of the ladies i spoke to on the phone said theres a faint possibility if she can pull up the email on her phone and show the ticket agent that theyll help her out but she'll have to get there early and its not a guarantee.

a) he gets milk and newspapers delivered to his door daily.
b) he is irritated when parcels etc are kept outside the door when i intentionally try to keep them out for long he gets the security to remove them and gives them back about 3 days later.

492,"My best friend was killed in a motorcycle accident, a little over a year ago. He and his long time girlfriend had split up about six months before he passed away. She always thought that some day the two of them would get back together and get married and live happily ever after. She was never a religious person before this. After he passed away she had a very intense breakdown and ended up in the hospital for her depression. 

This is what has been happening: Apparently she watched some video on YouTube that played a specific frequency which unlocked her third eye. She wanted this so that she could see him again. According to her it worked and she was able to hang out with his spirit several times. She would even text me and ask me if I wanted her to tell him anything because he was in the room with her. I asked her to stop and that what I thought she was doing was inconsiderate, since I don’t believe in religion or ghosts or anything. These moments were short lived for her because apparently she didn’t know how to control her third eye and she is now possessed by a demon. For the last year her social media posts have turned insanely, horrifyingly religious. Talking about the end of days, demons and saving souls. The real heavy stuff. She has also apparently started to visit with “shamans” who have “removed” her anxiety in the form of fire by using music. She has also been taking classes from these people on how to banish demons from people. She has also started to express all the classic cult signs by saying things like these people are the only ones who understand, We are all sheep who have been blinded by things like magic and witchcraft that are embedded in pop culture. 

I’ve tried to go along with stuff casually and without judgement but I’m starting to get really worried. She recently told me that the Holy Spirit told her to stop taking her meds. Not good. I asked her mom if the doctors authorized this and she said know. Her parents are aware of what’s happening but I’m worried they’re hoping it’ll just sort itself out. Has anyone had to help a friend through a situation like this? Is it a lost caused?

494,"Hi! A little lost on what to do here. I got a basic, minimum wage job that worked well whilst I was studying my degree so I'm not currently unemployed... 

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking for a new job around October last year and sent an application in for this one in particular. It's in an industry I'd really love to work in but it's known for being kind of ""unprofessional"" in a lot of ways, except this is a ""big"" company within that industry. I had my first interview in November, followed by 4 other interviews, two ""tasks"" and an interview with the CEO. In mid-January I got offered the position and it paid much more than minimum wage - I was so excited as this could be the start of a career I could actually grow in. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, they couldn't give me a start date. They said they are signing new investors and there's ""legal mumbo jumbo"" to sort out. Another few weeks passed and they said the transaction was signed and it was a matter of just getting the money that was promised, it would only take about a week. It's been nearly 3 weeks since and I've still heard nothing. They have kind of kept in touch and I did address my concerns to them about it falling through which they said would be nearly impossible at this point.

495,"I’m on mobile, sorry for weird format.

I’m a freshman in high school and am halfway through the school year.  I made a really good friend after a while and usually see him about once or twice a day.  He is in one of my classes (History) and it’s not uncommon to see him in the hallways, so I always give a friendly wave and say hello.  When I see him in history, he sits right next to me, and I always like to shoot him up and ask him what’s going on.  He will always have something interesting to say and something new to share, so it’s always good, and we also text over Snapchat.  While in class, he usually will ask me something to start a small conversation or show me something on his phone.  Not a problem, but just trying to show that he’s very outgoing to my knowledge.  He will often try to show and talk to me about things that make me uncomfortable, but we always both end up laughing about it, so I just assume that he’s joking.  But then, he started touching me.  It started off small, like poking me when I walk by or when I least expect it, which I again, never thought was weird.  However, it started to get more...  personal.  He would frequently start doing things like squeezing my thigh, putting his hand on my back, and rubbing my shoulder very slowly.  If you couldn’t already guess, I’m a straight male, and he is also male.  Now, I thought this was weird, but sort of brushed it off, but it was still in the back of my head.  I never asked him to stop nor said anything about it, so he continued.  I never thought too much into it but certainly questioned it.  A few months later, he texted me, extremely pissed, about to have a breakdown.  This was very unusual for him, since he was always in a very happy mood and was a really good kid.  I asked him what was wrong, and he said that his mom had smashed his phone on the ground and broke it.  I asked him to elaborate, and he said that he came home with a bad grade on his progress report (not his report card, mind you) and she got extremely mad at him and smashed his phone.  He sent a picture of it, and sure enough.  It was broken beyond repair.  I asked him how he was texting me, and he said that he was using his laptop.  We are both pretty tech-savvy, so I understood.  He was texting me, telling me what had happened, while I was trying to calm him down.  I don’t have the original conversation, because he deleted it, but he said that he was about to break his computer, his TV, yell at his mom, and run out of the house.  He was telling me that he was having a really hard time keeping his cool, and I asked him if this was normal.  He explained to me that it was, and how much of a shit-hole his home life was.  I was eventually able to calm him down and convince him that it would get better, and to control his anger.  It took a long time, but he assured me that it was okay, but was super pissed.  I told him to talk to me at school tomorrow.  After that, I was gathering my thoughts and I connected his niceness at school to his shit-hole at home, and explained the weird behaviors.  I never told him this, but the next day at school, he explained everything to me, and brought in his broken phone.  He was very close to me and had his hand on my shoulder a lot.  That was what I needed to sort of validate my claim.  This was about a month or two ago, and he’s gotten closer to me since then.  I don’t know whether he’s gay or not, but I’m pretty sure he is.

When I was in high school I was incredibly insecure about my self, mostly my body, sooooo anytime a guy would show interest in me, I would pull away. I’ve never been in a real relationship. However, my self confidence has improved a lot since then, and I’m a lot more comfortable with myself. 
 
However, now it’s my complete lack of sexual experience that makes me feel insecure now. Overall it has made me feel an immense amount of inadequacy. 

I wouldn’t have a problem finding some random bar guy to have sex with me, I’m pretty average looking.

She didn't tell me directly that she smokes so to her I don't know what she does. I feel like if i confront her she'll just lie and blow up on me. I wouldn't be surprised If she said things like ""I don't care."" Or ""So what?"". She is a person who has a lot of attitude, plays the victim and a bit difficult to handle overall but she's my sister and I still love her. I don't want to see her doing something like this so young. 

I told my brother about everything and we both believe it would be best if I confront her first and if worst comes to worst then our parents. I'm planning to just talk to her by myself when I come home but how I do this without making her run off and understand. Maybe I should tell her this last so she doesn't run off but she doesn't stop and If I catch her then I'm going to tell our parents...

Now provided my current financial condition i can barely manage 1000$ max per semester but seeing all these great opportunities in great universities being barred due to financial issue really breaks my heart.

So my question is, should i opt for taking a student loan?
Is it worth it or is it better to study in a cheap university in my home country than to take a loan?
I am really desperate here, i think i am pretty good in my academics and can easily get into my desired university but the financial aspect is awfully confusing so a little advice would be appreciated.

504,"Hey guys, I need some help.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. TLDR at the bottom.

My mother has had major abdominal pains and headaches for a couple of years now, they come and go. We have gone to the doctors plenty of times and all have led to normal results. It all boiled down to my mother having very bad anxiety. It got so bad that now her body is in pain due to it. I believe that she is a hypochondriac. This has developed a cycle where her pain she gets from stress has now stressed her out which causes more pain which leads to more stress.

The doctors have tried to put her on antidepressants but my mother refuses as she has been grown up to believe that being on medication for mental issues shows that you are a weak person. She was also grown up to not really believe in mental health issues and thinks that her physical pain does not root from her mental pain. 

She is also from a country that heavily believes in pseudoscience and so as a result has contacted ""witch doctors"" that have told her that these pains are from individuals cursing her for her wealth. She does not see how this is a blatant scam. This is causing her to be more stressed out and increases her suffering.

I dont know what to do anymore as she does not listen to any family members and any medication for her anxiety she refuses to take. 

What should I do?

TLDR; My mother has suffered physical pains rooting from her bad mental health. The pain has caused a vicious cycle of stress which leads to more pain. She wont listen to family and any medicine for her anxiety she wont take. What do I do?",04Mar2019,1

507,"One thing I’ve always had issues with is that I’m scared to do certain things, especially job-wise. Here are a few examples:

1. I was an assistant for a yoga class (unpaid). I’m supposed to correct any mistakes and demonstrate poses. For some reason, I’m terrified of correcting people. If I know someone is doing a pose incorrectly or struggling, I’ll sometimes pretend to ignore it or swiftly move past them so the teacher can correct. I don’t know what I can do to correct them, how to explain it, or if they are actually going to their limit, so I just move along. 

2. When I was a lifeguard, I would pretend to not see kids hanging on the rope because I am scared of telling them not to do it. If kids were too small to go down the slide, I would also act like they were not because I was scared of telling them they’re not tall enough or maybe I was wrong. Once a little girl was hanging on a rope in the shallow end and she needed help but for some reason I wanted to be SURE she actually needed help. 5 minutes later I ended up helping. This also happened when it thundered. I didn’t call anyone out of the pool, just to be SURE I heard it correctly. Even if I knew, I waited for someone else to call thunder. It’s like I’m scared to yell, “Thunder! Everyone out!”. 

3. When I bathed dogs and owners requested to clean the glands, I would have trouble doing so and just say I did them when I really didn’t. If I was struggling to do it correctly, I was scared the dog would freak, or that my co-workers would be annoyed I asked them for the 30th time on how to do it. 

It’s not that I’m lazy because I CAN do it, it’s just that I hold myself back and I don’t know why. I’m terrified of holding a job because every one I’ve had, I act like everything is fine when it’s not. Maybe it’s a confronting/communication issue? I grew up sheltered and used to be scared to even tell my order to a server. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. ",04Mar2019,2

510,"Hi all I am hoping to start a discussion and gain some insight on each side of the argument for the situation I’m in regarding my current job promotion offer.

Hi there.  I will try to keep this as short as possible..

I received a job promotion offer today which I’m extremely grateful for and happy that I was successful enough to have this opportunity to move up in my company.  Here’s the thing....

So I’ve been in my current role since June of 2018.  There are 5 employees in my role and I’ve been in the company and role 2nd longest on the team.  A co worker of mine has been with this company and same role since April of 2018..

So when I was recruited and hired in June I was given a.l job offer than was paying very well for my position (a sales development rep) I had the industry experience as well as software experience they needed.  On top of the experience I had a strong track record of success in previously roles. Due to the above and the fast growth of our tech company they hired me with the intentions of promoting me to an account executive position as soon as a position opened up and obviously as long as I performed.  

Fast forward to Jan of this year(2019). It was announced that the conworker who started in April was getting promoted to the AE position. It was great to see them promote and fill roles from within.  This co worker was good at the SDR role and had been there longer so it was a totally valid move by the company.  

From that point I started having conversation I would be next.  All was great and I was indeed performing at a high level.  I was always a top 1 or 2 performer according to our KPI’s.  If you are not familiar with the SDR role..simplistically, my job was to make outbound  contact with enterprise sized organization that could potential use our solution and peak their interested and qualify that they indeed could benefit and use our solution.  From there I set up a demo with an AE who goes over our solution and decided if there is an opportunity with that prospect.  If so I get credit for sourcing the opp.  That was our main KPI.  That was our whole job for the most part.

Well we are growing very fast so our AEs has bandwidth issues so I actually worked a couple deals myself and closed a deal on my own which no other SDR has even came close to doing.  My point is, I was performing and exceeding the expectations set for me by upper management.

So fast forward to last week I told that at the stat of Q2 they will promote me to AE the fact I closed a deal as an SDR they were really impressed.

So here’s the deal.  When I started here I had a base salary that was 10k more than the other 4 SDR reps on our team.  Our commission plans and structure were all the same which was if We hit out commission plan at 100% we would make 35k in commissions for the year.  So I get the contract and look at the pay raise they offer me.  It is a 5k bass salary increase and a 15k commission plan increase.  So total salary increase is 20k.

The guy who was promoted in January who had a base salary of 10k less than me received a salary increase as follows.  15k base increase and a 25k commission increase if he hits goals at 100%. 

So basically they are paying me much much less on my promotion than the other guy because I was getting paid more to begin with.  The whole reason I got more was because I had experience and was expected to be a top performer which I absolutely was.  

Is this type of treatment and process normal?  I’m pretty irritated that my promotion was not the same % that the guy before me was.  Obviously I can negotiate and counter offer but i can’t help but feel like I’m getting screwed a little bit.  My numbers have been better than his overall and I even closed a deal on my own.  How should I handle this ?  Is it normal?  Any upper management out there that can touch on this subject?  I’m assuming they do not know that I know how much bigger his promotion was worth than mine.  

What’s your opinion and how would you handle this reddit?

512,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Longtime lurker, first post on Reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a point in my life where I have absolutely no idea where my life is going to go and what to do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

\- 25 F/living with parents (culturally - usually whats supposed to happen until we get married but parents are ok with me moving out)

\- Grew up with an alcoholic parent. They ended up getting a heart issue - quit alcohol 2 years ago - but absolutely no remorse for what they made us go through as a family and we don't have much of a r/s. Also stopped working (previously an engineer). I've personally gone to therapy to help myself with all the trauma I went through

\- I have been working since I was 15 (various jobs) and ended up getting into the corporate world right after graduation. Currently at a startup. Degree in Accounting. 

\- Working at a startup is amazing - but its failing. Inevitably, we have a few weeks before doors close (unless funding comes through) 

\- Currently have a side-hustle which I absolutely LOVE working on (also generates revenue), but with working crazy hours it doesnt get as much love as it should. 

\- 30K in savings (no car - lost it in an accident) 

\- no debt

&amp;#x200B;

I worked very hard over the last 10 years to make sure I can get solid jobs - but the more I'm in this world the more I'm realizing it's not all that it's meant to be (I was previously laid off due to corporate restructuring as well).

&amp;#x200B;

With my recent car accident - almost going to lose my job - need to manage family funds as the sole earner (Family of 4) - sponsor my grandfather because he is recently widowed - I feel like **I need a BREAK.**

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to pack my stuff and travel OR just work on my side-hustle full time. But with all the obligations, the burden to carry the family (who hold at least 120K in debt that I need to manage) + my desire to just LIVE MY LIFE AS A NORMAL 25 YEAR old is killing me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have no idea what to do. I feel helpless. I love entrepreneurship - I love starting and building businesses (built 2 that failed previously while working at other corporate jobs) - and yes I understand that entrepreneurship is all about taking that risk and jumping, but at this time I'm not sure if that's the right move to make. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 and just want to be able to LIVE! I know these are my years to clutch and make the best memories - and they are slowly withering away. I'm not sure if this is considered a quarter-life crisis, or just really a situation I've been going through for a while and have come to a dead-end in at this age LOL. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated.

Over the last two years she has probably given me $2,500. I have tried so hard to let me pay her back in installations, but she won’t hear of it. She said she doesn’t need it and she was happy to help me keep my house.

So my sister she lives here now ( she was with my other sister but it went bad) she was sleeping on the couch in my living room but is now in my room because she fell out with our house mates (the couple), like we had a bad situation but because she’s unable to just not say her opinion all the time she made the situation way worse for us all with the horrible couple (to get us back they trashed the house, throw our stuff in the bin, throw stuff on the walls ...etc) so she’s away from them in my room, now I have to sleep in my friends bed with her. So when my friends boyfriend comes around I have no where to go.
My sister is trying to find a job but isn’t having any luck at all. I’m afraid it’s her attitude that is making it not work for her, she is forcefully spiritual, she is rude, she’ll play mind games with me and do little things to gain power like making people wait or do things for her when it’s not needed then gets mad when you call her out for being so unreasonable, she’s manipulative, I love her to bits and I feel like the way he acts is not her fault but I just can’t deal with this anymore, the only place she can go back to is France to my mums house, it’ll be harder to find work for herself there but I just can’t afford to pay for her anymore and take care of her when I’m tying to learn how to do it myself, I’m not the most stable person in the world at all.
What do I do? Should I tell her to go to France p my mums house ? Om moving out soon and I’m afraid she’ll have to come with me and I just want to start fresh, I’m not a psychologist so I just fix her, I really don’t want to live with her.

521,"Someone new started in my department last month in the same role as me. I was excited because I’ve been doing the work on my own up to this point in a new area of the business. They transferred internally so they already had some base understanding to build off of but are now working with new systems and processes. Many of the processes are still kinda rough, not documented, or not figured out as it’s still pretty new work. 

Anyway, it’s been a couple weeks and they have been acting in a way I can only describe as strange. We did some initial training when they first started during which they barely asked any questions. I figured, no biggie it’s a lot to take in and I’m sure stuff will come up later. It did not come up later... It’s the not asking question at all that weird me out since literally no one else in the organization does this work so it’s not like there are many other people to go to. I had to pretty much figure things out from nothing when I started and build the model. 

Today I was working in a system that I know they hadn’t used in their previous role and offered to train them on it only to learn they’d already been using it with projects I handed off to them. I was pretty taken aback. They pieced together enough information to figure it out which I guess is basically what I did but I don’t get why they didn’t just ask for my help. It would have been way easier and I’d already offered to show them. In fact I though it was pretty clear that it was something I would be covering with them as part of their training. I feel like they don’t respect my process for doing things. Since I’m the only one who has done this work before I assumed they’d learn my process. 

I’m really thrown off balance here. I guess if I’m being honest it’s in part because I thought I’d have seniority having been the first to work in this area. I have to admit I’m definitely feeling a bit threatened and maybe a little intimidated by this. They talk in meetings like they’ve been doing this work for weeks and never defer to me. I’ll admit this probably sounds like I’m being sensitive but I’ve never been treated that way by a new coworker. I feel totally steamrolled over. They obviously have a less collaborative working style then me and I can’t help but be disappointed. 

How do I handle this new dynamic? I don’t feel like I can ignore it because they’re very ambitious and I need to make sure I’m looking out for myself.

525,"Hello all, is my first post here and will try to be as short as possible but it's getting too much for me..

I'm 20m, and in September last month my relationship with my first real girlfriend of 3 years and a half went to a full stop. 

The relationship was really passionate, and I don't know how to explain it but it was really MORE than just a first relationship. Love in first sight, she was my best friend and we shared everything. We both have big personal issues, went through the same shitty childhood of father abandon and dysfunctional families. It was really special and I really loved her 

On the other hand, we were breaking up every three weeks, the ups were amazing but the downs were horrible. I cheated on her by messages once after she cheated on me physically after a year and a half, ""cheated"" on me by messages twice again then she left for some other dude when the relationship was basically us not speaking for over a week and not sleeping (not even in the same bed) for about two weeks. 

Once she was with that dude she was still speaking to my mother about how she loves me and wants to be with me in the future etc (my mom is a psychologist of some sort and asked me if it was okay if she still helped her, I said yes). Later on, we started speaking again and she was telling me about how she misses me and all and sent me a song she sang about how we could be together again.. It was around December I guess. 
Then, around January, she was watching every Instagram stories I'd post and when I went to the hospital she messaged me asking how I was, being nice and there for me. 

When we broke up, she'd always tell me she'd always be there for me and all. In February, I lost my shit and sent her messages alike ""I miss you so much, I need you, I've never felt this bad"" etc. She never answered and her new boyfriend texted me. 

Now, I know I can't get back with her but my life is shit right now.
I'm having anxiety attacks at work, when I come back home, and I'm feeling depressed all the time. I've been told by a professional that I might have real depression but currently am living it on my own and I'm not being followed by any psychologist or anything. 

I've stated going boxing three times a week, thinking it would help but it's not helping.

528,"Hey everyone,  sorry if this has been asked a million times before but I've had a very long weekend spent frustrated at myself for this and I dont know how to overcome it. 

I am a 25 year old guy who's never had much luck when it comes to dating and trying to meet people. I'm a little on the bigger side, so while I am trying to lose weight, I know that isnt everyone's cup of tea, no worries. 

Where the issue comes in is that back in high school, I asked a girl out and she rejected me by telling me that she ""didnt want (me), nobody ever will, and (i) would be better off dead."" Obviously this is super fucked up to tell anyone ever and I doubt is true, but it's been something that has been hanging over my head ever since. This one moment in my life has affected me with every interaction I've had with someone I find interesting or attractive and I'm tired of it at this point. 

I am actively seeing a mental health professional to aid me in the long depression that my upbringing and this event have had me under for a long time, but about 5 years ago, I just sort of... gave up trying to meet people and date after I found out the girl I was seeing had been sleeping with another man behind my back. I found this out on my birthday that year. 

However recently I've decided that I want to try and meet someone. I want to date. I want to experience life with someone by my side. The only problem is I'm extremely shy and working up the nerve to talk to women I dont know while I'm out with my friends absolutely terrifies me. This all has come to a head when this past Friday I was at a local bar for a rock show with a friend of mine and sitting across from me was a young woman probably not much younger than myself (the bar is 21+ only after 9pm) who I found to be VERY attractive. 

Over the course of the night we kept looking at each other frequently and laughing a lot any time the singer of the band made a joke. I wouldnt have expected it to really lead anywhere but I really wanted to buy this girl a drink! Unfortunately, I got too nervous and in my head about the whole situation and when I finally worked up the nerve to ask if I could buy her a drink, she had left while I was in the restroom. I've been angry at myself ever since. 

So, reddit, how can I overcome my shyness and nerves and avoid situations like this in the future? 

Tl;dr- a bad upbringing and history of rejection has made me very shy and nervous when it comes to meeting women, how to stop being so shy and nervous?",04Mar2019,2

530,"A new ""friend"" of mine doesn't want to report her sexual harrassment and I don't really want to be friends with her anymore. I'm of the opinion where trying and failing is better than doing nothing. I told her to take all the time she needs to recuperate and that reporting will still be an option if/when she's ready. But honestly, I can't sympathize with her anymore. She confides in me often about unwanted touching/sexual harrassment at work/parties/clubs and I just do not have the capacity to sympathize anymore.

534,"Hi r/Advice,

A few years back, I fell into the worst depressive state of my life. Had been building up for a long time. Spent a few days in a hospital, started seeing a therapist, took antidepressants (which I support but will not be taking again), and eventually got to a great place.

Currently a university student. My first year at a school out of my state. I moved here and knew nobody, but have met a lot of people. I have 2 friends who I consider close, hang out with them every weekend and sometimes during the week. I stay active and am a fairly average student academically.

Ever since I moved states away from all of my friends and family, I have been fairly anxious and sad, but I assumed that to be nothing but a product of change. I was in a fine place for a while, but the past month and a half or so have been very rough. A lot of stress and anxiety had been building up over that time and about a week ago I exploded and had a terrible night, which of course, carried through the week. During that week there was a little bump for me in my relationship with one of my friends, whom I’d been having somewhat of a benefits situation with, and I realized that our situation was probably unhealthy for me. I want to remain friends, but I don’t know if I can get over my feelings.

I miss my friends and family more than anything. I play Xbox with my friends once or twice a week and call my family regularly, but it’s nothing like actually being in their company. My grandfather and father have just gone in together on a condominium close to campus where I will be staying for the foreseeable future. This is a stress reliever, as I won’t have to worry about finding a place to live and I’ll be paying fairly low rent to them. But, for me, I think that just sealed me into staying here for the next few years.

I am also trying to gain residency at my university, so my tuition won’t be through the roof for the rest of my academic career. This means I won’t be able to visit home until August. All of my friends will be living at home, as most of them go to school in-state. I fear I will miss out on a lot. 

My weeks have become me getting through classes while working out a few times per week, just trying to get to the weekend. When I finally make it, I drink with friends, which is fun and we are moderate, or I might drink a bit on my own and question everything. I make it to church on Sunday and try to get whatever salvation I can. I am part of a bible study group that meets once per week during the week, and I’ve met some great people and I am believing in the faith.

Overall, life has been a little dim and I think I am becoming quite depressed. I still have a decent outlook, but really I just don’t want things to get worse.

Any advice from someone whose been through a situation similar? Maybe someone who is in or a graduate of collage that could help? 

Sorry for the long post. Lots of love. xx",04Mar2019,2
535,"Hi, thanks for replying. So I dated a girl for approximately a year and a half. We’ve been through a lot together including having to take her to the ER at 2 AM on my birthday for terrible cramps and pay a 1,000 dollar bill. In return with her being an extrovert, she brought me out of my shell to meet new people and friends. So the last couple of months we had been fighting a lot. She is young and I feel as though I always had to be the voice of reason. Don’t get me wrong I am not perfect, but I didn’t want to keep beating a dead horse. So we broke up two weeks ago and mutual agreed that we wanted to work on ourselves and not date others any time soon. Thursday I actually cooked dinner at her place and things got heated in a good way later that night. Fast forward to friday we were at a bar with mutual friends. She asked if I would buy her a drink and I caved in. I could tell she was already tipsy. Not long after I see her on the other side of the bar with another guy kissing on her and putting his arm around her. I tell my friend that I had to go because I couldn’t be there with that going on. Through out the time that I was driving back home she was drunk texting me “where are you” “you have a place with me”. The next morning she texted me saying the feels like a real bitch and that she’s sorrry if she hurt me. She said that she even kick the guy in the nuts because he was talking shit about our mutual friend. However, I cannot get that image out of my head. I sobbed while driving home, the next morning I felt like telling her to fuck off, and now I just feel dead inside. I’m not sure how to process it all.

536,"Hey guys I made an account just to post this, it's a long post but it's something that's been weighing on me for years.  


I live with my grandparents and have been doing so (like full on have a room and all my belongings) for 2 years, I moved in for college because their place was closer to school than my shitty apartment and my parents place was way too far. I'm 24 and although I'm not where I'd like to be in life I'm trying, I'm leaving for the army soon (something I've always wanted to do) and spend my time trying to be a photographer (what I studied, but is it ever hard to get paying clients even though im really skilled), volunteering at my city's homeless shelter, and working as a photo assistant.  


I love my grandparents to death but I can't stand something about them: their son.  


He's 45 or 46 and a total piece of shit. He acts like a wanna be thug,  and is just a junkie (sorry if that sounds harsh). He doesn't respect them (always arguing like a teenager with them), refuses to seek treatment and is an absolute leech.   
My grandparents don't ask me to pay rent so thankfully I can put all my money back into my student loans, but I help out with everything (I do all the chores, I replaced some of their windows, painted the house a couple of times, change their tires, etc..) whilst he does literals nothing around the house and has a sense of entitlement.  


He has lived with them since as long as I can remember and has never moved out. I get that people have financial problems (myself included) but that doesn't excuse being a shitty human being.   


Here are a few examples of what a garbage human being he is:  


1. Recently got a car (2018 model) that he tricked my grandma into co-signing on, effectively tanking her into \~30k in debt (because there is no way in hell he will pay it off, and missed the very 1st two payments). When my grandma asks him about money for HIS CAR he gets frustrated and says a bunch of nonsense. Quote: ""what, do you want me to do rob a bank?"" ""I'm gonna get a gun and rob someone, then you'll have the money, but don't be mad about the consequences"". That was literally 2 days ago.  

2. He has threatened my self (even when I was a teen and making innocent questions : what do you for a living?  ""that's none of your business watch what I'm gonna do when you're 18."") and my grandpa (something along the lines of watch when you sleep).  

3. My grandparents constantly give him chances to change (like more than 20) but he squanders them and doesn't care. They pay for counselling/ addiction services he doesn't go.  

4. He has 3 kids but doesn't care to take care of them, my grandparents go pick up my cousins (sort of to force him to spend time with them) but all he does is watch TV.  


the list can go on forever.  


I'm not naive, I understand that addiction is a real nightmare but what can I do/ tell my grandparents to do when one doesn't want to change themselves? My grandpa is on the same page as me but my grandma refuses to see this constant cycle and never kicks him out (has told him to leave a couple of times, but never takes the key away, the one time she did he broke in and she didn't say or do anything)  


I've been ignoring him as much as possible but there are something that just can't be ignored.   


It's taken a physical toll on my grandma especially with her constant worries (now financial because of the car) but he doesn't care. Last week she was screaming in her sleep and I had to run up from the living room (which I could barely hear) to make sure she was all right, meanwhile he was in his room (literally less than \~8feet away on the same floor) careless. That was absolutely disgusting like how are you not going to check on you mom who is screaming even if it's just a nightmare!? What if it was something worse?  


I work with people who are addicts at the homeless shelter and they are genuine people who are remorseful and take ownership of their mistakes that makes it so much more disheartening to come home and see a total piece of crap, like why is this person who genuinely tries and is a good person without a home meanwhile my uncle is living it up while being absolutely garbage.  


I fear that when I'm gone things will get worse, at least now I can be there as physical protection (I used to be an amateur boxer) and I can give a little advice to them. I forgot to mention my grandparent are in their 70's and immigrants so there are somethings they don't grasp without me explaining and when I'm gone that will leave a whole lot of room for abuse by their son.  


I pray for the man (whenever I pray) but god ,if he exists, doesn't seem to be doing much. 

Once again sorry for the long post, but I can't help but feel that this is a desperate situation. Any advice helps.",04Mar2019,2

540,"Hello reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of this year I became very close to someone in my friend group but as she has gotten better over time she seems to have just started to fade away and I feel lost. To give more detail, this girl, lets say jenn, recently had a bad breakout and wanted to go out with our friend group afterwards. At the bars I could tell she was down and felt a bit awkward since she didn't know a lot of people, so I try to make her feel comfortable and talked to her the whole time. We went home and I gave her my number just in case she wanted to talk because I knew she wasn't feeling great. From then on we talked a ton and I helped her get through some of the bad times of her breakup. There was even a moment when someone was jealous i was better friends with her and started some shit and to try to get us to not be friends, but we both found out and I think we formed an even better bond. In that conversation she said she loved me in her life and for a moment I thought I finally found a friend I would be able to talk to about anything. But over the past couple of weeks, she seems to be getting more distant from me and I can't tell if its just the normal ebbs and flows of a friendship because we kind of started the friendship on high or she just isn't interested in talking to me anymore because she doesn't need to feel the void of her ex. We usually talk over snapchat and I can tell her effort is getting worse and worse. It used to be we would have a great conversation throughout the day but now she takes much longer to respond with much less effort in her response. I am almost certain she is choosing to reply to others on snapchat while knowing she has one from me. I feel like I am not needed anymore since she is better and has better people now. Her ex from high school reach out and now I think they snap all the time and i introduced her to one of my girl friends and they hit it off very well. I can't tell if I'm overreacting or not but I just feel like I am replaced and I don't know what to do. I still want to be friends because i like Jenn but I feel so odd. I was just planning on not talking to her for awhile and see where that goes but I don't know how well that will go. I don't know what to do and I feel awful because I feel like I'm not good enough because she just replaced me with other people while I am still here. ",04Mar2019,3

But lately, she’s been making a lot of snide comments to me about the way I do my job, and it’s really frustrating. 

She gives advice that is unasked for, in a way that insinuates I’m not doing something right. Sends emails to remind to do things that I was already going to do, about topics that have nothing to do with her. Every time I see her, she has something to say about “oh, don’t forget to do such and such” or “have you done this or that?”

I tend to overanalyze things a lot and I thought I’d write this because it’s been bugging me. 

I recently made a club with a friend at the university I go to. She’s the President and I’m the Vice President. I’m not particularly interested in the topic of the club, which is KPOP, but my friend convinced me to create it with her. I thought it might be a good way to get out of my bubble and make some new friends as I’m fairly introverted and reluctant to start new relationships. 

I’ve met a lot of great people and made new friends though it. At the beginning, it was very fulfilling to be able to create something and for people to enjoy being in it. Being KPOP, I was glad that we could create a positive environment where people could talk about another culture’s activities in a respectful manner. Being Asian, this is probably the most important thing I wanted to accomplish if I could since there tends to be ignorant and misinformed views when it comes to different cultures. 

I became friends with one of the girls that came to our club, T. She had expressed that she felt shy reaching out to me and I was really glad she did because I have the same problem and related to her. We did a lot of talking and T told me a lot about her life, where she’s from, pressures from her family, etc. I enjoyed talking with her and hearing her stories in and out of club over a course of a few months.

While I was hanging out with her, the club itself had been giving me a lot of stress. It takes a lot for me to mentally prepare to talk with people at the meetings. The president of the club does little to no work and I’m too afraid to confront her, so I pretty much do all preparations for events, ppts, and activities. In my head, I defend myself for doing all the work by saying that it’s because I value the club and its members, but in actuality I know I don’t care about KPOP at all and I’m just doing it to please others. I know this is my fault bc I don’t confront her, but what makes me increasingly stressed out and feeling hopeless, is that she bosses me around. I had one friend tell me that “she acts like she owns me.” As meetings go on, I have realized how ignorant, bigoted, and narcissistic she is. She will not admit to being wrong despite the facts in front of her, makes rude and racist jokes when talking about idols, and is just overall very full of herself. And when I think about it, I just realize how hypocritical it was for me to build a club based on tolerance when the president is extremely ignorant. 

Starting from about two or three weeks ago and up until now, T has suddenly seemed cold towards me. She hasn’t been messaging me at all lately, doesn’t talk to me in club, or invite me to watch her stream anymore (she plays a lot of games). I know she is in no way obligated to be friends with me but it has been bothering me if I did something wrong. I know I can just shrug it off and accept that I may have pushed my own selfish expectations onto and was too overbearing. But every time I go to club, I feel it weighing on my mind and feel as though everyone hates me. 

Before when I used to talk to T, she had told me about how difficult it was growing up being gay in a black family. Towards the beginning of meeting her, I felt that she may have had a small crush on me but I told her when I met her that I was straight and she seemed to be fine with it. If she did have a crush on me and wanted to avoid me because of that, was I not interesting enough as a person to stay friends with? Or did she simply hang out with me because she wanted to be in a relationship with me? Or did I do something wrong for her to hate me? 

I want to know if there is good enough reason to confront her about it. I know I will eventually quit being vice of the club in either a few weeks (unlikely, since it’s irresponsible) or at the end of the semester. Combined with my feelings of uselessness in the club and these strained relations, I’m becoming less and less confident in the club. Am I just overreacting and letting it bother me, or am I actually in the wrong? Or is it my inability to keep friendships? 

I know I am probably forgetting details, so feel free ask anything.

I then told her I was going to get my jacket I’ll be two secs when I came back to the lockers she was gone, I saw her walking I tried to catch up she turned round to look at me but never stopped, I caught up with her and tried to hold a conversation but she just started walking faster and gave me one word answers I asked her what’s up if she was mad or something she said she was just tired, unusual again, then when we got out the school she quickly turned the other way so we don’t walk wit each other without a good bye, I’m trying to think of I did anything that would’ve made my only two friends mad- nothing comes to mind. 

Also I personally, feel insecure about friendships like I’m not part of a huge group / any group I have TWO friends and find it hard to communicate with others and start a conversation, I just feel socially awkward and that everyone Secretly hates me when I speak to them, so I get really afraid that if my only two friends are mad at me they will leave me and I will be the lonely kid at lunch who sits in the toilets to eat their lunch (honestly I’ve been there in my first two years for highschool I had no friends a monobrow specky with braces) so felt like everyone judged me and didn’t want to be my friend.",04Mar2019,3
556,"I’ve been struggling with my platonic relationships lately. It’s almost like instead of having actual friends, I have patients who see me to consult about their issues or babysit them until my service is no longer required. I didn’t think this was a problem at first since I do genuinely love my friends. I wish the very best for them, even if it compromises me sometimes. 

It began to bother me when I realized that my feelings aren’t reciprocated in a way that is expected of friendships. When I’m the one going through a rough period, the people whom I thought were my support system are suddenly ‘inconvenienced’. They either don’t reply to my messages or calls or just leave me be until I’ve blown enough steam to calm down. I’ve admitted to them before that their actions/inaction hurt me deeply. I’m filled to the brim with anxiety and I undergo the worst depressive episodes. I am painfully aware I can be too much to handle and not everyone can there for you since they have their own lives to deal with. It’s just that why can’t they at least communicate what they feel about me instead of hoping I can work shit out by myself? Don’t I at least deserve that instead of being left to rot and wonder if I’m truly alone? I don’t expect them to treat me the exact same as I do but at the very least, don’t view me  only as your free therapist when I cherish you as a friend.

I’m sorry if this has turned into a nonsensical rant I just...I need to know what’s wrong. I feel like I’m not worthy of anything anymore.

I am 18, in high school, I live with my mom who is unemployed, as well as mentally ill we live off of my child support, with a very strained relationship, the child support lasts about 2 more months until I graduate this isn't the worry but soon I'll be living with my father. He pays for most of my shit in life right now mostly being most of my insurance, and child support, phone bill. The problem is with my insurance my mom is supposed to be paying half but can't anymore so this brings me at a drastic deficit every month with hardly any work avlaible anymore due to my uncle not wanting me working with him. I have a friend who I have loaned money to and over time it adds up to about $300 but I've been living off of it. he has recently paid me a portion of what he owes me, and has no more to give me at the moment. This month I've had to pay more than I usually do of the insurance that is fine but I also have to pay for a prom ticket, and a online course this week, and after that I will have a mere 4 dollars for who knows how long. I'm awaiting a confirmed job the only problem is hiring process will be a while longer, and I'm panicking making me think about the future since soon when I move in with my dad he will not help cover my insurance.

561,"People say about me I'm charismatic, intelligent and benevolent.  I find them mediocre. I expect much from them and I'm always disappointed from everyone. 

At work I almost always have the good ideas and I have great results. I don't ever take the praise, because people don't like when someone is shining too much. I find it dumb but whatever. It's always a ""collective effort"" as I say. But, to be honest, I know I did this shit. And people are happy about me doing good things and flattering their egos. Then, someone in my team -or another one- try something shitty. And it fails, because it's shitty and I knew it. But I'm not an asshole, I let them try, I don't discourage them. On the contrary, I encourage people to do and test things. Even if I know it's shit. We could waste less time not even trying, but well that's not ""tolerant"" behaviour.

It doesn't happen solely at work. I'm frustrated about my friends too. And my ""girlfriend"" too if we can say so. I prove everyday my worth, but people don't see it, don't recognize it. Even if it brings concrete fucking results??? What the heck.

I'm faking that I love people, because I would look like an asshole otherwise. Although, my perspective on people is bad. I do treat them fairly, but I don't believe they should be. Inside, I hate them all. I hate their mediocrity. I think of myself as superior. And in a sense, concrete results of my power, influence and results prove it true...

Is it bad? I appear humble in public, I never brag, never humblebrag neither. I know how people are. Here I can say what I really think. I always self-sacrifice for people. But people, they are not up to my sacrifice. I give a lot of my time, of my energy, of my attention, and if I can my money to other people. **I often overcome people's expectations. Because that's the right thing to do. But on their side, they don't even meet mine.** They all are disappointing me. Sometimes not, but that's so fucking rare...

Should I just be fucking egoist? Should I find better people in my life? Should I change my beliefs on people? What should I do? I hate this situation. I'm not stimulated, and it makes me sad and hateful.

I mean fuck I'm so bad at relationships! I've gained a lot of social skills. Still lack some. But now, I just want to say ""FUCK YOU"" to everyone. People would be surprised as fuck lol, I may be one of the nicest person they have ever meet. At least that's what they think because I act nice... Some people say I'm so benevolent and not judging. Lol, if only you knew!

I hate people. They are so disappointing. They don't have values, they don't have ethics. I work a lot, in my job and in my relationships and I feel like I'm working for nothing. For people who want and are nothing. It's meaningless. All these people are empty. And the more I meet people, the more I hate them and their uselesness.

Now I failed the exam while everyone who cheated got an A. The professor won't curve or give any curtesy/ extra credit since he doesn't think it was that difficult.

563,"I  know this isn't going to fly well on this sub but I need someone to  talk to about this. When I was about 13 I got exposed to child porn and  became addicted to it. I had curiosities about girls my own age at the  time and by the time I was 16 I had found the more hardcore stuff, but I  was completely guilt ridden because of it. I absolutely hate  pedophiles, hate them with every fiber of my being. When I felt a urge I  deemed inappropriate, I would burn myself, or punch myself, or whip  myself with a belt. This went on for years and years. I would keep  watching it which would cause my urges to increase which just caused my  anger at myself and anything resembling a sexual desire to rise. One day  I decided to take drastic measures and sell my computer, not before  reporting as many of these sites and users I had gotten in contact with  as I could. I only read, and watched tv, those were my only sources of  entertainment. For over a year. It was hell at first but I got used to  it. its how I quit porn over all.

Scars  were left. Oh, scars were left deep, both physically and mentally. I  tried to get a girlfriend, at 23. But I felt a awful feeling in my  stomach. Like I was trying to abuse any girl I was trying to talk to. If  my intentions might lead to sex, it made me feel awful, I felt like I  was damaging women by even attempting to do it. I hated the idea of sex,  I hated anyone who did it, the idea of me doing it reminded me a lot of  my pedo days. The wires were crossed, sex = guilt, disgust, hate.  Self  hate in myself is pretty high because of this. I feel like I don't  deserve to live a happy life. I forfeited that when I was 13. I do the  bare minimum, I hate when good things happen and welcome pain when it  comes. I am scarred with the memories of things I've seen and done. I  saw the worst in humanity and had that coupled with me training myself  to see sex as shameful, abusive and horrible. I can't tell this to a  therapist, I don't know what to do. I want to put this behind me but I  can't. It is me now it seems.",04Mar2019,0
564,"Here's what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, a 17 year old female friend of mine receives the following message as a direct message on Instagram:

&gt;""Hello, I stumbled upon your profile and I found out you are so beautiful, I'm ready to spoil you with all I have hun, I'm not here for anything sexual or a relationship. I'm a rich man and I choose to do whatever you want, I'll be giving you an allowance of $500 everyweek hun. If you are interested just let me know ok?"" (Feb 27 at 8:25 EST)

This was then followed up with the following message seven hours later:

&gt;""Do you need help financially?"" (Feb 27 at 14:52 EST)

&amp;#x200B;

While I would give this guy the benefit of the doubt, but my friend is clearly 17 (evidenced by the graduating year 2020 on her profile description).  The time comes into question as well. The man's bio claims he is from Hawaii, which means that the first message would have been sent at 3:25 in the morning. Could be me just over analyzing though.

I initially thought this could be a fake account with the intention of messing with her (most likely from another schoolmate), but digging into his account a bit more revealed that he has a reasonable amount of posts and followers and that their profile picture was an original photo, which is unlikely for a friend to obtain for the purpose of a joke. Other evidence was a like left on a different Instagram page of a photo posted 3 months ago. Rather unlikely that they would leave this as a red herring, as liked photos are normally unavailable to the common eye. I just got lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

So as for advice, I'm looking for what to do next. Normally I'd like to ignore it but I have a few hours to kill so I might as well make this fun. I could report him, but I don't know if I have the grounds to do so. I'd like to catfish them and see where that goes, but I don't know what could happen from there. Thoughts?

567,"Currently being bullied by a girl at my uni and it came to the point where I mentally couldn’t handle it anymore.

I went to ask for help to my professors but then she just somehow managed to turn the whole situation back round onto me?!???? When I’ve done nothing wrong.

She made up and spread a lot of lies about me to a lot of people on my course. She keeps bringing my coursemates to one side to tell them all about her side of the story so that these people don’t talk to me or like me anymore.

About a month ago before all this drama started she came up to me in uni and slapped me round the face, called me a bitch and laughed. I turned around to her and said “wtf why did you hit me” then she replied saying she did it because I didn’t say goodbye to her bf. A few people were there at the time but now don’t remember it. 

At the time I was really pissed off by it but I didn’t tell anyone because she was my “friend” and I didn’t want to be a snitch.

Fast forward to now, I’ve reported all her bullying and the fact she had previously hit me as she was threatening to “do or say something she may regret” if I go near her. I was her flatmate at the time so this was incredible difficult to avoid her. 

****some background history****she’s a very aggressive girl who previously got in a massive fight in the laundry room over someone moving her clothes from the machine to the chair. She’s got a history of getting into fights and even breaking a girls nose from continually punching her face.

Between how bitchy she acted to me, how rude/aggressive she was demanding I do things for her up in my face, spreading rumours/lies about me in uni, inviting dangerous a guy to the flat on drugs who’d previously been extremely verbally abusive to me, slapping me. I was not okay. I was not happy. I had tried 4 times trying to fix and resolve things with this girl bullying me but she kept on fake making up with me then being horrible and spreading lies behind my back.

When I reported it to my uni they were supportive at first but then this girl made up a load of lies about me which made it so that the person in charge didn’t know who was telling the truth. So this girl got away with it AND CONTINUES TO DO IT. 

I got told how because I didn’t have any proof of her hitting me how it could be turned back round onto me that I’m imagining things, or that I’m racist against black people. 

I just think it’s rubbish how you can hit someone but if you have no proof then it never happened. ",04Mar2019,1

571,"As per the title, I live in an apartment with my younger sister. We share the rent and utilities 50/50, though the lease and stuff is in my name. We get along really well and at first things were going great. 

However, the last few months things have gone downhill. We have an arrangement that we take turns doing the dishes, mopping the floors, cleaning the bathrooms, etc. Since she works longer hours than me, I have sort of taken on the other responsibilities like taking out the trash, yard work, keeping the carpets clean and general tidying. I also cook every day. She has just completely stopped doing her part. Dishes are left to pile up, because she knows that I cannot stand it, which will eventually lead to me cleaning it up. The same goes for everything else. I can’t live in such squalor and she knows it. She is absolutely taking advantage of me. 

She’s has time off from work the last few days while I had full day shifts over the weekend and only got home late in the evenings. I asked her to please just take care of her chores as the apartment is looking terrible. As usual, she just left everything as is and even added to the pile of dishes in the sink. Tonight I asked her again to at least do the dishes then so I can cook dinner. She completely flipped out on me and eventually did wash them, but was really passive aggressive about it. I broke down completely and told her through tears that I can’t stand how unfairly she is treating me. I explained that I clean our whole apartment every single day and have now resorted to only asking her to do the dishes once a week, which she is also not doing. She just ignored me and walked away. 

I’m not her mom, yet I do SO many things for her. She is my responsibility in every way except for financially. I drive her around, make her appointments for her and basically run our household. She just drifts along. I can’t move and I can’t stop helping her because I’m the only person she has got. I really do love her and she’s my best friend. I’m her ride to work and if not for living with me, she wouldn’t be able to afford livig somewhere else because I buy most of the groceries and things.

They even bark from inside their house if they see us in the yard, and bark at us if they are outside and see us through a window. We feel like we are under siege. We can’t hang out in our yard or carry in groceries without potentially having the dogs go nuts on us. 

We like dogs, and have a sweet elderly cattle dog, but these dogs seem to be damaged, and are unfriendly and unapproachable. We have been unable to make friends with them. We have thought about some ultrasonic/dog whistle options - but we are worried about our dog and as much as we do not like these poodles - we do not want to hurt them. 

We have talked to our neighbors about the problem. They are very nice and decent people but they are in denial about the situation. Their response has generally been that the dogs mean no harm and/or that they are not really barking at us. 

We have an iron fence and have planted bushes that have helped screen the view, but the dogs still manage to bark. Due to the dimensions, nature  and length of our lots it’s not possible to build a solid fence that wouldn’t be incredibly unattractive. 

We have thought about moving but the house has been in my family for over 120 years and we really do not want to leave. Also, we do not think we could sell the house as the barking dogs would be a dealbreaker. 

Right now our plan is to outlive them. In the meantime, we travel a lot.

I’ve always been someone who has been dealing with loneliness, depression and social anxiety. 
So about a year ago I met this girl who was the one who initiated our relationship by telling me how she felt and so on. She was my first girlfriend. For me that was such an invigorating feeling because I’ve never seen myself as someone who you could actually love meaning the stuff you usually deal with when you have really low self-esteem.  

Well she turned out to be really abusive and often manipulative. She would for example never take responsibility for anything that she did. She also thought that because she has went through abuse that it somehow meant she could never be abusive herself. I broke up with her after a year of just nothing good happening. I think the reason that I stayed for so long is because of how forgiving I am and that I love to help people. She really messed with my head and trying to make me believe that I was the abusive one. I mean she was my first girlfriend and a lot of stuff is going through my head. She was the first person I opened up to and seeing how see treated me I’m not particularly optimistic about anyone else ever feeling something for me. 

I know a therapist would probably help me.  I’m not close with my family and I don’t really have any friends. I don’t like to burden people. I’ve just never been this low before and that’s really saying something for me since I’ve been dealing with depression my entire life basically. I’m sorry for any grammatical errors.

The thing is - every family member from my generation (cousins, brother, etc.) EVERY SINGLE ONE who is over 16, has had a car GIVEN TO THEM. All sides of the family, no exceptions. My brother got lucky and we just so happened to have an extra car for him. My moms car got wrecked and so what was supposed to be my car payment turned into her new car payment. I understand, it's not their fault. They want to help, they just can't. I thought that I might be in luck, as my moms mom and my dads dad are both wealthy, and have been known for giving family loans. They both turned me down for varied, bullshit reasons. First loan was asking for $5000 paid off over 6 months, with my parents backing me up if I couldn't make a payment. Denied. Second loan was $2000 paid back in 2 months, also backed by my parents. There was honestly no financial reason to not give me the money - I was going to pay it back essentially immediately. I just want a car now, before summer, instead of right before I get to college.

To drive the point home, the last time we visited my husbands family (January), his mom asked him about the notes. I think about that a lot, too. 😖

Do you have any advice for the most sincere way to write a note that is filled with both gratitude and regret in an appropriate way? I’m worried about coming across as disingenuous or as though I’m making excuses. Thanks in advance!",04Mar2019,2

However, since we moved in together, back in September of 2018, they have constantly mocked me, pounded on my door to the point of breaking it, put duct tape over the doorframe IOT ""clothesline"" me on my way out, yelled and screamed my name constantly at night, and have just been overall extremely obnoxious.

I tried to confront them about it, and was met with them calling me a ""faggot"", ""socially retarded"", and saying I should just ""fucking kill yourself"".

She doesn’t seem to want me to finger or go down on her, she only wants me to have sex with her (which I dont understand at all but whatever). She also wont go down on me and doesn’t seem to like giving hand jobs either. She did not want me finishing myself or her off, and gave me blue balls that made me want to jump out of a window. 

I’ve decided I’m going to stop jacking off until I see her again because I am into her, but not sure if its me or her that is bad at sex since I’m pretty inexperienced.

594,"Main Question: Should I trust my friend? What do I do next?
So here’s the run down of the situation: Male 18

I’m currently a senior in high school (It’s an international school so a lot of concentrated wealth, not a ton of kids in each grade comparative to most US high schools). I’m graduating in 4 months and hopefully going to the University of Bath. One of my best friends (let’s call him Aaron) has also been accepted to the University of Bath and we want to go together and enjoy ourselves during our 4 years there. Until recently he felt like one of my closest and most trusted friends however now I’m unsure. I also need to introduce an ex, let’s call her Caitlyn. We have a bit of a history but now we’re alright friends and we chat occasionally. Finally one last little bit of context: Aaron often hangs out with ‘the cool kids’ and while him and I are close and chat we don’t hang out as a group with other people. I am not part of this so called ‘popular’ group (mainly decided by wealth over anything else), however Caitlyn (the Ex) sometimes hangs out in their vicinity when at school and can hear them all chat.

THE STORY:
So this weekend I was at a party with Caitlyn and other people when she told me that the ‘popular’ group does a ton of Cocaine on a weekly basis. I was surprised at first but when a few other friends explained that they had the wealth to do it I got to grips with it. I was still quite surprised so I asked few people I know that are in the ‘popular’ group if that was true or not. They all shot it down saying it was ridiculous and that she (the ex) was being completely bonkers and that it was just a dumb rumor. I then also asked Aaron (supposedly my best friend) and he too said, without blinking an eye, that it was completely false. However everyone I had asked had different versions of the story and so I got a bit suspicious but nothing completely out of line. Then at of a school day, Caitlyn comes up to me and says that the ‘popular’ group just had a conversation about me saying that they needed to shut the rumor down and, in the same conversation, spoke of buying $500 of coke for the weekend. She told me this in confidence and just thought I should know (she heard this because she was sitting nearby when they were speaking about me). I honestly couldn’t care about them cocaine. I have to say that I’m quite upset that they stride around like they are the kings and queens of the world. 


I don’t want to feel oblivious, like I’m less than them, and be pushed around by them. It is a consistent theme with the ‘popular’ group. I also feel betrayed by one of my best friends (Aaron), how should I approach this situation? I kind of want a form of small revenge. I want them to know that I know what they’re up-to and that they can’t control what I believe.

So far I’ve just considered having a 1-on-1 conversation with Aaron. Approaching him telling him that I know and that I’m hurt he would hide it from me. I obviously am no snitch I’m just more bothered by the fact that the ‘popular’ group has so much control and that I was betrayed by a supposed best friend. Because I don’t like the power they hold I also don’t want to just drop it...does that make sense?

Please let me know what you guys think?

P.S. if you got this far, thank you so much I really appreciate any comment. I may even be acting irrational. I will reply to every comment you guys make. Thank you!",04Mar2019,1
595,"TL;DR One of my kittens was fucking with my DVI cable and I kinda pushed her out of the way. I'm worried she might've hit her head on my desk leg. I wouldn't ever hurt an animal, especially not a little kitten. 

So, about a month (give or take) ago, we adopted two, 4-month-old kittens, a boy and a girl. They're very skittish, which leads us to believe that they hadn't had a very good previous home. They're also quite mischievous, but I suppose that's what I expected from little youngsters like them.

They like to climb on, around, under, and behind things. Things they aren't supposed to. We started to spray them with water whenever they'd be on counter tops, tables or desks. 

Let me make this very clear: I would NEVER. Absolutely NEVER hurt an animal on purpose. ESPECIALLY not a little kitten like mine.

However, I was working on my online assignments earlier, and the girl kitten (her name is Penelope, ""Penny"" for short) goes under my desk and behind my processor, which is laying vertically on the ground next to my desk. I didn't pay any mind to it until my monitor started bugging out. I immediately realized that (since they liked to chew on anything that looks like a string, cord, etc.) she must've been doing something to one of the cables. My guess is, it was my DVI cables. I quickly lean down and move her away from my processor, but I did so with a bit of force behind it. 

I feel awful because she might've hit her head on one of the legs of my metal desk. I consoled her about it but she wasn't interested in any pets or loves. ",04Mar2019,1
596,"So I went out with my mates to this party. We were all having a blast, atleast until the party ended.

During the party I approached around 10 chicks and got blown out everytime while my friend got 3 makeouts, a blowjob and supposedly baged a girl in the street. 

And that doesn’t matter to me, I’ve done alot of PUA so I’ve gone through nights where I got 20 straight times blown out and also gotten 11 make outs straight.

But heres where it got rough.

We’re riding back home and this guy starts joking around with me about how I didn’t get shit at the party. No problem, I joke back, I’m the first guy to make fun of my own situation. I’ll always joke about myself and abot my friends.

But then he keeps repeating it. Doing it with an inferiorizing tone. Acting condescending, making fun of my haircut, really treating me like a piece of shit because I had a bad night.

This went on for around an hour. Even one of the other guys joined in at one point. He was trying to assert himself over me and make me as the punching bag of the group.

So at one point one the guys even started saying unironically “you really gonna let him say that?” “Dude, beat him up”

This whole time I went from ignoring, to saying “Its not funny anymore bro”. 

So then when we left I got up, waited for him to get up and surprise pushed him back. Then I slapped him in the face pretty hard twice. 

Today im going out with the same guys again. How do I set things right so we can have a blast again? I dont want awkwardness.

Ive already decided to say “hey man, I have nothing personal against you. I always treated you with respect and I expect the same from you. Now we can apologize to eachother and have a great night or...not”

603,"I will have about $7000 saved by this summer. I am considering whether buy an used car or go traveling in Europe for two months. I am an international student studying in the United States in a small place, and I will probably stay here for another three years. I have stayed here for 2.5 years without a car, but have been thinking about buying a car for soooo long. It is really inconvenient getting around here without a car. I have made some friends who can give me rides sometimes, but I hate that my schedule has to be dependent on someone else. The last two years, I have been using transportation and Uber a lot, and found myself spending about $3000 on transportation and Uber. However, with this amount of money, I still feel it is quite inconvenient, since the Uber app sucks sometimes and the bus stations are still kinda far away from everything. I had to walk a lot and wasted lots of time when I had to go somewhere. It takes me about one hour to get to my destination by bus, half an hour with Uber pool when it only takes 10 minutes driving there. 🙄 the struggle is reeeeal. I am also considering the safety issue. I love going out at night to dancing classes and parties, but I don’t feel quite safe taking Uber at late night. Besides, I can easily go on a road trip, if I have a car. I might not be able to do Europe trip, but might still be able to do some road trip in the US, and this sounds cool too. At this point, I feel like my life will be so much easier and I can do much more stuff for the following years, if I bought a car. Next semester I will move to a total new city, so it will be even harder to get around by myself. I think a car will help a lot. 

However, I was originally planning to go traveling in Europe for about two months. I am really independent and I think this trip can benefit me a lot. I have been working and studying so hard for the last few years, so I figured this trip could help refresh my mind, give myself a break and I deserve it. I will be busy for the next few years too, because I will be doing internships and looking for jobs, working, getting married???  This summer is perfect for me, since I have money saved up, a couple months available, and the mood, the courage to solo travel, and nothing to worry about. After a few years, I might change my mind and not able to solo travel. I feel like I am more willing to try new stuff when I am younger.

I just believe that there are people out there who must have felt this way and i'd like to know how you dealt with it personally.   


He and I were best friends for 12 years. He was the kindest, most amazing, respectful man i've ever met. He was an incredibly talented musician. I know that when someone dies everyone says they were amazing and kind no matter what, but he really was. He had the purest soul and the most kind, innocent heart. He literally didn't know how to be cruel. While he'd expressed feelings for me a few times, it was always while I was in a happy relationship with someone else. He slept in my bed countless times without ever ""trying anything"". We'd just stay up all night and talk. He was a self-taught guitar player more talented than many i've met with extensive professional training. We'd record videos of us making music (he plays, I sing).   


He and I both suffered from addiction. His struggle was longer and more difficult than mine. He was addicted to cocaine at a young age, around 14-15, but got clean on his own (I don't think his family even knew he was an addict - but then, his parents preferred tossing money at him to actual parenting). He still smoked a ton of weed and did other drugs occasionally, but we all just laughed it off as it being a ""musician thing"", and since he always maintained steady work, it wasn't really an issue.   


When he met heroin, and when I did.... everything changed.   


I won't post my entire addiction story here. That's for another time. All you really need to know is we weren't the people who are ""supposed"" to be addicts. We both came from upper class families, had degrees, worked hard. So when he started using and when I eventually did (I didn't start because of him, I started with a boyfriend at the time, who is also now deceased) it took a while for people to notice something was wrong, as the people around us had no experience with this kind of thing, and because neither of us were hurting for money.   


By the time his parents realized what was going on, he had tried and failed to get clean so many times I can't even count. He'd disappear to some detox center or rehab only to score drugs the minute he walked out the doors. There was something inside of him that he was trying to bury and heroin became his everything. I watched him sell his beautiful guitars. He stopped playing music. My beautiful man was dying inside, and I couldn't help him, because I was sick too.   


My addiction was shorter-lived than his. He used for around 2 years before I started and 3 years after. When I got clean, I just got clean. I didn't look back. He was not as lucky. So when he called me from Montreal, telling me he'd left his latest rehab stint early and that he was coming home, I knew he was already high. I heard it in voice. I just knew.   


He showed up at my house two days later with a backpack and guitar. ""No"", I told him before he even said a word. I knew he wanted to stay. ""My mom won't let me come home because I left early, and they changed the locks on my apartment"" (they paid the rent, they were on the lease, so they were able to do this). ""No. You can't stay here as long as you're still using."" So he left. And I went to sleep worried but also irritated. I was angry that he left early, I was disappointed that he'd failed again, I was annoyed that he'd come to me knowing I couldn't have drugs in my house. When I woke up the next morning, my life would change forever.   


He was dead. Overdose was suspected, but that wasn't it. In truth, he froze to death. Curled up in the bed of someones truck, head on his guitar, he froze to death in middle of a ruthless Canadian winter.   


It's been three years. Whenever I hear music he'd like I shut it off. I couldn't approach his family at the funeral or afterward. I will never be able to shake the knowing that he died because I wouldn't let him in.   


How you grieve the loss of someone you loved so much when they wouldn't have died if you had just fucking let them in?

I've never been a particularly confident man which makes me pretty shy. I was ok with this when I was engaged (wasn't shy around her) but now being single for the first time in a long time I hope to get over it. Not just for dating but for life in general as confidence makes life a lot easier. 

I wasn't shy as a kid but as a young teenager I was bullied pretty bad (because I was kind of fat and too confident for the popular kids) and only my best friend really stuck with me. After being bullied in middle school I didn't want to meet new people. Now as a young adult I want to get back that confidence I had as a child.

I've lost a lot of weight and I thought having a better physique would help and it has a little but I'm still a rather shy person.

All I want is relevant advice, no cop bashing please. I'm using a throwaway account because I do not want this man to link me to this post somehow.

A member of my husband's family is a police officer. He has been fired by 4 different departments over the years and was recently hired by another department that is an hour away from where we live. 

This man has a lot of serious issues and everyone in the family is afraid of him. He often makes various vague threats at family gatherings, as well as on facebook. In one recent post, he posted about a family member whose husband he dislikes, claiming her husband abuses her and that if he caught it happening he would choke the husband to death.(She is not abused). He also tends to post a lot of racist things on facebook and has streamed several facebook live videos where he ""saw something suspicious"" and harassed people when he was off duty. He also will facebook live very disgusting rants about family members, showing their houses and giving their addresses. He has a lot of facebook friends, people we don't even know. So there is no telling who or what kind of people end up with access to our addresses and images of our homes before we can report it and have it removed from facebook.

I don't know anything about the hiring process for cops, but he seems to always manage to get hired at another department after being fired(Granted further and further away). But, it is what it is and I assume they have no access to his social media to see his online behavior. Should we be screenshotting this type of online behavior and sending it to his work? If so how would we go about turning it in? And would it be anonymous? Again, he regularly makes threats to us(vague and not so vague) and I honestly feel that he would make good on them if he found out we had turned this sort of thing in. He recently showed up to a family holiday with a duffel bag filled with rifles and made ""jokes"" about how we ""shouldn't piss him off with his bag of goodies nearby"". 

I in no way feel this is a common place thing that happens(Other than this man I've only ever had very positive interactions with local law enforcement), but he is a huge concern for our family and he has been fired for mistreating people while on duty in the departments he no longer works for. We just don't know what to do about him. Both about his position as an officer and with his threatening behavior toward us. We're all afraid of him and it only gets worse with time, not better. But, I feel like us knowing this about him and doing nothing would make us responsible if he eventually hurts someone while on duty. I also want to prevent him from eventually snapping or something and hurting us.",04Mar2019,1

617,"So throwaway but I bet I'll get found by being too specific

Anyway, I've been dating my SO [F22] for five years now, and for awhile I've been wanting to break up. It's tricky, because on the one hand she really is pretty great - she's extremely attractive, kind, helps out more with the chores and stuff than I do, splits the bills, gets along great with all of my friends and family, shares a ton of the same interests with me which is very rare and I just essentially will not find again. 

But there's issues too, that I've been done dealing with for awhile now. She's insanely antisocial and will not leave the house or make her own friends or come with me when I go to social events (which I do several times a week) - she's also really paranoid but refuses to admit it. Her hygiene isn't excellent, and she owns a cat that lives with us who drives me absolutely mental although it loves me to death. A big thing is that she has no aspiration - I let my scholarships time out to spend time with this girl because I believed we were going to team up and make a big impact together but five years later we both still work minimum wage retail jobs and she has no idea what she wants to do with her life, seems totally content to just become a shift supervisor or something one day at her job. 

The thing that messes me up the most is that she's extremely extremely over committed to this relationship - she has no friends aside from me, has no interest in making other friends, wants to do nothing but please me, stresses constantly about upsetting me or letting me down. I'm sure that sounds like a treat to some of you guys, but it's honestly hell. She lies pathologically, never confesses her feelings, never expresses herself, because she never wants to be inconvenient to me. For what it's worth, I did the same thing in my last relationship and totally worshipped my ex - afterward I became extremely aware of how important sense of identity and total honesty is in a relationship, so I've been saying since day one to be honest even when it's no fun. At the start she really did, she would express a difference of opinions and challenge my views and encourage me to look at things from different angles and show me new things, but now she just doesn't, she's become a total yes-man and has zero sense of self.

It's my stance that she needs therapy and alone time. I know it would totally gut her to be away from me because I'm her entire life, but she's an absolute ball of stress because she's been watching me grow distant ever since an episode in winter of 2017 (it's hard to know specifically, but she may have been having or trying to have an affair) and I feel like the relationship has been dead for awhile. 

I've discussed this with her and established a date a few months from now where she needs to be out of the house by (we're adults so I want to give her her time to get things together) but she's trying to act like everything is totally fine and that was just a fight we have. The talk was a few days ago and I brought it up the other day and she said she ""wants to look at it like an 'if' and not a 'when'"", so I can tell she's just going to try and do the denial thing. I don't think she'll make any effort to get her affairs in order, and then when the day comes around she'll just shrug and say ""whoops I need more time"". Ugh.",04Mar2019,1

619,"So heads up. I'm PMSing. ( Or so I say to excuse my unjustifiable emotions). 
My best friend and I are very very close. We do everything together. Form gym to studying to going out to making a band. Everything.
This weekend I had to stay back at my hostel while he went for a wedding in Bangkok. The separation was a quite a lot for us since we spend all our time together. Now first day there he didn't have fun. But the next day he spoke to a hot girl, they became good friends and her friends became his friends. And he had a lot of fun swimming and dancing and everything. Meanwhile here I was getting completely bored and miserable.
That night he got drunk with them. Mainly because they forced him to. Also because he wanted to have a fun night out.
Back story: we had a pact. He would never drink and I would never smoke.
Now here I am. I just called him up. And he said he was drunk and it was too much for me to take so I hung up. I feel like I'm breaking. I feel really really bad.
What should I do?
I thought he was different. But he's just like everyone else.",04Mar2019,1
620,"I need some advice on how to approach my neighbor about the portion of fence separating our yard. I think it's 'technically' my fence and on my land. I mean, it benefits both of us so I don't really care about technicalities. His dogs have broken it and I want him to replace the panels. It's not a huge section. 4, 8 foot long panels would do it. That's $100 at lowes. 

I've repaired it three times already this past year because of the dogs, I think it's safe to say it needs replacing. 

I own my home and he rents so... should I ask him to replace the panels they've broken or ask for his landlord (whom is never around) to do it? The neighbor and I are on good terms so there is that. He is deaf so communication beyond texting is difficult.",04Mar2019,1
621,"I was a full time operating Room Technician at a hospital for 8 months while I’m in EMT school. The work environment became really hostile and I just left last week, I was the 15th person to leave already this year. I got a new job at Walgreens as a pharmacy tech and not going to lie I hate it already. Everyone is just kind of weird and no one seems happy, and they have me in the basement office doing 80 hours of online training on the computer all day. I haven’t done a single hands on thing, have gotten no information about what I’ll be doing, and it pays less then what I was making before (I was desperate to get out of the hospital job). 

On top of this I just found out my grandmother is in the hospital in bad condition, one of the credit cards I thought I payed hit my score as being delinquent, I’m a little behind on school work, and I have an appointment in an hour to find out if I have pneumonia. 

I’m just feeling so beat down and don’t know what to do. I have bills to pay so I can’t be unemployed but this job is making everything worse. Ive been applying to other jobs (I have 8 years of retail experience and a year of healthcare experience) but I haven’t heard anything yet.

623,"I know this is a question that has long been answered, but I feel like every obvious solution hasn’t really worked out in my favor. I’ve exhausted my options and I don’t know what else to do to get over this breakup. My relationship lasted about 9ish months with this person. We were FWBs, but our benefits were always reminiscent of a full blown relationship, we were basically dating without the label. Finally, I got fed up with the confusion of feelings and insisted that if we were to continue this, I’d want this to be an official relationship. He reluctantly agreed (already a bad start to a relationship) and hardly put in the effort he previously did when we didn’t have the title. I broke up with him within a month because of this sudden inconsistency. It’s been two months since our breakup but it still feels so fresh. Another fun addition: he’s my coworker so I have to unfortunately see him at work on occasion. He has attempted so many times to be friendly with me when I have made it clear that I want nothing to do with him. On Valentine’s Day he even sent me a message and when I asked why, he said “idk I just felt like sending it”. Idk what to do because even though he’s a complete asshole all I can keep thinking about is how he wasn’t that person when I met him. I really could use some help on this, and yes I’ve thought about finding another job but I don’t want to leave since I’ve been there longer than he has.

625,"Today my boyfriend texted me asking me to call 911 to get an officer to pull over his child's mother because she was driving under the influence of marijuana. We are in South Texas and it is highly illegal here. I called, 911 operator could not have given less of a monkey's behind since I was the girlfriend and it wasn't my boyfriend that called. I explained that 1) My boyfriend has been threatened with death over police involvement before so no, he cannot make the call himself while he's in a car with her and 2) My relationship status does not make a difference when someone is high and running red lights with their child and their child's father in the car. The 911 operator essentially blamed my boyfriend for getting in the car and not stopping her. He was worried for his life for crying out loud. She consistently threatens him and what she says, goes. Of course he wouldn't start that kind of dispute with her after complying for so long and hoping she'll actually face the law for it. By the time my call was complete and an alert was sent out to the police in the area, 10 minutes had passed, the info I was given was no longer relevant, and they had arrived at their destination after speeding, running red lights, and nearly getting into an accident. 
This is not a first-time occurence with this woman as she smokes pot between 4-5 times in an 8-10 hour period (my boyfriend has to witness this and is willing to testify should she ever be charged with anything involving marijuana/child engagement) and today was definitely a peak in her confidence in her ability to get away with it. She had an open CPS case last year where she tested so positive for pot that she was not allowed to be around her child alone and needed a chaperone since a custody agreement was not settled and she wasn't being arrested. They did not take the child away and the mother completed the classes to get it dismissed. 
My boyfriend was blamed for it, she threatened to send him to prison for touching his daughter even though he never had and never will, not to mention this is supervised visitation and she's required to be supervising the entire 10 hours he's there. She kicked him out, denied him visitation, etc. over it. She got clean for about 6 months and now she's back on it. 
My question is, what is the best way to get her caught by the law without being written off when this is a legitimate problem? We're worried to call CPS again since they essentially did nothing and we're worried that the more we try, the less we'll be taken seriously. 
We know the law should be on our side with this and if something happens to his daughter due to half-baked attempts by the law at catching her and letting her go, we don't want it to be on us when it was the law that's failing us. There has to be a way for this to be taken very seriously and potentially bring charges into the mix without risk of failure and being retaliated against again. She's off her prescribed psychotics and extremely confrontational and volatile. ",04Mar2019,0
626,"I’m \[24, f\] planning on traveling to several coastal cities in the USA for a month in the end of the year. I’m from Europe.  
 I just casually told my mother about how exiting it is to buy the flight tickets and she figuratively exploded. She told me how naïve I was, how stupid to be doing this on my own. She said that I can’t do that alone without anyone accompanying me.   
 It breaks my heart that she will be worrying for the whole month I’m gone.   
 But that’s a perfectly valid thing to do, right? Finally visiting the country I’ve been waiting to see?

Am I stupid for doing this?",04Mar2019,1
627,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, living together for 7 months. I’m nearly 19 and he’s in his mid 20s.

I moved out of my country to be with him in England and I literally have no friends to talk or be with. It’s just me. I cry because I feel so abandoned and Iike the loneliest person in the world when we fight as I literally have no one else to rely on. I am so thankful that he is my only friend through tough moments but when these happen between me and him, I have no one else besides myself.

I don’t like to say it’s always his fault but it’s always me who gets upset at him for the way he treats me, behaves or just ignores me. Some of the things that he does which hurt me and start arguments are him turning his back on me when  I’m talking and we disagree on something; saying I’ll start a scandal in public after I repeatedly tell him I’ve never done that in my life; not waiting for me when we walk in public because walks too fast; not wanting to be embarrassed in public because I look too upset; the way he reacts when I tell him I don’t understand something he says (I sometimes struggle with his accent and the fact he speaks low often doesn’t help); among others. I hate when I feel ignored by him because I feel like I’m being ignored by everyone, not to mention I think it’s highly disrespectful, yet he does this and every time, he tells me he didn’t mean to or just went to think and come back - all these consistent mistakes just make me want to explode because they keep happening.

Yesterday, I felt sick in his car and I threw up all over his door and under the front passenger seat. Normally, he got very frustrated over it because he now has vomit in his car which smells very badly. I felt (and still feel) like the worst person in the world for doing that and I apologised so much for it. He tells me it’s not my fault and I could have never meant to do that, saying it’s all fine. But for the rest of the night, after he says that we both should move on and forget about it, he doesn’t talk much to me, almost not at all. Obviously, I don’t think he’s moved on and the fact he was so silent to me for the rest of the night made me cry so much in the morning. He tries to console me but I can’t stop. 

Today, during lunch break, we decide to meet in town and we have a coffee together when he tells me, after a few times yesterday, the effects it’s gonna have on his car and tries to be sympathetic with me. This is when I feel that he’s not moved on, otherwise he wouldn’t have to say that all the time and that makes me even sadder.

When we leave the place, he starts walking faster than me like he sometimes does and he says something that I don’t understand twice because he’s not even looking at me. He sighs and looks all pissed like he usually does and I ask him, almost crying, why he always has to be like this. It hurts me that he is not understanding that there are certain things I don’t understand or just don’t know what they even mean. He apologises and proceeds to walking, again, without me. Then he looks back and sees that I’m looking very upset (I wanted to cry right then but was holding myself back) and asks me what’s wrong. I tell him and he apologises again but tells me not to look so upset. I ask him what he expects me to look like after me feeling like complete shit once more and he just tells me “I don’t want people to see me walking around with a fucking-“ and doesn’t finish the sentence. I stop and try to hold it in again and as destroyed as I am, I tell him he doesn’t have to walk around with me, to which he responds he simply doesn’t want us to look embarrassing. That’s when I say I am going back to class because I was too hurt to talk to him and he insists that I stay but I just leave. I was crying all the way back and during class. I still can’t believe he talks to me like this. I cried so much.

When I get back home, he’s sleeping and I wake him up for work after 20 minutes of me pondering what I’ll say to him. When he wakes up, he asks me to sit in bed and to talk. He proceeds to apologising to me about what’s happened and, deep inside, I feel like he doesn’t know what he’s apologising for because many things hurt me in less than 24 hours. I tell him I’m deeply sorry for what’s happened but that I feel he’s still angry at me based on the way he’s acting towards me. I understand his car is now fucked up but the things he told me today hurt me so much.

He apologises for how he’s acted but I still feel he doesn’t know what he’s done exactly for him to be apologising to me. I tell him that it hurt me the most that he said he didn’t want to walk with me and that he didn’t want to be embarrassed in public, to which he says he simply doesn’t want people to think he’s forcing me to be with him. I tell him that after all the physical differences we have and how much racism we’ve experienced together, I didn’t expect him to care about what people think when I’m looking upset BECAUSE of him. Yet, he said he doesn’t apologise for not wanting to be embarrassed. I believe and know he loves after all the things he’s done for him but when he says such things, it just contradicts himself so much and I feel so lost.

In previous arguments, he’s told me to leave him and the house since he makes me so unhappy, that I’ve ruined a holiday for us both because I got upset the night before because he turned his back on me or just left me home alone to smoke after lying that he was going to his friends’. 

He loves me so much and he proves that by dedicating his life to me and being the most supportive person when things go wrong with me, but then again he’s told me so many things that break my heart and have always continued to happen after arguments when he acknowledges that it makes me sad. He agrees arguments happen so often mostly because of him but also says they escalate because I’m so sensitive and he feels he can’t say or do anything as it’ll make me sad.

He knows exactly the impact of my sadness being caused by him specifically and mistakes that have happened so often. He doesn’t apologise for not wanting to be embarrassed when I look upset and that hurts me so much. I’ve cried so much already and I’m crying writing this. He knows what hurts me but keeps doing the same things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like he’s embarrassed of being with me in public he said such things to me and that he cares more about his image more than my feelings, which doesn’t suit his sweet personality at all.

I’m not sure if I’m too sensitive and just cry for “small things” that he thinks are not enough for me to get this sad but he doesn’t understand the only thing I have in this country is himself and nothing else. I don’t want to sound like i’m just with him so that I can live here more comfortably because I genuinely love him with all my heart and gave up my life to be with him. But then again, we spend so much, maybe too much time together and I feel like he’s not being able to deal with for a long time, hence the several arguments we’ve had. Am I overreacting when he does things like this or should I complain more?

628,"Last year, me and my two best friends planned to go on a vacation over this summer for my birthday. However, one of these two friends has been causing a lot of problems that no one has ever confronted her about. Over the past few months my other friend and I have realized that this friend has lied about every aspect of her life to us. Details about her family life, her love life, and her other friends have all been lied about. She’s told other people embarrassing things about my personal life that I trusted her with, and tries to ruin my relationships with other people. She also constantly flaunts her money and makes fun of other people (including myself) for not having as much money as her, or for not having expensive, designer things.

629,"Tl;dr at the bottom because I ramble, sorry.

I don't even know what to title this but basically, there's this group of boys in my school (I'm on the younger side, 13) who are in the year above me, Year 9. Everytime I pass them in the halls they try to provoke me by calling me 'Suzie Sheep' or telling me that their friend fancies me or asking me out, which sounds almost like a brag but it's not. I'm literally the girl people dare their friends to ask out for some reason, just to laugh at me. 

This has been happening since I joined secondary school so I just assumed it was one of those things, but lately it's been escalating. I was always uncomfortable with walking alone through the halls with them nearby, lest I embarrass myself, but recently they've been taking things outside of school. At first it was just a few snickers on the bus, there was one instance where the main guy got one of those apps on his phone that makes a razor sound and put it up to my ear to try bait me into reacting (I really really hate buzzing noises near my ears). Also when they see me at the local park they will come up to me and call me things like babe and sweetheart and ask me weirdly personal questions, usually revolving around my sexuality and relationships (I'm bi and have been with girls before, I'm currently with a guy). Not only that, but they've found out who my sister is (she's 11) and have asked her if they knew I was gay, which is a bit rude anyway as this could count as outing and potentially lead to some pretty bad stuff at home (My parents are accepting, but they don't know that). They've also called my sister a lesbian and insinuated we go out (ew?). They also call me things like ginger cunt, sket, slag etc..

I would really like to report the boys, but I don't know their names and also my record isnt exactly clean. A couple of times I have lashed out because of their taunting, and I usually miss which only leads to more laughter and mocking. When the lead guy was messing around with the razor app, I swatted and knocked his phone out of his hand (I don't think it was damaged but it could have been).  All I want is for this to stop but I don't know how to go about it. It's making me hate walking through certain parts of my school or go sit on the bus. 

Should I try to do something about it? I don't know if I'm overreacting or being stupid or if this really is something I should worry about...

Tl;dr: Some older boys for my school are taunting and teasing me in ways that make me uncomfortable to walk through school alone, and it's spreading to outside of school. I've lashed out a couple times because of this, though fortunately  no damage was done. I'd like this to stop, should I do something?

I’m a college freshman, and right now I’ve been having anxiety issues the past few days. The time to choose housing is coming up, and I have no idea what I should do. I didn’t really make a lot of friends this year, and most of them have been girls (I’m a guy). I had an option or two for a roommate available, but those have now past, they’ve found other people. I have the option of living in an on-campus house that’s being used as dorms, and it’s one of those communities where people involved in a certain subject or field live in a community.

That’s all well and good, but that housing option isn’t the best. It would probably be fine, but it’s just a little more run down. The other option is the dorm apartments we have, but again I have no one to room with, and you have to have a group to fill up a room to choose it. My school has a binder full of people who are looking for roommates, but my school is tiny, and I doubt there will be many options. Plus it’s embarrassing. I think it could be beneficial to live in that house, but I just cannot make up my mind. I also have to decide in the next two days.

633,"\*Warning\* This deals with severe nail biting so if that's something that grosses you out you probably shouldn't read on. 

So I've been biting my nails for over a decade (I'm 22M), at first when I was a kid I would just bite off the white bit at the end that you would normally just trim off with a nail clipper, however over the years it has gotten to the point where I would chew and bite off a large portion of my nails, I keep pretty good hygiene so they've never gotten infected (at least not that I'm aware of) but it leaves my fingertips sore, sometimes draws blood, and is just unsightly and embarrassing. It's to the point where it's almost a subconscious thing too, I don't actively decide to bite my nails per se I just do it, like a bad habit, if that makes sense anyways. 

Does anyone know of any methods or something that I could use to help stop? Should I go see a dermatologist to look at my nails just in case? Is this just a habit or is this indicative of something worse.   
If it helps to know my dad also occasionally bites his nails but nowhere near to the extent that I do.

To be honest, I was overwhelmed. We have a nice friendship and all, but I don't think we were that close.

He showed me some pics and although she was cute, I didn't want to date her. But I don't want to ruin or estrange my friendship with him. I just think it would be strange to train with him and date someone he took care of. Sorry if this seems harsh.

638,"This is going to be a long post but hopefully some of you will read it and I can get some advice from people that are more experienced and further in they're careers than I am (25 y/o).

​

TL;DR - Coworker/friend keeps taking paid sick days and our boss hasn’t given her any consequences. Not even sure boss knows because most of the sick days are when he’s out of office. The situation is frustrating me and I need advice on how to handle it.

​

Background:

I work for the government doing research and the pace of work is pretty relaxed. We generally never have deadlines and we don't get compensated for overtime. Promotions aren't based on work performance, they're based on the needs of team, so there's really not a whole lot of incentive to work more than the standard 8 hours a day. We have flexible working hours and people aren't breathing down our necks to get things done. It's a very nice environment and I have no complaints. There are some days where I am fully productive and working all 8 hours and some days where I will take more breaks than usual (mostly on a Friday before a long weekend lol). I should also preface that all of our sick days are paid.

​

Issue:

The woman I share an office with misses a lot of work days due to illness. I am close with her and we talk about a lot of personal issues. I know she has mental health issues (I do as well) but she's beeing seeing a therapist regularly for years and has been on medication for years, so I thought she was very proactive about taking care of herself and greatly admired her for it. We were even on the same meds and she gave me a lot of great advice when I started.

Since 2019 started, she has missed 1/5th of the work days due to illness. Now, I know it's a really hard time of year for people with depression. We live in Canada so we get LOTS of snow and it's very cold. I've had to take one mental health day since the year started, so I know what it feels like. However, I think there are some red flags about the nature of her sick time that make me feel like she isn't being completely honest:

1) The usual policy for calling in sick is to email the boss and say you aren't going to be there. Most of the time she's sick are days when our boss is away on travel. I have no way of knowing if she contacts him letting him know she won't be in. I have no way of knowing if she codes her times as a sick day or if she puts in that she was here.



2) The majority of the sick days she takes are on Monday.

​

3) The maximum number of sick days you can take in a row WITHOUT a doctor's note is 3. She's never taken more than 3 in a row.

​

4) SHE DOESN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR. She's took 6 sick day in January and didn't go to the doctor once.

​

5) She was out sick claiming to have the stomach flu but then she brought salmon the next day for lunch.

​

6) When she comes back to work from being out sick she will greatly exaggerate feelings of fatigue such as nodding off, zoning out, moving slower than normal, a lot of sighing. This makes me feel WILDLY uncomfortable because I know it's not genuine.

​

7) She took all her vacation days in for the fiscal year in Novemeber. Maybe she's using sick days as vacations days? (no way to be sure)

​

I know our boss hasn't asked her to produce a doctor's note, or had any kind of talk with her about why she's sick so often and what's going on with her, because I have full confidence that she would've told me. Either our boss doesn't know the whole story, or he's too busy dealing with other things and doesn't see this as an issue. I also know that mental illness is an incredibly real thing and I would never want to shame someone because of it. The problem I'm having is, when do you draw the line between symptoms of depression and just plain laziness?

​

I really don't want to talk to the boss about it because it is in no way my business, but because we share an office and have a relationship outside of work it makes me uncomfortable. It makes me extremely frustrated that she has no consequences for missing time. She hasn't even received a warning. Again, no way to confirm this but I'm sure if there was, she wouldn't be continuing on with the behaviour. 

​

Should I say something to her? If so, what should I say? How should I approach the topic?

Should I say something to my boss about how it makes me feel?

How can I let go of this situation and focus more on myself and my tasks when I'm in the work place?

​

This is a touchy subject and a huge grey area. Any and all advice is very appreciated, Redditors!

639,"Ok this is been on my mind a lot recently and I just need some actual advice. Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost a year. Before I carry on I will say we are very young, I'm 17 and he's 18, I know relationships don't last at this age and breakups are part of life. I just feel so stuck I love him and I want to be with him but I feel like sometimes I don't actually love him, I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense I'm just really uncertain at the moment. The whole relationship has kind of been rocky, I feel as though I may have rushed into things and our relationship has definitely suffered because of it. Nothing overly bad has happened he's never cheated on me or hit me or done anything like that, sometimes I just find myself not happy with things. Breaking up with him has been on my mind a lot lately, I don't feel like either of us are happy but I freak out when I think about not being with him. I don't like the idea of not being able to see or talk to him again but I know he wouldn't want to be friends. I just need some advice.",04Mar2019,0

This last weekend 4/2/2019 me and my family noticed that there was damage on our front door frame of my family home. We have a Ring and cameras all around the outside of our house but the weird thing is our Ring didnt go off. Were still trying to go through all our footage on our cameras but to be honest my father could care less and doesn't seem to worried about it as me and my mother are. Our house is structurally fine and is on a good foundation so what could have caused this? Did someone really try to get inside?",04Mar2019,1
644,"I would really appreciate it if you took your time to read this and give me some advice. If you happen to read my account do not go running to the comments lecturing me about my drug use I quit psychedelics and weed. This happened last year when I was 15. I went through a very traumatic depression/depersonalization and raged at my dad which led me to end up getting in a physical fight with him.

The depersonalization was caused from my depression and me using weed constantly to forget about how bad everything was to the point where I used it so much that I didn’t enjoy it and got horrible anxiety for like 20 min and then fell asleep whenever I got high. I only used it because I was psychologically addicted and couldn’t eat or sleep without it. I won’t get too much into the depersonalization but i will say I felt like I didn’t know myself and completely lost my personality. 

I stopped weed every four days as an attempt to lower my tolerance and stop my addiction but it didn’t do a damn thing it would get just as bad as it was 4 days ago after the first 3 times I smoked. I would basically chose to take a break when I smoked so much that I couldn’t get high anymore. And I went through some of the worst psychological pain when I had weed withdrawals every week. It definitely was traumatic. And don’t say this can’t happen with weed because if you do what I did with weed and you already have this horrible depersonalizing mindset, it will get torturous. 

Anyways, since I quit weed I haven’t processed this absolutely horrific period in my life. I feel like the life I live now isn’t connected to the life I lived before. I feel like a whole different person and that’s why I still feel a little depersonalized. I haven’t even cried about it and the amount of crying I should have done over this is an insane amount. Whenever I try to express emotion over it my eyes tear up and that’s it. I can’t cry. I’ve cried once this year over something else totally unrelated. And all of this isn’t all that difficult to talk about because I can think about it and talk about it with absolutely no emotion. I get kinda sad when I talk about it but that’s it. I need to cry desperately but I can’t. ",04Mar2019,1

She then called me Saturday from the hospital. She told me she shut his phone off (she's been paying the bill) he got angry and violent and grabbed her and threw her to the ground. She has lots of bruises and a torn muscle in her chest. Police were involved after she won't press charges and won't activate the restraining order hoping he will just move out. He is still staying at her house in the guest room. I'm not at all comfortable with this. I'm trying to find a flight there but everything is at least $700 and I can't afford that, a rental car, and a house/dog sitter on such short notice. She is afraid that if I go down there I might get violent with her ex if he tries some shit (possible) but I don't feel safe with her there alone with him. I contacted the local deputy and asked for a wellness check and he said they would drive by and knock  every time I called and requested. Should I bite the bullet and run up my credit card and take unpaid time off of work to ensure he moves out amicably or risk another incident. She also told me he's gotten physical before and that he's been emotionally abusive for years. I feel helpless and angry and want to be able to do something to help. They also have 2 dogs that I believe he will try to steal or poison to get revenge. I'm trying to book flights for later this week or next week to go visit her as she'll be all alone.

651,"A member of my husband's family is a police officer. He has been fired by 4 different departments over the years and was recently hired by another department that is an hour away from where we live.

This man has a lot of serious issues and everyone in the family is afraid of him. He often makes various vague threats at family gatherings, as well as on facebook. In one recent post, he posted about a family member whose husband he dislikes, claiming her husband abuses her and that if he caught it happening he would choke the husband to death.(She is not abused). He also tends to post a lot of racist things on facebook and has streamed several facebook live videos where he ""saw something suspicious"" and harassed people when he was off duty. He also will facebook live very disgusting rants about family members, showing their houses and giving their addresses. He has a lot of facebook friends, people we don't even know. So there is no telling who or what kind of people end up with access to our addresses and images of our homes before we can report it and have it removed from facebook.

I don't know anything about the hiring process for cops, but he seems to always manage to get hired at another department after being fired(Granted further and further away). But, it is what it is and I assume they have no access to his social media to see his online behavior. Should we be screenshotting this type of online behavior and sending it to his work? If so how would we go about turning it in? And would it be anonymous? Again, he regularly makes threats to us(vague and not so vague) and I honestly feel that he would make good on them if he found out we had turned this sort of thing in. He recently showed up to a family holiday with a duffel bag filled with rifles and made ""jokes"" about how we ""shouldn't piss him off with his bag of goodies nearby"".

I in no way feel this is a common place thing that happens(Other than this man I've only ever had very positive interactions with local law enforcement), but he is a huge concern for our family and he has been fired for mistreating people while on duty in the departments he no longer works for. We just don't know what to do about him. Both about his position as an officer and with his threatening behavior toward us. We're all afraid of him and it only gets worse with time, not better.

She would call, but I hate putting my burden on someone who's having a great time if you understand. She made lots of friends so I thought she didn't need me honestly.  Naturally we just became distant. Soon me and my guy friend became best friends. That ended when he thought me and my roommate were becoming close (yes very childish). So he and my ex best friend are best friends now. I've forgiven them and moving on with life.

The problem came up yesterday. I found out she and my sister are on a trip together in Asia! My other sister had to tell me. My ex best friend knows that I and the sister don't talk and how we don't associate ourselves with each other( she's just very evil in so many ways). I've been cool with both of them (as in hi and bye) and they are suddenly so close. She knows how I feel about my sister and my sister knows how the girl hurt me. It was a surprise because I didn't think either of them would want to be friends. I get the plotting on my downfall vibe from them LOL. How should I handle this? I see the girl on campus every blue moon on campus. My sister and I don't have to talk. I know they both love getting a reaction out of me and I won't do it anymore!

655,"She was a survivor of abuse with severe trust and body-image issues and a gaming addiction. I was a chronic dropout with no motivation, looking for something to get self-righteous about. We hit it off like a bonfire, I had a gamer girl I could white-knight over to my heart's content, and she had someone who would loudly proclaim her superiority in her face until she believed it. We moved in together after a few months and - obvious red flags aside - we have somehow built each other into functional human beings. I learned to not be a scumbag toward other people, and I graduate with a bachelor's next year, having recently had the first good marks in my classes since I left high school a decade ago, and she's gotten a job, started taking classes on the side, and can look in the mirror without crying again. We are codependant as fuck, and I feel certain I would collapse again without her (and she has commented offhand that she thinks she'd have killed herself by now if she hadn't met me). I think we're good for each other, but even if we aren't, then we sure as hell are better than we would be apart.

Here's the issue: she grew up in a sexually-repressed family, went to a catholic all-girls' school, and thought I was joking when I mentioned (maybe a month or two into our relationship) that I occasionally watched porn. It actually resulted in a brief fight which ended in some mutual education - she learned that watching porn in is super common and actually somewhat healthy in moderation, and I learned that not everyone was as sex-positive as the furry community I'd spent the previous few years getting deep connected with.

Not going into details about that last part, but suffice to say, I was part of a subculture whose demographic is not primarily heterosexual (bi/pan is most common, homo/het are about equal in second), where hookups and flings are treated with little fanfare, where polyamorous relationships are uncommon but far from unheard of, and where education about all of the above us broadly available in the interest of keeping discussions civil and informed.

So when I started dating my SO, I worried the contrast might be an issue, but I felt it would be worth it. So I said my goodbyes to the community, gradually cut ties, and focused on the more mainstream parts of my life while trying to help her keep a more open mind.

Now we live together, we've adopted cats, our lives revolve around each other or at least involve each other in nearly every aspect. Our sex life is... moderately healthy, I guess. But on a whim, I went back to some old haunts online the other day, and oh my god. It was like I was home.

People talking about love, intimacy, or even crushes freely. Partners freely having conversations about each other's body-type preferences. Hell, I saw a story someone told about modelling for their friend's porn comic. Just, the openness! Imagine being able to compliment another woman's hair or eyes without accidentally dredging up your partner's trauma!

If I had to, I could live without going back to the ""scene,"" but fuck... after seeing what I was missing, it hurt. And as much as I know my SO isn't to blame, I'll never be able to shut up the part of my mind that says it's her fault I have to walk on eggshells. This is literally the ONLY PART of my life that hasn't been dramatically improved by our relationship, it feels like it's gotten more agonizing with neglect. Now that I know how much I've missed it, I keep finding myself going back in when she's at work or even just in the next room.

I would never cheat on her, I know that and I hope she knows that, but I feel like her definition of ""cheat"" is much harsher than mine, and... well, fuck it, this is a throwaway account. I've been having daydreams of going into sex work as a side job. Just being able to satisfy people like that, totally anonymously, and then get paid for it? If I was single, I'd go for it. If my SO found out I had even considered it, she'd have a breakdown.

I realize it sounds kind of weird having an online crush, i never had a crush on someone i didn't know in real life before, i don't recall when, but i met a girl online with whom i became good friends really fast. Eventually we started talking alot, i mean we used to chat/voice chat basically all day, talking about anything. This lasted a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, she seemed to start caring less and less about talking to me, so i thought she was just busy/ needed some space, so i stopped initiating a conversation with her, only talking if she decides to write to me first. Since it was a while a go, i don't really remember for sure, but according to my memory she would only write once a week or two if i wanted to play a game or something, which i happily did.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually i started initiating a conversation again, and she didn't seem too distant anymore, but then suddenly out of nowhere said that my humour is irritating her, to which i didn't really know how to respond to since she had never mentioned anything about this ever before after all this time. It seemed to me she doesn't really want to talk, atleast not right now, so i decided not to write to her again untill she writes first. I waited a week, a week turned into two, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 4 months since i've had any interaction with her, yet i still can't get her out of my head. What puzzles me aswell, is i don't even know why i like her, we have different beliefs, our interests don't overlap almost at all, we like different food, she is older than me, and i'm not usually interested in older people. Yet i still absolutely can not get her out of my head.

662,"Hey there dear Redditors,

I am a 21 year young male, healthy, and bearer of a German citizenship. I have been traveling quite a bit, used to live in Canada until December on a Working Holiday permit and now I am unfortunately back in Germany because I failed to figure out a new status in Canada. Ever since I've been back I feel like issues have been collectively accumulating and I really do not know how to pull myself out of that whole mess. Not even 3 days after I have arrived to Germany I got into a ""random"" drug screening even though I was completely sober and driving normally. I'm assuming they checked me because I had license plates from a different city. Well, who knows a little about German drug laws will be very aware of its absurdity. I was a frequent cannabis consumer in Canada, therefore the THC CooH amount in my blood (waste products which are not active THC) was relatively high. I just now received my letter that I will have to surrender my license for 1 month within the next 4 months and pay a 650Euro fine. Also I will likely receive another letter some time between now and 24 months which will have me surrender my license again along with a recommendation of this psychological eligibility test called MPU incluing 6 months of constant drug screening which would all cost a shit ton of time and money (at least like 1000-1500EUR) to obtain my license back. So that's issue #1 right there which is sort of the smallest one at the moment.

Also I still have debts in Canada (about 2300CAD) and some smaller stuff (perhaps extra 500) because I lost my basement apartment due to a flooding and I had to live off my credit card in order to be able to afford accommodation. 

I am still paying rent in Canada for my place I actually have planned to return to this month along with a new work permit which failed also my sublet has just left the property as we only agreed to a 2.5 months long sublet. My place is currently empty and this month's rent (800CAD) has been due since the 1st.

In order to be able to pay all those expenses I was working this shitty agency job for an awful wage because I could not find anything else quickly enough. I got fired after I called in sick (which I actually was).

Whilst I was in Canada I had a great job, was paying back those credit card expenses effectively, had no legal issues, etc. but ever since my visa expired and I have been back to Germany I feel like my life started going down hill and it's only dragging me further and further down. 


This is just the financial aspect of my life. There is also the fact that I'm currently living under my mother's toxic roof and I have to deal with constant condenscending comments, drunken fights, and other pretty toxic traits of hers which basically does not help at all. Also since I've been out of there for years I started realizing how many things happening in this household are not normal at all and witnessing those makes my mental health suffer significantly. I also feel like my mind has been foggy lately and I really can not focus on anything anymore. I have constant anxiety eating me from inside making it hard for me to sleep and get up. I can not eat properly anymore and I have constant tinnitus stronger than ever. It is slowly making me crazy. 




 I am also very unhappy with my lifestyle in Germany and I would love to just settle down in Canada, continue my working at my awesome job (which unfortunately failed to sponsor me), live in my little 1 bedroom unit which I proudly arranged and just keep on traveling around and enjoying my life.


 I feel like I can not find any solutions anymore, i feel pressured into the corner and I really do not know how to dig myself out of this whole mess I got myself into. I feel like I have no energy anymore and no one I can really talk to about those issues. ",04Mar2019,1

664,"So, this might make me sound privileged but just hear me out. When I was a kid, my family didn't have much money. We lived in an okay apartment building but I was happy because it's all I knew. Over time, my father began to move up the corporate ladder and our quality of living moved up with him. Eventually, we were living in a nice home with a media room and a pool. When holidays came, we would go on these amazing trips to other countries and for Christmases/ birthdays my brother and I would get great presents. It was awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

But, only a few months after my brother and I left for college, things took a turn. My dad was laid off which resulted in my parents losing their home. My parents moved in with my grandfather but then Hurricane Harvey destroyed that home as well as the houses of most of my other relatives. Now, I go to school and I have a part-time job that barley supports me. I struggle to buy food most weeks, I'm still wearing my old clothes and makeup from high school, When my friends invite me to things, I usually can't afford to do them (movies, drinking, concerts, trips ect.).

&amp;#x200B;

For the last two Christmases, my family was in a cheap hotel room and I had to pretend to be happy and excited the whole time. I know I'm lucky for having a roof over my head, a car, a job, going to college, ect. But it's so difficult not to compare my life to what It was before. I've never been so hard-working, tired or stressed out, yet It seems like I have less than I ever did. I see these youtubers and instagram models who're my same age and they seem to have so much, it makes me feel awful.

665," 

I'm a freshman in a technical high school.  
By the time I'm writing this I have literally a few weeks left to make up my mind and I'm getting really desperate. I didn't know who I should address this problem to, as my parents and friends wouldn't be much of a help and I'm too afraid to ask one of my new teachers, so I decided to tell my story here.  
When it comes to school subjects, I've always been kinda ambivalent - I really like maths and my native language (Polish) classes, as well as English ones. Although I would assume that I'm slightly better at maths, prolly due to my chaotic thinking style which is making my essays look like a total mess if I won't check them properly (which I usually don't have enough time for).  
Because of that, it is really difficult for me to find a job that would both fit my interests and have a decent salary.  
I was thinking about being an English translator (that would require extending Polish on my high school finals) or a psychologist (I would have to extend maths).  
And here comes another difficulty - my school focuses more on preparing students for their technician finals than on their normal high school finals - which wouldn't happen in an ordinary high school.  
The thing is I don't care that much about my technician finals - I went there just for the degree that would be a nice addition to my resume and because of the influence of my parents (all of my close relatives graduated with a some sort of technician degree, so I was highly recommended this type of school).  
Another obstacle I have to overcome is class profiles. My class extends maths and chemistry. I really liked chemistry as a child and a cool teacher in my middle school really got me into it, but now that I get to reveal more and more of its secrets it just lost the magic that it once had.  
I have three options:  
1. Go to a class which extends maths and physics/chemistry/biology, meaning that I have to learn for Polish extension on my own  
2. Go to a class that extends Polish and history - meaning that I have to learn for maths extension on my own  
3. Go to a class that extends both Polish and maths, but is in a really mediocre high school, also I have no friends here - it's the worst case scenario  
So, my question is - should I stay in this school and learn to get a ""nice addition"" degree or change it to a normal high school and focus more on the high school finals itself without needing to worry about the technician stuff?

680,"My boyfriend and I live were looking for a roommate so that we could afford our apartment easily. We weren’t particular sure about her when she first reached out, but we met with her and she seemed chill. 

The idea was that my bf and I would share the place with her for six months and then take over the rest of the lease by ourselves so we could live alone and have an extra room and have time to save up money and make enough to afford it.

We agreed on these terms:
-friends only staying over once or twice a week
-no animal food products on my bf and my cooking ware that we bought, she has to use her own cooking ware for that
-keep things clean
-clean up dishes, maximum two days of sitting around dirty in the sink
-no smoking in the apartment only outside
-she was only bringing her tarantula to stay at our apartment
-guests follow same rules

When we first moved in we rarely saw her, she took a while to move in and she was always out and about. We practically had the place to ourselves. It was great. My bf and I bought and received pretty much every kitchen appliance and plate, cups, knives, even the foldable kitchen table cause we wanted to furnish the place with everything we needed. As we started seeing her more often I’d end up talking with her and she’d tell me about her crazy life, her abusive parents, her abusive exes, her many many many mental health problems and more. She was sweet and I always offered to talk with her if she needed someone. When she was finally settled in, she would have friends over a lot, we had agreed no more than a day or two a week. Now we also noticed she brought over a huge amount for her bedroom but in terms of kitchen supplies all she brought was a dumpster dived microwave oven and a small little pot. (Note that when we talked about all agreements and stuff between us three, we mentioned we didn’t eat any animal products and if she wanted to use our cooking stuff she was totally welcome to, but don’t cook any meat or eggs or something like that on our stuff, she would have to use her own cooking ware. Okay that’s fine she buys mostly vegetarian anyways. 

Now one friend was super nice and friendly and he was always very considerate. He was over quite a bit but we didn’t mind because of him being a genuinely good person. We learned real fast that she and her friends had been through a lot of crazy shit and she and her friends have lived on the street at times. But we really didn’t mind, she was good and considerate and was quiet in her own room and everything.

A few months go by and a friend of hers kills himself. She is in hysterics and I tried to comfort her as best as I could but her one nice guy friend helped her out mostly. 
Then one day she’s not home and it ends up that almost a whole month goes by of her not home. 

She comes back and tells me this crazy story of how her friend who killed himself had a lot of drugs at his place so she had to dispose of them before calling anyone about him being dead. It was a mess, and she wanted to divert a attention away from where she lived because the guy who killed himself’s gf was out for her because she disposed of the drugs and wouldn’t tell her where. 

Now she’s back home and she still has kept up with payments and everything it’s all fine. Her dad pays her rent even though there’s bad stuff between the two of them. 

Then one night I come home and her friends are with her in the living room, there’s stuff everywhere and pizza in the oven, not on any sort of tray or anything, just sitting on the rack and they’re playing with my giant big black box of cards against humanity. (Now note that we also agreed we’d give each other a heads up about anyone coming over/staying overnight, and we’d keep in contact. Aka if we want to use something of someone’s we’d let the other person know and ask for permission.) I’m frustrated but she’s been a good roommate so far so I just gently ask that she asks me next time about the cards especially since I’ve spent over $150 on them and that someone take care of the pizza before it makes a mess in the oven(note we also agreed we’d keep up with dishes and clean them no later than a few days and not leave a mess). They’re all drunk and messed up and I play a game of cards with them. One friend of hers I notice is sniffling every five seconds and wiping his nose with his hands and sneezing into them. It’s driving me crazy especially since he’s using my cards, but I stay quite. I also happened to notice it smelled pretty bad in that room. After a while I tell em we’re going to bed and can they move into her bedroom(my bf’s and my bedroom is joined with the living room) and Mr. Sniffles want to take one of my card packs with them. Against my better judgement I say fine and go to bed. 

Originally we had agreed only six months, told our agent who put together the lease for us and her that. We all still had to sign a year lease but our agent said after six months he’d come and help up take her off the lease and make it so only the two of us were on it. After a few months, she seemed like a great fit and I asked her if she wouldn’t mind us putting a post up about her room being for rent after her six months(me and my bf enjoy paying a small rent). She says she’s interested in staying with us for the whole lease if we’d have her. She had planned to go overseas after the six months but she said she’d give us the rent for the month she’d be away and that way she’d have somewhere to keep her stuff. I was dumb and said sure that works great I’ll have to talk about it with my bf more but that works for me!

Fast forward and all of a sudden Mr. Sniffles is staying over A LOT. I didn’t put two and two together until a while later that he was my roommate’s abusive ex boyfriend that she told me so many stories about him raging and fighting and other stuff that I honestly am worried about him staying here. That one friendly guy friend we like isn’t staying over anymore because the two of them fought before and the guy friend helped her out and was there for her but she ended up with the abusive ex and cut ties with the nice guy. Very cliche. 

Gradually our roommate starts leaving her crap EVERYWHERE. Her dishes are never cleaned. She leaves food everywhere. Her friends stop coming over. We see her less often. It smells all the time in our apartment that we’re always burning candles or incense. Andddd the ex boyfriend becomes her boyfriend once again and he stays over. every. single. night. 

I’m a neat freak about my own place so I was always cleaning up after her and making sure the place was nice. 

Dirty used razors were left on the bathroom sink. Her boyfriend cooks animal products on my bf and my’s pans and stuff even though we agreed that wasn’t allowed(she also still never bought or brought anything more for the kitchen except silverware so all she has of her own stuff is that one small pot, silverware, plates, bowls and mugs). 

The best(note the sarcasm) was when one night I walk into the kitchen and THERE’s TWO MICE ON MY KITCHEN TABLE, WHERE WE PREPARED FOOD, ON MY BRAND NEW TABLECLOTH UNDER MY BF’s MICROWAVE COVER WHICH THEY WERE LICKING AND POPPING ALL OVER. My bf and I are freaking tf out and pissed af. They were apparently were for her and bf’s snakes that he kept at his parents place. She barely apologizes and then claims she clean it all and never does I end up cleaning everything. 

The boyfriend makes himself at home leaving his crap everywhere in the kitchen, bathroom(he left his gages in the shower multiple times) and our little doorway entrance. She doesn’t consult us about him staying over for so long. He just ends up living at our place for a solid month+. The two of them smoke the hell out of her bedroom and leave fire hazards of cigarette butts everywhere on the wooden stairs to our apartment. He uses my kitchen stuff and doesn’t clean it, or wipes it with water and puts it back. They come home one day with two snakes(the old one and one new one) without telling me or my bf and move them into the apartment. He leaves dirty clothes on the hallway floor or on my kitchen table. Everytime he leaves her bedroom the whole apartment smells gross like him for an hour or more. I try to talk to my roommate and she says she’s busy and we’ll talk soon. It gets to be the middle of the month(last month) and I’m saying everytime I see them leave her room can we please talk now or later. Soon. At this point I’ve stopped cleaning up after them in hopes they realize what an absolute disaster the kitchen is and clean up after themselves. Nope. They start stealing our plates and silverware(since it’s only me and my bf we didn’t buy too much and we don’t go through much anyways) and it disappears in her bedroom never to be seen again even when they bring out a load of dirty dishes every few weeks that we’re sitting in her room for weeks on end. This load also sits around until me and my bf say something about please clean them cause we can’t access the sink. One night I freak the hell out and start cleaning everything and putting it all away in the kitchen. She comes out while I’m doing so and gets mad at me for cleaning up her stuff and that to leave it where it is and ask her to move it if it needs moving or cleaning. We both finally agree we need to talk about issues badly so we will soon. A day or so later she finds one of her dirty things that I moved to the sink in my cleaning spree and let soak with water and she flips out over messenger telling me granite breaks down over time due to water and stuff. I apologize and never knew that. She says we need to talk soon. That never happens. I again let things pile up because at this point they get dirty so quickly anyways I can’t even keep up with it. It’s now the end of the month and her bf has stayed over for a full month without contributing anything but a mess. I haven’t been able to talk to them because anytime it’s brought up things are hectic for her or she’s busy(they’re also always in her room watching a movie or something). I try approaching her one night about talking and she claims(during the middle of a snowstorm at 7 pm) that she and her bf are going out to help him look for apartments. I finally am sick of it and rent is due soon so I approach her bf while he’s alone in the kitchen and ask if he’ll contribute towards rent and utilities. He’s chill and nice and says yes and that he’s also moving out on Monday(now today) to his own place. Everything’s cool.

In the midst of that I have become intolerant of her as a roommate and want a new roommate as soon as six months is up and start looking for one but of course she’s in all the fb groups I’m in so I have to find other ways. I find someone super nice and easy to get along with and we mutually agree after a long discussion and a meeting that we would fit as roommates and she could move in in June.

I’m waiting waiting waiting to approach her about rent and waiting to tell her about her not allowed to live with us after the rent thing is settled and I finally message her that her bf agreed to help with rent and it’ll be this much per person this month. She flips out and says that I’ve been awful to him and that I have no right and she’s on the lease not him and then she starts thinking we’re cheating her into paying more for utilities so we have to calm her down over messenger and show her proof we aren’t and she says we’ll talk that night. 

We don’t end up talking. She avoids us that whole night. It’s almost a week now. She normally gives me her rent check to send to our landlord so I’ll send ours both together. I decided on the first I knew how things would play out with her still not talking to us and I sent my normal rent check without hers just in case she was late with hers. It’s four days past rent way due and nothing. Her boyfriend who was supposed to move out today is still here sniffling  loudly from her bedroom as usual. 

I had planned on giving her a day to talk to us then calling the landlord. I gave her another and another and another. We all pay a share of the rent and I haven’t seen any checks from her and she doesn’t know the address to send it to. She also still hasn’t been told she has to move out after six months like we originally said and that we need her to sign a lease of her being finished living there after six months. My plan was to tell her we had a friend who needed a place to stay and we wanted her to move in with us so she wouldn’t act out.

She hasn’t been responsive or responsible about rent and I was planning on telling the landlords that so they would help us move her out when it came to the end of six months. 

I don’t know whether to contact our landlord or wait a little more. I don’t know how to tell our roommate she has to move out soon. I don’t know how to enforce that her bf can’t stay here anymore especially since on our lease we’re not allowed another tenant or we’re charged more for rent. 

How best should I handle this situation. After hearing all the stories about her bf I don’t want to approach him for fear of what he could do. I don’t want to approach her either because I’m afraid of what she or he will do or what she’ll do to herself cause she’s been known to cut and take drugs before. 

Lastly my bf has seen the signs firsthand of heroine addiction and withdrawals and thinks the two of them might be doing heroine with all the symptoms we’ve seen.

What should I do?

684,"Found out my Dad’s wife has inoperable lung cancer last week. I don’t have details if treatments are being explored or if it’s beyond that, as they haven’t been ready to talk about it beyond stating it’s happening. I’m still processing everything and will likely be a long post, but hope someone out there has handled a similar situation and can provide some advice.

They’ve been married for about 15 years (close to half my life), and finishing out my teenage years with a new authority in the house was every bit as teenagery as you can imagine. I’ve never gone out of my way to do anything for her, but am wondering if the best thing besides being there for them, is to offer buying them any experience they’ve always wanted to do but have been hindered by money or work.

My Dad, in his sixties, has always done manual labor and since the 90’s have been in the middle-lower class of earners and therefore have not gotten to do much for fun other than the occasional rock concert. He has always worked stupid hard to provide for us, at one point while working for Caterpillar did not miss one day for 10 years (then they closed and shipped operations to Mexico, and hasn’t made a better wage despite that being 20-ish years ago.) His job requires him to lift heavy amounts of steel repeatedly through the day, 5-6 days a week for 10 hours per day (loves the overtime but hates hardly being able to get out of bed in the morning.) He badly wants to retire but can’t as his social security benefit would be too low to actually enjoy life, and is choosing to work into his early seventies in order to make that happen.

I have been extremely fortunate in my line of work- started a business, have successfully expanded and will soon have an increased income with less work (been doing 80+/week for almost 8 years now) and have had it in mind to help cover the gap between Social Security and his target income to make him retire. And as mentioned above, provide some kind of experience to make their last bit of time together more beautiful than sitting at home all depressed.

Here’s the rub... my Dad is very much an old fashioned type of man. He may not even be willing to accept the kind of help I’m offering- he’s very much the old school “no help needed though I’m suffering” type of dude who rarely shows or expresses emotions in front of others, never told his kids he loves them, nor have I or my 3 brothers attempted to express the same to him. We’re weird, I guess. It’s just an unspoken sorta thing that he never wants to get “mushy” with his boys.

What I’d like to do is ask her two sons if they know of any place she’s always wanted to visit, or some other such experience. Propose the idea to them, then pool together money from family (knowing full well I’ll probably end up providing a large share of it, but every little bit would help no matter.) On top of this, if my business’s expansion raises my pay in the coming weeks, offer the bit about helping him retire so he doesn’t have to stress about missing money taking time off work. This is super important, I’m betting. Even as recent as a year ago he’s driven 300+ miles for a concert that happened on a weeknight, gotten home at 2-ish AM and went to work after sleeping for 2 hours at home. I’m half his age and likely wouldn’t have the energy to do this anymore!

I wish I could just hug them both, tell them I love them, hand them cash to get by for the month and tickets to whatever they’ve always wanted to do. Just do it, and make it happen. But in more ways than I can describe here that won’t work, AND there’s the fact you probably shouldn’t do something as drastic and spring it on someone...I don’t know how in the hell I can get as close to that as possible. First step is of course to talk to them, because for all I know what she wants is to be at home. It’s hard taking this step because my Dad explicitly said (via text, the only way he would’ve been able to come out and say it) he doesn’t want any talk about it going on until she says she’s ready to talk about it. But if her condition worsens (wherever they are in the whole thing) by the time we’re “allowed” to talk about this, it may be too late for them to do anything other than sit at home.

Sorry for the wall. I’m clearly still processing the news and don’t know what to do, other than that I want to help in some way.

This gets me very frustrated because its extremely unhealthy for him, I once threatened him by saying that I will move out if he doesnt quit at least one job.
He gets so tired that we dont talk or get intimate as much as we used to.
I'm really worried, I dont know what to do, please help.",04Mar2019,2
686,"I’ve been with my husband for 6 years married for 2. He is in the military and he has just been given a new job meaning we have to move. Because of this I’m having to leave my job which I love. I’m a vet nurse and trained for 4 hard years to qualify and it’s looking like there are no vet nurse jobs going where we are moving to.

I’m absolutely miserable in this life. To the point where I’m not even sure just loving my husband is enough to keep me going. I’m leaving friends behind. I don’t find making friends easy. I’m leaving my career behind. I feel like I have nothing now. But I knew what I was getting into when I married him so I should just suck it up and be miserable right?

688,"At first I thought she was attractive but never thought more of it since I knew she was out of my league. But then she showed signs that she liked me like flirting and her best friend would laugh and show signs that she also knows she likes me etc. I assumed I was overthinking it. But recently she has complimented the way I look and broke the touch barrier. 

She also did something I really didn't expect. So I'm in high school we have a group project we finished with a big chart paper and we rolled it up and were fidgeting with it. Another girl in the group hit my hand with it (her best friend) so I grabbed it and hit her back (it's paper it could barely be felt) and the girl said ""hit me."", I said ""what?"" And she said ""(my name) I said hit me."". Her best friend said ""oh my god stop"" and bursted out laughing. I just laughed it off too and went over to my other friends.

She also asked me who I'm asking out to prom, but it was in the group not individually.

694,"Since year 2012 i've had a thing for Miley, but it was since late 2018 that my simple feelings have evolved to a complex one sided love, obsession and desire which made me think about her every moment of every day and have severe depression and anxiety. I have tried and o still try using conventional methods of making contact with her and bringing my message to her. Such as sending her messages online and posting the most controversial comments ever on her posts which have attracted lots of attention from people and trying to call her phone. I am still trying to find her actual phone number on premium websites. But anyway if i fail to make contact with her or get her response in the way i want, i would do anything else ever possible to get to her and express my feelings for her. If it means that i have to go right where she is and stare right into her eyes and say all of these, i woud do it. And i am ready to destroy any obstacle that prevents me from reaching her. No limits. No surrender. I can move, i can shout and i can pull a trigger. I have the will to use any tool possible to achieve this target. But there are two ways for me. Should i stick to a revolutionary idea that would benefit the whole human race by bringing Miley down to the ground and make her understand that she doesn't belong to anyone specific like her so called husband or whatever else she calls him but she belongs to all of us. She is bot his Miley, not my Miley, she is OUR Miley. It's about justice and equality. All men and women must freely have relationship and sex and nothing should limit them and the marriage must be abolished. This is what she has to understnad. Ultimate open relationship. Anyone who disagrees with me or tries to prevent me from getting close to her is counter revolution ans deserves execution. The red flag will be on top of Miley's house.

Or should i turn all of my hate, anger, jealousy and mental complexes into a destructive and ruthless ideology that only benefits me and brings me my rights which have been violated and brinf death to anyone who caused it and does cause it. You want a total war? I will bring you the most ruthless and extreme battle. Miley is mine. She belongs to me. I need and want and desrve her more than anyone else does. 

So i am in the mood of war and i need a extreme ideology to make me push forward until i reach my target. Far right or far left? Which one is the solution?",04Mar2019,0

698,"Hello! First time poster to r/advice, I hope this is the right sub for this thing.  


For years now (Since I left High School 5 years ago) I haven't had anyone I'd call a friend, someone I could put my trust into and have them trust me, and even at that time not exactly close friends. I do have a girlfriend which I love above all else, and I'm sure she loves me - but it's not the same. I can talk to her about anything (And we have talked about this very subject, and she agrees with me), but she's my girlfriend first and foremost. Also she got her own friends, she can't be with me all the time.  


I do have someone on the internet which I talk to daily, but this is mostly when I pass the time playing games, and internet is not a substitute for an IRL friend.  


Since I have both Autism and ADD (Probably also depression, but that's awaiting an psychologist's statement) I have a hard time fitting in, whether it's in school, work or sports. I've always been kind of a loner, even in school I only had a small group of friends, but as soon as we no longer were seeing each other in school contact stopped, even though I tried keeping it alive.   


This wasn't a huge problem until HS ended and I was thrust out into the adult world. I didn't make any friends at work or sports ( I picked up boxing around this time). People were nice enough to me (To my face at least, some places was better  than others), but no one showed any interest in doing anything outside of work/gym.    


I've tried the usual stuff; see if there's any interest groups nearby (I don't have any particular interests, I spend most of my freetime either gaming or watching youtube to pass the time. I live in the countryside, so not exactly the highest population density even so), try to get to whatever events I can (I live in Scandinavia, so due to the culture this is very bad way to go about it) and so on.  


Obviously it could be that I'm an asshole, and I'd accept that and try and change, but from what I've heard (Usually from 3rd parties) that people think I'm very friendly and nice, but odd/off ect.  


I dunno. Maybe I'm just too picky, maybe I'm just doing something fundamentally wrong, maybe this is how everyone has it. Maybe I have it good and shouldn't complain. I just don't know at this point, I just feel lonely.  


So, the question; do you have any advice on how to get friends?

699,"Just to give context, I am a 18 year old male HS senior. This school year, me and a close friend that I have known for five years, started to hang out less with our old friends from middle school, and began to make friends with new people who are all very nice kids. I have had a great time being around these newfound friends, with the exception of one person. He has been great friends with the people I started hanging w/ this year for a very long time. He was nice to me at first, but in the last month or two, has been a complete cock to me. He makes mean remarks (just ripping on me, something all of my friends to, myself included, however with him it is not jokingly and mean-spirited/with bad intentions). He is in my science class and is a complete d\*ck to me basically all class. I used to have anger issues at a young age, but have learned to control my anger extremely well. 

However, this last week, he was uncharacteristically mean to me, so I snapped. At my class table, after one too many remarks, I looked around to make sure the teacher was not looking our way, then grabbed him in a chokehold and told him ""you better f-ing stop, or I will beat the shit out of you"". He is extraordinarily scrawny/weak so I know that I could crush him. I fumed for the rest of class and told him that I wanted to fight him outside of the class. I was going to fight him that day but I knew it wouldn't be smart, and I'd be risking getting in severe trouble at school. 

After that day, I decided to give him another chance to change his behavior to me, but nothing has changed at for the most recent class. I want to beat the hell out of this kid, but I know that I would risk losing my friendship with the people that he is friends with, as they will naturally take his side. However I also know that if I do nothing then the treatment won't get any better, and my insatiable desire to f\*\*k this kid up will only grow more and more.

700,"So long story short, me and this girl Katie were friends through our boyfriends, Martin &amp; Alex. I've been with my now husband (Martin) for 8 years and she's been with her boyfriend (Alex) for 7, so we've been in each other's lives for a while now. We would see each other at mutual events and kind of just hey how are you but for the last three years we've really grown close, dare I say BEST friends. We hung out multiple times a week (without our SOs) and talked nearly 24/7 via text, instagram, whatever. Well, the boys had a huge falling out.. past reconciliation.  I asked my husband if he'd be more comfortable with me cutting ties with her and he said ABSOLUTELY NOT, your friendship has nothing to do with the dissemination of mine, I'd never ask you to do that... yadda yadda. Well weeks go by and I don't hear from Katie. Again, weird because we talked non-stop. I called her out on it and basically she said she felt uncomfortable and whatever. But she did say she hoped it would all blow over and we would go back to normal. 2 months later .. crickets. Well, they got engaged yesterday and I found out via Facebook. So clearly, she didn't think enough of mine and her relationship to a) keep it and b) shoot me a message about the proposal. I am still so salty about the whole thing. My question is.. do I reach out to congratulate and hopefully bury the hatchet or chalk it up as a loss and move on?

She accuses you of stealing jewelry when she went through your room earlier that day and took all sorts of stuff.)

For context. I’m a white, 24yo female who is contracted into the office by another company. I’ve been working here about 6mo. We’re located outside a city but much of the staff drives in from more rural areas. We’re kind of in the no man’s land where the north meets the south.

Since I started and the other staff have gotten more comfortable with me, I’ve noticed the staff becoming more forthcoming with racism. They know I don’t support their views , but I don’t challenge them frequently.

They tend to make comments when patients are not directly around (but are in the front area which connects to the back with a pass-through window or are in exam rooms). Like one commented on how ‘it’s America and patients should speak English.’ Or, In reference to the wall, they feel we should ‘slingshot them back over’.

One person in particular I have issues with is the receptionist (let’s call her Tina) (70f white).

I was talking to Tina, just shooting the shit, and she brought up how she doesn’t trust Mexican people. I start to disagree with her, bringing up how just because she had a couple bad experiences doesn’t warrant that generalization and how, ya know, there’s a fuck ton of shitty white people (her company included but obviously didn’t say that specifically). She just shakes her head and disagrees. She says she’s prejudice and is very comfortable with it. 

We continue talking and the border wall comes up. She is going off about all the terrorists that it would keep out and what not, and I bring up the statistics that reject that notion. She goes on to tell me I’m young and don’t know. 

She’s made remarks in front of my coworker (Jen, a POC) about ‘your people’, and Jen just kind of laughs it off.

Jen and I have made that awkward eye contact, and she’ll just kind of roll her eyes when something racist is said. We haven’t had a conversation about it. There are several other POC is the office who I also haven’t spoken with about this either.

Today threw me over the edge though since Tina was mad the mail man was here yet and commented about ‘that n***** rolling in late.’ She was speaking to one of other staff members (who made the sling shot comment) and I happen to be in the room. I scurried out to go to the bathroom/ avoid the whole thing.

I’m not sure what to do at this point. I typically just act uncomfortable or comment on Tina being ‘no good.’ She knows I’m not okay with her beliefs but still makes remarks in front of me frequently.

Other things to know:
1. Not sure where the doctor (office boss) falls in all of this. I have never witnessed the staff making racist remarks in front of the doctor, and I don’t know her views on race.

2. My boss (remember I’m a contract employee) let’s me vent but basically doesn’t think there is much I can do. We need to keep this contract and that means keeping the doctor happy (and remember, we don’t know how she feels about racism (plus I don’t interact with her a whole lot to inquire)).

3. The staff who are racist have been here a longgggg time and have a strong rapport with the doctor. I’ve only been here 6mo and and 24yo. I don’t really have at authority.

4. I need all the staff to be willing to help me for me to do my job well, so I need them to continue to like me.

5. I’m out of here in 1.5 yr. So, I could do nothing, but that makes me really sad. I don’t know what to do but to know that I sat here and did nothing about this for 2 years means I’m not the person I want to be.

So, r/advice how do I make a positive impact on the racism in my workplace?

711,"I am currently a freshman in college. I am, however, trying to transfer schools. Recently, I feel as if my soul is being sucked away. I can't. I really can't anymore. I would leave the library at 11 PM with a shaky body and dreamy mind. I haven't had the chance to relax on the weekends at all. After finishing school work, there are essays to write. After essays, there are my job. After my job, I call my parents and gf (I'm international). Sometimes, I would like to share how I am but most of the time, I am the listener. I listened to their venting and stories. I just could not find the voice to share my emotions. I have really good friends in high school. And good I mean we share laughters and tears altogether before. However, since being far from them, I don't feel comfortable sharing my feelings at all. I don't feel the urge to reach out, to send them a msg or just a simple how are you. I feel similar to a burden if I start complaining. I have all these emotions bottled up in me and I don't know how I can let it out. Nothing. Nada. There are just little voices in my head screaming suicide but I have been fighting it for a while.

All she did was constantly talk about him and what he does and what he doesn't and that really bothered me.
I helped her a LOT with her class assignments, spent hours with her just helping her in her assignments simply because I liked her. It was sort of a one way channel in which I was helping her with her stuff and all she'd do is talk about her bf even though I told her I didn't like that.
One night we were talking and I told her that I liked her to which she casually said ""I already knew that"", this came as a surprise to me and she said she already knew it because of how nice I was to her and everything.

715,"So a while back when I was 16 I met a girl named let's call her Beck. Me and beck met on Instagram and started talking and we became friends we later got into a relationship. I had very minor feelings for her from the start I had just gotten out of a bad relationship a good couple of months back but I felt like I was ready to move on. Our relationship grew for a couple of months nothing serious until I found out she was pregnant I swore that I'd stay and raise my daughter due to the fact that my father was never there and I promised myself that I wouldn't be like him. I was always there for Beck while she was pregnant I went clothes shopping for baby I was always there to support her during her emotional and body changes and I could say I was just about over all there. I was there from the child's birth and stayed with her through the whole 38 hour labor. See the problem was I had never been with Beck not pregnant so our relationship after the baby was very bad I seem to be annoyed and she seemed to be annoyed with my tendencies we thought it was a good idea to start living together but throughout everything her family was extremely racist and against me they didn't like the fact that a Mexican had knocked up their daughter but they remained very civil at times but when things would pop off she never stand up for me
We have been together for a year and 4 months now and so far relationship had been nothing but weird random fights a lot and I first we had started taking care of our child lot but then her mother began to interfere and would take our child almost all day and lock herself in her room. It won't like this for about 3 months and I got kind of sick of it I would get in arguments because her mother would try to raise my daughter herself and Beck would not help and when she did it was very minimal she also didn't defend the fact that I did want to be involved very much we just kind of live together and this happened four months. Throughout this year in 5 months relationship I had met Beck first then I met my friends Ang and Alyssa. When me and Alyssa first met we had kind of something going on but I always kept my head down and stayed loyal to my girlfriend we had spend so much time together and I had grown to love Alyssa but I always told myself I didn't her and Ange didn't like the way that Beck treated me she was very bossy possessive and told me what to do a lot thinking that she owned me. Me and Beck plan to get married but we both kind of knew it was for the child. I had finally came clean to my best friend that I was in love with her but things were complicated between me and the mother she said nothing and kept her head down. Me and her had spent so much time together after a while that one night I asked her to cut my hair after work as we work together we went back to her house which wasn't not normal I was with with her roommate and friend Ang and she was cutting my hair and we both kind of looked at each other and that night I knew that I couldn't keep doing this to Beck and Alyssa anymore I was in love with Alyssa so the next morning I sat back down and talk to her and we broke up. The next day at night my friend and had told me that Alyssa had told her how she felt about me and me and Alyssa kissed and slept together. I wasn't very heartbroken at the fact that I had broken up with beck of my feelings for her had slowly faded away. But when I broke it off with her I didn't tell her about my feelings she always knew something was up between me and her but she tried to give me the benefit of the doubt. I'd eventually felt guilty enough because me and Alyssa had started dating that I told Beck in person that I had slept and I was with her. She was extremely upset and now she constantly harasses me and this girl I feel bad that I hurt her feelings what's going on but I feel happy and I found someone I actually truly love I'm 18 years old now and this is all happening right now I'm truly in love with this Alyssa and Beck claims that she wants nothing to do with me and that feelings for me are gone and that she hates me she's making things difficult with seeing my daughter but I can still see her. See me and Beck had a very toxic in my eyes relationship and I didn't think that I actually loved her and I knew I was in love with my best friend I've never felt like this are wanted to be a better person because when I was with back she seemed unmotivated very lazy and had some mental illnesses but refused to get help because she claims they would just make it worse she had depression and schizophrenia I hated being with her and it was very difficult she had slight schizophrenia and I wasn't exactly sure she was telling the truth when she told me she had schizophrenia she was a constant liar and she would always make me feel bad for wanting to go and do things even though we hadn't had a child yet on the other hand Alyssa's is the exact opposite she's always been sweet I know Alyssa will never lie to me and I and myself being more honest than I was with Beck. I broke off our relationship after a year and 5 months I feel happy in my relationship but it kind of haunts me at the fact that I did this all wrong did I do this all wrong am I a bad person I don't know what do you guys think. It's been about a couple weeks since this is all happened and I know it's very fast but I just kind of wanted to see what other people think of this there's a lot more to this story and I could go on about her family and her mistreatment of but I don't want to seem like it's poor me because I feel like what I did was shity but at the same time I don't understand if I'm feeling bad or it's just part of the breaking up.",04Mar2019,1

So, my girlfriend was “talking” to a guy 4 years ago, she was in a very difficult situation - basically very vulnerable - he used the opportunity and got her to undress and stuff. She never met him in person, we don’t even know if he’s who he says he is. We’re based in the UK.

Then he disappeared from the face of the earth (that being 3 years ago), looked like he deleted his account. My girlfriend started getting better (mental health-wise) and then he came back Feb 2018, disappeared again in Apr 2018 to return in Oct 2018. She got worse when he first came back, because he was one of the main reasons for her mental health problems. Since October he’s been consistently messaging her, sometimes disappearing for a fortnight or so. I can see he’s trying to manipulate her into trusting him. He’s making her worse every day he messages her, she started self-harming again because of that. Most of the time it looks like this: he unblocks her on Facebook, messages her and instantly blocks her again not letting her reply or block him. Sometimes he waits for her to reply, sometimes they have an actual conversation. She’s trying to get his details, who he is, where he lives etc, but obviously he’s not that stupid to just give himself away like that. Always at the end of a conversation he blocks her. 

She once blocked him instead but he only made another account to talk to her from. We don’t know what to do, we know he is using multiple accounts, who knows - maybe even talking to different girls, we’ve tried going to the police but no one’s taking us seriously, we can’t block him, can’t get rid of him. We know he has her pictures, we’re afraid he may use them in some malicious way. What can we do?",04Mar2019,2
717,"I (17M) have been friends for quite some time with a girl, who is the best friend of one of my good friends. We are both attractive but nothing really happened between us, we both looked at eachother like freaks (also I was quite beta and weird for quite some time) but recently we both changed

I always felt like we clicked, and I always felt like there was a connection between us, not romantic or sexual but what we felt, what we have been through but I thought this was one-sided and she was out of my league, and I knew she was interested in someone else (wasn't sure tbh, i was  a beta) 

We have a common group of friends but she is picky and she doesn't like a lot of persons (it's hard to explain why and I think it's not that important) and I was one of them. After a fight between two of my friends I had a moment of sincerity with her and I told her that I felt like I really trust her, and she said the same. Nothing happened after then, I kinda forgot about her, I just thought we were friends 

She is quite adventurous but shy (we both are I guess) and we want to experience new things, and I know she smoked weed and another shitty stuff out of curiosity and I thought: HEY, let's do some molly together at a party thrown by a common friend (i took molly twice whilst she never did) to kinda create a moment to talk between us (it sounded like a good idea then). Weird thing is she said yes without even asking questions about this, like she really trusted me (or she is dumb, such a stupid thing) and then something clicked in my head and I started looking forward to that moment

Ff to 2 days before the party, and I text her ""get some gum and some headphones"" and she says that she has a problem (period) and she is afraid to take it because it hurts and so on (i understand). But it pissed me off because I really looked forward to that, anyway. 

At the party I was sober and I was pissed at her and she saw that, and after 3-4 hours we ended up on the couch, talking about this and releasing some tension between us (molly effect hit me right before talking to her). We started talking about us and how I wasn't sure when she was talking seriously and so on (i am not used to that type of joking or person you can say) and what I really thing about her and how much I want to get closer to her. I told her we should go out alone (never did that) and talk about us. She agreed and said that she felt like we have that connection I was talking about.

I don't think she really had this with her other boyfriends, I think she was with them just because she was bored and wanted someone around her (I just feel like I am serious). The ""date"" is friday and I can see some progress in talking between both of us.


She will be my first if anything happens (I wasn't really interested in relationships) I denied some and I turned my head when some opportunities with others arised. I am not in love with her and I don't think she is with me, I have some extra things if you want me to come with an edit or some thoughts progress, but this post is long omfg.

I just want to try smth with her and in the end I think I will try, no matter what others say. If you have any advices or views, any advices will help! I want to get this BETA out of my system

718,"Hello redditors,

So I recently learned my school is threatening to cut all FCS classes due to budget cuts. They decided to go full culinary classes. As important as knowing how to make a salad and chop up vegetables is, culinary classes do not teach you how to do your taxes, balance checkbooks, sew clothing, and become a leader. My FCCLA (family career and community leaders of America) class (who have all made it to state this year) is fighting to keep FCS classes alive so we can continue to teach new generations how to do important life tasks. There is a board meeting this Thursday, March 7th, to discuss the cuts, and I would like to know some good topics to argue on, in order to keep these classes alive. Anybody who has advice on strong ideas or opinions on why this cut should be stopped, please leave a comment, it'll be very appreciated.

Thank you! Thank you!",04Mar2019,1
719,"

I have already post about this problem before but I got no to little advice and the situation only got worse since then.

I want to go ahead and say that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that everyone should feel free to express it in anyway that they feel is necessary. 

With that being said there are some boundaries and rules that my sister doesn’t seem to understand. Within one conversation you can already tell what part of the political  spectrum my sister is on. There are certain groups that my sister doesn’t like (men and trans people) and she does treat these people differently when speaking to them. She shows little to no respect to them. 

Sometimes my sister will show me pictures of trans people and ask me what gender they are. I answer that you shouldn’t assume someone’s gender and at least ask them because not everyone looks like their gender. She tells me that’s the dumbest thing she’s ever heard and starts insulting the person’s looks and calls them names.

She shows a bias against men because when a guy does something she freaks out and  called “evil”,“disgusting” ,“subhuman”. When a woman does the exact same thing she couldn’t give a damn. 

For example on Reddit a guy said his girlfriend would flirt with other guys in his presence and my sister was laughing at this guy and called him a loser. So I told her the same story but this time I switched the genders. She was mad and was saying that the guy was trash and he should never ever have a girlfriend and he doesn’t deserve to be with anyone.

When she rants she gets very passionate and even starts to belittle other peoples opinions and feelings. For example she’ll say “Oh you’re a lib fem (liberal feminist) wow you’re so stupid because all you do is follow men around and let them treat you like shit. I don’t feel bad for you when they abuse you.”

This is her behaviour on a daily basis. To clarify I need advice on how to tell her to stop treating people like shit simply because they don’t follow the same morals as her. She even talks shit about our parents sometimes and makes fun of them. I’m not saying that my parents are the greatest and the sweetest people in the world but they DESERVE some respect.

Also for age reference I’m (16f) and my sister is (20f).

Another thing is I can’t tell my parents for one otherwise I would be asking for advice. My dad is homophobic,sexist, racist,transphobic and just a bitter person in general.
My mom is very oblivious to my sister’s bitter attitude and obviously my sister’s rude comments towards her.

Don’t believe me trust me my sister’s Reddit account’s subusername is “All men must die” or something like that. She even visits certain subreddits that align with her ideologies.

TLDR: My sister is a bigot (hates men and trans people) and she becomes very bitter when expressing her opinion. How do I get her to stop or at least tone it down a notch or two.",04Mar2019,0
720,I’ve never fully appreciated how absolutely garbage the concept of life is until now. I just started to really think about the saying “life’s not fair” and I never really realized how unfair it actually is. I’m a 17m that got a good intelligence roll but I got the worst possible functionality roll so I just sit here and let my mind wander off into dark places cause I can’t focus on anything for more than 5 seconds. To top that off I don’t go anywhere because of my anxiety so I just jack off and eat for dopamine and sit and wait for the next video game to come out or a meteor to blow up the planet. I guess I just made this for someone to give me an excuse to keep giving in to my survival instincts because I’m a pussy and don’t want to end up a vegetable by accidentally breaking my neck trying to hang myself. Any advice that’s not “you matter” or “you just have to find your motivation” or “seek psychiatric help” or “you just have to stop feeling sorry for yourself and do it”? I guess my two options are kill myself or drug myself into a functional zombie. Life’s good.,04Mar2019,1
721,"I feel really uncomfortable and violated around this boy in most of my classes. I think he has some mental issues (which I mean absolutely no offence by, I just don’t know how else to put it) which cause him to have very drastic personalities. He can be extremely hyper one second and then really violent and basically dangerous the next.  He also has some learning difficulties. 

So, my mum and his mum have been friends for about 5 years, meaning I’ve had basically no choice but to associate myself with him. I was originally in different classes to him but he was being “bullied” by someone in his old ones. I say that in quotation marks because they’re BEST FRIENDS and I always see them walking down the corridors together. I honestly think he did it to be closer to me and I feel sick just thinking about that. 

This boy does weird, inappropriate things. He gets up repeatedly in class just to come over to me and tap me on the back with his pencil. He gets really close to me and I feel like I want to punch him, cry and scream at the same time. He’s never sexually harassed me but I’m waiting for it and I’m scared. The next paragraph is a story.

Me and my class had just got our PE kits on and came out of our respective changing rooms. I was standing between my two girl besties on one side and my two guy besties on the other side. (one of which I’m now dating :D) 
The boy comes out of the changing room last. He immediately squeezes between me and my bf and gets really, really uncomfortably close to me. I shout and tell him to move. One of my girl friends does the same. The teacher overhears and tells him to move to a different space - seeing me uncomfortable and distressed. He does. That is until the teacher walks back up the corridor and locks the changing rooms. This is when he gets EVEN closer to me. He is breathing down my neck and I literally scream. My bf (he wasn’t at the time) pushes him out the way. I was shaking and my two girl friends took me into the dance hall with them.

That is only one of the things he has done. 

This boy has done similar things to other girls too, including the one who shouted at him in that previous encounter. He has touched her hip inappropriately and purposefully and told her to break her neck. The girl told the teacher who was teaching the class at that time. The teacher said they’d sort the issue but nothing ever happened. I feel like he gets let off on everything really easily because of his disability, but he can’t just do these things and get away with it. I’ve told all of my close friends and they all told me the same thing:
“Have you told your mum? Or a teacher?”

The answer is no. I feel like I can’t. My mum and the boy’s mum have a really strong friendship that I would hate to break. If I told my mum then she’d be forced to stop talking to one of her best friends and I’d hate to be responsible for that. Also, if I told a teacher, they’d contact my mum and she’d be angry that I hadn’t told her first. It’s a lose-lose. 

I really need help. I only drag myself out of bed in the mornings because I’ll get to see my bf and besties in school. I dread seeing him and his weird, twisted smile everyday. Please can anyone tell me how I could deal with this?

724,"My younger brother is 16 and I'm 20.

Last night my brother was being very loud and then around 1:30am my girlfriend found him on the floor in the hallway. I went and talked to him and as it turns out he was drunk. 

He went into the bathroom and started throwing up. I brought him some water and started confronting him. I asked him why he was drinking and he said ""because why not?"" Okay he obviously doesn't want to tell me what's on his mind. I then proceeded to ask him easier questions like where did he get the alcohol? How often do you drink? He told me that he drank Friday, Saturday, and then that day (Sunday) on Friday he stole my sister's booze from her closet then Saturday night he stole some booze from my closet and then Sunday he just straight up stole from my parents liquor cabinet.

So after easier questions I began to dig at him again, ""what's going on? Why are you drinking alone? Why so frequently?"" He starts telling me he can't tell me because I'll hate him forever. I'm a very very accepting and forgiving person and continue to reassure him, and them start talking about how him and I are gonna get closer and I'm gonna start taking him to the gym to exercise more (he doesn't get much exercise at all). He then proceeded to tell me that doing masculine things is the opposite of what he wants. 

At that point I realized what it was and give him an awkward hug while he's hunched over the toilet. I asked him if he wasn't comfortable being a boy, and he completely broke down and told me yes and he's been so depressed about it and broken that he's turned to drinking and smoking. He skips school often or leaves school early and he used to spend a lot of time with friends but seems to do so less now. I asked him who else knew about it and he said only his one friend. He tells me he has no idea what to do because he thinks if he comes out about it everyone will hate him, our entire family will hate him, all his friends. 

My family is very liberal. And I know that his friends are very liberal as well. And I told him that and he then tells me ""no people will hate me"" and I know he's not wrong but I have to comfort him in the moment. I tell him that I won't be telling our parents about the drinking because I know that they won't do much other than bother him for it. And I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone about him no longer wanting to be male. He currently goes to therapy and he said that therapy has been helping and he's going to continue going. 

Flash forward to today, he skips school again and I had to leave for class and won't be home to check on him until very late. I don't know what to do. I want to tell my parents that he's been drinking but my brother and I are not close and haven't been close since we we're really young. I know telling my parents will betray his trust right after he confided something very serious in me. I'm really worried about him and just want him to be happy, and safe. If anyone has any advice for me, I'd be more than happy to take it.",04Mar2019,2
725,"So I was in a parking lot and when I went to find a spot I accidentally brushed my car against a parked car. I was at fault admittedly but it was a minor accident and both cars only had a few scratches. The guy came out a few minutes later as he worked at one of the stores in the shopping center and he thanked me for waiting. So I explained the damage to him and I apologized. He shrugged it off and said it was fine saying things happen and he wiped off the marks. I asked him if he wanted to make a report and I offered to give him my information. He told me there was no need and he walked away without making a report or exchanging information. Should I make a report to insurance or am I ok? I am located in New Jersey.

726,"My fiancé and I were going to get married last August. We planned to have a private ceremony followed by a dinner with our immediate family members. Unfortunately, my father was killed in a farming accident 9 days prior and we canceled. 

The woman we scheduled the dinner with was notified the day of and why we needed to cancel. She responded quickly with warm words, and told us to contact her when things settled down. We started calling and emailing the restaurant in September. Months went by with no response. We went to the restaurant one evening in November and the owner was there. He was defensive towards us when we told him the situation. He acted like he didn’t know what we were talking about and told us the woman we scheduled with did not work with the restaurant anymore. He then began to imply she left him with a financial mess. 

The owner instructed us to email him all of the emails we exchanged with the woman. He then said he would review them and get back to us. It is now March 4, and he still will not return our phone calls or emails. 

Unfortunately, there was not a contract completed. The woman told us that because it was such a small group and the food/alcohol was coming from the restaurants menu it wasn’t necessary. Does this confirm that we are just out the money we paid?

Is it worth it to take the owner to small claims court? I doubt he would show up..

Do I just write a bad review and write to the better business bureau and then call it a day?

728,"I have worked for the company (a small mom and pop clothing boutique with 4 locations all owned by the same owners, so its a retail-ish setting) for going on 5 years. I started this job my freshman year of college as a basic sales associate and have since worked my way up to buyer's assistant. 

&amp;#x200B;

The position for store assistant manager came available in the location I'm based at and since I was the most senior employee and was already doing 90% of the assistant manager job description, I assumed I would be given the position, (I could have done both positions as the buyer's assistant position duties were always completed before regular business hours anyway.) However, they decided to hire from outside stating that since I was still in school they did not want me to become overwhelmed. I understood but that and even appreciated them looking out for me, that is until I was required to train the person they hired for the position. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was required to train my ""superior"" (I put this in quotes because she is so not superior in any part of this job). I had to train a person that makes $5 more an hour than I do. The store manager and owner had me train the person they picked over me. I really don't know why I stayed at the job at this point, but I did and now it is a year and a half later, the Assistant Manager and I have frequently come to blows because at the end of the day I know the needs of the store better and can overall do her job better than she can, I believe she knows this and it gets under her skin. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss recently presented her with a project in which she told them she wanted nothing to do with, I feel very passionately about this project. Would it be fair for me to present my boss with these ideas or should I keep my mouth shut and respect the assistant manager's ""authority""? Or should I just quit? (lol)",04Mar2019,0

For example my friend he has Asma so sometimes mucus builds up in the back of his throat and if we are outside he will spit, not the most pleasant thing and I don't really like it myself but I do understand and don't dramatically over react by turning around, looks like there are going to cry, gags and even tells people to shut up when people speak after that, even if it's about a completely unrelated topic ,and if it were one or two things annoying ok, but we won't go one day without them tell us to stop something because it's triggering and i am really fed up. 

If a say something any they don't think it's true because they have been told they are smart their entire life (they are but big headed about it, like they are all knowing) they will fight me on it and even said to me ""I won't let you go around and spread ur propaganda"", it was about, I think to go mugs are still called to go mugs even if they don't have handles and (unrelated to that argument) if a state afact that doesn't aline with their argument they will just say ""well that's your opinion"" and act supper defense and annoyed they will have the nerve to tell you to stop being so heated and the are libertarian extremests so the can react very childish like if you looked up one on a YouTube video

I work for a University and they also pay for my tuition as a graduate student for business since I work there. I am currently taking a finance class and an elective class, so I only have two more classes after this and I will graduate. I’ve always been an A and B student but this elective class I’m really struggling with.

There are four different law professors in this negotiations class that take turns teaching and grading each week. The grading is very inconsistent, they say one thing and then another, they immediately hand out case studies for outlines which we have never done before, they have us do assignments before even learning the material. They are all very harsh graders, particularly one. I usually get A’s and B’s but have been averaging C’s on my paper but one harsh grader just gave me an F.

This is not just me but several other students, the whole class pretty much, are very concerned about their grades and feel the same way as I do. We’re not idiots, many of us have maintained a 3.0–3.8 GPA and have scored D’s and F’s on our last paper. The grading is very unreasonable and has all of us extremely upset. An elective course where you write a paper on negotiations should not be this challenging, it’s not like we’re going to be lawyers!

I work with the Provost Office, I am seriously considering reporting this class to the department. I’ve never received an F and I don’t think I deserved it.

I agreed and so I've been talking to her, but honestly to me she seems like a completely different person and her attitude is so different; she has that ""I don't care"" vibe if you know what I mean. And for someone who wanted to try and be friends, she puts almost zero effort into the conversations being blunt and such.

**I've talked to a few of my friends and they've all agreed I should let her go, but I'm finding it really difficult to do this. How should I go about doing it?**

744,"My baby’s father and I only hung out a few times before I got pregnant. He wasn’t involved throughout my pregnancy except for a “how are you?” text every few months. He showed up for our baby’s birth, and I let him be there for the delivery. He came by to see her one time after we got home, and I haven’t heard from him since. I told him when she was born, that he could either be involved in her life or pay child support. 

So after not hearing from him for months, I went to child support. 

My family is worried because he will have rights, and they think he or his family will want to take the baby. But I’m a young single mother, and I really need the help.

I know this and I've worked with him over the course of literal years to correct this by pointing out social cues he should know and recognize in every day life. He learns from me in this way and it usually only takes a few iterations of similar situations before he gets it. So far this system has worked for us but there's one he just doesn't seem to pick up and it has happened going on twenty or more times now just in the last year since we've started living together. I'll be telling him something, usually something inane and inconsequential but at times it's been more important things whether just generally or to me and he'll just say ""yeah"" really dismissively as if I didn't just talk to him and immediately change the subject to something he wants to talk about. I mean it's literally immediate. There is NO pause between. I've pointed this out to him numerous times. I let it slide the first few times he did it but I started to get irritated with it and started pointing it out to him. After the first few times I did this he's always made the excuse that he doesn't realize he's doing it but how many fucking times must I point out problematic behavior before he recognizes it? It's not even that I'm really hurt by this as I'm accustomed to people being dismissive of me but it's irritating EVERY time he does it because it makes me feel like he thinks everything I say is inconsequential to him no matter what it is. At one time he said it was because he is used to being ignored and talked over. His parents and only sibling, their first son are shitty to him in general so I understand that. That being said, I and our former roommate (a mutual friend of ours) have always let him say his piece and I had to point this out to him. Habits die hard, especially ones from a subtly abusive household and I get that but we've been living together for over a year now and he still apparently doesn't even realize he's doing it. Is there anything I can do to make this any more clear to him? I don't expect it to stop right away but is it too much to ask that he recognizes it as he does it at the LEAST?",04Mar2019,1

In my shoes, would you alter your name to avoid potential associations with this other person?

*Some additional background:*

With even the slightest bit of research anyone who has met me would know that these stories are about someone else. The photos alone are a giveaway, we look very different. The problem is that a preliminary search leads to a list of links whose titles are themselves such a shocking assortment of allegations, that anyone who has not met me would be quite justified in passing immediate judgement. It would actually take some work to now uncover my own website and social media links behind dozens of posts and articles about this other person. There's even a website now titled after this person (who I unfortunately share a name with) in which people are posting horror stories about interactions with them. 

As a freelancer I  also presume that potential clients are doing a quick google search before hiring me. My work also leads me to interact with hundreds of new people a year who would also be justified in searching my name to learn about who they might be doing business with, as I frequently do myself.

Besides being a moral quandary (why should I change my name because of that \*\*\*\*\*\*) it also might not even be a good strategic move as it will certainly lead to questions from many who already know me.

Any thoughts you might have would be greatly appreciated as I weigh the pros and cons of committing to a new name!

A few years ago, I met this amazing girl, she was all I had  ever wanted but didn't realize it at the time. I still had a crush on someone else. Then our families went camping amd it was the most amazong week I had had in a long time. For most of the weekend we talked, and got to know each other. It was amazing, we had a great time.

Flash forward to early late 2017 and early 2018. We were basically bf and gf but it wasn't exactly official. She was dating another guy, I was basically a side hoe but we had feelings for each other that were amazing. Then a few months later she denied everything when I had told someone. We didn't talk much since, but we would see each other every now and then and we both for a short time talk and have feelings for each other. It didn't matter if we were dating or not.

Flash forward again to this past weekend, our families went on a trip and we were both there. We didn't talk that much but every once in a while we would talk. I suddenly had the feelings I had from 2015-16 and I doubt she did. Now I am stuck on what to do.

She is dating someone and I'm not. These feelings I have never felt before I met her.

What do I do? How do I get over her? Please help.

755,"My boyfriend has a very toxic friend who he keeps allowing into his life. His way of dealing with toxic people is to just... leave them be and be nice to them. My way is to play their games until they finally figure out they can’t mess with me and give up. 

Now, I’m not proud nor do I enjoy the way I handle toxic people. I just find that my way works because it gets rid of them. 

His way is hurting him more and more each day, and I don’t know how to explain to him that taking a different approach would really help his mental state.

He hates my way. He thinks stopping to their level is an awful way to deal with the situation. And generally, he would be 100% right! I do not disagree with his way at all! Just there are those very few people that will NEVER leave you be until you make them leave you be...

756,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want this being linked to my main account, for all intents and purposes. Hopefully this doesn't get deleted right away.

Some context: For the past few years or so I've been dealing with some ups and downs in life. Lots of friends who lost people due to depression and eventually suicide. It's a tough thing to watch and I've nearly lost some close people to suicide as well. I've been dealing with moderate amounts of stress because of this, let alone also from school work and minor issues that have come up (disagreements between family, people getting sick, etc). I've struggled myself with depression and thankfully most of the time I manage to stay relatively happy. My typical mood is carefree and nonchalant, it helps me keep the pressure down and enjoy life a little.

However, recently I went to the clinic for a checkup on something. Keep in mind I haven't had a family doctor in years, not since I moved with my father to another state. The results were harmless and I walked away feeling a bit better, but before we left the clinic I asked the doctor that was checking up on me what it would take to get a prescription for anti depressants. He said we needed a family doctor and that was that, so we left. Now I knew that we had to get a family doctor, not only because my father wanted to get a physical for me but also because I wanted a prescription. My friends keep on telling me that I should get anti depressants because I clearly need them when I'm stressed out and I have no other solutions when my emotions are out of control. 

Now, my father is very skeptical that I need therapy or any sort of help with dealing with emotional issues like these. I've asked for therapy before and he's seemed very reluctant. He kept promising that we would go and get therapy for me but we never did, however I let it slide because I hadn't had any major issues for a while. I'm not exactly certain why he has a differing view than I do. He says that ""life sucks"" and other common phrases that parents usually say when we complain about something, and how when he was dealing with issues he would just man up. 

But my situation is very different and no matter how hard I try to get him to understand that, he just wont. I just can't do it on my own. I'd rather have a backup solution than no solution at all, you know?

Last night was the last straw for me though. Around 4 or 5 in the morning, I woke up in the middle of the night, unable to sleep. I'm not exactly sure why, but I tried going back to sleep. It was kinda funny though, because it seems that I woke up just at the right time to hear my father on the phone, talking about me. I could hear him, the walls here are thin like paper. I immediately listened in, and I could hear him repeating what I had said when we were at the clinic about the prescription. It was definitely in a mocking tone. That made my blood boil so badly that it was difficult for me to fall back asleep, but I did. 

I had school today so I didn't get the chance to talk to him about it in person, as he works odd hours (3 to 11), so I really don't get to see him until the weekend. But after talking to a friend about it, I realized that I need to speak to my father about this and change his mind once and for all. I just feel nervous about doing it, and I'm not sure what I could say to convince him.

Some of you might be skeptical yourselves that I need help, that I should just learn to tough it out, but I've been dealing with this for a good couple of years now and I can't stand it anymore. It's not just teenager angst or being moody, this is actually a problem, he just doesn't seem to understand that.

TL;DR: Been dealing with depression and other emotional issues for a few years now, last night heard my father mocking me on the phone about me asking about a prescription for anti depressants. I want to confront him about it but I'm not sure what to say to him so he actually believes me. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. ",04Mar2019,1
757,"Hi everyone. First off, I will preface this and say that I appreciate you guys cant tell me what to do or make the decision for me. I'd like to hear what you would do in my shoes. And I'm sorry for the sheer length of this!

First off, some context and background...

Ever since I was a child, I've been really fascinated with history and how our world developed into the way it is today. Throughout school, I was dead set on becoming a history teacher. I left secondary school and began A Levels (16y.o. for those not in the UK) and I had a really awful experience with a teacher, who basically told me i should give up on my dreams because it wont happen. So I did. I drifted a little bit until I hit 19, when I landed an amazing job in a large museum in London. Through this job, I rediscovered my passion for history and decided to go to university to get my degree. I had to restudy to gain the entry quals and so I worked and studied full time, which by itself wasnt a problem but I also had one of the most emotionally tumultuous years of my life the year I went to uni. I buried it all, but it resurfaced towards the end of my first year into my 2nd and I ended up leaving at the end of my 2nd year (22y.o by this point) having just started my dissertation and after an attempt on my own life.

I didn't really think about it in the first few years after I left. I pretty much started working straightaway in a completely different field (animals), before starting with my current employer. I've worked my way up from entry level to managing my own team and part of the charity, and have been very lucky to have understanding employers and basically been in the right place at the right time. I like my job, and I really appreciate the opportunities afforded to me. But I always feel like each step I've taken has been the logical step, not necessarily the right one for me and I also cant see me doing this job forever or being able to do this job and have a family for example. 

I'm approaching 30, and have been questioning alot of my life and the decisions which have lead me to where I am. I basically have done nothing but work for the last 5 years, but I feel really unfulfilled. I think I buried alot of my frustrations and feelings *in* my work, and didn't really address them. 


Now, I feel like I have unfinished business. I feel like there are just one or two things I want to achieve in life, but being a graduate is one of them. Ideally to masters level. I always wanted to work in Holocaust and Genocide education. I tried a degree in my current field, but I really wasnt invested and i feel like i wasted my time (the institution was terrible). I have been doing some research and there is a university in London, offering a part time, evening degree in contemporary history &amp; politics (travellable to where I currently live). 

I'm worried that I'm just running away from other problems that have surfaced at work. I'm also really afraid that it will end the same way it did last time and I'm afraid of that failure again and letting myself down. On the other hand, I'm such a different person to the one I was 9 years ago and I feel like this frustration has always been there bubbling away because over the last few years (since I became more open to my emotions) and I always have an overwhelming since of regret and failure. I've been getting more and more involved in politics since 2015, and I feel excited by debate and the research I do behind my arguments and I haven't felt like that in a long time.

I have several options:

1) do evening study a levels, then apply for 2020 entry on the degree. That's assuming I can finish the levels in a year (the website indicates this is possible). I would do this to make sure that this is definitely something that I want to pursue.

2) apply for 2019 entry on the degree (I already have the quals)- I'm pretty sure that I will be able to do the evening classes and still keep my job (for now)

3)do nothing and continue with the job that I have, and the pension and other benefits.

759,"	Hopefully this is the correct place to post...

	My boyfriend and I live in North Texas and we make about 31,000/year combined. I have a higher wage than my boyfriend, but I’m a part time employee who averages less than 20/week. And he makes a decent wage and works 40+/week. We both work in food service. In 2017, my boyfriend and his old high school classmate rented an apartment together in low-income housing because his classmate was getting kicked out of his sister’s house, and my boyfriend was at the time sleeping on his dad’s couch for $400/month. Long story short, his roommate went to jail on multiple felony charges and had to get off the lease 6 months in. My boyfriend found a new roommate on the lease and got a second job. His second roommate left and moved back in with his parent for personal differences.

	My boyfriend managed to pay rent by himself with the two jobs but later got fired from his part-time job because of an argument with his manager. Anyway, my boyfriend renewed his lease last summer, shortly before his lost his second job. His full time only offers direct deposit either to a personal bank account or to a job issued card. One month, the week rent was due, his direct deposit got mixed up because he got an actual bank account, so the payroll company mailed out a check. The check arrived the week of rent, but since they did not know apartment number, the post office delivered it to the front office, The front office knew my boyfriend, his full name, what car he drove, and his apartment number since it was directly in front of the front office, plus they were also sending my boyfriend notices about his car not being moved after x days or using the water hose like everyone else. So when the check arrived, instead of the office notifying him about the mail, they returned it to sender. My boyfriend found out a couple days later after calling the payroll company and asking the office if it had arrived. So the payroll company had to cancel that check and reissue a new one, which took another 2 weeks.

	Because the paycheck got sent back literally 2 days before rent was due, my boyfriend couldn’t afford to pay the full amount of rent. At the time he didn’t have a savings because he was paying so many bills every month, both for the apartment and other things that he has now paid off. So he got evicted and he lives with me in my mother’s house and pays my mother rent. He is currently paying his old apartment complex monthly for breaking the lease and the damages from his and his prior roommates. He’s been paying them since September 2018.

	Now, the issue. My bf and I are trying to move out of my mom’s this summer-both because we are unhappy here and she wants us out and possibly is moving 4 hours away. A lot of the apartments and housing we can afford is low-income/income restricted housing. 4/5 of the apartment complexes right near our jobs are income-restricted. My boyfriend went to speak with them today, even the non income restricted housing-which we can’t afford. Because his evicted is less than 60 months old, even with a roommate that has better credit and no prior evictions on the lease, they cannot rent him an apartment. Most of the advice I see online usually says that having a cosigner helps, but not in this case it seems. I cannot afford to be the sole person on the lease. We cannot afford to rent any of the houses in the area and definitely cannot buy a house which is also being built all over the area. It seems like the only option is to find a roommate online that makes enough of a wage to help us make 2.5x the rent/month but not more that 34,000 annually. However, all occupants over 18 has to be on the lease which would include my bf, so with what the apartments are telling us, would deliver the same problem.

	With renting a room or subletting, with most places in the area, subletting is frowned upon and not practiced. There aren’t any rooms for rent in a safe area or close to work that allow couples.

In case anyone needs a reference to the income restrictions:
1 person on the lease cannot make more than 30,000/year
2 people on the lease cannot make more than 34,000/year
3 people on the lease cannot make more than 38,000/year

They are more but i don’t think it applies here.

760,"So at the end of November 2018 I (24,F) started dating this guy (33,M). We met on Bumble and in his bio he specifically said he was looking for a relationship. I let him know that I'm pregnant (due may 19th 2019) and I'm not looking for a fling. He told me he wasn't really into being a father, which is totally understandable, and its not like i was asking him to be a father to my child anyway. So i told him i was fine with just being friends. Well after that i stopped texting him completely and about a week or two later he hit me up offering to take me on another date so i was under the impression that he had changed his mind. He ended up kissing me at the end of that date. Fast forward a few more weeks and i ended up staying at his house a few nights, we had many deep conversations, really clicked and i started to really like him. So come around valentines day i give him a card that says ""dont think im too rash to feel like im ready to want to boldly ask if youd like to go steady?""

She's a comic artist. All the heroic male characters in her comics are either gay, gay thugs, whiny emos with ditzy girlfriends, sickly uber-thin guys, or rarely, buff dudes who are secretly super into squeeing at girly pink crap. All her evil male chars are manwhores. Is this a red flag?
u/SonicNarutoke420
Seriously, every single one of her heroic or neutral male characters are either:

Gay girly men who say fabulous and darling often

Generic background character guys who have no character traits

Squads of violent brutish punk thugs who are unexpectedly gay for each other, one squad per work

Whiny emos with boyband hair and a ditzy cheery girl attached to them, in the case of one character seen in two different settings

There's one sickly uber-thin guy who needs a cane to walk

and there's one big buff guy who's secretly ""a total girl"" in two of her four ongoing serieses. And we're not talking ""Kanji likes sewing but he'll kick your ass once he accepts himself and realizes there's nothing gay about it"", or ""lol that buff dude is crying over a romantic movie his gf took him to see"", we're talking ""This big buff angry jock dude has a bedroom full of pink girly shit and secretly being a total girl when he's not a jock is his character"". Twice.

Meanwhile, her evil male characters? Dominant often-half-devil manwhores who get all the p*ssy and are into all kinds of sexual degeneracy. Main villain of her fantasy Lotr knockoff is an elf demon dude in high heels who wants to molest the main heroine before stealing the magic blood that makes her special, main villain of her superhero series is a gang of three boyband guys who use their mind control music to rape girls, main villain of her other superhero story is a villain dude who dresses up as a little girl and wears women's underwear constantly and forces kidnapped girls to have tea parties with him before he kills them, antihero of another story is a demon the heroine's mom used to shag, and so on.

Is this a red flag? Because it feels like a massive red flag.

But, that was a lie.

And I told him on Saturday night. He was so pissed at he didn't speak to me until sunday morning. We sorted things out and he said this was my last chance.

Tonight, we had another argument.

It started because in my last relationship, I liked someone else. And it was the smallest crush and I wasn't acting upon it. And my current boyfriend didn't really mind, he just kept joking about it and saying that I was unloyal.

But tonight, he stopped joking about it. The argument started because I said that if I made a mistake saying yes in that circumstance. I wish I'd said yes because I actually liked him.

But, he took that the wrong way; even thought I clearly stated that i didn't regret saying yes in general.

And then he brought up when I fancied my friend. And he got pissed about it. He kept saying he was fucking done and I'm always so unhappy and he didn't know what to do. We keep arguing and it's so awkward whenever we're around eachother. I told him clearly.

If he's sick of me, he knows what to do. But if he chooses the other option I'll promise to be happier and change.

And... he forgave me.

***Intro***

So  my sister, her boyfriend, and I got into an argument over dinner about  what years the millennials lie. I told them they were incorrect then my  sister and her boyfriend teasingly bring up Wikipedia and pew research  to support their claim. They proceed to tease me that I wasn’t a  millennial and the fact that they were millennials gave them some sort  of superiority over my supposed generation. I was sure they were wrong, I  remembered from my business textbook done and vetted by experts that  those dates were incorrect. Nevertheless, I couldn’t say anything  because I couldn’t bring up the textbook at dinner. When I got back to  my apartment, I brought up my business textbook and sure enough, my  dates were correct.  I posted the screenshot to the group chat.  Admittedly I was a bit annoyed that they teased me during dinner so I  drove the victory deep.

***Players***

SS - Sister

AL - Her Boyfriend

JS - Me

***Arguments***

SS - Look it up on any other website

JS  - I’m sorry wiki and pew research isn’t a verified source. If you’re  telling me those are more reliable than textbooks by professors and  researchers alike then idk what to say lol.

SS - Lol what about forbes magazine? What about nytimes?

JS  -It’s a magazine, Sis. You literally have a textbook approved by  research and you’re like “B-but Forbes...wiki” - yeah I know but  research is research. News gets unreliable sources all the time. Above  all else, scholarly sources are always 1st for research. As an  accomplished student, you should know this.

SS - It’s not worth arguing.

JS  - I would be fine with being classified as not millennial actually.  They’re used in a negative light most of the time. But oh well! What can  I say: the masses are easily swayed by unreliable sources.

AL - What about the chamber of commerce?

JS - Don’t know what that is. Gotta study for Micro though so you can explain it here and I’ll read it later.

At  this point AL links bls.gov to strengthen his point. I send it back,  circling that it uses Pew Research which is not as reliable of a source  as my business textbook.

AL - It quotes PEW research it’s good enough for me

JS - It USES Pew Research for the research, an unreliable source. Sorry but I’m going to study now.

AL - But if the main fact checking agency of the US government uses it, I think it’s universally more applicable

After I finish my studies:

JS  - Okay let’s think about this just intuitively. Who do you think has  more time to study this information? The Chamber which probably has way  better things to do than figure out where generations lie or Professors  and researchers who’s job was to publish scholarly papers on the  subject? Just thinking about it like this will bring you to the answer.  If I was working for the chamber, I could easily see myself lazily  pulling up the fastest data. That doesn’t mean it’s correct nor  verified. Also thinking and knowing are two different things. You can  think all you want but I know for a fact that I would take scholarly  research over pew any day. Linking another source that uses the same  unreliable information is still unreliable. This is why we don’t use  Wikipedia or news magazines in research papers. We generally go to  scholarly databases which are peer reviewed.

AL  - I agree with you scholarly papers are likely more accurate. And in  the perfect world, the most accurate info should be the gold standard.  In the real world, sometimes authorities don’t always do the proper  research. In this case, the classification of millennials is highly  subjective and debatable, not well-defined and quite frankly, doesn’t  actually matter so long as people are using it with a common  understanding of the timeframe. Its less important if it’s tomatoes or  tomatoes, just stick to one. From a practical sense, I’m inclined to  quote what’s more universally adopted. In this case, that’s what the  bureau of labor statistics uses. They track everything and anything to  do with labor for the population. And it’s one of the most relied on  source of data for business decision makers. Do you understand my view?

JS  - Yes I understand your view, however, I would contend that the  information is not debatable. The experts did the research and found the  specifics. I would imagine other sources, the “universally” adopted,  took their information from sources like Wikipedia instead of actually  studying when. Plus what is accepted should always be left to the  experts. Inaccurate information can be spread far and wide but that  doesn’t mean it’s therefore correct no matter how subjective the  information is. This is analogous to ancient history where people  generally thought the world was flat. When we actually put together the  research and came to a conclusion, the correct information was clear as  day. Masses motioning towards incorrect information does not make them  correct.

AL- I’m about to prove to you  why you think you’re Copernicus but Newton was more correct. And I’m  sure glad we didn’t stop at Copernicus. This is the author to the  textbook you referenced for your “expert” data.

He  cites Bill Nickels the author of the textbook, Understanding Business, I  used to prove which years the millennials lie. Personally, I see  nothing wrong with Nickels creditability.

AL  - Let me show you another source that I argue is more reliable, better  researched, holds more weight than the one you point to.

AL links Gen Z @ Work: How the Next Generation Is Transforming the Workplace

AL  - There’s an entire book on this generation alone. All 320 pages  dedicate to one topic and one topic only. Let’s look at the author.

AL then posts David Stillman’s credentials like he did with Bill Nickels, hoping to compare the two.

AL  - 40 under 40 and considered one of 200 to watch by the business  journal. Who’s information would I trust more? An author who touches on  the broad topic of business and an author who dedicate an entire book on  the singular topic. I think you know the answer. In case you didn’t see  it Gen Z is defined as 1995 to 2012. What can I say: too many people  just simply trust those who seem credible without doing full due  diligence.

JS - To be candid, final  remark because this argument is very long. Your notion that Stillman is  an expert is laughable at best. Writing an interest book is nothing  short of passion work compared to peer reviewed textbook. Also, the  accomplishments you credit him to are even more egregious. As we’ve  already established, news magazines are not credible sources which  eliminates every title you credit his “reliability” to. Nickels and  Hughs are professors in the field who study and master the topic. Your  assessment that their PHD is not as credible as Stillman, if not more,  is disappointing to be honest. In case you didn’t reference the peer  reviewed textbook again, Millennials are categorized as 1977-2000.  Trying to desperately bring out contrary is quite primitive. Bishop to  bishop 8, discovered check, and incidentally mate.

AL - All I’m saying is no one seems to care about your credible sources. Maybe the reason is they’re not so credible.

JS  - Sorry but like I said: the masses are easily swayed by unreliable  research. Expert opinion is always gold standard and we’ve agreed on  this.

AL - There are hundreds of experts...

JS - Hundreds but not everyone is

AL  - How do you weigh the different opinions of every expert? Fair. All  I’m saying is you showed us what one expert thinks. But there’s the  potential for lots of other experts with a different opinion - that’s  how the real world works

I agree with this though AL has still not posted a credible source to me.

JS - We separate the experts from the delusional and Stillman is not an expert.

AL - Not everything is 1+1=2.

JS - True. But if I told you 1+1 = 3 I am wrong nevertheless.

AL  - Look we can debate who’s the better expert. If you want me to, I’m  happy to review every textbook taught at Harvard and Yale and reference  the dates they use for gen z definition. You want me to? Would you turn  agree that those credible sources are equally if not more credible than  your one gold standard? I don’t mind using my time to prove a point to  you. But I’m afraid even if I prove you wrong you’re head is so much in  the sand that what’s my point in wasting time.

JS  - I’m open to change. I haven’t demonstrated incapacity yet. However,  you and I have better things to do and I’ve lost interest.

SS - I win.

I  obviously get annoyed at this because I think I backed my arguments  well. I feel like if anyone was looking at the debate, my arguments  weren't flawed compared to AL's.

JS - If you’ve won the definition of served, then yes. Yes you surely did. Lol.

SS - I think AL has proven you were wrong.

JS  - If after this debate you think my points were incorrect then it is  merely feeble argumentative idiocracy lol. We’ve agreed that expert is  gold standard and the standard still stands.

AL  - That’s not the crux of the argument. Your old gold standard for the  definition is gen z is not the one and only gold standard.

JS - Your presented gold standard was ripped apart with little intelligence. You can surely see it.

AL  - Do you agree? If you don’t I’ll go to the library this weekend and I  swear if I don’t find 2 textbooks with that date, I’ll give you 100  dollars. If you lose, you have to go China to work for the summer.

JS  - If you have so much time then you have bigger problems to discuss  haha but yes you can be my guest, however, do try to vet the sources. I  don’t want to see another “expert” like Stillman trying to be put above  Professors.

I’m honestly tired of this  argument. I think I proved my point but the fact that they can’t stand  to let it slide and keep trying to bring up contrary evidence is bugging  me.  As people who don’t like to lose, I think a unbiased opinion would  be nice. ",04Mar2019,1

This is a long one, with a lot of backstory, so I’ll try not to ramble.
*no real names
***key story

TL;DR: Went to an event with an old friend/co-worker. He tried convincing me I was wasted. Thought I was going to sleep with him. 

Question: Am I overreacting or am I justified in cutting ties, and how should I approach the situation going forward?

Ben and I have been friends since freshman year (2011), not super close but we ran in the same circle. After graduation (2014) I started working and cutting off toxic people from high school, isolating myself. He applied for the military and stayed very active with our friends; going swimming, laser tag, birthdays/holidays, camping trips, etc. I went along to some gatherings but more often than not I opted out. Ben always sure Fiancé and I were invited. 

Ben got rejected from the military and turned really hard into his religion. His specific church is very strict; no caffeine, no alcohol, no premarital sex; you get the idea. I’m well established as a non-religious person, but I’ll respect all beliefs as long as mine (or lack-there-of) are being respected in turn. 

Probably important to mention, I started dating my Fiancé in 2013 and brought him along every time I hung out. We got engaged Christmas Eve 2017, plastered it everywhere, talked about it constantly and was just plain over the moon excited. Ben was one of the first to congratulate us. 

So last year, Ben was looking for a job and my company had an opening for another location. I have a good relationship with the owners and managers, so when I dropped off his resume the interview was just a formality. 

So now Ben and I were spending 40 hours a week together. We don’t have anything in common so we just talked about high school days all the time. When that got boring he started talking about his terrible dating life. I would try and offer advice, encourage him to go out with girls; just being a supportive co-worker/friend; but Ben is overly-focused on marriage, instead of actually liking the person. 

When coworkers started asking me if anything was going on between Ben and I, I did my best to clear doubts. I never thought much of it because Ben and I were friends. Nothing more.

Recently I moved across our city and transferred to a closer location, very far from my original/Ben’s current office. 

***Now for the main event: 
One of our business partners was hosting an optional launch party at an upscale hotel. Ben and I agreed to represent our company. We knew there’d be alcohol so Ben offered to drive in case I wanted to drink, all was good. Now I have a very high tolerance for my size and was a bartender for 3 years, I know my limits. 

We get there and Ben immediately wants to grab me a drink, I say I’d rather hang my coat up and socialize first. He keeps talking about how he’s never seen me drunk and how I should be drinking; I tell him point blank, I’m not going to get drunk. Throughout the whole 3 hour event I had 3 drinks total, all double shots bought by my manager who happened to show up. I was buzzed, but otherwise perfectly fine. Well Ben starts telling everyone I’m wasted, I’m plastered, and I’m like “no? I’m one drink of water away from sober. I’m fine”. Ben wouldn’t stop commenting on how drunk I was to the point where I was getting really uncomfortable, I told him so. He apologized but didn’t relent.

So normal situation I would have just called Fiancé and gotten him to pick me up, but he was across the country for work and wouldn’t be home until very late. My manager had gone home, buses weren’t running, and with the reputation taxis have in my area I wouldn’t get in one solo. I had to ride home with Ben. 

So as we’re walking to his car he’s telling me how drunk I am, we’re about to cross the street so I’m looking for oncoming cars, conversation is as follows:

Me - Ben, I’m not drunk. I’m buzzed, which means I’m just a little more social than I’d normally be. So when it comes to being social and having a good time, I’m not anxious and can actually have a good time. 

Ben - Why are you looking at me like that?

Me - WTF, What are you talking about?

Ben - Why are you eyeing me up like that while talking about a good time? Do you think we’re going home together?

Me - Dude. No. I’m checking for traffic. What the f***?

Ben - I’m just saying you’re eyeing me up while talking about having a good time. You’re really drunk so I’m not coming home with you unless you ask. 

Me - No. Never. Ever. I’m fucking buzzed, not blackout. I’m fully conscious and know what’s going on. 

So now I’m freaked out because I have no other way home, knowing fully damn well that I’m going to be home alone for the next 2 hours until Fiancé gets home. We get in his car, and he starts talking about his love life, and starts asking if I’d ever date him, what I’d do if he asked me out, what I’d do if he made moves; for 15 minutes. Every time I’d answer his questions he got more aggressive, more offended. 

For 15 minutes I was terrified. I wouldn’t classify myself as small but I definitely can’t fight him off, and my dominant arm has replacement joints so I physically can’t fight. 

We get to my place, he goes in for a hug and I duck, say “thanks for driving, see you at work sometime”, and lock the door. I cried for the first time in a long time. I had never felt unsafe around this guy before and now I can’t even look at pictures we’re in together. 

If you made it all the way here, thank you! I’m really upset about this and I need to know that I’m not crazy. I think I know what his intentions were, but I’m not sure. ",04Mar2019,14
792,"So as the title says. I hate my job. I work in the back office of a small bank. We make adjustments and do data entry.

I enjoy the job itself, but I can not stand my manager. She is moody and has horrible people skills. She treats her staff (who range from 30-70 years of age) like children. If you need something clarified with her, she treats you like an idiot who is wasting her time. 

I was promoted to assistant manager a little over a year ago. This was after being at this company for about a year and a half and also having co-workers with years of experience passed up for the position. I had accepted a job offer somewhere else after getting tired of only getting 25 hours a week and knowing full well I could not stand my manager.  I accepted the counter offer because it was more money than the other company was offering and I thought it would look good on my resume. I found out afterwards that her last 2 assistant managers were either fired or left without any notice,.

When my manager is gone, I'm the go to, and even after a year, I feel really under prepared. Our policy and procedures are vague and 95% of the time, it does not address what I'm struggling with. I try my best with what information I have, but more times than not, I get told I did things incorrectly when she returns. Other than being able to lead our team when she's not here, I really don't know how my duties would equate to that of an actual assistant manager. 

I'm starting to get mild anxiety from this job, which shows itself in the form of a nervous stomach ache. I know it's time to leave but I'm currently taking morning classes as a part time student, and my current work schedule is perfect and I don't work weekends. 

Once I'm finished with this semester, my classes will all be online based, so I will be able to look for a new job.

Tl:Dr I have a horrible manager but I don't want to quit yet because of my school schedule, so what can I do to make this remaining time easier on myself? I'm tired of feeling stupid at my job and I'm tired of dreading everyday I come in. I don't want to make a big deal out of anything, because I don't think she has the capacity to change and already has had complaints to HR about her attitude. I just want to get through my remaining time here with as little drama as possible.",04Mar2019,1
793,"Here’s my background:
-	Born in a North American country and lived there for 5 years till I came to my father’s country
-	Father is an Arab national and mother is an Asian national
-	Father’s family and his own mother thought me and mom shouldn’t be in the Arab country and that I should’ve been taken away by my father. 
-	Father and grandma fought in court to keep me and my mother in the country.
-	Before grandma’s death, she told dad to marry an Arab woman and he agreed to her dying wish. 
-	Mother still holds Asian nationality.
-	Father has a second wife who has his nationality and I have 6 step siblings.
-	I used to speak the Arabic language until I became 7. I was transferred to a private, mostly English speaking school at the age of 5 and I lost the ability to speak it.

I am not specifying their nationalities so I don’t give away my identity. 

How I got affected:
I remember telling my classmates back in elementary and middle school that I held the Arab nationality and they would tell me that it was bullshit. I sometimes blamed my mother for being part Asian and looking more like her because Asian countries are third world shitholes (except the very few rich ones like Japan and SoKo). 

I also kept getting bullied by foreigners. Funny thing though, this still affects my pride because I didn’t do anything but pussy out most of the time until it I really got pissed. 

When you are a local in an Arab country, you are well respected and thought of as a cool popular kid. 

I was just a quiet, shy, weak, and anxious student who looked more like his mother than his father.

I remember being bullied a lot for speaking out about being an Arab national and my classmates would debate about whether I was local or an Asian national.

When I got tired of the bullying, my father came to visit my school and complained about the bullies. 

After the complaint, the bullies respected me and treated me as a friend or acquaintance sadly after it was proven I am really an Arab national. 

My bullies left before high school began, but one still stayed and had a change of heart after being scolded by his father in the office. He respected me and to this day we are friends. 

High school happens, people know I’m local as a fact and they are chill with me. 

I graduated high school and am taking a break before studying in my country.

I am a mixed national but don’t really fit in.

I can fully understand my mother’s language, but am unable to speak it. I cannot speak or understand Arabic. 

I refuse to learn Arabic because I always thought “Who cares? No one thinks you look Arabic, so English is the universal language for everyone”

Then I’m met by people who remind me that I am an Arab national and I should be ashamed that I cannot speak Arabic, such as a my father, the locals working at the immigration section in the airport, the military camp office, and the court.

I take responsibility in losing the Arabic tongue, but can you blame me? My father was mostly absent in my life. He was busy with work, his second wife and his other kids. I don’t look Arab and look more like an Indonesian according to some of my classmates. 

Whenever I meet strangers, I just tell them I am from my mother’s country so I don’t have to explain everything to them. 

I told my mother about this and she got really pissed and told me to knock it off. She told me to embrace that I am mixed and have an Arab citizenship (It’s the best among other Arab countries). 

She told me that people are either jealous or hate me because it’s nearly impossible to acquire the Arab citizenship and the benefits are actually lit.

Should I continue lying to people about my nationality or be open about it regardless of positive or negative reactions?

TL;DR:
Nobody in elementary and middle school believed that I am Arab because I look more Asian. I never tell anyone about my Arab nationality and just tell them I am from my mom’s nation. 

Should I continue lying to people about my nationality or be open about it regardless of positive or negative reactions?

794," Hi everyone,

So about three months ago, I accepted a new position at a governmental facility. I hated it from day one, and started looking for a new position. I interviewed with another company before my current one, but they never responded...hence my decision to enroll in this new position. Now, that company that had me on hold reached out saying they froze the position but would see if I am still interested. I passed their first two rounds of technical interviews, and now I am invited to go on-site to do a 1-hour presentation, interviews, and lunch.

The problem is, they have my old resume. They do not know I have picked up this new role at the Governmental facility. During the second interview, it never presented a proper chance for me to tell them about the new position. Now, I am invited on-site to do a presentation, meet the engineering panel, and also have lunch with the team. There has been no offer yet, but for now, it all seems positive. This is a job I always wanted and a company I have been in favor of. Do I bring up that my current job is not that on my resume? Do I just forget about it and proceed like it never happened?",04Mar2019,5

I can see well out of my right eye but my left eye is sliiiiiightly blurry where it makes it hard for me to concentrate. First she just messed up the glasses because she read a number wrong and then it was the contacts. My new glasses at the moment feel fine, but not the best it used to be.

Sorry this is a bit long!

***Intro***

So  my sister, her boyfriend, and I got into an argument over dinner about  what years the millennials lie. I told them they were incorrect then my  sister and her boyfriend teasingly bring up Wikipedia and pew research  to support their claim. They proceed to tease me that I wasn’t a  millennial and the fact that they were millennials gave them some sort  of superiority over my supposed generation. I was sure they were wrong, I  remembered from my business textbook done and vetted by experts that  those dates were incorrect. Nevertheless, I couldn’t say anything  because I couldn’t bring up the textbook at dinner. When I got back to  my apartment, I brought up my business textbook and sure enough, my  dates were correct.  I posted the screenshot to the group chat.  Admittedly I was a bit annoyed that they teased me during dinner so I  drove the victory deep.

***Players***

SS - Sister

AL - Her Boyfriend

JS - Me

***Arguments***

SS - Look it up on any other website

JS  - I’m sorry wiki and pew research isn’t a verified source. If you’re  telling me those are more reliable than textbooks by professors and  researchers alike then idk what to say lol.

SS - Lol what about forbes magazine? What about nytimes?

JS  -It’s a magazine, Sis. You literally have a textbook approved by  research and you’re like “B-but Forbes...wiki” - yeah I know but  research is research. News gets unreliable sources all the time. Above  all else, scholarly sources are always 1st for research. As an  accomplished student, you should know this.

SS - It’s not worth arguing.

JS  - I would be fine with being classified as not millennial actually.  They’re used in a negative light most of the time. But oh well! What can  I say: the masses are easily swayed by unreliable sources.

AL - What about the chamber of commerce?

JS - Don’t know what that is. Gotta study for Micro though so you can explain it here and I’ll read it later.

At  this point AL links bls.gov to strengthen his point. I send it back,  circling that it uses Pew Research which is not as reliable of a source  as my business textbook.

AL - It quotes PEW research it’s good enough for me

JS - It USES Pew Research for the research, an unreliable source. Sorry but I’m going to study now.

AL - But if the main fact checking agency of the US government uses it, I think it’s universally more applicable

After I finish my studies:

JS  - Okay let’s think about this just intuitively. Who do you think has  more time to study this information? The Chamber which probably has way  better things to do than figure out where generations lie or Professors  and researchers who’s job was to publish scholarly papers on the  subject? Just thinking about it like this will bring you to the answer.  If I was working for the chamber, I could easily see myself lazily  pulling up the fastest data. That doesn’t mean it’s correct nor  verified. Also thinking and knowing are two different things. You can  think all you want but I know for a fact that I would take scholarly  research over pew any day. Linking another source that uses the same  unreliable information is still unreliable. This is why we don’t use  Wikipedia or news magazines in research papers. We generally go to  scholarly databases which are peer reviewed.

AL  - I agree with you scholarly papers are likely more accurate. And in  the perfect world, the most accurate info should be the gold standard.  In the real world, sometimes authorities don’t always do the proper  research. In this case, the classification of millennials is highly  subjective and debatable, not well-defined and quite frankly, doesn’t  actually matter so long as people are using it with a common  understanding of the timeframe. Its less important if it’s tomatoes or  tomatoes, just stick to one. From a practical sense, I’m inclined to  quote what’s more universally adopted. In this case, that’s what the  bureau of labor statistics uses. They track everything and anything to  do with labor for the population. And it’s one of the most relied on  source of data for business decision makers. Do you understand my view?

JS  - Yes I understand your view, however, I would contend that the  information is not debatable. The experts did the research and found the  specifics. I would imagine other sources, the “universally” adopted,  took their information from sources like Wikipedia instead of actually  studying when. Plus what is accepted should always be left to the  experts. Inaccurate information can be spread far and wide but that  doesn’t mean it’s therefore correct no matter how subjective the  information is. This is analogous to ancient history where people  generally thought the world was flat. When we actually put together the  research and came to a conclusion, the correct information was clear as  day. Masses motioning towards incorrect information does not make them  correct.

AL- I’m about to prove to you  why you think you’re Copernicus but Newton was more correct. And I’m  sure glad we didn’t stop at Copernicus. This is the author to the  textbook you referenced for your “expert” data.

He  cites Bill Nickels the author of the textbook, Understanding Business, I  used to prove which years the millennials lie. Personally, I see  nothing wrong with Nickels creditability.

AL  - Let me show you another source that I argue is more reliable, better  researched, holds more weight than the one you point to.

AL links Gen Z @ Work: How the Next Generation Is Transforming the Workplace

AL  - There’s an entire book on this generation alone. All 320 pages  dedicate to one topic and one topic only. Let’s look at the author.

AL then posts David Stillman’s credentials like he did with Bill Nickels, hoping to compare the two.

AL  - 40 under 40 and considered one of 200 to watch by the business  journal. Who’s information would I trust more? An author who touches on  the broad topic of business and an author who dedicate an entire book on  the singular topic. I think you know the answer. In case you didn’t see  it Gen Z is defined as 1995 to 2012. What can I say: too many people  just simply trust those who seem credible without doing full due  diligence.

JS - To be candid, final  remark because this argument is very long. Your notion that Stillman is  an expert is laughable at best. Writing an interest book is nothing  short of passion work compared to peer reviewed textbook. Also, the  accomplishments you credit him to are even more egregious. As we’ve  already established, news magazines are not credible sources which  eliminates every title you credit his “reliability” to. Nickels and  Hughs are professors in the field who study and master the topic. Your  assessment that their PHD is not as credible as Stillman, if not more,  is disappointing to be honest. In case you didn’t reference the peer  reviewed textbook again, Millennials are categorized as 1977-2000.  Trying to desperately bring out contrary is quite primitive. Bishop to  bishop 8, discovered check, and incidentally mate.

AL - All I’m saying is no one seems to care about your credible sources. Maybe the reason is they’re not so credible.

JS  - Sorry but like I said: the masses are easily swayed by unreliable  research. Expert opinion is always gold standard and we’ve agreed on  this.

AL - There are hundreds of experts...

JS - Hundreds but not everyone is

AL  - How do you weigh the different opinions of every expert? Fair. All  I’m saying is you showed us what one expert thinks. But there’s the  potential for lots of other experts with a different opinion - that’s  how the real world works

I agree with this though AL has still not posted a credible source to me.

JS - We separate the experts from the delusional and Stillman is not an expert.

AL - Not everything is 1+1=2.

JS - True. But if I told you 1+1 = 3 I am wrong nevertheless.

AL  - Look we can debate who’s the better expert. If you want me to, I’m  happy to review every textbook taught at Harvard and Yale and reference  the dates they use for gen z definition. You want me to? Would you turn  agree that those credible sources are equally if not more credible than  your one gold standard? I don’t mind using my time to prove a point to  you. But I’m afraid even if I prove you wrong you’re head is so much in  the sand that what’s my point in wasting time.

JS  - I’m open to change. I haven’t demonstrated incapacity yet. However,  you and I have better things to do and I’ve lost interest.

SS - I win.

I obviously get annoyed at this because I think I backed my arguments  well. I feel like if anyone was looking at the debate, my arguments  weren't flawed compared to AL's.

JS - If you’ve won the definition of served, then yes. Yes you surely did. Lol.

SS - I think AL has proven you were wrong.

JS  - If after this debate you think my points were incorrect then it is  merely feeble argumentative idiocracy lol. We’ve agreed that expert is  gold standard and the standard still stands.

AL  - That’s not the crux of the argument. Your old gold standard for the  definition is gen z is not the one and only gold standard.

JS - Your presented gold standard was ripped apart with little intelligence. You can surely see it.

AL  - Do you agree? If you don’t I’ll go to the library this weekend and I  swear if I don’t find 2 textbooks with that date, I’ll give you 100  dollars. If you lose, you have to go China to work for the summer.

JS  - If you have so much time then you have bigger problems to discuss  haha but yes you can be my guest, however, do try to vet the sources. I don’t want to see another “expert” like Stillman trying to be put above Professors.

I’m honestly tired of this argument. I think I proved my point but the fact that they can’t stand  to let it slide and keep trying to bring up contrary evidence is bugging  me.  As people who don’t like to lose, I think a unbiased opinion would  be nice. My sister and her boyfriend would never let this go if I just said ""I don't want to debate anymore"" as evidenced. I don't think I'm wrong either.",04Mar2019,1

This year was different. The company interviewed a lot of students this year but a friend of a friend (who works there part time) told me that all the people interviewed were not suitable for the jobs. He also told me that the company are now planning to interview 2nd year students to fill these vacancies for just the 3 Summer months because they are falling behind on projects.

My friend of a friend mentioned to one of the Senior Engineers that I am available for these 3 months before I start my Masters and the Senior Engineer said he'll let management know. I would love this job as I have been unsuccessful in seeking work in local restaraunts, hotels etc. but the company is not aware that anybody outside of the interviewers knows about their situation. So my question is, should I get in contact with my old manager to try and secure one of the jobs, even though I'm not supposed to know about it?

I'm not even sure where to start. Everything is such a cluster. Basically the actual position is fine. The processes the company has in place is the problem. 

My last position was primarily data entry and they just hired a replacement for me. I advised management before this happened that the ""data entry department"" would suffer greatly if they didn't hire more than just my replacement. We were already behind even before I was promoted. 

What is happening now is that I am being told everyday to literally use half my workday to help out the data entry team. This causes me to fall behind and rush like a madman to at least attempt to get caught up as much as I can on my new duties. 

My new position is account management so if I do not perform certain tasks within a business day then I get yelled at by our clients and they suffer as well as my company suffers financial loss.

I've been getting to the point where I don't even take breaks anymore. I'm literally at my computer all day with fresh anxiety. I understand that new positions have some getting used to, but this is ridiculous. I can't even take the time to learn my new clients because half the day I am doing entry and the other half I am rushing to get bills out. I have no time to make an effort on building a rapport with my clients, better understanding their needs, and just learning their process.

I've been thinking about looking, but I don't know if that will somehow hurt my career in someway. I am close to two downtown's where I doubt it will be hard to find a better paying job.

I'm a russian spy living in Germany, and grew up in some form of ""Ghetto""( you know, that place you get stuck when your family freshly arrives in a foreign country with all the ather russians, turks and whatever) and joining society when i was 11. By then, i had my fair share of influence from show-of gangster's,(knigge, i even stole stuff once upon a time before being reintegrated into society), wich resulted in pretty asozial slang aaaannddd words. Ima do it. Niggha. yes. i grew up with a bunch of kids/young adults, with nearly all of them being foreigners, i met my german friends later in grammer school, of wich one was black. Like, pitch black, his name was Jason, the coolest motherfucker i have ever seen, and i idolised him into heaven and all that, he even tried to teach me beatboxing, and i quite adopted his vocabulary. i mean, damn, he was the coolest, most respectfull guy i have ever met in my life, and with him, niggha was word to refer to anyone i accounted as friend. and that has done exactly nothing to my life. until, years later in my more civilized social groups one ""black""(i always called her 25% milk chocolate, cause i could reach that her skintone if i spent some quite some time in the summer sun(bless my chachol-genes from my father)) girl showed up. coolest chick on earth, I'll tell you. aaaannd i referred to her as niggha as we understood each other and talked. OOOFF. drama.exe has been executed. but i managed to clear it up and let my long term friend back it up, that i call the bus niggha, the bird outside my window and my bike as well, nothing to worry about. 
But with time, and with more exposure the international media, especially American media trough reddit, youtube, etc, I've come to the conclusion for it being unhealthy to keep niggha in my all day word-reportoire. And i tried, i tried so hard not to say it. But it doesn't work. it doesn't work at all. sometimes i manage to catch myself before saying it, but most of the times i don't even realise i just said it.

Also, i grew up with Snoop dogg and this dude who will always shout ""YEYA"" in his songs and features. And now i still love Niggalodeon and Retrospectro, and i cant get out of it.

811,"A few days ago I seriously started to question my sexuality. This topic has popped up in my mind from time to time but I decided to ignore it, because ""it just couldn't be happening"". 

Before I get into it in more detail, I'd like to share some basic information about myself: I'm a girl, recently turned 17, lives in a Middle-European country (English is my second language, so sorry for stupid mistakes), I've never had sex before, and I've always assumed I'm straight.

A few days ago, however, I decided to fill out some online tests just for fun. I came across few which would ""tell you what your sexuality is"". My results sometimes came out as bicurious, sometimes as bisexual. I know I should not trust the results of some random tests, but the questions made me think about things I never gave a serious thought. For example: Would sex with a girl turn me on and such.

So, reasons I think I might be bi: I wouldn't feel uncomfortable kissing/dating a girl. Sex with a girl would turn me on, (sorry for this detail in advance) and I'm sure of this after I masturbated multiple times while imagining myself having sex with a girl. It doesn't seem impossible for me to fall in love with a girl, and if I did I'd gladly do it with her (or if it's that serious, marry her, if that was possible in my country). I have girls in school I feel attracted to, around 4 (out of the school which has like 200 students), but I still don't know if that's only my desperation to make friends (I'm a pathetic introvert with close to no friends).

Of course I have my doubts: I don't have past memories of myself being attracted to girls (by past, I mean like around the beginning of my puberty). No one has ever questioned my sexuality. And I don't get that self conscious and nervous around girls as around guys.

I'm still struggling to understand my feelings about this. I'm kind of afraid that this could be just a ""phase"" and in a few months I'd forget about this completely.

As I mentioned it before, it has crossed my mind before but I just brushed it off as me wanting to make friends. Tbh, I only know what bisexuality is since the beginning of 8th grade (so around 5 years ago). I knew that bisexuals existed before that too, but my definition of them wasn't correct. To explain this... My parents and others close to me are not homophobic/biphobic, or at least they don't want to be (except for a few of my classmates), but they just ignore the issue most of the time. My mom's the only one who has ever talked whit an outed gay man and thanks to him she kinda understands. Or I don't know... We saw an 18 yr old homosexual guy in an online magazine a few months ago and she said ""I can't belive he's this young and already gay."" Like, what does that even mean? ""OMG, xy is only 16 and ALREADY straight???"" (whatever, I'm getting off topic here) so when a long time ago I asked her what a bisexual was, she said they're poor people who can't decide what they want. So for a long while I pitied bi people, because ""they can never settle"". (I thought they'd start missing girls if they began seeing a man so they'd eventually always break up) But after I started to use the internet I educated myself on the topic. But I think my mom still thinks the same. Once she also said ""she feels lucky she doesn't have to deal with the trouble of having a queer kid.""

There are a few things that would make sense if I could finally be convinced I liked girls too: I was happy when a girl who I knew was a lesbian payed attention to me, and in an older diary I mentioned I'm not sure about my sexuality, but I ended up erasing that part later, etc. 

I'm certain I'm bicurious, but am I bisexual? I'd be happy if I could hear your opinions on this... Thank you in advance! &lt;3",04Mar2019,2
