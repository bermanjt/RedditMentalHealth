1,"I invited my guy friend [25 M] to come on vacation with my friend [22 F] and I [23 F] We were all planning to go to South Korea. My friend didn't like the idea of a guy she'd never met staying in an airbnb with us, so she asked if he could get his own place. I understood her concern, so I asked if he'd be cool with staying in his own place. We'd all travel and hang out together, so I thought it would be no problem. He said absolutely not, and said he's staying with us. That there's no other option. I truly hate being in the middle of things. I had to be the jerk and break it to him that he can't stay with us. He hasn't texted me since December. I tried to text him today, but he didn't text back. Should I give up on trying to cast the olive branch? Doesn't seem like he wants anything to do with me.

4,"So to give some context i'm a freshman in an honors geometry class and I always pull about a B+. Recently, I inquired to the teacher about joining algebra 2 honors my sophomore year and he said ""Ok but you will need to work more on independent study"" To which I agreed and complied. So we have this sheet that we use as our planner for math homework/studying. This is also turned in every once and a while for a grade so he can be sure that we are logging everything. This time in particular, we were given homework but we also had to turn in the planning. I have short term memory loss issues so remembering page numbers is difficult. I got home only to realize that I forgot to write my HW pages down somewhere other than the planning sheet. I also couldn't retrieve the page number from people in the class because although they are my friends, we don't really have contact w/ each other outside of school. So this led to me forgetting to do this one particular assignment. The way the HW system works is you are graded by which HWs you turn in. It is worth 10 points. So if you forget one piece of HW you get a 90 percent and so on and so forth. The next day I come in and he is calling people up to grab their graded planner sheet and turn in their HW. When I get up there I tell him that I forgot to write it down elsewhere and couldn't contact anyone to which he replied ""you promised to work harder, this is not what an honors student would do."" Am I really not ready to do honors algebra? Especially considering that this HW is in no way related to independent study. The rest of my day was literally crushed and I felt awful because I hate disappointing people. Is he right?

TL:DR My teacher is disappointed with me and im not sure if I should worry about it.",14Mar2019,2
5,I live in the Philadelphia suburbs and there has been an insane amount of cars parked outside my house over the last 2 months. Today was just especially odd cause at around 4pm there was a Nissan sedan out there for around 5 minutes. The second me and my mom started looking out the window they left. Fast forward an hour. My mom comes downstairs and says there’s a Nissan suv sitting on the corner and has been there for 5 minutes. I go outside with my phone to get a pic and the second the person saw my phone in my hand they left. I did get a pic of the back of the car and the front. Both plates front and back were New York plates. I’m in southeastern Pennsylvania. My mom has seen SUV’s parked outside at 2am. My dad has tried approaching some of the cars but they always leave instantly same with my mom. What should I do in this situation? I will not call the cops so don’t even recommend that. ,14Mar2019,1
6,"So back in Oct 2018, this guy (29m) and I (28f) matched on OK cupid. He lived in a different timezone at the time, but was going to move to my city in a couple of months so we stayed in touch and eventually started a long distance ""relationship"", hoping to be together when he moved here.

He kept referring to this girl Jenna as his ex who he dated for a few months but broke up with after he moved (she lives 3 hours away from me). Apparently he liked her but she was a nightmare family fit (she's Caucasian, him and I are both ethnically Indian), she's also not as well-educated, is taller than him, etc. etc. During his move to my city, he temporarily crashes at my place while looking for a decent apartment, and says he has an aunt in the city who he wants to stay with over an extended weekend.

While he was away, I found a bunch of folders in one of his backpacks (I wasn't snooping per se, he had asked me to put away one of his suitcases). The folder contained a bunch of cards and letters from Jenna, the dates confused me. She had been writing to him while we were still ""dating"", saying she can't wait to move to (my city) with him and marry him. He had told me during that time that he loves me so much it hurt, and I am the kind of woman he wants to eventually end up with. 

Anyway, I check her fb profile and she had check into my city, the same weekend he was away. I called my bf immediately and asked him wt heck was up. I didn't mention the folder. He said it's a huge coincidence and that he loves me and wants me to trust him. ""Let's talk about it when I get home, okay babe?"". I was on high alert. 

Meanwhile, one of my friends stalks Jenna's instagram through a fake account, and it's riddled with pictures of the two of them together hiking and at an airbnb the same weekend. She had also posted old pictures of them in the past few months marking significant dates. I was heartbroken. I confronted him when he came home, not revealing everything at once. He kept making up lies. ""Her aunt had died so she's visiting"" ""she still has feelings for me, I wanted to get some closure"" ""I didn't even meet her until you told me she was in town and then we went for dinner""

I was done with his shit. I told him to pack up and get the fuck out. My friend also sent a message to Jenna explaining the situation, with a small video of him packing, a picture of us together, and my phone number. 

She was shocked at first and said they never broke up. They are engaged to be married. He had proposed to her when she visited him while they were long distance. She is sorry that he did this to me and her but she loves him dearly. She also believed his lie that while him and I have been sleeping in the same bed for a week, we didn't have sex, and that I was a former classmate. I sent her a couple of screenshots of our conversation where he said he loves me. She didn't want to communicate further. 

Two weeks pass, I've blocked this guy everywhere. She contacts me again asking whether we did have sex because he is still denying it. I said yes we did. She calls me and we have a brief chat about how he had been lying to us both. And still was to her Apparently he told her that I was a former classmate his parents wanted him to set up with (which shouldn't make sense because his parents knew he gave her a big fat ring). Regardless, she seemed to be okay with the fact that he slept in the same bed with me for a week. Sigh. 

I had also spotted him on another dating app a day before she called me, and I sent her the screenshot. She was very upset but I told her to pull through and contact me if she needs any support since she said she can't tell anyone. Her friends and family all love him and if she stays with him, they can't know about all this. 

We haven't spoken since then (2 months), but seems like she does visit him almost every weekend. He changed his profile picture to their picture together. She is obviously still with him, posting cute Valentine's day stuff and throwback photos of them together. I also noticed her viewing my Instagram stories a couple of times, so she's definitely keeping tabs on me. 

Now, I know I should move on and doesn't concern myself with their relationship etc. I have, to some degree. I started seeing this guy who seems really nice so far. And their pictures together don't hurt/affect me since I know how superficial their relationship must be. 

But for the sake of curiosity, I want to understand how someone forgives their fiance for all this. Sure, he is lying through his teeth but some facts are well established. That he told me he loved me and found me a perfect partner for life, that he lived with me for a week while telling her he's staying with his aunt. That we had sex multiple times, and he was still on a dating site. That he lied to her even after she confronted him the first time. He had also claimed to have told me everything about how they never broke up and that's why I threw him out, but the fact is that he never gave me any explanation or apology and kept insisting he didn't have sex with her that weekend. Until the last moment. She knows that. 

 I know people forgive and compromise in a relationship, but my question is: how do I reason with this situation and get closure and finally end this chapter of my life? ",14Mar2019,2

12,"I have a dog named Kody who is a very good girl. I've had her for years and she is pretty old now (12). The last couple years I havent seen much of her since I've been away at college and she stays at my parents' house. Recently she was taken to the vet due to losing 12 pounds in only a few months
 we were informed at the vet's that she may have a tumor on her liver based on the symptoms, but would need an ultrasound to know for sure, which is a $400 procedure. If she does, then it's expensive treatment to follow. If she doesnt, then $400 would be wasted (if they didnt find anything else there). Shes 12 (fairly old for her breed, Norwegian Elkhound), deaf, has not-the-best hips, and is now on the low-end of average weight for her breed (she was overweight before she began not eating as much suddenly). She can still get around ok most of the time (minus the stairs) and loves to be pet and cuddled..she doesnt seem to be in pain, she isnt crying out or whimpering at any time about anything.
Our options right now are spend this money to help her or save her the procedures and just put her down..I dont want her to eventually starve to death due to the tumor but I dont want to put her down when she isnt ready to go...but since she cant talk, I am unsure when she is ready to go. What do you think? And what are some signs that she knows it's time? Do dogs know when their time is up?",14Mar2019,1

I moved from New York to LA a year ago and since I was used to public transportation my whole life I do not have a car nor a license. I was spending $500 a month in Uber costs until a coworker who lives nearby told me I could carpool with her. 

The problem is that this coworker has a problem with picking me up at a decent time each morning. We start at the same time but we are in different offices and have different supervisors and her boss doesn’t care that she is 5-10 min late each day but my boss does and is very strict about taking sick or vacation days too. 

So I spoke to my coworker about coming earlier several times but she would arrive early for about week and then start coming later and later. Until 2 min turned to 5 then 10. And today my boss called me into her office and told me that she doesn’t want me to rely on other people for transportation. And that when she hired me she was under the impression that I was taking an Uber and that it was temporary (I never said that by the way). My job doesn’t require a license or a car. And she didn’t mention me being late, she specially said that it was me relying on others for transportation and cited the late mornings in passing like “you’ve mentioned being late because of other people”. Also I don’t have to get a ride from someone, I can still take an Uber. But she really stressed that she thought it would be temporary. 

It’s one thing to tell me I can’t be late, but can she tell me I’m not allowed to carpool ? Can she tell me I have to get a license and a car when I don’t need it for work and it wasn’t required when I was hired? ",14Mar2019,1

17,"Okay so I've (F20) known Jake (21) for a while now. We're so similar (humour, music, opinions, personality) but different too. But sometimes i feel like there's something missing in our friendship? Like there's an area with a lack of clarity, just almost a barrier between us, when we're getting along normally it's fine, but sometimes it's just tense between us and I don't know how to fix it or how to just let it be. Sometimes I just leave it alone and it fixes itself, but sometimes I just feel the need to be the person to make the first move. 
Sometimes we sit quietly and do our own thing, sometimes we watch shows together and it's also fine, but then this weird distance gets between us. The mood just shifts, and if it gets too tense I try and talk just casually and see if it'll change. But Sometimes I just feel like withdrawing and giving up on trying to sort our weirdness out and then he'll do something to make me regret pulling away, it'll be something small and insignificant but he'll just make me want to be better friends again. Every time I've gone to pull away and let go of the idea of being better friends, he makes me think otherwise. Am i overthinking things? Are guys just generally like this, or is it just Jake and I?

Well, it has been 3 months and he has not been able to find anything. He has been depressed, struggling with anxiety and has lost great amount of weight. He talked about selling his house if he doesn’t find a job soon enough. His contractor was able to get him a job interview back in January, but for undisclosed reasons it was canceled.  He was pretty bummed but thought nothing of it. Then last week he landed a job interview (all on his own because contract won’t even answer his calls/emails) at this big company, but he got an e-mail today saying thank you but they are not interested. Obviously, he’s devastated and worried he has to sell his house. His beautiful house that he worked so hard for. He is a very smart and talented man. I really don’t understand why he’s not able to find anything or even get job interviews. 

He just texted me to tell me the company is not interested, and that he does not walk to talk right now and that he will talk to me later.

At the same time, my new babysitter’s daughter’s best friend (who was a girl) was also taking advantage of me (I know I keep repeating this phrase but I really don’t want to go into detail). Finally, when I was 8, a man who would regularly come and garden repeatedly molested me.

I get really uncomfortable in social situations, especially when it’s with guys, or at a club, and if a guy so much as touches me I feel like I’m about to have a panic attack and have to leave. I used to think it was because I was insecure (which I still am), however even after losing a lot of weight things remained the same. All my friends go on about their love/sex lives and every single time they talk about it I want to throw up, because I find it so unfair that they all get to have completely normal experiences sexually, and that has been completely robbed from me.

There is one person who I consider opening up to, because keeping this inside for so long is horrible. However I don’t know how to bring it up, and I don’t want to burden them either since it’s a pretty big thing. But I need to talk to someone, and I can’t afford a therapist. I feel so alone and lost and, although I could never actually kill myself because I’m scared, I wish I could just suck it up and end it. Everyone around me thinks that they know me so well, and think that I am completely okay mentally, and I’m sick of pretending. I’m just lost and feel myself spiralling and I don’t know what to do, hence why I’m turning to reddit. I used to be really fun to hang out with, now I feel like I’ve completely lost my personality and any sense of who I am. 

This post is all over the place, I’m sorry. ",14Mar2019,1
37,"ill like you to take a moment to think about who should we marry for a really good relationship. did you have a chance to think about it?

to have a good answer, you have to be specific in your answer (look at scientists or surgeons as two of many examples of very specific answers)

after you've thought of a complete answer, then continue, but if you dont you should have the chance to think about it

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~

when we ask ourselves who should we marry, this is the current conclusion i've come to so far:

1. you should marry someone that you enjoy being around, and makes you **happier** than you already are
2. you should marry someone that **communicates well** with you &amp; **understands** you well
   1. this part tends to be helped by being more educated since this is learned
3. you should marry someone that is **reliable** and that you can trust
4. you should marry someone that is the same as you (meaning the **same important values**)

these are **basic** attributes/qualities all my friends &amp; ppl have (this includes singles &amp; also those newly married)

in a good relationship, of course both would have these. this is also a good reflection on the future

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

this is about the kind of person most ppl should marry that would very likely lead to a good relationship

* **im looking for info** that is adds something **new** to what is said, or different from what is said, about the kind of person most should marry that would very likely lead to a good relationship
* your reasons for why you have any given opinions is what i'll like to discuss

&amp;#x200B;

im sure (i mean im guessing) that there are good info on the web on who most ppl should marry for a really good relationship, but i have not run across any that i can atm recall

but do you know of any good things i should look and why it is good?

&amp;#x200B;

after you've thought about all of this, please reply if you're experienced, and have specific reasons for your opinions, and ill like to discuss your reasons

look forward to it =)

38,"I'm a senior in high school and I've been talking to this girl the last couple of weeks through Snapchat that used to have a crush on me a year prior. She's pretty shy and sees herself as awkward. We've hung out the last 3 days. The first day we just went and got coffee and since the coffee shop was packed and there were no available seats, we just decided to leave and drive around. We both share a huge passion for music, so we talked about that mainly amongst other topics.

The second day, she stopped by and picked me up and she said we were just going to drive around. Then she took me to this beautiful park that I had never been to. She asked me if I had  been to it the day before, and I told her no. So we walked on the docks and just talked. Then we went up in this watch tower and tried to read all of the engravings that we're carved. We left a little later, and when we got back to my house, she leaned in for a hug, and we hugged, but we both held on and I kissed her. She smiled and looked really happy. I sent her a message and told her I was sorry if I made her uncomfortable. She assured me that she wasn't, and that she just didn't expect it and reacted awkwardly. 

The next morning, she messaged me and told me that she spilled Pepsi all over her purse, and had to throw it away. I felt bad for her because she didn't have a spare, and I went out and bought her a new purse as well as a gift card to the coffee shop we went to because she had been making jokes wondering how she could buy coffee with $1. I told her I would stop by whenever she gets home, but she insisted to stop by my place since she was already out. She did, and I gave her the purse and the gift card. She was extremely grateful but also felt bad that I bought it for her. She told me to get in the car, and I did. We stopped at a grocery store and just goofed around and smelled candles and just acted like idiots. Then she started driving down a familiar road that I take to get to church on Sundays since I play drums there. I had my personal kit in the youth group building next door, and I wanted to show her around. We went in and had a good time. She played the kit, and I showed her how a little bit. Then she kept hugging me, and eventually her mom called and was angry she was out late (7:30 PM) because apparently she has an 8:30 curfew. So we left and drove back to my house. She was upset on the drive there, and was just telling me some personal issues about her relationship with her mom. We got to the house and we hugged and said goodbye. 

Later that night, I get a message from her around 9:30. She says that her mom grounded her through spring break for being out late. I told her I was sorry for keeping her, and she said it was her fault. Then she went on to tell me that after the argument with her mom that she had been thinking. She told me that she had just gotten out of a relationship, and that jumping straight back into one wasn't working for her mentally. She said that she didn't want to start this relationship if we both weren't ready. She also said that buying her this stuff overwhelmed her and that it was just moving too fast for her. She told me she wasn't trying to lead me on, and that she just needs some time to heal from the past. 


Sorry for this being super long. Today is the first day I haven't talked to her in about 2 weeks since it happened last night. But I don't know if there's any signs of this being completely over, or maybe having a chance to start over. I know that I'm in the wrong just as much.  ",14Mar2019,1
39,"Got the mouse, but now I’m wondering how do I clean up the droppings and how will I clean the stuff that was on the floor that it was potentially crawling around on. I was in the middle of going through all my belongs and choosing things to keep and throw out so I had a lot of things thrown across the floor, mainly clothing which is fine but I also had things like makeup and skincare, hair drying and straightener, shoes etc, basically I had everything pulled out of its place to reorganise it and now I’m just disgusted and paranoid that everything is infected in some way.

I did find out he had a gf living with him but was stupid to hookup for 3 months but it fell apart as he got mean and selfish and pathetic and I lost temper and exposed him

I sent proof of him cheating on his gf of 7 years 2 weeks back. We both blocked each other, the girl was dumb to block me and seems to be ok the way to forgiving him I think but she is angry he told me and doesn’t seem like she will forgive him 

Now, 2 weeks after the incident, the first thing he posts on Instagram is 3 photos of an AXE, one with rust and the other after he cleaned it. 

Captioning how happy he was with the results 

My friends thought it was slightly odd timing for him to post something like this but he doesn’t seem very aggressive from what I know of him.

But if it were you in my shoes, would you be worried? Does this seem like a subtle message? He lives an hour drive away so seems unlikely he will come but I don’t know how crazy people get when they feel betrayed and need revenge so I am going to be cautious. He knows my address but I don’t know his and he knows my building Door code.

What does this mean I hate the mystery or might be a coincidence

41,"Hi all, throwaway account just in case. 

First, a little background: I (Male, 28) was raised in an abusive cult where I was not exposed to alcohol, but when it fell apart when I was in late high school and I got my first taste of the real world, I went off the deep end for a little while. When I was in college I had a very bad relationship with alcohol; I even skipped a semester at one point because I had such a dependence on it. It was bad, and only by sheer luck did I come out the other side without any DUIs, arrests, or suicides (In my senior year, with help, I finally realized how much I was self-medicating depression and post-cult PTSD with the first “medication” I encountered that made me feel okay). I got help, and I got better.

I ended college with a wonderful girlfriend and moved to a major metropolitan area in the US to work my dream job. Three years later, here I am, a couple promotions under my belt, living comfortably, and by all signs poised to excel in my field. The girlfriend (and later fiancée) is gone, but that is due to her realizing she was a lesbian, which was hella difficult, but nothing to do with me or my alcohol consumption. In fact, she often commented on how proud she was of me for getting so much better and moving on from when she met me and I was wasted all the time... she even mentioned it in our breakup talk.

However, this past week my coworkers and I were talking towards the end of the day, and we all ended up taking an “are you an alcoholic” quiz online. Based on my weekly alcohol consumption, it said I was. I know not to put too much stock in generic quizzes, but it still bothered me, and it gave me pause for thought. And it’s kept me thinking since then. So here’s some info on my current alcohol consumption:

I work out early in the morning, so I usually go to bed as early as possible. I get home from work around 8 or 9pm on a normal day, I drink a six pack of Miller Lites or Michelob Ultras, usually between 9pm and 11pm, while I casually watch TV and go over prep work for the next day. Then it’s lights out. After a six pack I feel relaxed but not tipsy; I often have coworkers come over to continue work and we have a drink together; I’ve never had a “what happened” moment the next day.

I wake up the next morning and work out, and I always feel good (although I’ve never had a hangover in my life, even when I drank super heavily in college). 

When I travel, either for work or to visit relatives, I don’t drink, and I don’t have any averse reaction or withdrawal. Every year in the past three years I’ve gone at least two weeks without a drop of alcohol with no ill effects.

I was a scholarship athlete in college (track and field, 3k-10k) and still run marathons at a fairly elite level to this day (Olympic trials not out of the question of things go right). Since college I’ve never even come close to missing work—or even a workout—because of alcohol consumption.

So, I guess I’m wondering, does anyone have advice on my situation? Is it possible that my metabolism or genetics are not taken into account by an online quiz? Should I cut down on my alcohol consumption? I honestly don’t feel like I have a problem, but the quiz, and a number of other articles, tell a different story. 

Thanks for bearing with me over this drawn out post.",14Mar2019,1

I instantly knew what it was going to be about yesterday she had told me she was a bit attracted to another guy me being caught in i my fantasies didn’t leave her.

44,"Short backstory. TL;DR below.

Last year I met a barber who attended the Chiefs watch parties I attended here in central Texas. He confidently told me he would clean up my cut nicely. I went to him a couple times; first time it wasn’t the best, but I can’t fault him for his first try. Second time it wasn’t much better... He doesn’t have a shop, so he did it at his apartment. I wasn’t real comfortable at his place, he had family around and it was just uncomfortable. 

He has been texting to ask when I’m coming for another cut, but I’m not sure how to respond. I want to be straight with him, and just let him know his style just isn’t for me... but knowing this guy, he will take it personally. I don’t want to have beef with this guy, so I’m asking for advice on how to approach this to end it cordially.

There is also another big problem, she's pretty socially awkward, and while that hasn't been too much of a problem between us in the past I am still worried that this could make the situation worse.

He gave one scenario where he walks into his room for a few seconds to get something and leave, and in those few seconds, the wind slams his door shut. He does not want to move the door stopper for ""those few seconds"". 

Neither does he want to close the door slowly for those few seconds to avoid the wind slamming his door shut, because he is only there ""for a few seconds"".

I should note that I have heard the door slam shut even when he comes back to his room and stays for long periods without leaving again.

49,"I have this friend and lately he’s been overstepping some boundaries.
We started being friends last year and bonded REALLY quickly and become close really fast. I enjoyed spending time with him and everything. However one day he told me he was in love with me, he made it very clear it was more than a crush, and I said that although it was flattering I was straight. Well he stopped talking to me altogether for a few days which was kinda sad because I wasn’t going to treat him any differently after his confession, although I do understand he must have felt awkward. After a few days we started talking again and it was pretty much back to normal.
A couple weeks later I started talking to this new girl that I met. Well my friend was NOT happy about this. He would pry for information about her but would get upset everytime she was discussed. Ultimately I stopped talking about her to him altogether because I couldn’t handle how immature he was about it. But as things progressed with this girl, he got progressively worse. He started being rude and childish and would get upset very easily. We couldn’t hang out without him getting upset. He started cramping me and the whole thing became very unhealthy. Luckily after a while he realized this and said that he was going to leave and stop talking to me for what he made it seem like for good. I was sad of course but I was also exhausted from his tantrums. Either way about a month went by and he reached out and said he wanted to be friends again. And I’m fine with being friends again but I’m like very worried about getting close to him again or hanging out one on one. Since being back he’s claimed to be over my relationship with that girl, however he did make a selfish and rude remark about her already. Since being back, he’s constantly suffocating me with very personal questions, telling me dreams he’s had about me with details I’m uncomfortable with, and just straight stalking me. He told a mutual friend that I lied to him when I said I couldn’t hang out cuz I was busy all because he could see I was listening to music on Spotify.
I like this kid. He’s fun when he’s not being manic but ever since I found out about what he said to our mutual friend I’ve been feeling very uneasy for days. I want to say something but I’m not even sure how to approach it. The whole thing makes me feel sick.

51,"In this particular situation it involves a bar I've been going to for twenty years, I'm not a regular so I doubt the regular staff realize this. 

I used to have a big group of friends who is go out with regularly, but I moved out the area for a few years and in that time they moved on. I made a new social group via Meetup but wasn't close with them, we'd go out but honestly I'd not have fun. I started dating a member of the Meetup group but he became abusive and thus I had to leave the group, I've no idea what he's told them to explain why we went from sickingly in love to not even wanting to see each others faces. 

Now I avoid that bar on Saturdays to avoid that ex, and I've no friends to go drinking with.

I occasionally go in with a guy, like a friend or on two occasions dates, but that's it.

I ruined a great thing I had going before the summer with a very mature and genuine guy to be with SB. Our relationship grew, and SB started talking about our future. As much as I tried to distance myself from him I felt myself getting sucked in. Unfortunately things ended just as I thought they would. During the long distance after the summer he wasn’t trying at all so I dumped him on Labor Day. It hurt me so so much and I promised myself I wouldn’t date again until after college. (I am currently a junior) I had some flings here and there, but met someone through my internship and we began talking. I let him in and began developing feelings for him. I told him about past and he understood. He didn’t push me into having a relationship, but I got scared of losing him. So we started dating officially in January. He made me feel safe and comfortable everything that I was missing in the summer relationship. 

It’s now March and I’m in Hawaii on spring break. I found out some family news that turned my life upside down (for the worse)
My boyfriend hasn’t been there for me at all. Aside from saying he was sorry he was an ass when we fted the night I told him what happened. He’s in Tampa with his baseball team for spring break and I didn’t want to ruin his time. But if he truly loves me like he says he does (which was wayyy too fast by the way) wouldn’t he care enough to ask how I’m feeling? This news was life altering and I ultimately talked for 40 minutes about this with the guy I ruined things for for SB. (Him and I are now just close friends who understand each other) he even said that it should be my bf should be talking about this with me instead of him. I’m so confused because this was the guy who made me happy after such a dark time, who I thought adored me. He made me believe in relationships and love again. But in this time of need he’s completely absent. He apologized when I brought up how I felt, but then went back to acting like everything is fine. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ruin his spring break, but I am also not the type of person to put these feelings aside and act like everything is fine until we get back to school.

61,"I posted this to aimitheasshole, but I was told to post it here too.

I have 3 cats, Bella (16ish), Noelle (8), and Misha (4). Misha and Noelle are in great health, however Bella has been declining.

I've had him since I was a teenager, and before declawing was made illegal/banned where I live. My family and I had him declawed, which, we now know was a horrible thing to do. The other cats are NOT declawed.

Bella suffers from horrible arthritis. His knuckles weren't properly 'cut' during his declawing, and healed sideways. He's in a great deal of pain now, and has started biting his front paws until they bleed and ripping out his fur to leave large bald patches. We have taken him to the vet, and after hundreds of dollars worth of tests, have found that he has some kidney issues, but asides from his feet, is otherwise healthy.

I live alone, and Bella needs to take painkiller medication daily. He was prescribed two doses a day, but have you ever tried to give a pill to a cat? He howls and bites me. I pin him down GENTLY, pry open his jaw and push the pill in and rub his throat to help swallow, but he will purposely gag or purge until he vomits the pill back up. After he is pilled, he refuses to eat his food.

We changed the type of painkiller medication 3 times and downed the dose to 1 pill a day, since at 2 pills a day he was completely high, sedentary and unmoving, and....not really living.

He no longer allows me to give him his pills. He bites. He attacks the other cats. He drools and vomits all over the house and refuses to eat IF I manage to get the pill into him (which is maybe %20 of the time).

The only option outside of somehow finding a different way to pill him (I've tired all the diagrams and ways I found on the internet. He won't have it dissolved, hidden in food, forcefully given, nothing. I did everything the vet said), or to give him a very expensive surgery to remove more of his knuckle so that the declawing is ""done right"".

Would it be wrong to put him down? He's lived a long, fulfilling life- but now he's just in pain and miserable, and I hate having to try and give him his pill. He despises it, he screams, he vomits and hates me and it breaks my heart. I'm trying to do it for his own good, but he's absolutely fucking miserable all the time.

As I mentioned, other than kidney issues (he eats, drinks, pees and poops fine when I don't try to give him his arthritis meds) and the agony of his front paws, he's fine and seems normal.

I love him very much and I don't want to have to let him go but he's agitated and miserable without his pills, and if I DO get them into him somehow, he's a stoned, unmoving block of nothing.

Now, we have had unprotected sex on multiple occasions, as well as protected sex, but not once have I actually ejaculated inside of her, which I know doesn’t guarantee no kids, but just gives you an idea of what we’ve been doing.

She is a day late on her period, which is somewhat a cause of concern for me being an anxious little shit, so I need some advice 

If she does end up getting pregnant, how do I go about the abortion? I have a clinic near me, and am willing to call and collect the funds necessary to make it happen. Do you need someone of age to sign off? Do I need to pay up front? There’s no way I’m keeping the child if for some reason there was a conception, just as a heads up.

He doesn’t have a college education, but he has a decent job with good insurance. It doesn’t matter to me if he goes to college or not, I love him for being who he is. But my parents think he lacks motivation and has no direction. He comes from a wealthy family with a very lucrative business, but he doesn’t want to be near his father due to their strained relationship. He didn’t even tell me for the first few months of our relationship that his family was pretty well off, which surprised me, so I know he really doesn’t care about the money. My parents question me all the time why he hasn’t gone to work with his family and make more money to support me in the future. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I question him as to why he wouldn’t mend his relationship with his dad to potentially have a better career in the future? Or should I tell my family to back off?",14Mar2019,1

71,"I need advice on an issue that has  been going on for too long. As a disclaimer I want to say, I only ever got told my friends side of the story and never herd his girlfriend out as she isolated herself once she started dating my friend. If you don't want to read the huge set up then skip to the end, thank you and all advice is appreciated.

I've got a friend who I've known for 15 years, we are both 20 now. For the past two years he has been dating a very quiet girl. I've known this girl for a couple years and is fairly well integrated into our group of friends. From the off set there relationship seems healthy and cracks have only become visible in the last two months.

A year ago we were in a club with just the lads and I noticed he seemed off so I went over. He told me he needed to tell me something's because he can't keep it on his chest anymore, he was fairly drunk and his phone was ringing none stop (he was holding it so I could see). I can't remember what he said because when he showed me pictures of his girlfriend cutting herself that she was sending him it took over my mind. Over the next couple of days he fell apart and told me everything. She would threaten him with her life everytime he tried to do something she didn't agree with (such as go to clubs). It had progressed over the first year of there relationship to this.

Over the next couple of months he tried to break up with her a couple of times but everytime it looked like he was getting there she would draw him back in. She would tell him that she would hurt herself and use that to guilt him, she would tell him that she would change and so on.

She would also track his phone, delete girls numbers and contacts. He progressively lost all of his female friends throughout the relationship with her and the whole friendship group used to make small comments but it was always blown off. Recently we have moved in together and now she lives about 200 miles away. This means he's opened up to me and my other flatmate about the whole relationship. 

I need advice on how to help him leave this abusive relationship or advice to hive him on the matter. It's clear that I'm unsympathetic as he clearly loves her, it's his first relationship and he doesn't want to hurt her in anyway and he keeps returning in the hopes to either fix her or not cause her harm. I also feel responsible as now I know she is suicidal and her parents do not know this. 

I will answer any further questions in the comments as it's hard writing everything down,

74,"I’m a 14 Y/O male student who is currently in the eighth grade, and I’m coming to a crossroads. 



I’ve been going to a private school since I was in the second grade, and I’m a great student with straight A’s and one B+ in algebra.(which is advanced for my age) I’ve had no real problems with this school for the longest time, and I’ve finally settled in to a great group of ~10 friends who all enjoy my company and I enjoy being with them, school wise, the most stable and secure time of my life. Great friends, grades, I’m moving into a bunch of honors classes next year with a good idea of my curriculum( I have a sister in tenth grade at this school), and I’m a starter on our undefeated baseball team. Right now is the happiest I’ve truly ever been. 




Now, at this high school, I’m going to have to take a very rigorous seven class schedule (not to mention this school is very advanced compared to public schools), and I’m going to have a lot less time to do the things I enjoy through my life in high school. A lot more studying, working rather than playing video games, hanging out with my friends, etc. This is the same kind of change my sister had to do, Who now stays up every night until midnight studying and never hangs out with her friends or has leisure time. 





What I’ve started to realize I want to study in college and try my hand at is business. Yes, I know this can all change especially because I’m so young and have a bunch of time, but my fathers a businessman( how I get to go to a private school in the first place) and I’ve always been a kid keen in math and interested in all things business, like my dad. 





There’s a public school near me where I could easily go to and be successful, at least grades wise. My mom found out through talking to her friend who has a son at said public school, and he’s taking all sorts of business classes and even a sports business class( I’m a huge sports fan) that I would love to take and I’m interested in. Not to mention, since my education has been way higher than a public schools, I’d most likely get straight a’s, while taking not only your mandatory core classes, but classes that interest me and would set me up for success in the future, all which isn’t offered at my current private school.





Currently, my parents pay a little south of 50k a year to send my sister and I to this school, and my parents would love to have me at a free public school, opening the door for more family trips and other luxuries we could have. If there’s two things I’ve always wanted, it’s been a computer and a certain car. My parents have offered me that if I go to this school, I can get a nice PC, and my parents will get me this car of choice(it’s nothing crazy, a used car, but I wouldn’t be able to get it attending my current private school.) Crazy thing is, that would add up to about the same total as one year of tuition for me alone at the private school. 





I came here so I could get some advice on my next step forward, should I stay where I am, at the happiest I’ve ever been with a great, supportive group of friends and great grades, or, should I pursue this other public school(I haven’t been to a public school since I was seven) where I can get opportunities for classes I would never be able to take where I am currently at, and be able to get two luxuries I’ve always wanted.

85,"I am using a throwaway account as too many of my friends know my Reddit username unfortunately. For reference, I am still in high school and am seeking advice on how to act as maturely about this situation as possible. Any and all feedback is appreciated. As usual, **TLDR:** At the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

There is this girl, who we can refer to as S. S and I have become pretty close friends over the past two months or so, as we knew each beforehand but never really pursued an intense close relationship before. In these past two months our friendship has gotten close to the point where everyone assumed we were going to go to prom together, as we had both been through some personal events occurring we both went through that together and got closer as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to develop feelings for S but was rather unsure how she felt as she tends to be a little bipolar sometimes (Aren't we all though?)  so I decided to let these feelings sit to make sure this was something that I was comfortable pursuing and to see if she lost interest; over the months she didn't seem to lose interest.

&amp;#x200B;

As prom season rolled around I was still unsure on exactly how S felt about me, as I had definitely been getting mixed signals throughout. After talking to some of her friends and mine I decided that I would just pull the trigger and ask her to prom, not in any extravagant or surprising way as to avoid 

1.) Getting shot down in front of everyone if worst comes to worst

2.) To keep it lowkey, like I said we had both went through some pretty big life events at the same time and both were in need of something lowkey.

&amp;#x200B;

As the time rolls around my high school extracurricular which we can call CIP had to take a trip to the state's capital. As we board the bus home it is extremely dark as it is nearing 1 am on the way back. She steals my headphones and we listen to music as we drive toward home. She gets a text on her phone from someone who she doesn't talk to regularly asking her if she wanted to go to prom, She responded with a maybe and we went about the trip,

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point I started to accept the fact that maybe this wasn't intended to work out as I didn't want to start unnecessary prom drama over something so little.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Until Monday, as I left the student parking lot I witness the same guy bring over a big sign to ask her to prom. Naturally as her friend I felt happy for her as she was being showered with attention that she ultimately deserved, so she said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me close this by saying that I am happy she found a prom date and will most likely have a great time as the guy who asked her isn't a bad dude at all he would definitely go on r/GoodDudes I'm just asking for advice on how to control the stinging sensation that I feel and to not ruin this special moment for her as I do care about her as a friend first.

87,"A woman from my leasing office told me that she sent my Birchbox box back (return to sender) because she didn’t recognize my name on the address. She told me she had looked my name up on the system and nothing came up so she decided to return the package. Moments later in a different conversation, forgetting she had just told me my name didn’t come up on the system, she pulled my name up in the system - no problem. 

Yesterday I went by the leasing office and this woman was dumb enough to pull her makeup bag out in front of me during which time I saw three of the products that had been sent to me (really random products, not your typical drugstore finds).

I’m not big on conflict but it’s driving me insane knowing that someone from the leasing office lied to me and stole my package.

When I was nearing the end of school I thought about asking her out but didn't and then once school was over we went to different colleges so we didn't communicate until last year where I messaged her to see how she was doing.

I initially got back in touch with her because i was reminded of her while talking to another highschool friend and I wanted to ask her out but she seemed disinterested in our conversation so I never did it. (Conversation was only about casual stuff like uni and work) for the past few months on and off I have been thinking of what if she was interested and have been thinking of just asking her out to get a yes or no to rid myself of these what if thoughts. I'm aware if she rejects me I'll probably look like an idiot but it is what it is.

Can anyone share some thoughts on this if you think I should or shouldn't do it?

90,"Background: I am an 18 year old Community college student with no job at the moment and I currently am living in California with my Mom and sister (1). My mom is a seasonal (out of season rn) field worker who is getting far too old to be working. The rent is mainly paid by my sister 1 and I pay all other bills with FAFSA. We are a poor family.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister 1 has brought her toxic relationship boyfriend to out apartment; he has no job, skills, or any contribution value to the household whatsoever.  My mom, in our previous house, has caught them abusing each other causing her to get kicked out before; she also had a previous temporary restraining order. My mom threatened to move with sister 2 and sister 1 is persistent on him staying. When we were all packed to move in with sister 2, they said that sister 2's husband didn't want me moving in with them. (last fucking second too) So you can imagine how I feel now as we are awkwardly staying at sister 1's apartment and still don't know what to do. The boyfriend isn't part of the lease, my mother is, so apparently there might be some way legally we can kick the guy out, but my mom is too proud and wants to wait for her work season to begin and get us another apartment. I don't want her to work hard anymore but she is so silently furious at my sister 1 and sister 2. I am at this moment trying to contact my dad side uncle who told me i always have a home with him but my mom said she doesn't care and that she'll find an apartment by herself anyways.I don't really have any other options and, I feel as if i just condemned my mom to working for longer because I'm useless.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My mom cant move in with my one of my sisters because of me. I am trying to move with my dad side uncle but other than that i have no options.

But due to disablity I struggle to actually sit down and apply for jobs, no one seems to grasp my problem thus despite my approaching all the local employment support agencies I just can't seem to find any help. 

No job of course means no money...no car, no house, poor diet, not enough disposable income to socialize or find new hobbies. 

I've no friends - I tried Meetup but didn't really click with most people and the one person I did clock with I ended up dating but he became abusive so Meetup was no longer an option. I've tried dance classes, rock climbing, archery, going to the gym, etc. but none gave the opportunity to make friends. I try going places like free events but I always find I'm alone in a room full of people there with their friends, and I end up going home feeling miserable. Having no friends is so horrifically damaging to my mental health.

Ok, so I have been going to this worship center for a few months with no big deal. I was a pretty average person their. However, my philosophy is to respect even stuff I dont necessarily agree with. And I suppose that lead to me being noticed by the pastors and authorities at the place in general for the past couple of weeks.

During worship time, which is where some communicate with God, but I just sit their trying to comfort people who are crying at the altar, (for moral reasons, not religious ones) I got pulled aside by my classes pastor, who said I could be a leader and a teacher in the class, because I have shown that I can worshipGod, and therefore, I can be taught to teach others to worship god.

This is very tempting, because I feel like it could open up a LOT of opportunities. However, I feel like if I did this it would be an ultimate betrayal of trust, and they might view it as utter blasphemy if they ever found out. I told the pastor I would think about it over the next few weeks

Now I'm not a very good formal musician, I have a very hard time reading sheet music. And this type of music is WAY out of my comfort zone. We have been practicing for a few weeks and I already know I don't like it, I've never done anything like this so I didn't really know what to expect. I also feel like my parts are kind of unnecessary since we have a kid who is a really good piano player and a lot of his parts are pretty much the same as mine. I have been thinking about just telling him I want to quit because of these reasons, the thing is he can be kind of strict I'm afraid if I say I don't want to do it then he will get mad at me or something and I still have him for Jazz Ensemble so I don't want to have to go through the rest of the year with him having a grudge with me.

When I was nearing the end of school I thought about asking her out but didn't and then once school was over we went to different colleges so we didn't communicate until last year where I messaged her to see how she was doing.

I initially got back in touch with her because i was reminded of her while talking to another highschool friend and I wanted to ask her out but she seemed disinterested in our conversation so I never did it. (Conversation was only about casual stuff like uni and work) for the past few months in and off I have been thinking of what if she was interested and have been thinking of just asking her out to get a yes or no to rid myself of these what if thoughts. I'm aware if she rejects me I'll probably look like an idiot but it is what it is.

Can anyone share some thoughts on this if you think I should or shouldn't do it?

We dated for about a year and broke up when I was in college, he decided not to go to college and couldn't understand why I was so busy all the time. No big deal, we were young, I kind of expected it to happen. 

But he was my first love, and the first guy I ever willingly slept with. We talked periodically through the years, just as friends. We ended on pretty good terms honestly. 

I've dated 3 guys since him and I broke up, slept with 11 more guys, and talked to like 30 guys. I haven't talked to him in like maybe 6 months? I thought I was totally over him. I saw his Facebook pictures and scrolled past like it was nothing. 

He just uploaded a picture of him and his new girlfriend and for some reason I felt an overwhelming sense of...grief? It was so strange.

So, I’m in a bit of a pickle here.  My dad spent most of my money that I had saved up on pills (around $3500) and trashed my credit taking out online payday loans that never got repaid (you’ll see why that’s relevant in a moment). 

I’m down to my last few dimes, and this caused my rent check from last month to bounce.  I filed a dispute with my bank, reset my online banking credentials, and gotten a new card, but of course they require up to 10 days before they can issues a provisional credit.  From there, these loans have ruined my credit to the point where I can’t take out a loan myself to cover the expenses I now have piled before me.  I’ve disputed these as well, but of course I’m not sure how long the whole process will take.  

My question to you guys is - what are my options?  I don’t have family that’s able to help me with my current deficit.  I’ve currently been staying other places to be away from my father so he has no access to my information, and I’ll be moving soon, but I’m still at a loss as for what to do to make this money up quickly so I don’t have another derogatory situation to deal with in the form of my current landlord.

112,"Hi there, Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am active duty US military, been in for 4 years and I'll be out in 2. I'm making preparations for exiting now and am looking for some serious advice on feasible locations to look into for a very specific set of wants (hopefully this is the right subreddit).  


I will be highly marketable in the Project Management in the IT sector (background in Agile development). I have \~2k hours of project management experience and have some high profile applications in my portfolio. I will be around 30 years old when I get out, and I will have a Bachelors in Business. I'm usually pretty humble, but this is my throwaway so that's going out the window when I say that I'm damn good at what I do, and I've got some stellar references.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I have my pick of the litter when it comes to tech jobs and locations, but my wife is super into homesteading (having grown up on a farm).

&amp;#x200B;

In case you're not aware, homesteading is just the practice of living as much as you can off your own land, it's not doomsday prepping, it's not off the grid living, it just requires a pretty large plot of land (5 acre minimum), and a city ordinance that allows the cultivation of land and the keeping of animals on owned property.  


So I'm looking for advice on cities that are relatively tech savvy, but also have a surrounding area (about an hour commute to the heart of the city) that is relatively rural/good for homesteading.  


If I can afford to be even more specific, any place near Appalachia or the North West would be great.  


Thanks for your time in helping us out with this!

She comes to me to vent because not only have her and I been friends for 5 years, I’m also close with him.

130,"I know this is long but please read because I’ve never felt so lost... I don’t know where else to turn. I’m going to try and keep it as brief as possible. I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My boyfriend USED TO (or so he says) use opiates. Started with painkillers/pills, graduated to heroin (snorting, not shooting). This lasted about 10 years. He’s proud to be just about 2 years clean now. He’s doing better, even started his own business and is working just about 7 days a week. Problem is, he has always lived in the town where we live and everyone knows his past/talks/holds it against him. And people constantly bring it up to me. (“Look at him! He looks high on pills. Look he nodded out for a second!” You know he’s still using”) with no real proof. He DOES drink quite a bit, and he does smoke, as do I. And after working all day/drinking a bit he does tend to get droopy/sleepy and especially if he’s had liquor, will nod off a bit. I’m a bartender, I don’t see many people actually nod in and out. BUT he’s ONLY like that after a full days work and/or drinking. It’s not like he’s doing that in the middle of the day after he hasn’t had anything to drink. And I know alcohol is a depressant...maybe it could effect someone that way? It’s a bit of an annoyance, but we also believe the years of abuse to his body may have had lasting effects on his T levels/thyroid/other things that control energy levels. 

Now, we spend almost all of our free time together. We’ve been together just under 1.5 years, and we’re BEST friends. I can say that wholeheartedly. He’s my favorite person in the world, and for the most part we have very few issues as a couple and very good and honest communication. He’s always been brutally honest with me, even about things that are hard for me to hear and has never came across as secretive. He tells me if he was using hard drugs, he wouldn’t be able to drink because that’s how he use to be. He eats, a normal amount, and isn’t losing weight or anything. We live together (early, I know. We both own our own houses, he’s just staying with me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ we like it). I feel like if he was using hard drugs I would HAVE to know. And for the most part, my gut feeling is that he isn’t. But it gets jumbled sometimes....(I also have anxiety SEVERELY... and that tends to cloud my thinking as well). 

BUT. I’m 12 years younger than him and I’ve never been around hard drugs/users/opiates. Ever. So I know it’s possible I’m just naive and blinded by love, so to speak. For the most part, my gut tells me he isn’t. I’ve even asked “if I wanted to drug test you would you take one?” And he told me “whatever makes you happy” but I don’t want to do that....I feel like that’s a point of no return. But when other people make their comments/condescend to me telling me I’m stupid if I don’t see that he’s using/etc/ it makes me doubt myself. 

I guess what I’m asking is has anyone else been through this? What advice can you offer? Do you think he’s using(feel free to ask more questions I’m just trying to keep this short). Do you think it’s possible living together and hanging out every day, that I wouldn’t know he was? Am I stupid?? Or are other people (some of which WOULD have ulterior motives for us to break up....) just making me feel doubts? PLEASE, any advice would be so appreciated because I feel crazy right now. 


TL;DR Gut feeling is that my boyfriend isn’t using opiates. But when other outside parties weigh in, it makes me wonder if I’m just looking through rose colored glasses, and then on nights like tonight where he’s super out of it (but also has had quite a bit to drink) it makes me wonder, is it just alcohol? He works 7 days a week he deserves to let loose and get drunk every now and again. HELP. ",14Mar2019,1

132,"TLDR at bottom

This girl that I will call “S” is who I thought was a friend. S used to work with my cousin and went to high school with several of my other friends. S and these friends are in their lower 20’s. My cousin and some of these friends both said that S is weird. This was over 6 months ago and I decided to ignore what they said about her and try to become her friend. 

Me and her talked on Xbox alongside these friends and played games together. Everything seemed to be going pretty well. Around this time black ops 4 was still fairly new and I had an extra copy. I went with a friend to meet her and have dinner with her, that same night I sold her my extra copy for $25. We proceed to talk between then and December, hanging out from time to time. She bought me alcohol since I am below the age in my country. 
 
During the middle of December I got into a car accident and suffered a concussion. She is going to school to become a therapist so I texted her about this depression that appeared after my accident. During this time I started to drink quite a bit since I was on winter break. She also throws a get together and invites me along with our friends. I end up staying the night at her place along with one of our friends. She says that she won’t buy me anymore because she felt I drank it all too fast. As December goes by I slowly get better and towards the end of January I’m feeling almost back to normal. 

In January she texted me asking for $50 to buy some drinks since she didn’t have any money and was at a bar. I give her the money and all seems well between the two of us, our conversations seem to be full of life and can go on for a while. I went to the casino in January and won some money so I sent her $25 as a thank you for being there. When February comes around it’s her birthday so I get her a birthday card, a prepaid gift card for $25, a gift card for $30 to a bookstore since she loves to read, and a $40 bottle of wine. She was so happy that I got her a gift (she didn’t open the gift until I had left her place). A few days later she reveals to me that one of her best friends didn’t get her a birthday gift but instead went out and spent a good amount of money on a football player who she doesn’t date and whose birthday is two months away. 

Towards the end of February I let her borrow my vape and built her a bookshelf. When I took her the bookshelf’s we went out for lunch and I picked up the tab. After that we went to the liquor store to get alcohol for the both of us, once again I paid for both of ours. Later on in the week she buys us a book to read together and we hang out again. As I’m about to leave her place she suggested that the next time I come over we should go see a movie together. 

Last week everything still seems fine and she’s still texting me first and such. Last Tuesday she texts me saying that I had left +$50 from when I last saw her. I tell her she can keep it to spend it on necessities Incase she needs it but she declines. We then text later into the evening and she’s talking about how she wants to buy some books for the bookshelf I had built her. I text her last Thursday asking if everything is okay with her because the communications seemed to come to a halt on Xbox and in our text messages. She says everything’s fine and later says that she still hasn’t called her friend to talk about her birthday gift issue from earlier. I went to the casino last weekend and won $700 sending her a picture of my winnings. She replies with me throughout the night with words like “our money” and “we”. Our friends like to joke saying that I’m in love with her. Me and her both made it clear to each other that we are not interested in anything other than a friendship between the two of us. 

I joke with them about her in our group chat that does not include her that, “she would get a lot more money if me and her did hook up”. So I text her yesterday apologizing for anything that I may have said that may have offended her and that I didn’t want to lose such an amazing friend like her. She doesn’t reply to me but instead forwards my message to a group chat she has that consists of a few of our mutual friends that I am not included in. Today I texted some of our mutual friends to see if something was wrong and if she was upset. They said that she had said nothing about being upset but rather was wondering what I was apologizing for. I got a text from another one of my friends saying that she was talking about my text last night and started talking about how I said we were amazing friends but said we weren’t actually friends. He said that after saying that she proceeded to talk shit about me. I got Xbox today and found out she removed me as a friend. I feel like calling her out on all this in front of our friends and bring up some stuff that only me and about one or two of our other friends know. I also want to tell her I want my vape, bookshelves, money that I spent on her, and my hoodie back since we were never friends according to her. Part of me also realizes that I shouldn’t do this and should leave her alone to think about it, giving her space and time. I have 3 exams this week and I think the stress of them is getting to me, I feel like I’m overthinking things, that’s why I apologized to her. 

Should I call her out in front of our friends or sleep on it and not talk to her for a week and a half until I get back from vacation? 

TLDR: this girl I had become “friends” with back in October seemed to enjoy spending time with me. We have several mutual friends together who joke about us saying that I’m “Simping” or “obsessing” over her. We make it both clear nothing more than a friendship will happen between the two of us. I apologized to her her because I felt like I may have said something to her that offended or upset her. She sends my apology to a friend without replying to me saying she wasn’t sure what I was apologizing for. She later talks about it behind my back saying that she doesn’t know I I said I was scared to lose such an amazing friend like her, as we were never friends and then talked shit behind my back. She removed me from Xbox yesterday also. Part of me wishes to call her out infront of our friends and demand for my stuff back and another part of me wants to sleep on it and try and talk to her about it professionally when I get back from vacation in a week and a half. What should I do?",14Mar2019,4
133,"I have a coworker who I would just like to leave me alone. We will call them B

B, at one point, was my absolute favorite person at work. I admired them for their individualism and talent and I wanted to befriend them to soak up all their awesomeness. Turns out, they admired me too and so began our friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had seen nothing but positivity from B and continued to enjoy their company each time we hung out for a few months until we went on a trip together along with all the other management team and the owners of our company. 

&amp;#x200B;

B literally did not sleep during the 3 days of the trip and continued to display behavior that I was absolutely appalled by. It became increasingly bad. It started out with B bashing the managers from the other district. They were apparently jealous and had sour attitudes towards us, B's words. Then B cheated on their partner of 10 years with a married couple and tried to coerce me into sleeping with them as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

B made several comments to me that made me uncomfortable such as a desire to watch me masturbate, things they would do to me and comments about my body.

&amp;#x200B;

 We were in a foreign country and some locals were trying to get us to relocate to a more secluded area. B was all for it and I said hell no. Thankfully, B came with me back to the hotel. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then B got into it with my roommate. B had met a gentleman and was hanging out with him when I found them and asked if B would like to venture out to some local bars. I just needed to go back to my room to freshen up and change. I invited B to come with me to my room and B wanted the gentleman to come. I saw no big deal, he seemed fine. My roommate ends up entering the room to find B and the man sitting on her bed. Meanwhile, I'm in the bathroom so I'm only hearing what's going on and I hear my roomie ask why there is a strange man in her room. I interjected and told her I'd invited them and apologized to her, letting her know that I wouldn't have allowed it, had I known how uncomfortable it would have made her. B blew the whole thing out of proportion, accusing my roomie of being racist and only caring that he was in the room because he wasn't white. During that shitstorm, someone had mentioned that they thought B was on drugs. B blew up and acted inconsolable. B later found my roomie at the dance club she was at and got in her face, my roomie ended up back at the room crying. I was already there, in bed, taking a night off of partying. I don't know what B said to her but she was very upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in shock at B's behavior and absolutely drained having to keep a straight face the whole time. It really ruined the trip for me and I couldn't wait to get back home so I could find some normalcy and distance myself from B. It hasn't quite worked out, however. B got me demoted and is working on getting the other two women, one being my roomie on the trip, demoted. I think because we saw B's true colors. B continues to text me to ask to hang out because I believe B has picked up on the fact that I'm not interested in a nonprofessional relationship with them any longer. I feel like they will probably try to get me fired and, at this point, I'm just trying to keep my job because, despite this coworker, I work for some amazing people and I have a great job with awesome benefits. It would truly be a loss. I've never dealt with someone like this but I believe they are very mentally unstable and delusional. Any advice would be amazing.

134,"This person has helped me out for a few years and while I disagreed with their politics, I never thought it was that disagreeable, nor was it that extreme.   


Well, for some reason in the past month they have been going full on crazy talking about the Q conspiracy, Flat Earth, and violent revolution.  I don't think that they would take part in it, but they are supporting it completely. It may have been going on longer, for various reasons I was away from social media so the sudden change from them is very scary. It also bothers me that they have a PhD, is in a position of some authority, and has gone forward in denouncing a lot of what they used to stand for and now say they are no longer brainwashed by the liberal media. It is not about politics, but the extremism that bothers me.

135,"My mom and I share a business together, she started it by accident and it started generating a fair amount of revenue. 

It got to the point where she needed to hire somebody; I hated my job, was qualified to work with her, and so she hired me. I now own 30% of the business, she owns 70%. 

I have anger because after several years of doing this together, her referring to us as “partners”, she’s semi-retired yet our ownership  structure remains the same. Yes, she started the business, but I’m putting in far more hours and effort than she is, and will, and she refuses to up my percentage, stating she needs the money (I don’t see the business justification in this as we could both make that argument).

Besides the business issues, I struggle really bad with my anxiety and depression. For the first time in my adult life I feel like I really need my mom, but I have this pent up anger over the family business. My husband and I are trying to have a baby and in the past she made comments about me being a stay at home mom, indicating more % of the business being given to me (I couldn’t stay home without more % and she knows that, our business doesn’t generate enough money for 30% to allow that) yet she refuses to give more %. 

I can to rationalize any of this because of the family business ties, though if most people worked hard at a job (putting in overtime, effort, etc) and never got a raise, they would leave. 

On the other hand, I feel like an ungrateful shit for wanting more. I also feel like a total schlub for working essentially for my mom.

I know he wasn't telling the truth because one of my friends went to school with him and was friends with those people.

He sits behind me in homeroom, and I constantly see him copying down whole worksheets the day they are due. These are from his friends. It is for an AP world history class. I have seen this, and have referred to him as a future gas station attendant (Heathers the musical reference). He does this every assignment, and he says he only does 30 min. Homework total (impossible, I have 2-3 hours worth; same classes). I feel that I deserve to talk about him to my counselor because I feel it is unfair that I do all my work and make an honest effort, while he has 0 work ethic and only has a decent grade in the class from having his friends to cheat off of.

My moral dilemma: should I secretly videotape him copying down the two upcoming assignments and take them into the counselor as proof to get him kicked out of the accelerated program for academic dishonesty?

Her father lives in australia and we live in ireland. The mother and father separated when she was little so he hasn’t been around that much.

Im not a shy person just a quiet one I’m that kind of person that will watch what i say before meeting new people so i can analyze everything like there personality so i know what to say around them. So you know a-bit about me.

So she facetimes him sometimes and thats when i first met him. Didn’t really talk much too him the casual kind of talk i just wanted to listen to what they talked about to be honest. 

He came over a year later and when i met him he was such a dick not just to me but her especially. He is one of them ‘Work Work Work’ kind of people which i understand were he comes from but if you travel from australia to ireland for a short period of time your going to spend bonding time with your daughter ? No the complete opposite. He spent majority of the time giving out i say for the 3 days we spent with him and then he went to visit family down the country but for 3 days and this is no hesitation it felt like career guidance class. He made me feel like shit saying that the job i have now is shit and although he didnt say this it was like ‘how is that going to support my daughter’ kind of way. 

I work in a restaurant as a sou chef part-time and I’m in college studying IT because thats my career path. 
Which i dont think he’s 100 percent on that either. 

To wrap this up. He doesn’t like the jobs we have now even though were both in college and have some form of work ? Majority of people dont get that opportunity i could work full time if i wanted too. Im in no way lazy which he made me out to be somehow.

First up, the boys. I haven’t asked them yet becuase I am afraid they will say no. There will be six of us and only two boys. They are both harmless and nothing “sexual” or whatever is gonna happen. But- one of the boys played a joke on me (not a very funny one) by calling my mom and asking her opinion on oral. When my mom asked me about it, I pretended like I had no idea what she was talking about but now she doesn’t know what to think about that one. The other one, though, I’m sure I can convince my parents to stay. 

Next, drinking. Regardless of who ends up staying the night, I want to drink. I have enough vodka and shots for us all to get trashed. The problem is, my house isn’t that big.

172,"  I’ve known my bestfriend for years and I think I’ve caught feelings. We’ll call her “Alexa” for now. As of recently she’s started dating a friend I’ve known since fifth grade. (I’m in the 8th grade and 13.) My “friend” which is now her girlfriend, is extremely fake and toxic. She guilt trips people for her benefit and let’s boys get in any relationship she has etc etc. Alexa has a guy friend which I’ve known longer than her, but we drifted apart a year ago. I have feelings for Alexa, but her guy friend has feelings for me. And although I do think the guy is cool and I have leftover feelings for him from a year ago, I think I like Alexa better? So I don’t know what to do, as I have the guy friend and her girlfriend preventing me from trying anything.

 P.S my guy friend used to like Alexa, they dated out of her pity, and I had to break the breakup news to him myself.

P.S I used to like guy friend’s friend, and told my friend (Alexa’s girlfriend) I did. She ended up catching feelings and the news got out and they both ended up liking eachother. AKA my crush and my trusted friend likes eachother. Nothing came out of it though, unless you count the broken friendship between us.

I also can’t look guy friend in the eye, or talk to him irl without getting nervous and running away. ",14Mar2019,1
173,"My (18f) best friend (18f) recently got a girlfriend. I really like the girl, she's cool and funny. But things have been going really wrong in my life lately and I think my sense of humor toward her has been a little bit less... humorous and a little more abrasive. It's been entirely unintentional and I would never want to hurt her or my best friend but my best friend brought it up today and idk what to do. I know I've been a bit of a jerk and even though I've been going through a lot that's totally no excuse. I really value their friendship and if they stopped hanging out with me it would break my heart. But I don't know how to fix it, or even if I can?

Should I talk to the gf about it and apologize? Or just not bring it up and try and do better?
I'm really worried because I'm awkward and sometimes things I say can come off as insincere and I don't want her to think I'm faking it.

Well apparently I angered someone by having it in different subreddits, and the user mentioned something about karma conspiracy or something? I have no idea what this means and I have something like 13 karma, no idea if that's good or bad either. but I was just trying to let a larger amount of people see what I made because I was proud of it. I'm not sure what made them so mad or what I did wrong. I didn't realize karma was something that significant. Is what I did against the unwritten rules of Reddit?

My first stop is to admit to a girl I went to school with that I molested her while she was passed out drunk at a party. I've managed to get her number, and I'm trying to arrange a meeting to do it in person.

Hi All, 

I(28m) need some sage advice or an outside perspective, on what would be the best course of action to take. 

I'm currently working for a pretty decent company, people are nice and coming to work feels like just hanging out with friends as we are relatively free to talk and do just about whatever. However the pay could be better. I've been offered another position elsewhere, that has better pay, but the working conditions aren't as good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be around others I probably won't connect with. And work will eventually become just a place where I spend a block of time each day in order to earn money. So kind of like how lots of other people view work.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my girlfriend(together for a year) at my current work, and it's made coming to work so much more enjoyable. We get to share so many experiences together and that's what's keeping me from jumping at this offer.

&amp;#x200B;

If I take the offer, I would jump a head financially and career-wise, taking on more responsibilities and becoming more senior in my role. I don't really have much need financially, I have a place and I pay the bills, and I don't really spend much on anything else, I don't travel, so most of my current salary goes into savings.

However, I'll be spending less time with my girlfriend. We will still see each other, on the weekends. But we won't be able to share those small in-between moments of life, like banter at work after seeing something hilarious or talking about events that might happen at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure whether I should take it. If I don't, this opportunity might not come up again. 

What are some things I should be considering about my future, career or relationship(s) that I'm not seeing/thought about and should also weigh up?",14Mar2019,1
185,"TLDR at the bottom 🙂

I (22F) tried posting here a while ago, but perhaps I didn’t have enough karma....

To keep things short:

- I struggle with really severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. That affects pretty much every aspect of my life (currently in therapy, though!)

- Jobless, therefore 100% broke. Every job I’ve ever had has left me completely crushed, for one reason or another. Retail sucks.

- Lonely as hell. I have literally 0 friends, and can’t seem to make any more, no matter what I try. I’m really fucking lonely lol

- No clue what sort of career I want. Like, I don’t enjoy anything. I’m not skilled at anything. I have no passion. But I want a degree in... something interesting...?

- Desperately trying to become independent, but I’m too attached to my mom. Don’t know how to be an adult. Can barely order my own food at a restaurant lmao

I guess my ultimate question is what would you do? Does it get better? Is it worth trying anymore? I’ve put so much work into overcoming my issues, but I feel like things keep getting worse. I’m starting to wonder if I should just throw in the towel and give up.


TLDR: Broke, sad, and supremely lonely. Don’t know how to adult. Need advice on how to exist. How do I get out of this hole? Where do I start?",14Mar2019,1
186,"So I've always had depression issues. It's just kind if my day to day thing. I've tried a bunch of shit but honestly I'm just sorta always depressed. It's one of those things that's always there but I just kind of ignore it. Recently I've been off though. 

I think I should introduce myself a bit now that I think of it. I'm a 25 year old mom who tragically lives in her grandmother's house with her baby daddy. Now I made some choices obviously so yeah I've accepted my unfortunate living situation and most times too ashamed to admit it's not my house to the daycare moms but it is what it is at this point.

Alright, now that I put those little intros in now I can get back to how I feel off.

After being a stay at home mom for about 3 years I finally went back to work work. It was a very needed thing. I'm a terrible house wife. It was in December I started to notice things were off. I went from on time everyday to late almost everyday. Now I get paid hourly so when your broke 15 min effects your pay. But I dont seem to enjoy anything at all. The boyfriend baby daddy dude (BBDD lol) we often fight. He does dumb shit which often justifys the frustration but it's like deep down I just want him to get out and stay out. I feel like if he looked at me tomorrow told me we were done I'd probably just shrug it off. I only care about my daughter everyone else could just go away. I often think about getting in the car with my nugget and just getting out of here and not telling anyone where were off to. Like I just want to run away like some pissed off 15 year old. 

Tonight I had to hear how I've missed 2 car payments and daycare is owed money by my dad. Hes an asshole who's right to a point but I have had zero money and BBDD blew through out tax return. He doesnt like to talk about that. God forbid I say anything about it to him he just down and leaves the room. 

I already feel like a useless waste of oxygen. But this house just likes to remind me that I am a useless waste of oxygen. 

-I'm sorry this is all over the place I'm a little stoned (dont judge it made me stop crying also my kid is wary in bed) so I'm spacey-

I'm just a joke to everyone in my house. I'm a shit mom. Half the time I dont even get to parent. I used to back when we had our own place. Now my daughter only wants my grandma. My dad hates that because my grandma has stage 4 cancer and my daughter is 4 and if your know 4 year olds they are a tad wild (no a lot wild). I mean I agree with that but like the kid doesnt want anyone but her. GG is her bestfriend. 

I'm only here because of my daughter. They dont want me. 

Now I know someone is going to go ""you should look for your own space"" 
I would in a heartbeat hell yeah but I live on long island. Our taxes are ridiculous I make a pathetic $15 and hour my bosses wife doesnt want me getting 40 hour weeks so I get 35 hours and approx. 21% is taken from my pay. I make peanuts and the rent on this shit island is between $1600 - $2500+ I cant afford that and daycare which cost $300 a week

So yeah I'd love my own place but I need 4 more jobs to afford that. 

I really just want to pack some bags grab my daughter get her in the car and just drive. Drive till I forget about this family. Just start over. 

I'm a verbal punching bag for my dad. My egg donor stole $200 while she was here and it somehow comes down on me like because I came out of her I'm the reason we are plagued with that succubus. 

I honestly think I have zero luck. I mean recently every time I go to get gas something is wrong with either my card or the pump or the system. Today I had a full on break down at the gas station because I was almost out of gas and needed to go home. 

Oh that's another thing i do. I will sit in my parking lot at work paralyzed because i just dont want to leave. My job is my happy (stressful) place. It's where I dont hear bitching or nagging or being told to go f myself by moy grandmother. So yeah I will sit there and just watch Netflix till I finally get the oomph to go.

I need change but I just dont know what to do. I'm a miserable person to be around. My toxic life has now made me toxic. I'm angry all the time. In just tired of all of this. I hate everyone.

At night I sit in my car and just sit here chain smoking the shit out of my cigarettes. My life is pathetic.

How do you run away with a 4 year old with hardly any money? 

Thanks for reading this. I'm sorry I'm all over the place I'm a tad emotional and I'm just at my boiling point with all of this.

Also my grandma is dying and my daughter loves her as I mentioned they are best fucking friends. That lady pisses me off but shes my family. 
I love my dad too hes my dad I could never hate him. Hes just got a rough personality. Hes not your cry when his baby grows up kinda dad. We arent very lovey in my house. Which works for us.

So for context I’m an 18 year old guy and I have pretty intense/ bad anxiety... I have had sex, but I avoid kissing people at all costs, it’s insane. I’ve had many opportunities to kiss people but have always shy-d away because I’m so scared of not knowing what to do or being a bad kisser... but this hung of not knowing what to do just keeps getting worse the more people I push away, I’m an adult now and I haven’t kissed anyone and now I’m even more scared to be a bad kisser due to my age. I really don’t know what to do and the advice of “just go for it” doesn’t work because I’m so petrified of people realising I haven’t kissed. 

Edit: by kiss I mean make out - and I actually have made out with 2 people but the first time it was awkward and I don’t remember it and I think I did it wrong, and the second time I got so scared or doing it wrong I stopped halfway through the kiss and we just had sex instead. 

Also for clarity: to me sex is way less daunting, I can watch porn to see what to do and I think I’m ok at it. There’s no way I can know what to do while kissing, I’m so scared. ",14Mar2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have an iCloud account associated with all of our devices, most of which are Apple. She sees incoming and outgoing text messages through the iMessage app associated with certain devices. She turned on her iPad one morning after work and suddenly noticed there were new messages in the iMessage inbox from three days ago. They were text messages between my father and an unrecognized number. The content of the messages were almost verbatim in a tone of how he would text; he has a very specific/unique way of talking over text. The conversations were very obviously structured in a way to show that there was an obvious sneaky relationship taking place. There were even photos from my father (a selfie at his work desk &amp; random picture of a road) and a few selfies of her. The casual conversation seemed real but when there were texts exchanged about lewd things, the structure and tone of the sentences changed. It went from exactly how my father would talk, to something you would read in comment section of a porn website. It didn't make sense. Most of the sentences ended in a period, he never uses a period over text. Then, randomly in the conversation, there are three photos of what appears to be this person's daughter, or some random young girl, sent to my dad from this unknown number.  

&amp;#x200B;

The second my dad got home, my phone asked him to cough up his phone and he did so. My dad got really upset/worried and starting freaking out a bit. He swore up and down to everything that he hadn't done anything and has no idea who or what sent/received the text messages. My mom looked in every nook &amp; cranny of his phone and found absolutely nothing. All they had at this point was a first name used in the text messages and the phone number. My mom found a person by that name on facebook who was friends with my dad, but when she had his phone in front of her, she could only see it on her screen, not my dads. This person on facebook was also registering to have only one friend, and it was my dad. It also didn't have a profile picture or anything. They eventually called the number and actually got through to someone. They claimed they had absolutely no idea who my dad was and that they've never heard of my dad or mom ever in their life. They also said they had no idea what they were talking about with messages, because they couldn't see it on their phones. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad spoke with an Apple technician the next day and it was revealed from their records that the messages had been sent from an ""alternative device"" which is a number that sends messages that will come through reading a different number. The number was identical to my dad's except the first three digits, the area code. They tried calling the original number that had been associated with the messages, and the line was out of service. The technician and a friend of my father's both claim that his iCloud account was hacked by someone who was trying to blackmail him and that he probably pissed somebody off. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom says she believes him 100%, and I think I do too, but I've never ever heard of this happening. I mean, that all sounds completely crazy, right?  I'm also worried that someone has it out for my family? I don't understand why someone would go through so much trouble.

198,"I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post on but just need to talk to somebody. This has been a really difficult week and I received some news that flipped my entire family's world upside down. I'm so sorry for this being long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me give some background. I grew up with my mom and step dad. My dad left when I was 3 and moved across the state near his parents. My brother and I saw him maybe twice a year (three times would've been a good ass year but it was rare) when we would go visit him 5 hours away. We would rarely speak on the phone so basically we didn't have a relationship. This was very difficult for me as I wanted him in my life more than anything. I grew up with a lot emotional, verbal, and sexual abuse that I haven't really talked about with anyone. Despite all of this, I went through a lot trying to get my dad and grandparents back in my life, which ultimately never happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my grandparents was a bit better. They came down and visited us sometimes twice in a month. My grandmother often would cry to my mom about how much she regrets everything that happened in my mom and dad's divorce, and how her and my grandpa hadn't been around a lot. My mom kinda just felt like she was coming up with excuses and not changing anything about how things were, just complaining. I always agreed with her about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the middle of all this, my brother came out as gay and changed his last name to the name of my mother's parents, who practically raised us. When my grandma (dad's mom) found out, she disowned him and called him a bastard. This caused a rift between us even further, as I wanted to protect my brother and stand on his side. 

Since then, my brother has forgiven her, and is closer to her than I ever have been. I never really wanted to know her after that, considering that I am also gay and changing my last name. I already knew how she would treat me because of it if she found out. 

I haven't spoken on the phone with my grandparents in years. Unfortunately my grandfather is in a home for Alzheimer's, and doesn't remember any of us. I said goodbye to him a while ago. My grandma and I sometimes exchange texts, but for the most part we don't speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week my dad called and let me know that my grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. When he said those words, it was like everything came back to me. All the moments I spoke poorly about her, all the moments I avoided visiting her for different reasons. And the happy moments too. Flooding my brain. I had no idea how to react. All I could say was, ""I am so sorry."" Over and over. That part of me that was hurt by her and dislikes her is causing me to confuse my emotions about all of this. I don't know how to handle this. How do I put those issues in the past and suck it up and be there for her? I know I am selfish, thinking about my feelings rather than hers. How do I move past this? I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety/panic disorder and have a really difficult time getting out of my own head, and am constantly feeling like I'm on the brink of a mental breakdown. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I really don't want to live in my home country in the future, because of social and economic problems here, which have made it really usafe (lots of violence, crime and no justice or law being respected). Right now I'm finishing my Bachelor degree in Psychology and want to study a Master's abroad and hopefully stay to live work there.    
 
The problem is that I don't know what country would be best for me. I'm considering Japan because:    

+My father's family is Japanese and I've always been interested in Japan  
+Japan has a low crime rate and the law is strong
+There is a graduate scholarship programme for citizens of my country  
+My gf is planning to make her PhD in Japan after studying a MA in China  
+My younger sister (10 years younger than me) wants to study a Bachelor in Japan and I reckon we would coincide at some point.   

That being said I'm doubting because:   

+I've never been to Japan, even though the statistics are promising, I might not fit well  
+Moving to Japan seems difficult visa-wise 
+Work ethic and wages in Japan seem atrocious (long hours, relatively low wages) **this is what scares me the most**

+All four are countries with trustworthy police forces and therefore are relatively safe, also their government isn't corrupt (in comparison to my home country) 
+Work there might be more reasonable (no super long hours, relatively better wages). 
 
So my question is what master degree should I study? In which country? I'm not interested in Psychology anymore, only in Behavior Analysis (a very specialized field that is not very widely spread in those countries, except Norway) there is a Behavior Analysis PhD degree in Norway but I need a Masters first. That being said, I'm willing to study anything I can as long as I can work and live in a safer society. ",14Mar2019,1
200,"sorry if this doesn’t make any sense but It’s hard to describe how I feel, I feel like everything is going so fast around me and I’m like in the eye of a storm or something and just watching the tornado rip everything around me to shreds as well as I’m losing touch of what’s important and what isn’t. I don’t really know any other way to accurately describe it, i don’t think it’s a panic attack because I’ve just felt this way for about a week now. I feel out of it and everything around me is just happening in pure utter chaos and I can’t do anything to stop it even making myself feel productive and like I’m doing things to further myself just doesn’t help at all.

201,So it's this guy's birthday tommorow at work and we have a thing where we all buy each other cakes for our birthdays and rotate who buys the cake for each birthday. I'm new and it's my turn and the guy said he likes plain NY cheesecake and also white cake with white icing. I was thinking of buying both because Walmart has those little cheesecakes with like 8 pieces for cheap but I'm wondering if I can get a plain birthday cake with maybe his name on it by lunch tommorow? How long does that take? And where should I go to get this? There's a publix and a Walmart and a Sam's club near me so I'm looking for advice but I don't have a Sam's membership.,14Mar2019,1
202,"So I have a good friend with a crush. Normal, right? I would usually encourage friends to go after their crushes, ""yolo"" and all that, but this friend is obsessed with this one girl who obviously has no interest in him. 
Obsessed meaning: He saves/screenshots pictures from her snapchat and Facebook. He then uses it as his lockscreen and homescreen wallpapers. I'm not even sure she knows he does this. They are (or were) long time friends, I think he actually said childhood friend. I believe he said they reconnected. So I get trying to get with her after all this time, but that photo thing is creepy. 
He always tries to hang out with her, and she says sure but she always flakes out at the last minute. So far, for the entire 3 or 4 months of them reconnecting and him trying to meet up nearly every week, shes always flaked out on every single one. To make it worse, since he has her on FB and SnapChat, he sees that she hangs out with other people. Its obvious she just doesnt wanna hang out with him. At least it should be obvious.
I've voiced my opinions; The photo thing is creepy if she doesnt know, she doesnt hang out with him but with other people. He has low self esteem, and I know her flaking out hurts him every time, but he still persists on trying to meet up and hopefully fall in love. Hes even choosing her over people who actually showed interest in him. 
He doesnt listen to me, and I hate seeing him hurting like this. What can I say to him to stop chasing this girl around who gives him no time of day.",14Mar2019,3
203,"     I'm on a phone, please excuse the formatting and such.

     Alright so this dude is a manger where I work and last night his gf about caused him to have a bad midshift breakdown. From my understanding his girlfriend keeps him on a short leash and when I say short I mean like over bearing and horribly insecure. Like if you even fart in her man's direction she'll throw out accusations and scream at him.  No kidding, 2 of our servers said hello to him as they passed each other in a dolllar store and he said he got chewed out for it.

     Well anyway last night at work she was blowing up his phone (I think she's like 21 and he's like 28). And one of the things he showed me and my best friend was her saying ""Well if you really cared about me you'd answer immediately."" Now let me tell you, she's done this before to him like one night we starting closing at 9 (since That's the time we close during the week) and she ripped him a new one because she wanted him home at 9. Well as a friend I feel like he needs to leave but my best friend who is a dude was saying ""Oh Well Im sure you gotta work this out."" And ""Well its worth it if the 'bedroom activities are good.""

     I think he's being emotionally abused and my best friend is trying to get me to be friends with this girl....Uh That's a no from me. I mean last night just made me mad, I understand its the one year anniversary of her father's death but that's no excuse to use him as an emotial punching bag. Especially all the restrictions he has and the lack of trust and privacy. Like he's my best friend's good friend and last night was just ridiculous.

   Should I say something next time the subject is brought up or just keep it too myself?

I cant do things fast. tasks that can take maybe a minute or so to finish them, It takes me more than that, like 5+ minutes.

213,"My friend and I are both 17 years old and in high school. I've known him for ten years and we've been best friends for a very long time. We talk to each other about everything. He's pretty shy, but opens up and is incredibly funny once you get to know him a little better. He's never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl. He's a bit overweight and as someone with pretty frustrating body dysmorphia and disordered eating myself, I would definitely say that he has body dysmorphia as well, and he has been diagnosed with depression. I recognize a lot of signs in him that I used to demonstrate when I was a lot worse off, obsessively hiding his body, and talking very negatively about his appearance and personality. I know that self esteem is a problem for a lot of high schoolers, but my friend really hates almost every aspect about himself, and insults himself constantly.

Lately, he's been talking about how lonely he is, how he's never kissed a girl, and how he thinks that his appearance is the cause. He's very jealous when our other male friends talk about their love lives. When someone says he's funny   
or some other compliment about his personality, he usually responds with something along the lines of ""if I was funny I'd have a girlfriend"".

We have a lot of conversations, and over text we drifted over to the subject of gender roles and feminism. He's not a misogynist, but he thinks that talking to girls is very different from talking to boys, and indulges in a lot of ""women don't make sense"" memeing. He says he reads incel forums occasionally, and that he agrees with the fact that romantic appeal is mostly based on appearance. He seems to think that he is arbitrarily inferior to others, and because of this he will never get laid or date someone. He's told me that he knows it's not right, but he can't get it through his head that women have sexual desires or are interested in personality. I'm worried that his idea of women is devolving, and that he's starting to believe that women only date to be seen with hot boys, or that they only want to look pretty for attention.

One problem is that he hardly socializes with people outside of his close circle of friends. He's funny and social, just not to strangers. He only takes the required classes at our school, and only with his friends, and he doesn't go out often. So he basically has almost no chances of making new friends that could lead to dating because he doesn't talk to anyone new. That's (obviously, in my opinion) the reason he hasn't had a girlfriend.

He only has a few close female friends, including myself. This is why I'm so worried. If he were just my bro and I was a man, then I would be pretty sure he would get past this phase and we'd still be friends. But since I'm a girl, I think that if he continues down the incel rabbit hole, it could seriously damage my friendship with him. He's really my best friend and I would be very sad to lose him, but I think that is he keeps thinking these things, his social skills, especially his interactions with women, will suffer a lot. Incels think about women in a very dehumanizing and toxic way and I don't want my best friend to start thinking of me as inferior, shallow, deceptive, or any of the much much worse things that are out there on incel forums.

I also have LOTS of experiences where male acquaintances accuse me of friendzoning them, leading them on, or otherwise deceiving them because I'm asexual and not interested in dating. I know he's had feelings for me in the past, and if he decided to ask me out and I, his closest friend, were to ""reject"" him, this would probably only confirm his ideas that no women, even his best friend, could ever be romantically interested in him. Guys, I don't want to lose my best friend to the incel cult, and he really is a good person, just plagued by a very negative self-image. What can I do? What should I say to him? Should I give him advice on how to socialize and put yourself out there (since I'm good at making friends and have a lot of experience being social)? In the event that he does ask me to date him, how should I respond? Should I just wait for this to blow over and assume that it will with time? Please assist.",14Mar2019,4
214,"I'm probably a horrible person for saying what I said. 

My teacher is an older man, and I made a rather offensive comment about him being middle-aged and having younger children. I said something along the lines of, ""You're so old, you'll be dead by the time your kids are adults!"". Now,  let me explain. My teacher and I normally joke around a lot, but I went too far.

The words just kind of flew out of my mouth, without me really thinking first. I was really tired and cranky and I've been having some issues lately (I know that's no excuse, but it's true). The class laughed, and he seemed (mostly) cool with it.

When the teacher was done talking, I went up to him and apologized profusely. He said that he doesn't get offended easily and acted cool, calm, and collected. He said he forgives me. He reminded me that I'm human, and I therefore make mistakes. He also said that he doesn't care about other people's comments.

I 100% recognize that I shouldn't have said that to him and I completely regret it. I already apologized to him about it, and he seemed calm, but what if I did hurt his feelings?

216,"Hi! I need some advice about making a life game plan for the next 5 years. I'm currently 25 and recovering from anxiety and depression.    

  

I really don't want to live in my home country in the future, because of social and economic problems here, which have made it really unsafe (lots of violence, crime and no justice or law being respected). Right now I'm finishing my Bachelor degree in Psychology and want to study a Master's abroad and hopefully stay to live work there.    

 

The problem is that I don't know what country would be best for me. I'm considering Japan because:    

* My father's family is Japanese and I've always been interested in Japan  
* Japan has a low crime rate and the law is strong
* There is a graduate scholarship programme for citizens of my country  
* My gf is planning to make her PhD in Japan after studying a 2 year MA in China  
* My younger sister (10 years younger than me) wants to study a Bachelor in Japan and I reckon we would coincide at some point.   

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I'm doubting because:   

* I've never been to Japan, even though the statistics are promising, I might not fit well  
* Moving to Japan seems difficult visa-wise 
* Work ethic and wages in Japan seem atrocious (long hours, relatively low wages)  ***this is what scares me the most*** 

 

I'm also considering Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway because:    

* I speak German and lived in Berlin for a semester as an exchange student. I liked it there.  
* Learning Dutch and Norwegian isn't very difficult if you already know German (I could give my all to learn Swedish too)
* I went to Sweden and the Netherlands while on exchange and liked the people a lot. 
* All four are countries with trustworthy police forces and therefore are relatively safe, also their government isn't corrupt (in comparison to my home country) 
* Work there might be more reasonable (no super long hours, relatively better wages).

217,"Obligatory obligatory phone/mobile formatting warning. English is my first language, but I do not care about this post too much. I figure I'll get 5 internet points and a comment that says ""wow it must suck"" lolol.

So, first thing's first, I am young. So young, in fact, that my age demographic is characterised as directing slurs, excessive cursing, and offensive behavior to people because they beat us in a battle royale. I might even 1-2 years younger. I am also very immature. I use this app called Gacha Life with a very cute art style to make chibi-esque(?) characters, I have cried because of a Rick and Morty episode, I still watch gaming/funny videos by The Big Three, I still watch minecraft videos, I think watching adult cartoons is sorta ~scandalous~, and I watch a lot of cartoons. A lot. 

I also have a truckload of issues. Most people stop wetting the bed at say, age 5? Maybe a few years older, but no big deal. I am still wetting the bed. I'm lazy, procrastinating, stupid, reliant on avoidance 99% of the time, and I pee the bed. Name a kid with as many self-inflicted flaws, I dare you. 

All 3 of my sisters need to go to therapy. Not because anything is wrong with them, but because they genuinely need help with depression, anxiety, acting out because of stress and frustration, decaying relationships with our family, etc. The eldest of my sisters is 16 going on 17. She desperately wants to leave, but this might just be that independence thing lol. Anyway, my point is that I got therapy instead of my sisters, who need it way more than me. While they are dealing with genuine problems, my dad put me in because I have no friends.. and then he'll turn to me and say its my fault that I don't have friends, that I'm the Sheldon of the family (Big Bang Theory refernce, ugh). Even then, Sheldon has friends and a freaking wife. A wife. The only reason my doctor recommended a therapist is because she gave me this stupid 1-5 questionnaire.. (the questions felt like ""do you want to die 1-5"" and ""do you have depression 1-5"") and I said 3 to ONE of the questions, and it was ""do you ever feel worthless????1-5"" Sure, i lied on most of it, but say I wasn't. Youre just going to send me to a psych ward because I have more than a normal number of bad days??,, Only went to a few sessions, ended in 2017. More on this later.

I'm not failing any classes, sure. But I'm stupid. So freaking stupid and overweight/obese. I overeat and my dad hates me for it. I hate myself for it. I weigh more than my dad, at around a fourth of his age and a foot or more shorter than him. He also hates me for being lazy, messy, and.... depressed?? Basically, the doctor I go to every several years sporadically for checkups, suggested I *might* have depression. I don't, more on this in a small bit.. Not too long ago, my dad came out of the room I share with my sister very angry. He doesn't yell at me because it's in the middle of the night, but he berates me for having soda cans on the floor next to my bed, which is also on the floor for different reasons entirely. He asks me a lot of rhetorical questions, I THINK ""are you stupid/retarded/lazy?"" was among them, but I know and remember ""are you depressed?"" was there 100%.  i cried after. This turned into a little inside joke between the sister who shares the room with me, where if either of us have soda cans on the floor, we tell each other to ""pick up your mental illness(es)."" 


Okay. Depression and the ending of my therapy. I do not have depression. Sometimes, the attention seeker in me thinks ""well what if you do, you see online that actual depressed people say they doubt it and that its more likely youre depressed if you doubt it"" and then the tiniest and most logical (in a room full of idiots) part of me ""no shut up u attemtion seeker who do u thInk u are"" and the neverending conversation/paradox in my brain continues until i cry because do i even know. so no, i am not depressed. but i have tried to kill myself, after my therapy ended. didn't work because im overweight and it would take all 3 sorta large medicine cabinets in the master bathroom plus some to make me drowsy or a little sick. Didn't work, cried when I woke up. Did it because I thought therapy was helping (it wasn't) and stuff. Whatever.

Don't know what else to say really. Advice on how to make myself a normal person? Functioning even? I won't talk to a soul irl so uh lol. Dont comment stupid motivational stuff, I dont care if im alone or not, it doesnt matter, you can lick my shoes later.

222,"Well, here it goes. My second Reddit post ever.

My Dad died of a heart attack at 55 on Christmas 2018. My Dad and I had a complex relationship and I think that’s why it’s making the mourning process extremely difficult.


Most of the memories of my Dad are from him being too fucked up to help my mom with anything. He was laid off all the time while my mom worked two jobs, got her bachelors degree, and cooked my sister and I dinner every night.

The complex part comes from the fact that I’m also an addict/alcoholic. I will be 10 years of sober September 26th. I saw my Dad in a completely different light after getting sober. I saw that he was broken. When I went to treatment he went shortly after and I’ll never forget what he told me, “It feels like I have a hole in my heart and I try to fill it will all of these things and I never feel better.”

We talked more when he got sober, but that didn’t last long. I didn’t talk to him for a few years. Then I started talking to him again one time a month because I couldn’t handle too much of him. It’s like he stopped growing socially when he started using (19), It was the typical addict behavior, angry, selfish. and thought he was the shit.

As he grew older he started to realize what he did to his family and slowed down on drugs and alcohol. He wasn’t sober but he also wasn’t drinking every day and rarely did heavy drugs. We still had our ups and downs but we were taking a few times a week now. He was just happy to hear my voice and wanted to tell me that he loved me. He would thank me for calling. I would get mad when he would say “you never talk to me” and now I wish I would have called him more.

In the last 4 years he had become a much better person. Our conversations weren’t him complaining anymore. He asked about me and how I was doing and always said he was proud. He was my #1 fan and told everyone about my promotion. I would call him on my way home from work to tell him really good or bad news.

Besides a merry Christmas text on Christmas Eve, my previous texts with him were not nice. I was being rude and acting like I didn’t care about anything he said. I don’t remember our last phone call. I saw him two weeks earlier and we had a great conversation. I’m trying to remember that.

I’ve talked to one person about how I feel but I don’t know them well enough to really get into it. My boyfriend isn’t good with death, my sister stopped talking to my dad years ago, and I can only say so much to my mom. She’s going through her own mourning process.

It took me a month to internalize that he was really gone. Now I try not to think about it because I’ll cry if I do. It was so sudden that there is so much unsaid that I wish I could tell him.

Are there other ways of getting through the mourning process? I bought something to remember him by and I’m going to spread his ashes in a few months.

224,"So basically, let me just explain the background...

I live with 6 roommates in college and I genuinely do not like one of them (lets call her Eve). Reason being is because they are obnoxious and very self-absorbed. Eve will cut you off when you are speaking to them and finish your sentences. She will ask you questions and almost interrogates you every time she will walk into the room. She needs to include herself in every conversation being held, especially when something is not her business. It is not only myself who dislikes Eve, but the rest of my roommates as well.

On top of that, there was a long period where she did not carry her weight in chores and duties. She would sit around while you clean around her feet or even pick at you and tell you that you missed a spot. Very annoying. We had two meetings with RA's about her and how she needs to pick up her slack, which fortunately, she did. But when we told Eve about it without the RA, she locked herself in her room for almost a week because she felt ""hated."" However, from all of this, I have reached a point where I can no longer tolerate her and I CHOOSE to avoid her as I believe I have the right to stay away from situations that I don't want to be in. I spoke to my roommates without Eve and told them my issues I have with her and they seemed to respect that until now. I am not making anything uncomfortable between Eve and I by staying away because even she told them that she dislikes me as well for supposedly being a hypocrite, and staying in my room due to poor mental health and needing to be by myself. Oh well, lol.

With one of my roommates, she would tell me how she is waiting for something to happen between Eve and I. I respectfully tell her that I do not wish to be put in that situation as it is not worth my time and energy. She tells me how there will be a fight between Eve and I and one of us will swing hits. I am not the type of person to ever lay a hand on anybody. When I tell her this, she continued saying, ""Well if she hits you, you can't just stand there and take it. You'll have to fight her back and we'll record it."" That made me upset because she knows damn well that I DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT ANYBODY. I spoke to two other roommates about what she told me and they reassured me that nothing will happen. But yet why does it seem like she wants us to brawl it out?

The girl who wants me to fight with Eve told me that there is a fine line between maturity and hate, which I agree, but in all honesty, I firmly believe that she wants me to blow up at Eve or have it the other way around. She tells me to suck it up and be in the same room as Eve, but I can't put myself in a situation that is dangerous to me and perhaps losing my shit at her. I twitch in anger and being around Eve makes me very uncomfortable and almost nauseous. So now my roommate is calling the same RA to talk to Eve and I which is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what I should and shouldn't say to the RA because I do not want to hurt anybody's feelings. More importantly Eve's.

I respect people's feelings and opinions but I've hit a wall at this point. This is all childish, honestly. It's very draining. What do I do?

225,"So I have always (until recently) felt certain that I never wanted children. I don't really like them and definitely don't think they are worth all the stress that comes with them. My mom had two more kids when I was in late high school that I got to help raise so these opinions are not uneducated. However, recently I have been thinking about being very old and that my SO is a bit older than me and that when I am an old woman I won't want to be alone. I will want people with me and people who care about me and I don't think I will have that if I don't have kids.

226,"I broke up with quite a long term partner about 6 months ago, and have been seeing someone new for about 3 months.

I really like the new person I'm seeing, we get on really well, we have similar interests, they have a great career and a lovely family; there are literally no issues, apart from the fact that whenever I feel like I want to be in a relationship with them, I always think ""what if I find someone better, though?"" even though I really have no interest in even talking to anyone else?!

Thing is, I never thought this when I met my past partner, who was my first long term partner, and I got into a relationship with them after seeing them for only about a month.

I seriously can't figure out why I keep on thinking this and stopping myself from getting into a relationship?

I'm kinda worried about her because cheating isn't like her and her parents are very conservative which is why she doesn't want to get birth control because she's afraid of the consequences. What I'm trying to get across to her is that getting pregnant would be worse than her parents finding a condom but she won't listen. If she gets pregnant her parents will definitely make her keep it and Jodie won't stick Qaround. (We're all 16 for some perspective)

But then suddenly last night she sent me a post, a supposedly religious one, but the line that stood out more to me is that ""countries where women dress ""inappropriately"" have higher rape cases"". I asked her how could she agree with such a post, being a woman herself, but she not only agreed with the post but also restated all of the disgusting stuff in her own words. I used to like that girl, she was this sweet, lively and smiling girl. I couldn't stand this, so i wrote a 400-500 words paragraph explaining what she describes is absolutely wrong and a rape has nothing to do with how a girl dresses, i asked her about those children who are molested by priests and maulvis? She just remained silent, i dont even know if she read what i wrote properly, she just said she doesn't wanna argue and what we clearly have is a difference of mindsets and there is nothing we can do to match our opinions and mindsets. How can she agree with just a disgusting mindset?
Now after all this, dating is out of the question but i still want to correct her opinion, she doesn't wanna talk after this but hasn't blocked me(its what she does when she wants me to apologise) but i am definitely not going to apologise about this. I just want to correct her opinion because my own mother has been through physical abuse by my father just because of the toxic mindset that men are always right and are superior and similar bullshit.

237,"I am currently a freshman at the University of Florida with Electrical Engineering as a major, and I don't know what to do. I was feeling really burnt out this semester before spring break (last week), I was skipping class and spending a lot of time just laying in bed. I hoped that a week off would revitalize me, but I've been back only three days and am already feeling burnt out again. 

&amp;#x200B;

My classes aren't making sense even after I get online help and tutoring. I'm in calc 3 and physics 1 and currently at about a B+ in both, but I suspect I'll only go lower, not higher. Last semester my major classes were calc 2 and chem 1 and I got C's in both. The material just doesn't make sense to me even after multiple revisits. I passed calc 2 last semester with a 66.02% and a 66.00% (no rounding) was the cutoff. I'm barely making it by and if I don't do well this semester I'm in very serious danger of losing my scholarships, and they're the only reason I'm able to go to college at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if UF just is extra hard, I've heard that EE is the hardest major, but I don't even know if it's right for me anymore. It might just be that I'm losing interest and so I'm losing focus. I always have had a knack for intuitively understanding technology, I was often ""tech support"" for everyone. I was in technology related clubs and classes in high school and did very well in them. Lately it just doesn't seem right though. I thought I wanted to go into the automotive industry, I love cars and especially to drive, but I don't even know what I would do. Most automotive engineering stuff is mechanical engineering or software engineering/computer science stuff, and I find calc/physics problems and coding all to be boring and generally unenjoyable. Part of the problem is that I'm in a pure routine that I can't seem to break - I wake up, go to class, come home, do homework, and spend the rest of the night playing video games or hanging out with friends, rinse and repeat. I like surprises and change and I don't want every day to drag out in repetition. Weeks fly by and I feel like nothing exciting has happened in months, it's just the same shit, different day. I don't want to spend the rest of my life doing the same thing, where time passes but nothing really seems to change.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me thinks I should change my major. I've told my parents but they just want me to look at other engineering majors. More math, more coding, more work that I don't understand and I don't want to do. I don't even know what I want to do though, and that was the original point of this post - I have no idea what I actually want to do with my life now. Even if I magically get straight As in all my coursework, I still have no idea where to work once I graduate. I don't have much passion for electrical engineering, or even just regular engineering anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two big interests outside of my (dwindling) interest in engineering, and those are criminology and political science. With criminology, I love shows like netflix's ""dope"" and other crime related shows. I know the real thing is much different, but it's still an interest. Both forensics and criminal justice interest me, I could see myself as a detective or a lawyer. Political science stems from my love of american history (history classes in general were my best and favorite subjects in high school) and I got really involved in american politics ever since the campaigns for the 2016 election first started. For a while in high school I was thinking about constitutional law or flat out being a politician. The american political scheme is currently in chaos though and I don't think I'd have much success in the current climate given my status as a generic white male. I also thought about teaching or educational leadership, but my brother is down that path and my parents don't really approve because they don't think he'll be able to comfortably support a family on a teacher's income. I do love to educate, I tutored and also I ""TA'd"" in one of my engineering classes for a year in high school and really enjoyed it, but all I was doing was the up front teaching. A lot of the teachers I knew more personally loved their students and to teach to them, but hated all the background work the education system made them do.

238,"Just for some context, I just started college this year, and I've always been really shy so I was really nervous about not finding a good group of friends. I'm not diagnosed but I relate to some of the symptoms of avoidant personality disorder– I'm really quiet, and it gives me a lot of anxiety making plans with people, especially if I don't know 100% sure that they like me.

At first everything was going really well– I had a great group of about girl friends, and we started hanging out with a group of guys who I also really like.

Two of my girl friends have magnetic personalities– you know the type who naturally draw people to them/always end up being the ones controlling what the group does. One of them, I'll call her a, started excluding one of my other friends, I'll call her b, randomly by making plans in the group text that she wasn't in. The other magnetic girl, I'll call her c, didn't like a because she seemed controlling and she didn't want to become friends with her. Then another girl, I'll call her d, got in a really dumb fight with a about scheduling a trip (this wasn't necessarily a's fault). There was definitely a rift in the friend group, but for the most part I went along hanging out with everyone. I personally really like a and the group of my friends she hangs out with (everyone except b/c/d). I also like b/c/d, but they have completely different interests from me / I feel like I vibe better and always have more fun when I'm with the a crowd.

This semester, I feel like a has cut me out. She never invites me to anything unless I text her about it, which makes me really upset and anxious because I don't want to lose all my friends. She's always the one making plans. I think she groups me in with b/c/d, but I only hang out with them over a's group because they actually invite me to things (which I am appreciative of). Last Saturday night I cried for hours because I didn't know where anyone was and I didn't want to text anyone because I feel like if they like me or wanted me there they would have invited me. A said that she would text me when she got back from a thing and she never did and I literally had a panic attack. That probably seems dramatic idk but I get really stressed about this stuff.

I don't know what to do and I feel so anxious all the time. I feel like my friend group excluding b, c, and d don't like me, maybe because they think I don't like them. I feel like I don't have enough sway in the friend group to initiate plans, and if I do there's always the chance that a or someone has already done so without inviting me. Overall I'm just feeling really sad and anxious, because I had a great time first semester and I don't want to lose that.

244,"Back in kindergarten standing in line on the way to recess one day a fellow classmate asked if I wanted to play with him. When asking what game, he said sex. I naively drugged and was like sure. Little did I know that a few incidents later that I would be doing something that was wrong. It’s that weird you feel like it’s wrong, but you don’t really know. Games where we’d touch each other’s privates and he had all these games for it. I remember feeling weird about how secretive we had to be about it and how no one else could be involved. I remember the first time really getting that, “uh oh” feeling when a few classmates saw my hand in a certain area, and one of the kids making a huge deal about it. From what I can remember it didn’t last long, but clearly it was long enough. 

In retrospect now that years and years later I remember the incidents, I’ve wondered if he knew what he was doing or was just replicating what was happening to him at home. I’ve never blamed him and or felt anger towards him. Just the situation. Years after these initial memories reappeared...I remembered what really really bothers me about all of this, and it’s where I get in my own head and freak myself out. I tried once, one time what he would have me do to him I briefly tried on one of my younger siblings. No malicious intent, no feelings, just did it because it’s what we did at recess. My brother was asleep, and I do in fact remember stopping just a few seconds in. It haunts me and makes me feel so sick just thinking about it, and typing it up ever for the first time. 

The reason I bring all of this up is I’ve always been a little interested in psychology. I’ve never looked into this, but have heard things here and throughout the years. That whole, “ abused become the abusers” in a lot of situations. I have never done anything to a child, I just have this ever longing fear that what if I don’t know or realize it, but what if it did something to my head! I know it probably sounds crazy. I’ve never wanted to hurt a child. Ever. I just, I get in my own head like did this mess me up? Do I forever have to remember what happened to me in a weird way whenever I hear about child abuse? I get images in my head sometimes when I play with little kids sometimes. Not in a perverted way! Just in a way that makes me remember what happened to me and things I saw and did, and then I get so sick thinking am I or could I ever be an abuser because of what happened? I am not making sense, I don’t want to be attacked for this. It’s such a sensitive subject. It makes me so sick. I think seeing things back when I was little put forever images in my head ...and sometimes it just freaks me out that I even get that image. I think I get them because I worry about me getting them in the first place. Like I’m creating my own “oh my gosh” just beciase I’ll sit there and worry about it. Therefore creating the image...again it’s not a perverted image.  

I feel like I’m going in circles. I just, I’m hoping there is someone out there who’s had this happen and can tell me to just let it go and there are ways to move on. I’ve never wanted to go speak to anyone about it, but maybe process and figure out my struggle and move on. I don’t like the fear and guilt I put in my own head. I overreact and overthink things all the time. Maybe I need to just accept what happened, and know that it does not change or define me. I control my own fears, and move on.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ve never opened up about this. I hope there is someone that can help. ",14Mar2019,1

This stuff can't go to a therapist, I can't be put in another mental facility, Self-harm is not the agenda but finding a medical professional that is willing to hear what I have to say and take the risk, believe that I really don't have that goal, I doubt that would happen.

248,"Hey I’m a 23 year old black female that has been struggle my whole life. I live in Southern Alabama with my mom. 

Down here it is a very Very important to have your own car or some kind of transportation because without it you literally can’t go anywhere or get a job unless your within walking distant of somewhere. Unfortunately my mom never learned how to drive (I believe she’s too scared to) and so it kind of left up to me to learn how to drive. Sadly neither me or my mom are close to family so I can’t ask them help me but my bf can teach me but is driver seat is stuck all the way back and he’s like 5’9 and I’m 5’2 so I can’t even reach the gas. The main transportation I have is a county bus that only runs Mon—fri and from 8:45am-4pm in furter areas in my area they run from 9:30am-1:15pm.
(They’ll pick you up from you home/stop so for example when I get picked up from 8:45 I usually arrive at work by 9:15-9:30)

My situation:
So last year pretty much after endless applications Dollar General allowed me to work there around the busses schedule and I made it clear that I was getting a job to save money for a car so I can be more available for work. The store is also reopening at this time because there was a fired a few months back and a lot of workers had left as well. It was only me and 3 other people at the time so I would work like 5 days a week . Even tho I was making maybe $140 or less a week it was better than nothing cause I didnt have any money before and my mom doesn’t support me at all other than letting me live with her. But fast forward to now we have waay more people and I was cut from 4-5 days a week to 2 days a week. I confronted my manager about it and I said “what can I do to get more hours?” And she told me to get a car 🙃... I want to get another job but I never get calls because I know it’s about my/the bus schedule and I literally can’t do anything about that unless I have a car!! Even when I get interviewed it all goes well until I mention I don’t have a car . I don’t completely understand why they don’t want to hire me but I wished they would give me a chance .I talk to my therapist about it and she really wants me to just go to college but I don’t even know what I want to do in college. And I would hate to waste money I don’t have on something Idk what to do and then wouldn’t my hours be cut more if I did go? 

My goal was to get enough money for a car and then get a better job to better myself and move out because I’m tired of being alone .
It might not seem like it but not having transportation has made my life really hard and restricted me from doing a lot of things .
I just really need some advice /guidance on if it’s better for me to look for another job or to go to college because I really don’t know what to do ?

However, the downtown campus which is the one I need to get to, is a 45 minute commute and is in a very busy area. I may also have to take some electives at the uptown campus anyways, which is 10 minutes away from the downtown campus if I do live on the uptown campus.

After maybe half a school quarter or maybe a few weeks ( I'm bad with dates) but whatever it was I started to hang out again and finally things started to work out and be okay and what not until, after the day of the powderpuff game(if you don't know, it's when the guys play as cheerleaders and the girls play football) everything just went downhill. S started to become mean, passive aggressive, distant, and just idk. She wasn't like that towards anyone else besides me. At first I thought someone had spread a rumor but everyone else in the ""group"" was nice and what not. Then I thought well maybe it's just her being different. So I decided to ask another friend (calling her C) and she told me that She was like this because of a joke or something I did. It was a joke about well I can't remember but it was the tiniest thing ik that. I think okay fair enough. But I don't believe a person should just shut you out because of something so small in scale. I believe if someone is doing something wrong or it bothers you then tell that person so maybe they can try and help or fix it. S didn't say anything about the problem and then gets mad at me for not fixing it. And blah blah blah. We're up today, so at lunch I was already in kind of a bad mood and I don't really remember what fully happened before but I shouted one word because we're were just joking around and having fun I thought but nope (I'll call him J) J decides to get pissed off at me and bring me to the ground basically. I try and apologise for what I did but everyone kept interrupting me so I couldn't. Now S and J are both mad at me and I don't know why. They go to get lunch and a actual Friend (I'll Call him A) and I talk for the rest of lunch away from the group (I can see the group talking about me and stuff and I'm worried they won't tell the full story) and he tells me that one of the main reasons S and J are ""tired"" of me is because I talk to to close. Wtf. I'm sorry for having a habit that apparently hasn't been a problem to my knowledge until now. I'm sorry I'm not the perfect person. Yes I have a habit of talk close I Know. I've been like that for years. I just prefer it. However it has never been a problem neither anyone else. I'd ask other friends and people and they tell me it has never bothered them. So what makes me even worse is the same people in the group do the exact same thing but I don't point it out. Just there's a few more stuff but I dont wanna get into right now. I'm not trying to say that this is all their fault. I fully realize that some of it is mine but I just I don't know what to do anymore about this and frankly I'm getting worried to the point of breaking if That makes sense. If you have any questions please ask in the comments. Any advice or  help is greatly appreciate.",14Mar2019,1
255,"I live in Australia and currently work/study for my dad in his finance company. This arrangement was first discussed halfway through my final year (2018) of high school. At the time, I was too naïve to make a good decision about what I wanted to do with myself and my future. Until this point, my grades were good enough that I would have been eligible for immediate entrance into university, if I chose to do so. Throughout high school I worked for a supermarket and had been saving for a year to pay for a holiday that happened to clash with the start of university (not intentional). This was fine, as I hadn’t yet decided whether I wanted to attend university immediately or take a gap year. I settled on taking the gap year and would resign from the supermarket once I graduated. I believed I was getting too expensive and they may fire me for someone younger. I would then apply for work at a tech-retail store that I had wanted to work at since I was 15. This would provide me with permanent employment, and a part-time work opportunity should I decide to go to university.

Unfortunately, my dad didn’t really listen to what I wanted to do and started making plans expecting me to work for him, but he did so without telling me. He owns his own company and wanted to hire a mortgage broker. He decided that I would be a good fit and made me complete some personality “identifier” thing that he uses, which said that my brain would work best as a finance broker. Except it doesn’t. I can’t stand finance and desk work, I’d rather be doing automotive mechanics or literally anything else where I’m not sitting at a desk. Unfortunately, I didn’t really think of this at the time. I was only told the great things about working in finance. However, being good with numbers I thought I’d give it a shot.

At school, I was under a large amount of stress; having essentially missed two weeks of school at the beginning of the year and trying my best to catch up an immense amount of work for one of my subjects. My dad’s plan began to feel like a golden opportunity to alleviate the stress and earn decent money. (The money is important. I was concerned about racking up HECS debt for uni and being able to pay even a little bit off right away was comforting). My grades began to slide badly because I no longer cared for school – I was getting a free ride to all the money I could want! This was a big mistake on my part. I should have persevered through the stress and continued trying in school.

I flunked all my exams. Every single one of them. I did so poorly that I wouldn’t have even been able to get into university if I wanted to. This didn’t really bother me though, because I was going to “do some study” and then work for my father. I started at his company the day after my final exam. He put pressure on me to start right away, because he wanted me qualified January 1st of this year. That gave me two- and a-bit months to complete the studies and get certified. I regret not asking to start at the end of the exam month, because I missed out on spending time with friends while none of us had obligations before they all started university.

After I started work, I began to find out what I hadn’t been told before. It turned out that my dad had been telling clients that his company was going to be able to provide broking services in the beginning of the new year. He had been doing this before he even mentioned to me that I should work for him as a broker. He’s also already signed all the papers and agreements with one of the largest Australian finance aggregators. He’s talking about all the new cars and stuff he’s thinking about buying that I know he probably can’t afford without me bringing the business extra revenue. It’s even been discussed that he plans on giving me the company to run because he wants to retire soon.

As much as I appreciate him wanting me to continue his legacy of sorts, I really feel like I’ve been pushed into something I’m not at all interested in – for his benefit. I know that if I continued to study, I'd make some of the money I was told I could, but it just means I’m wasting time I could be using to better myself and prepare for university. He’s always had a lot of influence in my life and so I don’t know how to get out of the situation I’m in. I have a feeling that by leaving the company he may totally cut me off, which has happened in the past. The amount of time I’m spending inside the office all day, studying constantly, with little to no breaks is taking a serious toll on me. I’m not as happy or energetic or motivated as I was even while stressed at school, and I feel like I’m constantly lying to people involved in the company. I lie because I don’t want to find out how my dad would react if he found out I no longer want to work for him. My parents are split up, and I don’t think my mum could afford to have me stay with her full time while I look for another job.

Sorry if this is convoluted or difficult to understand. I’m happy to clear things up and answer questions, I just won’t provide specifics like names or exact locations but I’m sure people who know me will be able to identify me. Thanks for any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr – My dad promised me what seemed like a bright future, I made bad decisions and now I’m stuck in a situation that I can’t figure out a non-destructive way to get out of.",14Mar2019,1
256,"This is crazy. I woke up today at 5 a.m. hearing how someone opens house door and enters my room. Also, that somebody checked if I'm sleeping, if I was in my bed. He moved to the end of my room. I couldn't talk, I tried to scream or shout on him but I couldn't. I was anxious and scared to death. But I managed to control my body and stand up. My room is super dark, so it's impossible to see anything. I was disoriented, looking for lights in fear of being attacked. It took some time for me to turn ON the lights. Nobody was there.

Now I know it's hallucinations, but what I experienced was REAL. I am scared to death right now. I'm getting crazy? Unfortunately last 8 months i did trip lsd for 5 times (never did drugs before). But I'm sober for 1 week or so. I regret so much for taking drugs. I didn't knew it's even possible. What should I do?",14Mar2019,1
257,"I [F/19] have been working at the same grocery store for about 3 years now. In the years that I have been here, I have seen so much plastic wasted it is not even funny. We go through so many plastic bags per day it’s actually sickening to me. I know some states like California charge at bare minimum 10 cents per plastic bag that is used to encourage customers to bring their own bags; is there any way I could try and implement this in my store? Where would I even start? Would it even be worth it to try and strive to do this?
Side notes: Grocery store is a main chain in Ohio. Our store is a part of a Union (no idea if this would help me at all). Company is a family owned chain with many stores in Ohio — specifically the Northeast. Finally, I am simply a cashier so I feel like this would be nearly impossible to convince the whole corporate team on why we should charge money for plastic bags.

259,"My best friend of almost 8 years relapsed last week( just finding out about it today) and suffers from mental issues like bipolar and depression. 4 years ago he went to a facility to clean up and has been sober of drugs and alcohol. I find out he’s slipped up and has been drinking and smoking spice and does not want Help. He refuses to reach out to his sponsor nor will self contain the issue because he doesn’t have the will power alone. He says if I call his parents he will kill himself. 


I don’t know how to handle this as I don’t want my friend to self distruct In his non stable mindset but I also don’t want to out him of his life because If I tell his Parents he will loose everything. 

I understand that if he doesn’t get help he will end up down that path anyway because he was a abuser of almost every drug under the sun and will fall back to that. 

It’s important to note that he is suicidal yet states he could never do it  and does not live in the same state as me.  I also believe he doesn’t want to tell his sponsor due to possible repercussions on his job and life. (Doesn’t want to go back to treatment).

261,"Ima keep this short and simple.
I [18m] did something that made my ex gf[19f] really fucking hurt. I texted an ex to see how she’s doing and my girl(A) was really hurt. 
After talking to one of our friends, A started texted me and we have been talking  and stuff, but I can’t hold her or anything and when we did hang out, she kept playing songs that throw shade at shitty men. But I gave her my hoodie and she’s been wearing it since 3am when I gave it to her. I love her with all my heart, but she’s been acting cold and tells me she’s done with me. In my eyes, I know she still has love for me but is also just really hurt. She said “my future husband is going to be older than me” and that really hurt, but I didn’t say anything , just changed the topic. We still talk about hanging out and all, so I just know she’s only trying to make me feel the pain that I made she feel.
I am set on letting her unleash her anger on me slowly but i still show her that i love and care for her and eventually things will fall into place, but my other friends say that she’s not good for me. 
During the relationship I was always quite needy and since she often couldn’t make a lott of time for me, it made me really depressed but didn’t tell her, but it made life suck. I know my worth sometimes and she certainly knows hers, she has a hugee ego and I’m so attracted to it..

262,"Hello. I'm still a teenager and still going through life but right now I feel more lost than I've ever had. This is going to be kind of a jumbled mess between different things so excuse that. Also I may not explain things well and there'll most likely be grammar errors so please excuse those too. I'll be happy to elaborate if needed.

First is my passion. I've tried multiple things over the years such as writing, drawing, mask making and currently its shirt making, which is actually pretty enjoyable for me. Plus playing bass. But I'm worried that I'll never find anything that I'll have that really deep passion over. I've heard from some that you have to kind of make things your passion but I dont rrally believe that can happen. And I'm just worried about it.

Second is my identity. Like everyone else I've gone through phases in the past. As of now I'm delving into punk culture which I feel like is sort of my calling in a way but I feel like its gonna be a phase. Even if I do side with a majority of the beliefs and music and all the other things that punk is involved in. I've always been attracted to punk and wanted to be apart of it. But yeah, I'm worried about it to.

Third, is my future. I have absolutley zero idea of what I'm going to do after school and it scares the shit out of me. My parents aren't pressuring me to go to college which I know I'm not going into it if I dont absolutley have to. But someday I want to have a family and for that you sort of need to have a steady source of income so thats my concerns with that.

This was more of venting if anything but I just need guidance right now. Thank you

265,"About a week ago I talked to one of my profs about something related to my program where I eventually mentioned how in most of my classes I'm usually the only POC in the room. I told my prof about how in one of my art classes they showed a picture of a little POC girl playing in a rather derelick area and all the white kids and class agreed that the narrative for the photo was that the kid would probably die early because of that. Being somebody who is an immigrant and grew up in similar environments, I know that the environment that you play in doesn't automatically say that you're poor, sometimes it's just fun and kids don't really have the same prejudices have. I told my prof about how shocked I was about the incident, but decided not to say something because the timing was off and I didn't want to be seen as the token immigrant in the room. I told her that if I had said something, it would be similar as to not swearing in front of your parents. People will tiptoe about what they say when they're around me, but it doesn't stop them from having that opinion. She said that I should always speak up and all that, but that's easier said than done. The next class after our meeting, she suddenly talked about the importance of taking a stance and speaking out not just for ourselves, but also other people. I was embarrassed, but mostly ashamed.

Today, when I was hanging out with one of my classmates he was telling me a story where he paraphrased a friend and he nonchalantly said the n-word. I continued responding while he was talking, but I was shocked at how natural it was for him to say it. There wasn't a drop of hesitation or lowering of voice, he said it like it's normal. I knew he was from a rough background, but he's white and has no right to say it. I also didn't say anything even though I knew it was wrong.

Sometimes I feel like it's not worth mentioning certain things because I have to pick my battles, and that people are entitled to their own opinions just as much as I am. However, I do understand that certain peoples beliefs can be damaging to others, do I have the right to call people out at all times because they disagree with me?

266,"I graduated with a Masters from a reputable school last May, and I still haven't been able to land a job in the field for which I studied.  In fact, despite applying to every entry level job in that field in the US and in several countries in Europe and Africa, I haven't even received an interview. I've used my alma mater's career services to fix up my resume and cover letters, but it doesn't seem to matter. I've basically lost all hope in regards to my employment situation. Even when friends or former professors with connections put in a good word for me or make sure my resume is ""at the top of the pile,"" I'm not even short-listed.

(Admittedly, there is a lot I should have done differently, but I worked as hard as I could and tried to make the right decisions at the time with the information and advice I was given. I've always been an A student. I did a few internships, worked several paid research jobs, published research, maintained communication with professors, won awards and held leadership positions in several clubs. I didn't do as much as some classmates, but I did as  much as I could. 

It feels like, while I loved my classes and experiences, it was all a waste in terms of achieving my professional goals. Now I have a huge gap on my resume, and to continue to spend my days applying to these jobs without even receiving a response seems like a waste of valuable time in my life. I'm wondering if I should just give up on this dream, and focus on doing something else.

I thought about doing another unpaid internship at a more hire-friendly organization, because the places I did my internships were extremely small and cash-strapped. People keep telling me this is the wisest course of action, and its tempting. Yet, I  am skeptical about whether my monetary resources can sustain me even with side jobs in the cities where such organizations exist. I'm only able to survive now because my parents have been very generous about letting me stay with them. Yet, where they live is far from any opportunity for long-term employment.)

I've become somewhat hopeless, and I think it's starting to impact my mental and physical health. I've been having a panic attack nearly everyday for over a month. I don't know what to do. Is it time to pull the plug on this plan, and pursue a more job-friendly field?",14Mar2019,1

269," So, I've been working at my current job for the last year and during this period I made some good friends in there. The first one is a guy a bit younger than me. We share a lot of interests and he is a great friend to hang out with. However, over the last couple of weeks things have been changing.

 We've got new co-workers a few months ago. One of them is a really lovely woman (trust me this detail is important) that became really close to me and my friend. We've been hanging out almost every weekend drinking beers and talking bout whatever comes to mind. Me and her got really close to the point where we share some of our personal secrets with each other. This is where the problem started.

 A few weeks ago we've had an optional training at our company. I couldn't go because of personal reasons, but they went there together and when they came back, both of them were acting weird. She was getting visibly nervous and uneasy around me while he seemed pissed off at me for no apparent reason. 

 Later that day she told me my old friend was trying to convince her to distance herself from me because, according to him, I have a huge crush on her. I convinced her that I don't have a crush on her and things got a bit calmer, but I honestly have no idea where he got that idea from. Even though me and her are really close friends, I have never demonstrated any romantic interest for her.

 Now, ever since that day, every time me and her are together in the same room he comes running and sometimes just stands between me and her. When we are in a conversation, he makes a clear effort to cut me out of it. Me and him barely talk anymore. We also used to be really close friends.

 It's pretty clear that he is jealous and that he wants to break me and her away from each other, However, I don't know if he is jealous of me as a friend or if he has feelings for her. So, what should I do to revert this situation? I value both of them as friends and I don't want to break away from any of them.",14Mar2019,1

And she can get annoying somtimes. We'll need a name for her so we'll call her ""A"".

So our fine arts program had set up a trip to hawaii to perform at pearl harbor and to tour and have fun at the island. A was also on this trip. When we were all chilling in our hotel rooms until our directors told us what to do, A and i were texting and somehow the topic of relationships came up and out of the blue in our convo she said ""lol i would totally date you tho"". Thinking she was joking, i kinda laughed it off but when it came time for the plane ride home. she was next to me on the plane and mid-flight after a couple rounds of mario kart, she put her head on my shoulder i thought okay she does this somtimes and didnt think much of it, until A put her arms around me and cuddled me and i cuddled back because shes beautiful and i havent received any real affection in a long time. Things startted to get intimate when A started to run her fingers through my hair and when I caressed her face. She put my hand in her shirt (every body else in the plane was asleep) and she kissed me, i was supprised when it happened but i kissed back. For the hour left on the plane we just cuddled and held hands. After we got off and went to baggage claim we didnt say much to eachother but she had her arms around me and i had my arm around her.

When she texted me, I decided to text my sister and ask because I had honestly never heard her mention that before. My sister became upset that her friend didn’t believe her, and asked her friend why she wouldn’t believe her. Her friend told her that she probably just had an std, in which my sister became very upset and admitted that she has been diagnosed with endometriosis. To top that off, her friend started grilling her with questions accusing her of being a liar. My sister became very upset and went home. Now her friend is accusing me of instigating this whole fight because I sent my sister the texts( which was strictly me wanting to know what was going on). I genuinely believe that my sisters friend is an egotistical narcissist who can never take the blame for anything she does, and constantly picks fights so that she can play the victim.

277,"While this has not always been the case, in the last 3 years my ability to find people physically attractive has completely vanished. Consequently, my (previously already low) confidence has taken a huge, progressively worsening hit to the point where I am scared to leave the house. When I've tried to bring this up with those around me, I'm laughed at or not taken seriously. Can anyone else relate to and/or offer up advice on how to overcome these feelings?

To (hopefully) summarise what this feels like, everybody (be they male or female) looks exactly the same to me. No matter how hard I try, I just can't form an opinion on others looks other than that they look like a person (the same goes for public figures such as celebrities, models, etc). On it's own this shouldn't necessarily be problematic, but given that in recent years I've been surrounded by people who spend their days both criticising and appreciating (mostly the former) others appearances, I've become extremely self conscious about the fact that I can't seem to see things the same way. This has left me in a state where I've become fearful of others, assuming that everybody has similar conversations amongst themselves and that I could be nothing more than a point of ridicule. As such, I've since developed severely warped views of myself and cannot see my own reflection without going into a state of panic and despair. I now spend most of my days filled with anger towards myself for a) not being able to tell if I look acceptable to others and b) for being unable to see things as those around me do, and I also harness a lot of hatred towards friends, family, boyfriend and even strangers, for being my perceived reason for such a drastic change in mental state. 

To put into perspective the outcome of these feelings, I became a recluse and didn't attend uni for 6+ months out of sheer fear until just recently. Even now, I am having a very very hard time getting myself to classes. The lack of human contact has left my social skills as being pretty much non-existent, and I now struggle even to make conversation with my parents. This has completely taken over my life. Any reassurance or advice on how I might begin to overcome this would be greatly appreciated. (Apologies in advance if anything wasn't explained as well as it could have been)

Unsure if this is relevant, but I have diagnosed (prior to this situation) asd among other things.

279,"So I went to the hot-tub with my gf today (free one at university). And on the way back she was telling me about this necklace she found at the hot-tub and was now wearing (she started talking about it as she was worried about getting it wet as she wore it in). I was kinda uncomfortable as it was a wooden one and said a religious pilgrimage site on it. I didn’t ask her more questions about it. But I feel I should talk to her about it. Perhaps ask her to put it up on a lost and found uni fb page (if such a thing exists). Then keep if no one responds? How should I bring this up. We are kinda early in our relationship and I really like her. Our personalities really click. But I’m just disappointed that she would do this. Should I let it slide, and perhaps breakup with her if I found this to be a continuous pattern of hers. I don’t think it is but anyway. She is a really respectful person, very friendly and Personable always says thank you to everyone etc.

280,"So I'm 13 and in middle school, this is the only place I could think of that will actually listen to me.

P.S. this is long, and I go to a private school (state edu system is really bad)

&amp;#x200B;

So a few weeks back I went on a trip to another area by plane with my grade. we were staying there for a week and it sounded fun. for the first few days, it's fine but 3-4 days in I noticed that kids were playing blackjack in the cabin with money. (little detail in my state gambling is illegal and in my student handbook the punishment was being expelled) so when a teacher walks by he noticed what was going on and basically cold-hearted told everyone that they could get into a lot of trouble. mind you, I was in my bed resting from the long day we had hiking and I'm just in the room. so during the meeting that night the teachers told all of the gambling kids to stay back and so I did bec they also said that if you were in the room you counted. so they grill us out on how that is bad and Illegal and so on and so on. as a punishment, we had to clean the bathrooms before bed. so the trip ends a few days later and I come home, I tell my dad about it and he says that he got an email from the school saying that I was involved and they needed to do a further investigation about it. so my dad was pissed about what had happened until I told him that I was just in the room and that I had nothing to do with it. he believed me and that was that, but later he and my sister had to catch a flight to Colorado for a ballet competition so I was going to be alone with my brother and mom. the school finishes their investigation and say that my involvement was minimal and that no further action was required. fast forward a little bit and I text my friend in a group chat during school saying something really insensitive to say the least (we like dark humor but we take it a little to far sometimes) and someone's parent who had the app on their phone screenshotted it and sent it to our vice principal and this is where it goes downhill. She tells my parents about it before I even knew about it and they were pissed, I was afraid that I was going to get my butthole turned inside out. so they told me that I was grounded (which I expected) so I accepted it and tried to move on as quick as possible. so my dad comes back and is passive aggressive bec my brother isn't doing well in school and I was acting dumb. we all get through it and I am not allowed to do anything with my electronics (Not really supposed to be doing this but what the hell). and when I think life is going to get on nicely and I'd be ungrounded soon and finally be able to play fortnite my History teacher emails my parent's saying that I'm going to fail his class. bombs went off. my dad was really mad again (Luckily I was at my mom's office when this happened so I didn't get the boom in my face). when I got home he didn't say a word to me so I ate and went upstairs to go to bed to pass this, but eventually, he walks up the stairs and turns on my light. he was angry at me and he wanted to know why I was failing a class so I told him that I didn't know that I was even failing and he called bull on me. he showed me the email that he got saying that I was missing three assignments that were major to my grade. Heres the funny part...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ALL OF THE ASSIGNMENTS HE LISTED HE HAD GIVEN ME A GRADE FOR... A PHYSICAL GRADE

&amp;#x200B;

so my dad finally believes me and says that he and I were going to figure this out and so we email him, so on so on we figure it out and we discussed grades and he says that I'm going to get a 5 in his class which in middle school translates to a B or so. so he freaked my parents out by sending an email and now he tells me that I am going to get a B 

&amp;#x200B;

A FUCKING B

&amp;#x200B;

Any way we figure that out and I feel so tired now, I'm still grounded and cannot do anything, and this is where my real problems start. At school, I had my Wifi taken away so it was going to be hard for me to do my work and so I've been working hard to show my parents I'm not wasting their money like they always say to me when I am not getting A's. And the school said after spring break I would have my wifi back so I thought that I would be ungrounded before then. so tonight I asked my dad about spring break and see if they had off so it wasn't going to be extremely boring and he told me that I could only read. And since I have been working my ass off recently trying to show them that I wanted to stay at my school so I Wouldn't talk to my friends to study and pay attention. well when we play on PlayStation together we make a pack for whatever we say in the chat stays in the chat and so I haven't been able to joke with them because I wasn't playing with them and it makes me feel disconnected. what makes it worse is that my friend who made + texted first in the chat is ungrounded during spring break and from there on. he said more offensive shit than I did and he doesn't care. so I feel like I can't talk to my friends and joke with them. I'm disconnected from the outside world when I get home and I can't talk to anyone. while writing this post my parents told me to go downstairs and while down their my mom asked my dad when I will be ungrounded and he says a few more weeks. I'm dying because Videogames are really a part of me. My fondest moments were playing with my friends online and not having to worry about anything. now I'm lonely and can't talk about it and I feel so alone. and just today I was messing around and was throwing pennies on the school walls and a teacher saw me and recorded me (i know because at the end of lunch I looked over and saw her recording with her phone up against the window).

282,"Okay so this is kinda weird and niche but bear with me:

So, last June, I met a girl (EM) through a mutual friend and we quickly became friends. We both played the sax, were both left-handed, and both shared other similar interests.

One of our mutual friends was a boy (EL) who was going to leave in August (I live on a military base on an island so this is pretty common, I actually said goodbye to a very good friend yesterday). EM and EL became very very close friends in an extremely short amount of time. At the same time, there was this soon-to-be high school senior (TR) who began flirting with EM. She began a friendship with him, and when EL left she went straight to him and they began dating. No problem here, right?

Well, it turns out one of my other friends (HA) also liked this senior and had been friends with him for a long time. She began to distrust EM heavily, and for a while me and some of my other friends saw her as a bitch for the constant distrust of everyone who ever talked to her (excl. me for some reason). This is until EM starts bullying HA just for liking her new boyfriend and this takes a severe toll on HA's mental health. Eventually, in November, the school administration stepped in and made EM stop constantly threatening and bullying HA. And for a while, all the drama was over.

Until New Year's Eve, when TR broke up with EM. A lot of shit went down that night, including that one of my closest friends (KA) admitted their feelings for me (I'll admit, I had feelings for her, too) and we began dating, but that's not important.

Later in January, TR and HA began dating. And, just like that, the threats and comments and hate from EM came with. TR's sister, who used to be friends with both EM and HA, ended her friendship with HA and became friends with EM again, but only through mutual hate for HA.

Now, we (me, KA, HA, TR, and 3-5 others depending on who you ask) have a pretty solid friend group. However, EM hates half of the people in this group and I feel like she may be hating me as well for hanging out with them, and since I sit next to her in Band, it's almost tangible.

Now, up to this point, EM had not directly wronged me, only my friends. In fact, for many things, she had helped me. She helped me challenge the former second chair in band so now I sit second chair. However, this is where things take a turn for the worst.

When I was still third chair, we got a piece of music in band which was selections from the musical West Side Story. At the beginning, there's a short little alto sax solo, which was kindly given to me (Partially because it wasn't in her part and second chair, who also had my part, didn't want to play it). So, a week passes playing this song. I prepare to play the solo and clear the spit out of my sax and end up choking, causing me to miss my cue. The director (TI) stops the band so we can try again when her hand shoots up and she says ""I can play it Mr. TI."" Then she gets it, and everyone forgets I ever played it. However, when I get  second chair, she gives the solo back to me, and I'm back to playing it. Several weeks later, the day of the concert rolls around, I walk into the band room where she looks me dead in the eyes and says ""I'm playing West Side."" So, this crushes me, I had already told everyone I know that I was playing it. And during the concert, she tried to play along with a part the rest of the saxes had, messed up, and proceeded to fucking blame the rest of the saxophones and said we messed up. She also tries to make sure she is the only one with control over the saxes and right now is currently trying to get the former second chair to challenge me.

Okay, so everything is already tense. But it seems like anything she may have had against me may have blown over, as she was very nice to me in class today.

Now, last night I had some chicken wings at a friends house that had been left out for hours and I didn't think to warm them up. I went home that night with a stomachache and didn't sleep at all. So, beacuse of this lack of sleep and pain, my judgement was way off. So, after band, I pick up a staple gun and aim it at her. I had done this same thing yesterday with someone I'm not even friends with and they were fine and we had a good laugh about it. For some background, this staple gun is marked broken and yesterday, it was empty. I keep in a secret little hiding spot  and it was still there from yesterday.

She started freaking out over the staplegun and I said it was fine because it was empty and broken. I began to press the trigger and then the little bit of good judgement I had left kicked in and I decided not to do it. Except that my body was already committed to the motion and I pressed the trigger.

TO MY ABSOLUTE HORROR a staple shoots out and hits her in the face. It bounced right off but I can imagine it still hurt. She stormed off pissed, everyone else there knew it wasn't done with ill will, but I'm fearng for my life that she's going to go tell someone and I'm going to get in trouble.

Later, KA and HA ask me about it and I say I'm going to solve everything. At my school we go home for lunch, so I tried to catch EM and apologize, but she said that she didn't want to talk to me (fair, I mean I did just shoot her in the face with a staple gun les than two hours ago). However I'm still freaking out that I'm going to get in a shitload of trouble and that, combined with what were probably bad wings, cause me to throw up at lunch when I get home. My mom decided to keep me home and I didn't go back to school. 

I typed up an apology to send it to her Instagram only to discover that she's blocked me. I sent it via Skype and email but I can tell she's ingnoring it.

So I write this post here. Basically what I need advice on is:

1. How do I apoligize for the staple gun incident so that she forgives me and I don't get in trouble with anyone but her
2. How do I, once she (hopefully) forgives me, gradually cut her out of my life
3. How do I relax and not let this stress me out as much as it already is?

Thanks so much!

TL;DR I accidentally shot a toxic person in my life in the face with a staple gun and I need to apoligze and then graudally cut them out of my life.

285,"Soooooo kinda weird, but I’m more thought provoked than anything else.

There’s this girl I have a serious crush on. The thing is...we’ve never met or even lived in periphery. She’s an aspiring actress and model—you’ve never heard of her but she wound up on my Twitter timeline and I liked her content enough to follow her, as one does. YEARS ago. And it was just kind of whatever, I’m among her tiny fan base and I like her pictures as she cultivates more as a model and performer.

Today, after just being a one sided admirer of hers for at least half a decade, she follows me back out of the blue, I suppose she noticed me liking her stuff enough and gave my page a look and she even likes my stuff sometimes now.

And obviously I don’t think we’re gonna fall in love, I just can’t help but wonder what someone living life to the fullest would do in a position of becoming mutuals with someone they’ve admired for a long time. Even if it just means a chance to be casual friends. Would it be appropriate to shoot a message saying hi? That’d be hard to do without looking weird, but I think it’d be just so lame to ignore something like this too.

287,"So I have a mental dilemma coming up soon in regards to work and choosing a new job and thought i would pick yalls brain 

Back story is that I have been in the security/EP Bodyguard field since the age of 18, I am now 35, I mostly work here in Orlando, but on a rare occasion my current employer will ship me out to Vegas or Miami region for events. I’ve been part of the mgmt team for million dollar and billion dollar shows and guarded household recognizable names in different industries, film/movie/sports entertainment, CEO's , Diamond couriers, national news story suspects.  It’s been a good 5 years with them and they have given me the opportunity to step into a supervisor/managerial position, but the company as a whole has declined over the years in terms of quality of employees / upper mgmt, and as a result of their decision and keeping bad employees on staff “so that they don’t lose the contracts”…. They have lost some of the big contracts (read: employees who are rude to show attendees or don't follow rules from company/clients, but the company won't terminate them as they need warm bodies to fill the post positions) . As a result of that, there are less shows/contracts and less work for me. To the tune of working 1 day last month and two days so far this month. I consider this company a sinking ship and I want an out. This is a smaller company so the only way to advance is if someone gets terminated or dies and there is nepotism in the offices, and I don’t see any of that working in my favor. I have a 4 year business admin degree, so I check that box when applying for jobs. Graduated from a high ranked private school in this area too so that has helped with networking to an extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

What sucks in my current position is that I only work when there are events or clients contact us, so it’s pretty much feast or famine, I’m either working 105 hours in a week or such as now I’m working one day last month. Thank god I keep some money in the bank to cover bills and emergencies, as it sucks not working since I’m the guy who’s always 150% speed ready to work/ strong work ethic. Also for the past 10 years I’ve been the sole caretaker of my elderly father who’s had medical complications over the years, otherwise I would of most likely taken overseas contracts or moved to Vegas where my skill set is utilized 24/7. since i'm getting older and the body has got some miles on it, i need to trade the adventure lifestyle for something more organized and stable, with retirement and insurance related stuff too. 

&amp;#x200B;

These past two weeks I’ve been applying for higher end security supervisor/director jobs, or managerial based jobs. Something that is a bigger company/corporation and that provides stability while being local to take care of my father. I’ve gotten 2 rejection letters, one interview offer for a customer services manager from a nationwide taxi company, and I still haven’t heard anything from a national defense contractor whose position would require DoD top secret clearance… which would suit me best if they were interested in my resume. It seems in Orlando no one wants to pay decent wages for the physical security industry, and I’m not sure how to translate my management of security personnel into a wider more available manager position outside of security. 

&amp;#x200B;

In theory I have a decent chance of getting this manager position with the transportation company since in the email it said to bring license and SSN card, but from what I’ve looked online it seems their pay is in the 32-35k range, while the national average is higher. I’ve also got a mutual friend who works there and I put his name in the cover letter, but I haven't a clue if that was an influential factor in getting an interview. If am offered a position with this company and they come in low, do I take the position to start bringing in steady income to achieve the goal later on in the year and get out of the slowly failing company im at right now, or do I risk it and wait to see what the national defense company says if they are interested, and if so go thru all the hoops to see what it pays. I feel my years of experience and knowledge are near the $50k range and taking a 30-35k job might be settling/undervaluing myself.  Mind you I graduated in 2008 when the economy took a shit and jobs were extremely hard to find and most any job I’ve had in the past has been by personal or professional reference IE who you know and that I’ve come highly recommended. 

&amp;#x200B;

The slight speed bump in this situation too is that where we currently live is not the best in town and I would like to make about 10-20k in the next 6 months to come up with the down payment for a house in a nice part of town, since my father has been renting for 30 years (yeah I know, that’s a totally different conversation), I say roughly 6 months as that is about the time we would have to resign the rental agreement/ the housing prices in Orlando are getting stupid since everyone is moving here. Well say the house is 200k and I figure the 10-20k will be the down payment/closing/moving, what my father is paying right now (1250) will cover the mortgage/ppi/taxes, and that over the next 5 years I can sink my paychecks into the mortgage and possibly have no mortgage by age 40. I’m already debt free with an 800 credit score by age 35 and helped my mother buy a house too, so I feel I’m slightly ahead of the curve there.

288,"My best friend is an online friend. We've talked everyday for over two years. He's an alcoholic, and during this time I've talked him through being suicidal, panic attacks, deaths in his family, depression and despair. We shared a lot of really intense experiences together, and some really fun, happy, good times. We clicked and loved spending time together, and these experiences bonded me to him in a way I can't explain. I love him, and see him as my real friend. 

He also talked sporadically to this girl that he has some feelings for. He has an on-off relationship with her. He says she's a bad match, she disappears without notice, and she's also an alcoholic. He reacts badly to her, relapses and gets manic when she's drinking, winds up in the hospital or freaking out and calling the police when she's around. She's also an online person he hasn't met.

Last year I had a paranoid episode, for about a month I wasn't myself. He saw a dark side of me he didn't  like. It's like a paranoid, insecure part of me got magnified x1000. He avoided me for 3 months but I wouldn't let him cut me off just because I got sick and he panicked.

He didn't fully relax with me when he came back, he would watch for ""signs"" I was being paranoid or clingy. Started to call me creepy when I was being my normal self. It's like it tainted his view of me and our relationship a little, and made him question my interest in him. I'm married, happily. My husband knows all about him and our friendship. He knows how intense the last couple of years were, and how it affected me. We got back to a normal rhythm with each other though. 

In December, my friend got into a 3 month program and got sober. This was a huge relief. I wasn't worrying if he didn't text me (he had seizures and withdrawals, if I didn't hear from him it usually meant something was wrong).  

He started reducing our time together from a number of hours everyday to sporadically twice to even once a week. He was deeply involved with his programme and I was so relieved and happy for him. He was changing his life and getting better.

He reduced our time together more and more. He would say he was avoiding being online, he was very clear that it was bad for his plan, and he needed to be living in the real world, surrounded with real people, making new friends. All amazing stuff for someone who was hiding indoors for two years with just me for company. I was so proud of him. This was a really big deal for him.

For two months I missed him a lot, I hadn't changed after all, and I was waiting and wondering every day, how he was doing. Is it going well. Who his new friends are. How are his family. All this stuff we discussed endlessly before. It's hard to just have a space in your life that was filled before. 

I'd get occasional tidbits, exciting little glimpses into what was happening for him. I asked if I could share in this fair weather a little. I started to feel like a bad habit he was breaking, and I asked him about it. He said he was just deeply involved in sobriety. 

That feeling kept building though, if there isn't a space for me in his sober life, then what future is there, right? I become associated with relapse and bad experiences, maybe I drag him backwards? So I wrote a little upset and offered to bow out. He replied asking me to be patient. He hasn't written to me since. 

I wrote to him a number of times, but he'd left where we chat. In the end, I tried our old chat location (that he said he was avoiding since it was bad for those recovery plan). My message delivered, meaning he was signed in and online. I looked at the girl he talked to, and she was online too. 
He had lied about avoiding being online. He had compromised his whole program, his health, his sobriety. I was so mad at him for that but I was so hurt for me too. I called him an asshole and a liar, and haven't seen or heard from him for three weeks now. 

I feel like I was just disposable, used when I was needed, discarded when I wasn't. My heart hurts, because I let him into it and miss him despite it. I'm tempted all the time to write to him all the time, but I've managed not to.

I'm torn between thinking on one hand, I'm his friend, I shouldn't just abandon him because he's doing stupid stuff. And on the other hand, I'm his friend, I've been there through thick and thin, didn't he value me at all? 

Kudos if you've read this far. Maybe I am just whining and looking for sympathy. Maybe I need a kick in the ass. I don't know. ",14Mar2019,1

\- Magical thinking (Example, ""if I don't do this something bad will happen"")

\- Low empathy

\- I am extremely socially isolated, and I did this on purpose.

\- I have little desire for more than one or two friendships

\- Under extreme stress I have experienced disassociative amnesia, but this has only happened once

\- I hold extreme grudges with a lot of anger that are kind of obsessive

These are just traits that I've noticed that are outside the norm that cannot be explained by my current diagnosis'. I know this is a complete clusterfuck but please give me your opinion because I'm not sure how to articulate this in real life.

297,"Throwaway because friends and family know me

I feel like theres something wrong with me. Not exactly sure what but i don’t think that this is normal for someone my age to be experiencing. 

I’ve dealt with depression a good chunk of my life, maybe like 1/3 of it, so I know what things are normal for me and what are not. There are a few things that really make me thing there is something wrong, to list a few

1) I’ve been on a rollercoaster of emotions lately like sometimes id be happy and really annoying and just a ray of fucking sunshine, but most times i get really down. My friends always ask if I’m okay because my mood could suddenly just plunge into a deep pit of misery. I feel guilty and worthless all the time too. (i guess that is the depression part)

2) Sometimes I feel like I’m observing my physical self instead of actually doing what I’m doing. Like with assignments, i could be focused on it but, a second later, I feel like I’m not actually doing it yet I see myself doing it. (idk if that makes sense)

3) I feel like someone is watching me??? I’m not sure but it just happened today. I’ve been stuck at home (stayed home from class) because I felt incredibly empty yesterday so I decided to “take the day off”. As of late, I’ve been hearing weird things around my apartment but I chalked it up to neighbors. I just can’t shake the feeling of someone being here with me. So I decided to sleep over at someone’s house this weekend. 

4) I’ve been crying a lot lately but I don’t really know why. I wish I did so that I could fix it but I really don’t know. Every night that I lay in bed, I cry. 

Some significant things about me:
I am a timid girl that lives by herself, I am attending college, I experienced major changes in my life late last year, and I’ve also been feeling extremely worthless and also a nuisance to everyone around me. 

at the moment, I am not taking any medication to treat my depression. 

Essentially, I need advise on what to do now. Could this be normal and I’m just overreacting, or should I seek help? ",14Mar2019,1
298,"Hello Reddit,

 I'm a 5th grade dropout. I'd rather not get in to the details pertaining to why, or how. I will say nobody in my life currently knows, and I've never told anyone. It causes me to feel ashamed and inferior.

  I'm 19 now, working 15-25 hours a week in retail. It's made me realize I don't want to do this for the rest of my life, and I'm finding myself confused about what to do from here. 

  I'm wanting to get my GED, but I'm terrified of failing. I don't know if I'm intelligent enough to pass it, or if I'll ever catch up on everything I've missed. I'm absolutely horrid at math.

299,"So I'm a little conflicted at the moment. I'm 25 years old, soon to graduate with a degree in computer science and I want to start looking for a new job and leave my childhood home as soon as I can. I'm from the Hampton roads area of Virginia and there's just not many tech jobs available around there, on top of a good many personal issues with my family that are.... probably better for a different advice post. The thing is that I'm really not at all sure how to even begin thinking about leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

First off I'm not even sure about the places I would consider moving too. I've thought about Washington State or Texas because of how big the tech industry is around there, I've also hear that Canada has a thriving tech industry which sounds nice given that I do enjoy the cold and have hear wonderful things of Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even with that where do I begin? Do I put in applications to far off places get a job and then plan a move? Do I move first and ask questions later? Do I seek a room mate or is it better to save up and live in a solo apartment at first? I've heard many people will move in with close friends starting out but most of my close friends have already moved away and live with fiances, and my social anxiety and heavily depressive bi-polar make meeting new people rather difficult at this point in life.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that I'm not even sure where to begin looking job wise. I'm soon to have a bachelors in Computer Science, also working towards a COMPtia cert in security, three years of experience in a network operations center and as tech support, and a lot of personal study into game development, several years of personal experience in community management and moderation... Theoretically everyone tells me that I should be able to find a job anywhere but I'm really not even sure as to what levels of positions I'd be able to apply to right out of the gate. My biggest interests lie in cyber security and game development, which kind of feeds back into the moving aspect because I'm not really sure what areas are most likely to have jobs in those fields available.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone offer any advice on any of this? What areas are worth looking into for jobs like this in both the US and Canada. How to best go about making such a massive move when its very relevant to ones mental health to leave ASAP. Any extra advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Mar2019,1
300,"Looking for advice from anyone, but mostly from people who either:

1. Live further away from their work (50km+; 30miles+);
2. Have longer commute times (~45 minutes to 1 hour one way, up to 2 hours daily total or more);
3. Live in a rural area and work in a city;
4. Are legal profession workers that have managed to arrange work from home;
5. Want to give me a mean reality check (I'm very open to roasting criticism).

Life has come to the point where I, together with my SO, have weighted our options carefully and can confidently say that we:

1. Do not want to rent our home (rent costs have exceeded actual mortgage fees);

2. Do not want to live our lives in an apartment;

3. Want to live in a house further away from civilization and people (i.e., preferably in a house from whose windows we cannot see any other houses or people);

4. Live in more of a homestead type of home with plenty of land (~4 ha or 10 acres).

Each of these conditions obviously have their pros and cons, but this is not what this post is about.

The issue is that we live in a ""single city country"", which means that about 70+% (and perhaps even more) of our nation's commerce is centered purely in our capital. There is very little money in the rest of our country's 60k square km (20k sq mi). I'm a qualified and educated while collar worker (Lawyer), which means that realistically the only place where I am able to get a well paid job is the capital. Technically I could find a job outside the capital, but it's not something to rely on. From experience, lawyers can have some room for working from home, but it's not something you can surely expect or depend upon and it's very rare. Mostly we are expected to be on the spot, but this depends on several factors.

That being said, we're looking at properties in a band between 30 and 60 km (18 and 36 miles) away from capital. Because this is the zone where large land becomes affordable and commute is still manageable. Anything closer is either 500 square meter (0.1 acre) large grass square land crammed homes where all you can do is set up a grill and plop down a rose bush while the neighbors peek over you, or very, very expensive. And anything further out seems to be too much commute.

We've found this one particular property. It's a beautiful house with beautiful land for an extremely, extremely reasonable price. Everything is perfect. Even the location itself. Except for the fact that it's 75km (45mi) from the center of our capital (about 60km (37mi) from the border).

We've done a lot of expenses math, thinking and tailoring, we're overall fairly confident and serious about this, however I need a reality check on commute time.

We're seeing that driving the 65km one could manage in about 45 minutes at 90km/h highway driving limit (less if we go 100). We're thinking that there's multiple ways to go about this and mix it up. Sometimes I could go by myself with car and listen to podcasts and audiobooks. Sometimes my GF could take me while I watch Netflix, play videogames on a laptop or sleep, sometimes I could take the train while I read books, play videogames, listen to podcasts or watch videos/TV/movies on a tablet. We could look for other people in the are that want to regularly rideshare with us and sometimes drive them, sometimes be driven by them so we can multitask.

Commute is time you'll never get back at the end of your life. So 1.5 hours to 2 hours daily does seem pretty bad, however, I'm thinking it's possible to utilize this time in a useful manner. Instead of browsing reddit from home, I'd browse it while I commute (assuming I'm not driving). Instead of watching TV on weekends, I could watch it while I ride the train.

What are you thinking? Is this realistic or not?

One essential factor is that currently I live in the city, but since I live in the South, my work is in the North and I can't use my car to drive to work (no parking), I use public transport/walking, which ends up in about 1.5 hours of daily commute ANYWAY. I'm switching jobs soon to somewhere where I could park. While in the new job I could commute in 15 minutes (one way) with my car, I could also commute in 45-ish minutes from the house that is 75 km away, which wouldn't be a change from what I'm used to now.

I’m the only one who has a car and I genuinely like to be able to take road trips and be helpful if someone needs something. I love to be there to lend a hand. I always talk about asking them to chip in for gas and they always say they will, but I’ve never gotten around to it.

Today I was in a bit of a crunch with a low tank and asked them each for $5 so I could fill up the tank before I picked them up for dinner. Two of them said they would pay me later when they had more money and one of them flat out said no. They all proceeded to spend at least $5 on Chinese food and I admit it, I cried out of frustration after dropping them off at their condos. $5 to me so we could physically get where we were going was not worth it but a few extra egg rolls were. 

I’m not the type to punish them or “get back” at them in any way. My feelings were genuinely hurt, they know this, and I’m sincerely considering driving them less. It’s almost always out of my way to pick them up and drop them off and there are plenty of other options to get around. It would also put a lot less wear and tear on my car since the potholes are legendary in my city.

304,"In terms of life, I'm really not that far along. I kind of shit through my high school years, I was 250 by the time I graduated, and by the time I was 19 I was over 300 lbs. I've jumped a lot of jobs here and there, and after my 1989 Toyota Corolla was totaled I bought a brand new car thinking that I'd be able to do Uber, make bank and survive on my own. I've had it for 14 months at  this point and when I crunched my numbers again and did the math, I realized that I was putting 1400$ a month into the vehicle (360 for payments, 560 for insurance and the rest on gas) , and that if I wanted to get back out of my mom's house that I needed to get rid of it and find a different Job.  


That brings me to where I am now.  


I live south of the Seattle area. In Seattle the minimum wage is 15$ an hour, which is amazing. The area I live in has a minimum wage of 12.35$ an hour. I've found jobs in both areas, and I'm conflicted in which to choose.  


The Job in Seattle is the one I want to go with. It's an Escape Room job, and as someone who's DMed for D&amp;D before, it seems like something that would be right up my alley. I know I'd enjoy it and I'd be happy. It's also a 2 hour bus away from where I live, as well as on call until training was done and part time until I could be fully trusted running things myself. In the long run, this job would pay me more, after taxes about 2200$ a month once I get through to having enough experience to lead. But to start I'd be making 1400 or less.  


The Job in the area where I live is a Fast Food job that's a ten minute's walk from where I am now, and I would get immediate full time. No questions asked. I'd only ever make 1800 working this job.  


The reason why me mentioning my weight was important, is that over the past 5 months, I've actually been losing weight. I'm 21 now, and my highest weight was 358. After months of trying my damnedest and working out while avoiding as many triggers of my food addiction as possible, I've worked my way down to 311. Fast food is one of my largest and hardest to ignore triggers. I'm afraid that the exposure will ruin all the progress I've made to bettering myself for the future, but my mom wants me moved out by the end of May.  


I'm terrified, because I don't know what's best for me in this situation, and I'm terrified to make a choice. But I know I have to, because if I don't a choice will be made for me, and I'll regret not choosing which way to go. I've tried asking my parents for help, but my Mom doesn't care so long as I'm out by the end of May, which is only making me more stressed about the situation.

Hi!
I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a few years now, we are long distance so we see each other every two months. We are moving in soon and I was wondering what the best way of removing hair would be.
Now I wax every two months and when I get back home, I leave my hair alone.
I know I will have to get in a routine of doing is consistently, and I am really not used to this.
I know waxing will have to be a certain length and I don’t really feel comfortable growing out my hair for two weeks while I live with him. 
What is your routine when it comes to shaving/waxing/any other methods?
Do you have any advice on what NOT to do?

There is more detail in the /r/relationship_advice post and the chance to give advice if wanted.

I had an abusive ex who believed I was cheating on him with a friend, and then turned verbally abusive. After breaking up I wound up being with that same friend as he helped me heal. However, my ex had sent me into a spiral of despair and depression that made me miss class and eventually lose my eligibility for my scholarship.

After learning I lost my funds to attend school, I turned hysterical and immediately blamed my ex for it. I sent an email blaming him for essentially ruining my life. To my shock, he replied in the same day and we exchange a few emails. We then called on the phone. He apologizes for everything, says what he did was undeserved, understands why I would blame him and says he had been going to therapy to reform himself. However, he still thinks I cheated - I don't argue it. The call ends on a good note, including the agreement to never speak to each other again, and it felt as if I had gotten real closure.

I immediately tell my BF what happened (a policy of keeping our feelings open in order to prevent history repeats). Understandably, he needs time to think. We don't talk for a night, but in the morning he says he consulted close family and trusts that this was a good thing, even if he felt hurt that I contacted my ex instead of him. But, he had already forgiven me and is happy that everything turned out good.

This happened months ago, but it came up again recently in conversation with friends.

My friends say I'm an asshole to my BF since I reached out to my ex. They believe I had severely hurt him since talking to an ex is one of the worst things to do in a relationship. I agree with them and feel guilty that I had hurt my BF by not thinking of him for support first. My very weak argument is that the stress of the situation clouded my judgement - I wasn't thinking right. But in honesty, I am very glad the call happened as it answered many questions for me and gave a little solace in the wake of knowing I can't complete my degree.

I haven't told my BF about this conversation yet, and in the months that passed between that call, nothing has felt different. He has continued to be loving and he never hinted at being unhappy or disappointed at what I did. However, considering this is a LDR and that there are things that can't be conveyed through text alone, I could be missing something. I plan to speak to him and ask again if he is honest so we may have the chance to open a conversation.

tl;dr: Blamed abusive ex for sending me into depression and making me miss classes that eventually lost my scholarship. BF knows I reached out and forgives me, along with thinks this was a good closure. Friends do not. Did I mess up?",14Mar2019,1
316,"I hadn't seen my friend in well over a year, mainly because she needed a bit of alone time. We used to bicker and argue, but we matured a lot over time, so we rarely argue, and a lot of the time we only do it to joke around, and poke fun at each other. For the past year, I would always think about her, and how much I missed her. I missed when she'd eat my food, and when she tried to rest her head on my legs. It made me really upset not spending time with her. My initial thought was that I missed her, because she was my friend, but it wasn't until she finally came over after that year. It was like seeing an old pal. We both matured. We are both really different, she's more of a punk rock kinda girl, and I'm more of an old-fashioned girl. Her personality is more grungy, meanwhile mine's more like a innocent little bean. It used to really annoy me when she'd curse, but when she was gone, I realized that was her charm. I couldn't ever get over how badly I missed her. I had a not in my throat, and my stomach and chest felt weird. When she came over, I felt hot. My face was as red as a tomato. The feeling was 10x worse. I was sweating, and stuttering. I could barely make eye contact with her. Everything she did was there the whole time, but I was just now starting to appreciate it. When she'd speak, my bones felt weak. I felt like I was melting. I was really thirsty. I remember she'd talk about her boyfriend dumping her, and I felt unusually happy. I was upset for her, having to go through a break up, and all, but I just felt at ease from her being off the market. I felt the urge (But didn't) to hold her hand, and wrap my arm around her, even a high five or hand shake. I just want her to be by my side forever. I even lay awake at night imagining sharing a house together, and I cook her breakfast in the morning, and knowing no man could ever hurt her again. (There's nothing wrong with men, men are great, hard working) Everything she does amazes me. She doesn't know how to play the piano, and she saw my piano, and asked if she could play it, and she spent and hour or so at the piano playing in the wrong key, and messing up multiple times, and wasn't doing a good job at all, but she looked so cute sitting there trying. It just made me all stuttery, and like I was awing on the inside. I couldn't get over how adorable she was. When we were playing just dance, I found myself spacing off, looking at her, and her pretty blue eyes. I don't know what to do anymore. She's not into any girls as far as I know, and I've been closeted for years, fearing that she wouldn't want to spend time with me, because she would assume since I'm lesbian that I have a crush on her. Which, I'm afraid I do, but I try my hardest to hide. She calls me gay all the time, and refuses to call me straight, because she thinks that I am gay. Which I am, but I am closeted.

Over the past couple of months I started being ""lazy"". I do less and less stuff, I go to university very rarely (max 6 times since the semester started), I dont work on my assignments, I barely know what I have to. I stopped talking to all my friends, I contact my family maybe once a week.
Sometimes I do some small talk with my flatmates. I leave the house only if it's super necessary.
The only thing I do all day, every goddamn day, is listening to music, stare into space and imagining a better life. I fantasize all day about having a great career, meeting the love of my life, doing things together. And I make up all these scenes in my head and everything looks and feels so great that I do it for hours on end. And when I think that it's weird I just brush it off and keep dreaming with my eyes open.
I honestly don't want to live, because the life I make up in my mind is much better. I'm tired of being hurt, and in my head there's no one who would hurt me.

In December I went through an ugly breakup: my ex and I were living together, everything was fine until he suddenly (October, start of the semester) started being distant and uninterested in me. This went on for two months and I tried to confront him and solve the problem as nicely as possible but he would say that there's nothing wrong and that I'm crazy.
After my suicide attempt (unrelated to the problems in our relationship) he stopped talking to me altogether. After a week of him not speaking to me I had had enough so we sat down and talked. He broke up with me that night, saying that he is not ready for a serious relationship.
He had asked me multiple times if I'll want to marry him and build a future together, which for me was awesome, I was so happy, and I was so happy that he wanted these things without me bringing them up.
After the breakup I saw him with another girl and I had a weird gut feeling. I took all my stuff and moved that day, leaving a huge mess behind.
Turns out he was seeing that girl since October, slept at her house multiple times while I was at home worrying that something happened to him and left me for her.
Everything suddenly made sense, and apparently I don't even deserve to know the truth.",14Mar2019,8

321,"I’m a cook in a major casino kitchen in Las Vegas. My chef wants to promote me to sous chef (basically assistant manager).

I do want the position, I want to get management experience on my resume at the very least. However, my roommate and long term financial partner is a coworker, I work along side her every day. We co-own our house and car together, and plan to be together for life (it’s an odd situation I’ll grant you, but we have a much better life together than separately.). We have no romantic relationship, and no blood relation other than through marriage (she is my wife’s half cousin). 

My chef knows all of this, and is working with upper management because he really wants me for the position. His plan is to have me on another shift so I’m not her direct supervisor. 

My big issue is that he’s telling me to keep my mouth shut about being her financial partner, and to say that we’re roommates only. 

As far as I’m concerned, I’d rather lose a job before I get it, than after. I plan on speaking to upper management about the entirety of the situation, and if I make my boss get caught in a lie I’d rather he get in trouble than myself or my roommate. 

My policy is something my dad always said, “Nothing can bite you in the ass if you keep it in front of you for all to see”

So, should I talk to upper management and potentially fuck it up or go with the flow?",14Mar2019,4
322,"i am an 18 year old guy, and feel really terrible. I have been seeing this girl (who is a year older than me) over LDR, except... that it wasnt ever coined a ""relationship"" at all. She always made it clear that we could see other people, and that hurt me because it made me feel like she didnt take it to heart. I would always be left with this feeling that ""one day, she will be ready for me"", and that it was just a matter of waiting. DEEP down i was never into this idea, and it really killed me sometimes to think that shes been much more into other guys in her life (at least enough to actually BE with them). I feel sub par in comparison. If she doesnt want to commit to me now, is it insane of me to just wait till she does?  Both of us are commitment-phobes. so, i get it, and i care a lot about her, so thats why ive tried to think more like her and try to be OK with this. Ive even gone to see her a couple times. Ive never been into the dating scene because i am very selective in who i choose to pursue romantically. But its hard for me to really engage in ldr, because i just LIKE being in person with a girl more. i dont know why i thought i could be happy with a ldr, but i pursued her anyway because i really liked her. Over the past year, we never really texted throughout the day, and if we did, it was very short and bland. Sometimes if i did message her id usually get ignored. But, whenever I would ask about it, she would kind of brush it off. To be fair, i get VERY insecure. I say crazy things. Not just with her, but with any girl ive been with. My main insecurity is about not being enough, and it makes me wonder if people really like me or if they have to really *try* to like me. Id ask her multiple times whether she wanted to be in a relationship with me, and id either get ignored for being too insecure, or told no. She doesnt want a relationship, but she still wants me around. I dont know how to feel about that, seeing as we live so far apart and i cant afford to see her much anymore and vice versa. If i move on, she will probably be very very hurt. Sometimes i want to stick it out and wait, i really do, because i feel like im throwing away someone who genuinely loves me, and who i care so deeply about. But i cant get over the feeling of us not ""sharing the same world"", because we live very separate lives, and are pretty independent by nature. I feel so bad for wanting to run away (again), but my gut turns everytime i think of waiting for her to ""want me"". I dont think i really understand love, maybe. I feel like she doesnt love me ENOUGH, and i dont love HER enough. Those things dont change in time, do they? I always feel like im not enough for her, and that im just a huge drag. I dont feel mature enough for relationships yet, is that dumb? ",14Mar2019,1

324,"Hey guys! 
I have a Friend, who moved to the US a couple of years ago for higher studies (For reference, we are Indians). 

We have been great Friends for almost 15 Years now. He has had a few friends in his life but not that many or not who he can call CLOSE ones. So i have been one of his Best mates for better part of his life. 
Ever since he moved to the US, he hasn't made any real friends and he still relies on me for every advice / Sharing anything he wants. 

He literally calls me everyday and keeps on talking about random things (Specially how he got drunk the last weekend or how he is having a beer at 10 in the Morning). Most of the time when he calls, he would NOT hang up at all, i have to make some excuse so that i can get off the phone. I hate talking on the Phone for long time (Pretty sure many people do) but this guy can't seem to stop calling me. 

Although we have been amazing friends for as long as i can remember, i just hate this habit of his. For few months now, whenever he calls i just let the phone ring and never pick it up. He still keeps calling me almost every single day and texts me about random things, sometimes it's really cool photos of Cars that he is working on (He's studying to become a Mechanical Engineer) and sometimes it's random photos of Snowy weather. The Moment i reply to any of his Messages, he immediately rings me up expecting to continue the conversation over the call. 

I feel very bad not answering his calls but i don't want to spend hours talking over phone about an Uninteresting conversation. Over the top, he is now talking about me moving to the US for my Higher Studies so that we hang out and go on an Epic Road Trip across the USA. 

I understand he might be lonely since he is in a new place but i seriously can't seem to figure out how to handle this situation. 

tl;dr : I have a clingy friend who can't stop calling and talking nonsense for hours, hence i have stopped answering his calls, and now i feel guilty. ",14Mar2019,2

328,"There's a girl and I dated her she was before that my best friend for 5 years. Although this was a big mistake it made some of my best memories that I remember vividly. We broke up and knew we wanted to be friends. We gave each other so much space that she got another boyfriend. He's definitely not her type but is blind to the fact he treats everyone like shit, and sometimes her. They only hangout with each other never anyone else and it annoys me. 

We are off and on sometimes she normally says something and I've done so much for her. I drove her home when she had a killer migraine. ""Stole her car"" so she didn't have to drive it home the next morning. I've picked her up at the airport at 12:00 AM and other stuff. That no 16 year old should do cause it's considered ""too much time for a girl"".

 Anyways my thing is, I'm stuck and confused. I want to be friends so bad it keeps me up at night. Thinking of some mistakes I think she's made and realising what we had is lost. She still says I'm the sweetest, and touches my arm in the hallway smiles and such. I try to make our interactions super friendly and fun. I need to forget her but it's hard ya know?

My older brother has been living with my boyfriend and I since last July. I was happy at first since I hadn't seen him  for two years prior to him moving in. He kinda moved in by coming down for a ""visit"" and never leaving.  Some more context is that he usually has unstable living situations and even moved back in and out of my mom's place within a span of  two years when I was living with her. This even effected me at one point since I was looking for a place to stay and he told me I could stay with  him. Literally the day before I was supposed to move  in with him, he called me telling me he lost his home that he shared with his friends. At the time I was so upset and stopped talking to him  for a while.  


He's not at all responsible but I think that has more so to do with the type of autism he  has and I felt terrible since I knew people found it easy to manipulate him. (old 'friends' of his would do this a lot but he's very manipulative himself). Nonetheless, he was able to live here without having to pay any bills for a while. And at the time I left my job due to personal reasons rendering me jobless for a while. That meant it was left for my bf to carry the burden of rent and the bills as well as groceries. Whenever we needed help we hesitated to ask him since he wasn't willing unless it was on of the bills close to being cut off.  After a while we got back on our feet and  we told him he was able to start  saving to move out. In December I told him he had till  the end of February to move And started  asking him for 100 for groceries, which  we'd often have to beg for And sometimes he'd give us attitude on which is ridiculous since he got paid every week about 400 dollars. And though he ""struggled"" to give us grocery money, he was more than able to buy himself takeout food, junk, a gaming PC and about a week ago he even bought himself a Ps4 pro.  


Okay so to the night in question, Tuesday  night I made dinner. There was enough food for at least 5 people to eat. There's three of us but my brother and my bf tends to eat seconds so I figured it'd be okay. I kinda messed up my sleep schedule due to me not feeling well as of late. So I helped my boyfriend cook and went to sleep without eating since I was tired. My boyfriend did fix me a plate however I was too tired to eat telling him to  eat the food and I'd just eat later. He ate the serving that he made for me and left it at that. About a few hours later I wake up to my stomach growling since I have a habit of only eating one meal a day which was generally dinner.   I had asked my boyfriend to fix me a plate of food. While he was in the kitchen he and my brother were talking. It sounded like banter but generally they'd jokingly yell back and forth. My boyfriend came back into the room and told  me there wasn't any food left. Note my boyfriend and I both cooked so we knew what amount of food was there.  I honestly got so upset and started yelling words I don't want to repeat. There wasn't any food I could make due to the meat in the freezer, and on top of that it was late at night so there wasn't any places immediately near me that I could eat or order from.   After that he did end up giving me 25 dollars to eat  yesterday morning but I was still angry since  this definitely wasn't the first offense . So I sent him a message over discord while he was  at work.  


""Look. I've been rather kind in letting you stay here with me and (bf's name). Now that I got  to sleep on an empty stomach, I'm gonna tell you how I feel. Whenever I get any kind of food I make sure there's enough for everyone. Anyone can tell you that. Yet last night it seems everyone forgot that.  You help out whenever you felt like it for the most part, and we had to rather beg you to, or something had to turn off in order for you to take action. I'm pretty pissed about last night still. I know there was more than enough food for everyone yet you decided to eat it all instead of asking if everyone ate or just getting a moderate amount. You do not need to finish off everything. And this certainly isn't the first time this has happened. It's the first time I spoke up.  In December I told you to be out by the end February and here we are mid march. You haven't even taken a step to get a place  to stay, yet you have money to blow on a Ps4 pro and a whole computer. That goes to show me that you think you can just ride off us. You haven't even gotten a down payment. You make about 400 a week. That's 1600 a month. It's 35 dollars for an application across the street and free if you apply here.   You have until the end of April until mom gets involved. She's already pressuring me about you being here. I didn't mind until you decided to buy a c͟o͟m͟p͟u͟t͟e͟r͟ and a Ps͟4. This is ridiculous. It's  a slap across the face."" 

 I don't know I kinda feel like a bit of an asshole because he was kind when I seen him today and I feel like a major jerk.  I want to know if I handled this correctly and maybe some honest advice..

337,"(Please, no harsh words.)

I feel so unmotivated in my life. After I graduated high school, I immediately began working. I moved up in my company and changed jobs and every position I held, I earned a promotion. My most recent job, I was working for a company in the same area where I graduated from high school. I worked there for about 3 months and then was offered a promotion but had to move 4 hours away. My new position took me from managing only one employee to managing 50. At the time, I was only 24 and did not have the amount of leadership xp really required to perform well, nor did I have a mentor or a supervisor who was worth a damn. 

Before moving and accepting this new position, I had lost 80 lbs going to the gym every single day and eating right. It was the first time in my life of being an obese individual that I felt confident about my body and happy. When I started the new job, it was a brand new building I was supervising (senior living) and was not yet opened nor constructed completely. The building was located in Houston was was majorly impacted during Hurricane Harvey. Eventually, my building did open to new residents ages 55+. Due to a closure of another senior community near the one I managed, 100 residents were basically forced onto the streets because of the damages to the building during the hurricane. The week we opened up to the public, I moved in 30 new residents in 5 days, by myself with no assistance from the team working alongside me who was SUPPOSED to help but was not enforced by their supervisor nor could I enforce. I worked 7a-12a every day the first several months the building was open. The building had electrical problems, malfunctioning elevators, a maintenance team I was not responsible for overseeing (meaning they were unresponsive to my requests to have an efficient facility AND LAZY...). We also had acquired a dietary manager for our kitchen from our sister property that the company knew he was a total failure before they sent him to me. Almost like they didn't want to do the dirty work/paperwork in firing him but wanted to push him off on someone else. Our corporate expectation was to be the best community in town (even though we were new) but we ended up being just a beautiful building with crappy insides. 

Due to my overhaul of a work schedule, I stopped going to the gym. I gained all 80 lbs back in a year. The stress that building caused me made me begin binge eating and I generally hate myself for it. I still struggle with it now. 

I since then quit the job and am unemployed but living comfortably. I feel like because I couldn't make things work with that building I'm an overall failure. How do I motivate myself to want to lose weight and exercise again to get back to my happy place?",14Mar2019,1

341,"Hi everyone, sorry I’m not an expert in posting on reddit so I hope I have done this correctly. I also apologise that it is a long post. 

My boss (female mid 40s) me early 30s female, have worked together at two different companies. The first experience was good, however she was being bullied by her boss her peers who were all crazy and completely dysfunctional. I on the other hand was heavily medicated (due to chronic pain) and fairly quiet but known to do high quality work so an overall high performer. 

She asked me to join her at her new company, at first the relationship was fine and everyone in this company is super lovely and not crazy like the previous company. However, now that she’s not out bullied by her manager she’s become a bully herself. In the past few days it’s taken a toll on me, because apparently I have “undermined” her and I quote she must now “micro manage me”. 

The catalyst to these comments were due to the fact that I met with an exec member (without her) with a couple of other members of the team. The exec member requested a workshop for which he assigned an agenda. I sent said agenda out and when she gets the email she calls me and loses it at me completely, stating that the exec (her boss) doesn’t know anything. So she made me re-write it and send it out again to everyone now stating what she wants it to cover and then she proceeds  to railroad (takeover) the execs workshop and control it (poorly I might add) and all the members involved just got frustrated with her.

Second related event, she goes nuts at me for the outputs I had worked on with the leadership team members, claiming that they weren’t measurable (which they were). The outputs were also validated by the exec. So she puts me on the spot making accusations that they were all wrong and I (wrongly) reacted by immediately claiming that they were measurable. She obviously lost it and basically told me to shut up. So I was like cool whatever let’s do it your way and I went off to a meeting. 

Now i can do no right; she keeps telling me I’m not performing, so I asked for feedback from all members the enterprise who I worked or work with and they have only positive things to say about my work and attitude.  

This is really stressing me out and I feel I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. I can’t be bothered sorting it out (actively looking for new jobs) as I feel talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. Also I must add she isn’t very liked across the organisation. So now I have to be micro managed (as per her comments) and she’s on me about everything. I don’t know what to do in the interim - I know I can improve my attitude and just agree with her to avoid her rath, which i will do but does anyone have any other advice? I appreciate all feedback. Thank you! 

TLDR: my boss is a micro manager and completely irrational, seeking advice on how to handle this to keep relationship as civil as possible until I can move to another job. ",14Mar2019,1
342,"I (27/f) have been in an on/off relationship with my fiancé (29/m) for approximately 3 years. From the outside looking in, we are a very happy and fairly good looking couple who has overcome a lot in the last couple years. People always tell me how lucky I am to have found a guy like him and the only thing anyone ever asks me about is our upcoming wedding (tentatively planned for summer 2020). 

Ben (not his real name) and I started dating officially in 2016 after he'd first showed interest in me almost 2 years prior. When we first got together, he showed me how much of a gentleman he could be and how sweet he was and he reeled me in. I fell in love quickly and hard. We moved very fast and he moved into the house I owned after only 6 months of dating. Things went well for awhile. After a couple of months, we started to fight. At first there would be legitimate reasons and then it quickly became huge blowouts over small, insignificant things. I realized that all my time was spent with him and I'd almost abandoned my friends and when I'd bring up this to him, he'd get angry. That was just the beginning. He was also haunted by my past. The (few) people I've slept with were constantly being brought up because some of them were meaningless sex and he doesn't understand that. He believes sex must be between two people who have legitimate feelings for each other. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells. So, at the end of 2017, I ended our relationship with no intention of coming back to it and he moved out.

Fast forward to May 2018 and some unfortunate family things happened where our lives crossed paths again. Ben and I ended up having a couple friendly chats and he asked me if I would come over for dinner to catch up. I agreed and while there he told me he had been going to therapy and working on himself. He realized our relationship ending was because of him and he missed having me in his life and he wanted me to be apart of it again even if it was just as friends. I could see the old him again and admittedly missed him so I started seeing him again. We started as friends but things quickly turned to more and soon we were in a full fledged relationship once again. I assured my friends and family it was the right decision and he had changed and they were willing to give him another chance because they trusted me. In November we went on a short trip to Denver and he proposed to me and I happily accepted. Things were great. 

Around Christmas I once again felt like I couldn't hang out with my friends. Now I have to be careful of what I say for fear of him getting upset with me. The thing that I know I can't deal with the rest of my life is his jealousy. I slept with someone else while we were broken up as well. We weren't even speaking at the time and unfortunately we live in a small town so he found out and he is constantly comparing himself to him and talking about him. He wasn't with anyone else when we were apart and he rubs it in my face. I don't know what to do and I need help. I feel ashamed and stupid. I also don't want to hurt him but I feel trapped and I deserve to be happy.

Right now I'd wish I was still a kid I would go back to being a 9 year old brat where I would be with my family. And tbh I'm not really a crybaby I rarely cry or take anything bad seriously. Getting hurt, bulling or dumb stuff like that was never an issue. 
 
When I was 10, 9 years ago, my brother was killed, my mom was devastated, I was clueless at the time, but when I saw it with my own eyes I cried for the first time and never did again until recently. My brother was 20 when he died. I honestly wished he was alive instead of me. He was rebelish, a deliquent, and violent, but after he got out of juvie he began taking life seriously, he changed, he just needed a couple more years before he could come back home since he was deported for a couple of years. Back to the main thing.

I miss him, I miss the time when I was young, when I didn't think about life seriously, honestly being who I am I see myself as a waste of air, my life has been the best, honestly if someone else lived in my shoes they would say wow your life is fucked up. But I don't mind, I got tired of thinking to myself why is life bad for me, why did I get nothing, but I didn't get nothing, how I saw life back then was that, some people should at least get a couple things right. Other people I know got, A caring family, good health, money, education, intelligence,. Etc. Then I saw me, I got a family, that's it. I thought to myself, howcome that's all I got. He got a caring family and they are rich cause there parents studied, or they complain about how they got a 96 instead of a 97 in an assignment.  They get to fuck around drink smoke weed a bunch of different shit. I didn't but know I don't care I'm glad I didn't cause I'd probably be ungrateful like them.

Good things happen to bad people, meanwhile good people just get nothing or get worse. I hate how our generation has become, teens cutting themselves or hurting themselves cause they get bullied over dumb shit, kids shooting schools cause they don't think rationally, kids getting spoiled, I mean who buys a 10 years old and iPhone 9. I barely got an LG in highschool. I see my life and I see how different it is. I envy people but I rarely do. I keep it to myself and don't care, until one night I have the thought about life and envy. My life isn't great, it isn't simple, it isn't even a fair life. But I don't mind it. Life is unfair so just deal with it right?

I got a family, I enjoy spending time with them, but RN everything's changed, they are growing old, I'm growing old. And the thought of how one day I won't longer spend time with them breaks my heart I wish that I could stop time, not how it sounds, but I want to live and everyone to live in a parallel universe where we don't grow old, where we are immortal. I don't want to see anyone die. I don't want to be alone. Being the youngest of the family. Scares me. I'm the last one to go. But I don't want anyone to go. I want to die already so I don't have to live anymore knowing that my  family and me will no longer be together smiling.

I'm sorry if you had to read this, idk if I need advice or anything, I just wanted to share this story, I'm currently upset at life of how time goes on and we grow old, 

If you have any thoughts or opinions of what I should do, or how I should see things, or just what you think about this please go ahead lmk. 

You know I know this is serious, but don't forget to

344,"Right now I am almost 18 and male. I'll be turning 18 this summer, yet I look like I am 15. I am often asked for ID when buying beer or energy drinks and often am asked (in my job) wether I am old enough to work yet and all that stuff. I really don't know what to do about it and I doubt it'll ever change. This sucks and therefore I am really insecure about my looks. I have never been really told that I was pretty either, just ""funny"" and ""cute"". Thus, what can I do to look older, will I ever be pretty?",14Mar2019,1
345,"Hello! So I currently have an hour and 1/2 commute to work everyday in Boston, more with traffic. I have always wanted to work where I work but there is no room for advancement unless you've been here for years (ive been here for 8 months) but was promised a promotion in 6 months, which didn't happen. And doesn't seem like it's happening. So I decided to look for a job closer to home. Today is my last day here and I'm so torn and feel like I made the wrong choice. I love my hours here as I can work from home (not often) but they are extremely flexible. I also love the people, except 1 which I've butted heads with. My manager is also new and isn't the best. My student loans are adding up so I had to do something, I asked for a raise here back in November and was shut down. The new job has a better commute, room for growth, but is a 9-5 job which I don't like, and probably means I won't have the ability to work from home. Am I making a mistake?? This is a 100 mile a day commute versus my new job which will be 40 miles total a day. I won't have to fill my gas tank up twice a week and won't need as many oil changes. I bought my car brand new in August of 2018 and it already has 15k miles on it from this job. I'm also sick of waking up at 4 am to get here. Help! I know I should leave, but why do I feel so torn? They say the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and it should be. They say to trust your gut but my gut is telling me to stay :( but I know I shouldn't. Help!!",14Mar2019,2
346,"So I recently made an online dating profile, temporarily just to see what the site was like and got the number of a cute girl who lives about a 10 hour drive away. I went into this with a clear head, knowing that it's just someone I'll talk to for a while, have a few conversations and not really have it evolve into anything meaningful. She ended up being quite an interesting person, and seems cool, though she did tell me of a few hardships she's going through and that she's attending college and has little income. Yesterday, she asked for me to send money so she could afford some food, and I wanted verification that she was who she said she was and then I'd do it once and perhaps quit talking to her after as not to create a dependency. I do like helping people when they're genuinely in need, but I also didn't know that this individual is in fact who they said they were and not an Indian guy with a mobile app that lets them use numbers in the U.S. All I asked for was a snapchat as to see that they are in fact not an Indian guy, not hinting at anything else in even the slightest, just to confirm identity. Then this morning she wakes up and says she'll chat on an app and later adds that she'll use a toy. So at this point I'm accepting the fact that she is probably a camgirl that uses dating sites to reel guys in to give her money for nudes but on the other hand if she is genuinely in need then I would like to help her. Oddly enough, I liked the idea more of just giving her money and that being that rather than getting porn in return. Not really sure what to do as I do try to listen to my conscience and morals. I should help people in need, but I don't really like the thought of paying someone for sex, whether it be in person or just over the internet.",14Mar2019,2

348,"Long story short, we met through reddit and bonded over our mental health issues (i.e depression and body image issues).

We talked *daily* for months! Around September she started replied days late to my messages. I was ok with it, I thought that we were bound to talk a bit less over time.

Anyway, her replies came later and later, till she didn't reply to me in over a month back in September.

Then she reconnected with a huge wall of text, I replied back, she gave me another reply and then promptly ghosted me yet again.

That was in late November. I've only messaged her once since then, and that was in January.

I miss her so much, but I simply don't want to annoy her, and I want to give her the space she needs.

Truth be told, at this point I'm convinced that I imagined this friendship to be something that it wasn't, that she never liked me as much as I did her.

I know she's alive, I've seen her online plenty of times, she's just not replying to me.

Idk, I don't think I'll message her, but what do you guys think? I could really need some advice.",14Mar2019,1
349,"(Long long post) 

So brief background: I have a BA in journalism, currently working in a completely unrelated field but get to dabble with some elements of being able to work with design and text. I am feeling understimulated but now this desire of wanting something more is creating a fire within me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling this growing desire to go into game developing, although I have very limited knowledge of what it's like to work in the industry or coding. I think I would want to work in story-building aspects, but have also been considering positions such as community developer or team-management. 

I am pretty underqualified in most areas when it comes to production as I know how to produce and edit video/audio/images but not really motion graphics or programs such as After Effects. I am also aware that I do not have any education or experience of game production. But I am also a quick learner. The jobs I am looking for do not require years of experience but rather a knowledge and understanding of the programs they use. 

I am also interested in embarking on other types of creative projects, such as going into radio or documentary production, where I have more theoretical experience - although still pretty limited in practice.

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel I want to try my hardest to stay motivated and work towards this (very widespread) goal. I'm thinking of trying to learn more programs, like After Effects, by myself and create a few things to build a portfolio. 

I am really wanting to follow through on this, because I need a change in my life and this is something I think would make me happy and something I want to try out. I would be willing to do courses in both arts, motion graphics or similar fields if this would help - and if  I realise this truly is for me I am willing to seek further education in this.

But now I am wondering if there is any advice on how to stay motivated, how to best achieve this or any other advice on how to go about this route. ",14Mar2019,2
350,"Need help trying to get in a different mindset. 

My sister and her husband bother me to no end. They’re not unkind, just kind of clueless and I disagree with almost everything they do. We work together, which complicates things a lot. She has two kids and is constantly posting on social media which I feel is wrong and that she’s just doing it for attention and validation for whatever reason. She’s not big on vaccines, still breastfeeds her 2 1/2 year old and lives in an alternate reality. We went out to lunch when she was potty training her 2 year old and she showed up the the restaurant with the kid in no underwear and a short dress (in the middle of winter). When she tells stories, she’s not lying, she really believes them even though they’re not true.  They’re also super late to everything family related and just in general are inconsiderate. We shared a car on a family trip and ended up waiting 45 minutes for them to leave a tourist site because they weren’t done yet and everyone else of the family left. 

Her husband is completely incompetent. He was homeschooled and never went to a real school, got his GED at 25 and was fired from a grocery store and a car dealership before he started working at the family company. The worst part is that he thinks he knows what he’s talking about and won’t admit when he needs help with something so he ends up messing everything up. He’s in charge of IT (no qualifications whatsoever) and does facilities like ordering snacks and lunch for the weekly lunch meetings and he can’t even do these things right. I’ve always thought that my sister could do better (she’s book smart, but not common sense smart) but they’ve been married for 5 years and have two kids so here we are. 

Okay so. I know I have no control over their choices and they can do whatever they want.  But how can I stop being judgmental and just learn to live with it?  The worst part is that I think I’m projecting my problems with the parents on the kid which I know is so wrong.  

I’m obviously not going to be best friends with them but I need to learn to stop judging since we’re together all the time. ",14Mar2019,2
351,"We met online when I was 16 and he was 18. I told him since the beginning that sex was a really sensitive subject for me because my only sexual interaction at that time were being raped when I was 8 years old. 

He acted like he cared about my traumas, my dreams and about myself in general and I was already in love with him. We moved in together one and a half years later. 

Now it's just that same old story. He was my Prince Charming until he got me hurt for the first time. He cried. I forgave him. It happened again and again until I went numb to the pain, the screams and the whole suffering. The same for rape and humiliation. 

But at the same time I still love him more than anything. He's my whole life, I can't imagine being without him. I love him so much and I fucking HATE myself for it. 

I don't have any friends or family (my adoptive mom died last year, she was the only person I had left) and I didn't knew who to talk to about this, so... That's it I guess.

Today a private conversation with him got a bit personal, and he told me he's been depressed for the past year and a half. He said it's because all his high school friends moving interstate for university caused him to develop strong social anxiety. He has friends at his uni, but they live 40 minutes away, and he says that he would feel awkward asking them to hang out. He was close with his high school friends, but he also says that he ""acted like a different person"" in high school, so he believes they were friends with that different person - not him.

355,"This is such a dumb problem, but as the title says, I wrote an email to an employer to follow up on my application. I wrote the message perfectly and I planned on sending it to two separate emails. To make it easier on myself, I decided to copy and paste the message so I didn’t have to retype it all. 

However, I failed to realize that I sent the copied message incorrectly. I forgot to copy my name at the end. 

So the other email ended like this:

“sincerely,”

and blank. I feel like such a dope. I worked so hard to make sure I had no typos but still failed to find this error until seconds after I hit the send button.

360,"I’m really sorry for my poor writing skills, I’m not the best at expressing myself in words also I don’t know what I expect sharing this here, maybe just some others with the same experience?
So I was at work today and a coworker of mine who is in his mid thirties (I work at a pizza place we all vary in age) was talking about a memory he had when he was five years old and other coworkers started sharing young memories, whatever right? And all of the sudden this feeling of anxiety I’ve occasionally gotten since I was 13 or 14 (I’m 18 nearly 19 now) comes over me and as much as I try to shake it I can’t. This feeling comes because one day I felt like I woke up, but not me- like all my previous life lived hadn’t been me. I didn’t recognize any family I didn’t live with, it’s like my ‘friends’ were complete strangers, the things I ‘liked’ didn’t fit me at all. I know we aren’t supposed to remember everything from our childhoods or even life, but it’s all I can describe it as is one day waking up from a coma I guess. My sister still to this day talks about how we used to be so close and how we were best friends but she’s like a stranger to me, my brother calls me Waldo and I have legitimately no idea why, my mom will sometimes talk about the places we went when I was young and I can’t/ don’t remember. I apologize for more or less rambling now but it makes me very upset to think about I missed out on 13/14 years of my life. I just feel so wrong about it, I highly resemble the kid from the photos but my eyes are lighter- my skin is lighter- my hair much darker- I could legit just be crazy but I was staring at my face and there seems to be less space between my eyes and eyebrows compared to old photos of me. 

Here’s a list of all things I think have changed based off what family has told me (I’ve never shared this feeling with anyone)  
I used to be allegedly allergic to peanuts and tree nuts-  now I eat various forms of those things and am completely fine
I used to play a video game called kingdom hearts and was ‘obsessed’ with it (apparently fell in love around 10 or so) had posters coving my walls, tee shirts, the whole collection of games- My sister wanted someone to trade off playing the new one with her so I went to her house and had no idea what the story line was or how to play I had been told I loved this game for so long I just kinda agreed but when it came time to play it I realized I know nothing about it and I’m not sure I ever did 
I used to have a bunch of friends (given I have new friends now)- but when I ‘came to’ I could hardly come up with their names
I used to be in special reading programs for kids that needed extra help- I’m now enrolling in college with a nearly full scholarship due to academic achievement
I used to have weight problems being sort of heavy for my age/ height- I’m now very healthy but I never had to work for it? (I’m willing to chalk this one up to puberty though) 
I feel like a stranger around my family- I don’t know them, anything about them except names relation to me for example I spent every weekend with my grandparents growing up so my mom could be at work full time and it’s like one day I realized I didn’t know who they were


It just feels like I’m out of my mind, like I’m some sort of crazy yet improved version of my former self- or everyone in my life is an actor playing the role of people I used to know but I can’t remember enough to say if it’s true or not. 
Someone for the love of everything tell me they feel this way too so I can hopefully stop that pit in my stomach feeling every time I think about my early life.

363,"My room mate has become increasingly unhappy with his job, which is understandable. Its low pay, high stress (dealing with special needs kids), terrible management and no chance of career progression. He needs a better job and while options are limited in this town he will never even look for another job on his own. The only reason he has the job he has at the moment is because I found it for him. 

He wants to make video games full time and so no other job will do. His grand plan is to quit his current job, take out £20,000 loan and try and live off that till his first game is released. He has released games in the past but I don't think he's made back more than a couple hundred pounds, which is about the same amount of money he spent making them. While I don't doubt his determination there is no way he's going to make his money back.

Since he lives in my flat, if he defaults or goes bankrupt, will this effect me? I'm guessing it will, since the bailiffs will just repossess everything in the flat until I can prove its mine.

Every day now I'm expecting him to come home and say he's quit his job in a huff. He's already told me that he's quitting next month at the latest.

I honestly don't know what to say to him, this move could ruin his credit and life in general, but if I try and talk him out of it then I'm the bad guy trying to ruin his dreams. I can't even kick him out because I doubt he'd be able to afford another place (I charge him mates rates).

My last girlfriend really fucked me up. I fell head over heels for this girl, tried so hard to trust her and make things work. But then I caught her sexting her ex, but I against my better judgement tried to make it work. For the next 6-9 months it was nothing but gaslighting, cheating, lying and bullshit. Eventually I stood my ground and ended things with her but it was.... awful. She freaked out when I wouldn't take her back. She blasted my penis size and my ""inability to get her off"" all over social media, to my old workplace, my friends and even her own family. (?) 

So basically I have become *extremely* distrustful of women. Everytime I get into a relationship (with the exception of my second relationship because she didn't fuck me over she just wanted to open the relationship up) I get fucked over. Everything my ex told me was a lie. Her being ""okay"" with my size. That she loved spending time with me and blah blah. All of it was a fucking lie. Now when I look at girls I'm interested in I feel like shit thinking ""they'll probably just cheat on me."" 

I'm not going to pretend like I'm perfect either. I don't want to seem like the *only* victim here because I've done things to hurt others emotionally before and I have tried to earn forgiveness from them. But I've never cheated on anyone, I've never told them something important like ""I love you"" only for it be a complete fabrication. I dont know if I'm just destined to remain single for the rest of my life but that does *seem* a lot easier than dealing with all of the lies. I dont know what to do.",14Mar2019,3
369,Ever since I went on a website for Meme economy  I have been getting subscribed to a bunch of crypto currency sub reddit’s and other subreddits that I have never even gone on. Does anyone know how to fix this problem I already have tried changing my password any suggestions? ,14Mar2019,2
370,"I’m on mobile, sorry for formatting. Also, this is a throwaway. 

Okay, so some background: I ride the special ed bus (is that what it’s called?) because I have mobility issues and it’s much easier to get on/off and there’s more room. Most of the kids on there (only like 6 others) are pretty chill and we get on fine. Most of them, aside from one who also has mobility issues, are ranging from high to lower functioning mental handicaps. This will come up later. 

Everything is almost perfect. Except the kid that sits behind me. He obviously has something that causes him to be lower functioning. That’s not the problem. The problem is that he fucking STINKS. I’m not talking regular BO, but every day he smells like he literally shit himself and it’s been SITTING there. 

I know that this is NOT HIS FAULT. However, this is so bad that I am literally gagging. I threw up in my mouth this morning. The other kids have commented on it aloud. One day a girl said, “Bye C, don’t forget to shower!” as he stepped off the bus. 

It’s so bad that as soon as he steps on the entire bus immediately smells like an outhouse. And when he gets off, it lingers for at least 15 minutes. 

It makes me wonder why his parents aren’t cleaning him. It’s obvious they aren’t because he always gets on at 6:30 AM smelling already, and he just seems to get worse every day. Another thing that concerns me is that he’s always dressed inappropriately. By that I mean, he gets on the bus wearing the same shorts every day, even in the recent 16 degree weather we’ve been having in the morning. 

With him behind me the smell is obviously worse, but the whole bus smells. Should I ask to move??? I feel really guilty but I wonder why the school hasn’t said anything about this. I know he’s handicapped but to me it looks like his parents aren’t doing anything to help. Maybe it’s not my place to say that, but I can’t go another day almost throwing up on the bus. ",14Mar2019,1

They tell him he is an independent business owner and he buys this brand of energy drinks I have never seen in stores before to “sell.”
He has tried to recruit us, his friends into the scheme and trust us we have tried to get it through to his head this is a horrible choice.
He’s gotten fired from his electrician job he worked so hard for to pursue this “dream” of being able to retire with a stable income for the rest of his life thanks to his “business” in just half a decade.
It’s ridiculous it’s scary really. We don’t know what to do he’s so far down the rabbit hole. He defends his group to no end we have shown him YouTube videos of people breaking down exactly what they’re  doing and he still defends his situation saying “Just gotta work harder only a few years away.” Delusion stuff.

If you don’t know what snus is it’s a little bag with tobakko and nicotine you put under the lip. It’s about 8x more nicotine in snus then ciggarets so you get ”more” addicted to it. They compare it to be as hard as a light heroin addiction (not in technique but just how hard it is).

She had the application forms so I told her go ahead fill them in and send them off, why should you chase crumbs from the top level table?  She already does the top level job but isn't paid for it.  Her role is put down as an 'acting' level six.

Yesterday my dads okay out of hospital and now my mums taken bad, I can't get a break running about after their needs.  Doctors appointments meds shopping chores they need done so I needed some good news and asked the lady friend why the sad face?

The others including the bottom levels are going for their interviews now.  You didn't fill in and send off the application form didn't you? yeah I knew I wouldn't have gotten it she said.

She makes triple my wage had she applied for the job and gotten it she'd be set for life, she also owns her flat outright and bought it with some of the proceeds from her divorce settlement.

She's worked for it and deserves an official promotion, understandably I'm not in the best of moods having negative crap like that laid on me when I'm keeping shit bottled up inside me.  She is going to kick herself if one of the people she trained up now becomes her boss.

382,"Basically, I was in a relationship with my ex-fiance for 7 years from about 18-25. We had a great relationship at first, but long story short, we grew apart and a lot of resentment grew between us, and about 4 months after I started taking my antidepressants and feeling better, we broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, me and my current boyfriend started dating. We've been together for about 3 years now, and just a few months after we started dating, I stopped taking my medicine due to a HUGE price increase when I switched insurance. Now that I'm back on it (have been for about 2.5 months now), I realize that he doesn't treat me well and that I don't want this constant negativity in my life and I'm tired of being treated badly, and I want to break up.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this an effect of the antidepressants making me more inclined to make rash decisions? Or am I happier overall, so more likely to make positive changes in my life, and less weighed down by the burdens of indecision that come with depression?

- now im in my home country having no idea how to speak the language but can understand bits and pieces 
- i have been bullied by classmates and teachers im over that now 
- failing grades my mom had to bribe the stupid language teacher (she hates foreigners)
-  my mom had cancer and she got her breast removed I thought it was all good since its gone but my brother told me the doctor said she had 5 years to live

Now im here thinking my life choices cause of all the things i had to be good at was drawing but what can art do for me? I live in a 3rd word country with littlest of opportunities and my mom knows that she lived through that. Shes been begging me to change to medical.

    We know that first thing is to find the jobs to find the location for housing. However, for everything else such as moving all of our stuff, including cars, is there a web site that will help me set up a budget and get an idea of what we are looking at financially?

Some may say this is a bad idea, but a majority of our belongings are old and worn down, or were cheap buys from our single days.

The employment that's waiting at the end is excellent money (close to 30K a year), excellent pension, good working hours, 5 days a week, job for life (some people have been here 40+ years)

I'm sure lots of people would kill for this kind of opportunity.

The probelm is that i cannot bear the thought of having to work here permanently!

In short, I have absolutally no passion for this job anymore. The work is boring, the people are boring, the company is boring and it's making me perpetually miserable having to work here.

I was largely pushed into it by my family who have always been very pushy for me to get a ""career"" job.

I get that lots of people hate their jobs, i know it's not exactly uncommon but i feel like If i take this seemingly amazing job offer in a few months I'm going to waste my 20s being myserable with no ambition or drive to do well at work.

I'm worried about what kind of a person thats going to turn me into 10 years down the line. 

Lately I've been thinking of either quitting or turning down the employment offer and instead just taking up menial work for a while. Things like bars or shops. 

Not exactly glamourous or well paid I know. But i at this point in my life I'm not interested in money. I've saved up enough to support myself if things go to shit.

I have no idea if doing that will make me any happier but I need a big change in my life. New people, new eperiences, not just sat at a the same desk day in day out.

At some point in my life I do intend to return to some sort of career path but I need to be dead certain on what i want to do before dedicating years of my life to something. That could be a month or a year or ten years down the line. Who knows?

At the moment I honestly have no idea what that career path that will be.

It has been about 6 months since we left school and I think we've seen each other about 4 times in real life, and over the period of time our group chat has just gone from overflowing with messages to one message every day or so that commonly dies out. I'm the only one with an actual job but when I'm not working - I'm completely free.

394,"I’ve known my friend, who we’ll call Nicole, for nearly seven years now. We’ve been hanging out fairly consistently during that time and I consider her one of my closest friends. Even when other people would fade in and out from our lives, we would still try to make time when possible to see each other at least a few times a year, even while going to different colleges. I should mention that I find her attractive and during different periods of our friendship I had feelings for her that would fade in and out

After we both graduated and got back home, we’ve been seeing each other more often and thus our friendship would feel stronger to put in simple terms. I would give her advice on her now-ex boyfriend (who she increasingly complained about) and she would try to help me out with my problems if I asked for it. Simply put, Nicole and her boyfriend of two years were not a good fit, but she had issues getting up the courage to break up with him which I would try to help her work through. (I never met the guy, but she vocalized how unhappy she was with him near the end; emotional abuse, inconsistent values, ect.)

Anyway, one night, a few weeks before she broke up with her boyfriend, we were hugging goodbye (not typical) and she would not let go. We had just had a pretty deep conversation regarding her situation and she seemed very vulnerable, and I was feeling pretty confident and I’m not an idiot so I tried to kiss her. She avoided it and we said goodbye, but then she texted me immediately after saying she would have kissed me had she not been with someone. (I know I made a mistake but at the time it felt right) We later talked about it more and she confessed feelings for me that basically matched the feelings I had for her: she would go through periods of time during our friendship where she would have strong feelings for me and that she was into me and all this other shit. She then finally broke up with her boyfriend and I got ready to shoot my shot for when she got over the breakup phase.

A few weeks after she broke up with her boyfriend, I opened up to Nicole more than I already had about my feelings for her and my intentions (which she already knew about and was obviously open to prior to the breakup) but now she just wasn’t about it and said she had to figure some things out regarding her life and career before getting into another relationship. I understood this 100%, and while I was very disappointed, I figured that if I gave her enough time and space things would work out. However, it turns out about a month or so after breaking up with her boyfriend, Nicole got with another dude who had the same idea I did, who I’ll call Nathan. I had no idea who the fuck Nathan was, so I was fairly caught off guard once she started telling me about this new guy she’s been hanging out with.

This girl has been dating Nathan for about 3-4 months now, but she still asks me to hangout every month or so like the whole situation never occurred. I feel bitter, jealous, and upset that I was essentially lead on by somebody who I trusted and feel really strongly about. Most normal people in my situation would just move on and try to find someone else, which is fine, but I still have the issue of her asking to hang out regularly. Nowadays I never initiate, but I still find myself going out with her when she asks and feeling angry at myself and her, while also being less able to enjoy stuff with her like I used to. This is why I’ve been considering being upfront with her about my feelings and simply cutting her out of my life.

I’m trying not to come off like some loser r/niceguys, and I also understand that she doesn’t owe me anything. That being said, I don’t feel like I owe her anything either, especially now. And while it would be dope if she broke up with Nathan and got with me, I don’t think it’s wise to give her an ultimatum nor am I sitting around hoping things will change. Although I don’t want to lose a great friend, I don’t know how else to deal with this and I’m at the end of my rope here. Is cutting Nicole out of my life the move?

TLDR; I feel like I’ve been lead on by my really close friend who I have feelings for, but she still asks me to hang out just like we used to. I'm angry and am leaning towards telling her to fuck off, but I’d like to hear other opinions before doing anything.",14Mar2019,1
395,"Hello, I currently work for a security company with a 34 man company. I have been work for about 2 years. On our days off if we get overtime, the supervisor who is working would go off a list from the guys not working and he would call to ask if anyone wants to take the overtime shift (based on seniority).

Yesterday, a senior supervisor called me and asked if I wanted the OT, which I eagerly said yes, because it has been pretty dry lately. BUT, later on that night I was reading through our call log just to see what time the OT shift starts, I notice that two more OT shift were requested after me. The other two that came in are in the same area we work out of and the one he asked me for is the one in a different location. 

So, I want to ask him how come he requested me for to cover the out of town one when the closer one in which pays more he assigned to the other two guys. Our OT call out is based on seniority and I am junior then the other two guy so one of them should of had the job in which I am assigned to and I should of been with the the two man job in town. 

Also, this boss is believed to be scheming OT jobs and favoring his liked employees.

402,"Hey all, 

So, obvious throwaway account here but I didn't want to write this with my usual account. Let me just get right into matters if that's okay. 

I'm a 26 year old guy who has had a lifetime of issues with socializing, trusting, and fitting in. I was born with a physical birth defect and condition that made my life hard. I got picked on so much and abused by other kids growing up that I was constantly changing schools and eventually wound up just leaving high school and going the home school route. By the time I got to college I was super shy, very withdrawn, and almost mute because I was so afraid of being singled out again. Not that there still weren't assholes and jerks in college who made things hard for me. Adding onto my problems, I learned to eat my feelings and put on a lot of weight. I'm approximately 5'9"" and my highest weight was a little over 300 pounds at one point. 

About a year ago, I started trying to make changes. I went completely cold turkey on my bad eating habits, started walking through my neighborhood, and I've managed to lose quite a bit of the weight. I have a work from home job so I don't get to leave the house much, but I want to socialize more. My biggest problem is I'm still deathly afraid of most people and feel that even losing the weight won't fix my problems from the birth defect and my emotional and headspace issues. The part that concerns me the most is I am absolutely uneasy and awkward and uncomfortable around women because girls were my biggest bullies and the event that caused me to leave high school back in 2009 was a ""prank"" some popular girls did to me. I've spent a lot of my online time with MRA and Red Pill groups and their ideology poisoned me. I don't want to be one of those guys but I'm worried they got their claws too far into me. 

I want to try remaining body positive, fix my situation, and get real friends, but even typing this out I am so concerned someone is going to find out who I am and cause more problems or just make even more fun of me. I'm rambling now but I don't know what else I can say or do. So thanks for reading this I guess. ",14Mar2019,1

409,"**Posting this as I have a serious concern for a close friend.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Jay = Close Friend***

***P = Perpetrator***

***PGF = Perpetrator's Girlfriend***

&amp;#x200B;

It's come to my attention that my close friend, Jay, has encountered and witnessed minor (and possible) domestic violence occurrences at his share house. 'P' has a history of physically abusing his own sibling.

Verbal conflicts have also occurred between 'P' and 'PGF' on an almost regular basis. They have been together for 6+ months.

&amp;#x200B;

'P' also appears to have demanding behaviour, ordering Jay to complete chores despite being preoccupied with studies and/or work on most days. 'P' also does not clean-up after himself, I was also told.

'P' also appears to possess a toxic personality (lacks rationality, anger management issues, pushy, demanding, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Verbal conflicts have also escalated between Jay and 'P' regarding house chores and other errands, with yelling and swearing involved. 'P' had also attempted to force Jay's bedroom door open in a fit of rage.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, here's what I need to know:**

1. From this information provided, would any of this be considered legitimate domestic violence? minor or serious?
2. Can I legally step-in and attempt to take defensive and/or legal action on Jay's behalf, should this situation worsen?
3. Is a lawyer required to establish a Domestic Violence Order or Apprehended Personal Violence Order? (QLD, Australia)
4. If a lawyer is required, what are the costs involved? (Australia).
5. Is there a way to seek legal assistance with low or no costs involved?

If you can share your knowledge and/or wisdom, it'd be greatly appreciated.

410,"So, I live at that place for a month. When I first came check it out (mid February) there was his mom, but he said she's just here for few days, since he had surgery and she's helping him out.

One of the first days I talked to her and she said that she otherwise lives in some other city, but is here till the end of the month (that slightly annoyed me, but okay, I can handle 14 days). After a week she was gone for some time so I thought she already went home since he's okay.

But then again she appeared for few days and disappeared for a day and so on and for past week she's basicaly just living here and she enters whenever she feels like (before flatmate used to text me when she'll come). We had this deal of telling each other when someone is coming over.

Let me also mention that it's his place and I'm renting a room.

She's a nice lady, but i don't feel comforatable with that at all. I want to talk to him, but I don't want to make it feel awkward between us.

What do you think of the whole situation? Am I being unreasonable? Should I wait for a bit more and talk to him?

411,"So, I am what is essentially the marketing director for a small software company run by a man and his wife. Officially, my boss is the  man. However, I coordinate with his wife on certain things, but on most things it's between me and my male boss. His wife is a fleeting presence; in and out of the office, not in all meetings or calls in, etc. However, when she is present, she inserts herself pretty forcefully and with only half the info. If there is a meeting about a subject, and you want to keep it focus on that one subject only and have a short meeting, she will derail it by bringing up everything else under the sun remotely related to that in the business. 

Now, she did this yesterday: she attended a meeting I invited her to. For me, this was the second meeting, as I'd had a brief pitch meeting with my boss about a marketing initiative, and I wanted to see if it was a waste of my time. He gave me a soft green light to have a brainstorm meeting with the rest of the executive team, including the wife. So I did, and the agenda of the meeting was to decide whether we like the idea, and how to proceed, after which I would develop the timeline based on the feedback of the meeting, and the high-level summary of our discussion, and send to everyone.  

She questioned every little thing, which is fine, because the meeting was to pick it apart and find the flaws, decide if we can live with them or fix them, and go forward. But then she suggested that I'm not doing my job at all, and derailed the conversation to ask if I'd started planning for an event in May. As this was not the topic of the meeting, I hadn't brought materials addressing that with me, and my answer was basically ""it's on the calendar and we're (me and the VP) working on the plan"".

SOOOO. My question is two-fold: any advice for managing this situation diplomatically? and Any advice for ensuring that BOTH my boss AND his wife see the progress I make and all the work I do?

I decided to message an old ex boyfriend who I dated back in high school. He thought it was weird that I messaged him out of the blew but I had a boyfriend and wasn’t going to message him while i had a boyfriend. While I do have feelings for my old ex boyfriend. He made me love him in ways no other guy has done. I will always love him but I will not tell my old ex boyfriend that. I look at him right now as a friend, and maybe in future, we can try again. I recently started messaging him. He is a Christian, as so am I. I’ve been going to his church for about 3 years and I’ve grown and come to know his family. His family is nice, and his mother teaches Sunday school for college students like myself. He messaged me today and told me to stay away from his family. He said “when someone breaks up, they don’t spend time with their family.” His family has given me advice, and his mom invites me to do things with them, like bonfires, movies, and has even bought me gifts like expensive gifts. This is stuff his mother doesn’t have to do but she does because she is kind and caring. Anyways, do I stay away from his family? I do not know what to say to him, I’m just shocked that he would tell me that. His family attends church and so do I, along with his mom invites me to do stuff. It’s not like I’m exerting myself into their family. I don’t know what to do or how to respond to him? Do I tell his mom? This old ex boyfriend doesn’t even live near me anymore, in fact he lives 5 hours away. I don’t want to make this problem bigger or worse than it already is. Any advice would be nice. Thank You.

428,"Hello redditors, I've been in a difficult position for a while now and was wondering if anyone had some advice for me, particularly in terms of finance. Money's always been a worry but more so with this big change.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to make things clearer I am a 24F living with a 32M in the UK. I have been working full time to keep us going whilst my partner has been down and out due to depression as well as a workplace injury which has left him unable to walk for varying amounts of time. (Sometimes mild pain over a few hours, sometimes more pain over the course of the day) It's very random and makes his life unpredictable at times as we rarely get to plan ahead. For example we could plan an outing and come the day, he can barely move five steps before the familiar grunts of pain start. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's left me in a position where I have to care for him with thing like getting shoes on, bathing etc. I don't mind because  love him but it can wear me down. I suffer from anxiety and depression too so it can be a bit problematic with this stress. And in case anyone suspects anything, no, my partner is not taking advantage of me. He's struggling and feels nothing but shame whenever I support him. It's a real knock on his pride and he wishes nothing more than me achieving my goals. He's the reason I've become more confident and happy within myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is relevant because I have been pining to go to university for years but have been sceptical/nervous to do so. I am not the same level of introvert since meeting my partner and feel ready to take the commitment of at least 4 years to learn how to do my dream job. 

&amp;#x200B;

The financial side of me however has me unsure how to proceed as I am a panicky mess whenever I try to figure out what I'm entitled to and whether or not I'd be putting us in the shitter if I pursue this (since I've been the only earner). I get advance learner loans and grants, but that will only cover myself and my partner only has a finite amount of benefit to go on. With this mess of a system called ""Universal Credit"" being clumsily implemented in, it's even more difficult to find out what works with what and what conflicts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't live glamorously, minimum wage only *just* gets us by with sometimes a few £'s to spare but not often, so one can understand my hesitation. Aside from his benefit, I get a small amount because I've essentially dropped a shift a week (30hrs a week now) to support him. I would prefer to stay with my partner because it's very close to my chosen university, about 15 minutes on my bike (and I love him of course, duh!) and would like to know if anyone on here has had to go through a similar change or decision, like people going to Uni later in life with hard commitments like a prominent position in work or children. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if I can feasibly do this with minimum damage caused (I don't care about how much money or whatever, just enough to get by and achieve my childhood dream). 

Any and all  advice is very much appreciated and apologies if this post is too long/waffly etc. I just want to paint a clear picture so people can figure out where I'm at.

Feel free to ask questions too if I haven't made some things clear, this is my first post since I usually just browse. ",14Mar2019,1

Our uni's site has a way we can message one another, so I considered messaging her through that (to tell her I didn't get her number). I feel like that'll make me look weird though?? Should I just wait for her to possibly text me?

431,"I've (26f) been having issues getting my sleeping pattern back to normal for over 3 weeks now. I used to work a night shift job that was temporary and lasted about 4 months, working from 6pm-3am, but that ended 3 weeks ago. I've been having trouble getting out of the habit of waking up around 3-5pm and not being able to fall asleep until 5-7am. I've tried going to sleep early, but it's extremely hard for me to fall asleep unless I'm tired and I will literally just lay in bed for hours. I've attempted to wake up early, like only sleep for 4-5 hours, get up around 9-10am hoping I would be tired by a decent time like 10-midnight to get up early again, but my body just won't let me fall asleep until very late/ early in the morning. Sometimes I have been able to fall asleep around 1-2 am at best, but still sleep until 3-5pm, even after setting alarms. I used to sleep 7-8 hours fine, but now it seems like I am still extremely tired and will keep sleeping for 12+ hours most nights/ days.

442,"Throwaway account 'cus i'm pretty embarrassed about asking for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory, my parents were together for the first few years of my birth then they split, my mum raised me nearly on her own but my dad was still supporting both my younger brother and I, it wasn't until I was about 9 or 10 that we (my brother and i) started to stay over at our dad's house for the weekends until our mum met someone (no longer with that person) and made us move away from the city to the country where we've been ever since (about 5 years now).

My brother and I used to fly back to the city to visit our dad but our mum refused to pay for our flight down so that if we wanted to visit him he'd have to pay for our trip (which he has been willing to do every time), but after being up in the country for so long the visits have been getting less and less. My dad and I have a good relationship despite never living with him.

Last November I finished my final year of schooling and in the following December, turned 18. I was going to have a gap year this year before going into university to work and earn some money, and also figure out how else I could study the course I wanted as my grades ended up being too low.

This is where the meat of the post is:

&amp;#x200B;

It's now been 4 months since i've turned 18 and finished up everything to do with school, in that time i've done some voluntary work for local plays/concerts and did some work with a guy who builds patio's around our town (not quite a trades assistant but essentially the same thing just without the recognition of skills I guess), that job ended up not working out so i've gone back to looking for other jobs. The voluntary work I mentioned doing before ended up paying off as I got accepted into university, however as my brother and I have been planning to go to Europe with our dad I decided to defer my offer until the next intakes in September. My mum thinks this is a terrible idea and since i've been trying to sort out getting a new passport and figuring out the university stuff I haven't been doing any work, to which she gave me 2 weeks to get a job or else I would get kicked out (remember that I live in a small country town so I would have nowhere to go and it would take weeks to save for the ridiculous costs of airfares). I managed to get a shift at the the only other restaurant in town (we have 2 here, I used to work at the other restaurant in town but it's closing down) and my mum keeps going on about how when she was younger than me she had to pay for everything herself and her parents didn't support her so why should she support me when I don't have work (even though I do have work now, huh?). I'm pretty scared of getting kicked out because the threat has never come up before I turned 18 and it comes up every single day, I don't know what I would do if I did get kicked out.

So when I was telling my dad about getting accepted into uni I tried to casually mention how I don't know if I could get down to the city as I might get kick out, he told me I could live with him but I would have to work at least 2 days a week. I'm hesitant to as he has had another child with his new partner as I don't want to be putting extra pressure on him to setup living arrangements.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do reddit? Continue to work up where I am now, living with my mum and brother as i've been doing for my entire life, to save up enough so that when September comes I can move to a student accommodation in the city while I study at uni. Do I go to live with my dad which i've never done before to work down there and leave behind my friends (granted it's not like i'll lose contact with them)?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the big blocks of text, any and all advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Do I move closer to the city to live with my dad and find work there while I wait for my uni intake, or do I continue living with my mum away from the city, in a pretty toxic relationship where i'll work and wait for my uni intake?**",14Mar2019,1
443,"I'm 18 and in a few months I have what is the equivalent of the SAT exams in my country. The problem is that I'm pretty far behind in some subjects and I'm dealing with mild depression and social anxiety. I've lost motivation and it's gotten to the point where I am absent from school as often as I am in it. Now I'm unsure of what to do next.

If I stay in school, I worry that my mental health will worsen, and my results won't improve. In this case I would have to retake the exams next year, which I would be ok with. However I could potentially do some work, get decent results, and choose a college course with lower requirements than my ideal. I do see this as less likely though.

On the other hand, I could leave school now, get a part-time job, and retake the exams next year. It would give me some time to focus on my mental health and personal goals. It could also potentially isolate me and ultimately allow me to avoid my problems for longer, though.

The mistakes I'm talking about are two, masturbation, and talking to a girl (I'll explain, I promise, just keep reading). 

Now, I come from a very conservative community, so, while I know that, to you, these ""mistakes"" may sound ok, but to me and my culture, they're not.

Basically, to give you an idea of how guilty I feel, imagine the kinkiest thing you know, and imagine that you've done it, that's the level of guilt I am at.

I have started to hate myself and devalue myself, and I have come to the conclusion that, because of what I've done, I don't deserve romantic love, because I would never be able to forgive a partner that did these things, so I don't expect to be forgiven.

Anyway, with most mistakes, there's either something you can fix, or some way to be punished. Only problem is, neither of those exists for my mistakes, so I'm lost.

He has only worked as a server for a few years (like one or two), and in our industry for less than a few months (as stated before). He is never on the schedule and i know this because we started at the same time and i am there almost every single day. He has ruined product at our place before not knowing how to make it ect. Hes not even fast on cash register. 

This kid is so stuck up he thinks he deserves full time for the measly maybe 20 hours he has worked (i had 32 hours last pay period). I am just mind boggled because i have experience as a trainer, hostess, host, and our industry experience. I work there almost daily and it makes no sense to me. I know i dont deserve it sooooo.....

We have employees that have been waiting for a full time spot for a year and he came in as part time.

More to the story kid lives with his parents and pays no bills and only 250$ rent per month and 200$ (supposedly) car insurance. 

I have student loans, rent (550$) school to save for, and bills to pay actual water and electric bills (70$) with little to no help from parents on them......i also have car insurance (150$)

Last year, I undertook a journey and went back to school to do something I loved. I quit my job and enrolled in school so that maybe I might make a better life for myself. This was the biggest mistake I possibly could have made. I used all of my savings to pay for me to be able to go to school and that school put so much unnecessary stress on me that I almost buckled several times. I cried a lot.

I get huge welts all over my skin, my joints seize up and get so sore I can barely move. I shit my guts out twice a day so violently that I almost always faint. I have trouble typing and holding a pencil, and it’s progressing and getting worse.

My job that I finally was able to get after school is totally unrelated and doesn’t pay well but I am able to do it when my mortal shell is working that day. Some days are just so painful or debilitating I can hardly move. Today was one of those days. I called in and they let me know that my absence will not be tolerated.

I am a HARD worker. I take a lot of pride in my work and I do my very best every single day. I finally thought my life was on the upswing and my partner and I could buy a house for both of us to love but now my job is being threatened and there is nothing I can do about it. I understand their position as a business, but if I can’t sit at a desk all day and do computer work, what the fuck CAN I do??

After that until the age of 18, I largely hung on in the “outcast” circle of people and rarely ventured into the cool/popular kid groups at high school so didn’t get much attention I guess. Then I attended college. I would get men that would corner me while I was siting at tables alone in public areas asking if they can sit with me. Then I removed my headscarf. Things got worse with the attention, as you can imagine. One incident I was stalked by a former lover, and harassed over text by two other seemingly normal men, but these are stories for another time. Also, a guy I was close friends with and liked from classes spend a year hanging out with me before telling me he has a girlfriend, so that was cool. 

After college is when things have gotten so much worse though. I’ve had men subtly flirt with me at my professional job, outright say I’d get picked up if I went to a bar, touch my hand softly and tell me I look lovely and gorgeous. My next job after that was more of a blue-collar job and my 50+year old manager said good morning sunshine over text. Out in the streets, I haven worker truck men cat call me all the time. Once I went out to a famous bar hopping street and got picked up cause the guy thought I was “cute”. 

At bars and clubs I can’t be left alone and have men flirt with and corner me even when I was with a girl friend. The same goes for meet-ups and I get men always looking at and side eyeing and me smiling at me. I’ve even had a woman do it too once when I was out, she asked her guy friend to ask me out for her. 

My past neighbour stalked me and followed me vehemently, I’m too tired to go into that in detail. 

One of my friends who I’ve gotten to know since a little over a year said “I’m *so* cute” once and sent me a winking smiley face after saying she’s looking forward to seeing me soon. The same happened with one of my former colleagues who sent me a winking emoticon in an email after I asked for a reference. Like why? Why can’t y’all be normal? I feel everything is a subtle flirt with people around me.

These are the incidents I can remember off the top of my head. I really wanted to write this out because I feel it’s almost making me crazy, nearly everywhere I go I get hyper acknowledged for my looks and I can’t be left alone? I’m sure you can imagine also how this makes dating, as I seem to attract the worst guys sometimes that constantly refer to my “attractiveness”. I wanted to get this off my chest but also possibly get advice as to how to deal with this, without being mean or unfriendly to people.

So, Me and my current boyfriend are almost perfect, except for one thing: we barely have sex. I mean like, we have sex MAYBE once a month. And it's not like I'm not sexually attracted to him, because I am. But the idea of sex just grosses me out/seems like a chore to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now let me explain why I think I was sexually abused by ***my ex.***

&amp;#x200B;

My ex, I'll call him Chad, was my very first boyfriend. We were both virgins before we met each other. I was consenting to all his sexual advances at first, but things started getting weird. Chad would get pissed off if I denied him when I was around family, he would make me feel bad when I wouldn't do certain stuff *(because I was a beginner, no I don't want to do anal right after losing my virginity a month ago, asshole.)*, He would want to have sex like four to five times a day, it was exhausting.

&amp;#x200B;

We were together for almost two years, consent pressure with sex and having sex 3-5 times a day (*most of the time I hated doing it.*). Chad was following other cam girls on instagram even tho I asked him not too, since I was really insecure about my body (*eating disorder at the time, also yes i know very first world problems*.) But then he would yell at me saying that he had an addiction to porn and I should be more sympathetic towards him about his problem, which I was willing to help but we never got any treatment/saw anyone for it, so he just continued to watch it against my wishes *(we were young at the time, I was 19/20 and he was 18/19.)* This happened a lot until shit hit the fan.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I broke it off with Chad because he was jealous of this guy I befriended at school, actually he got pissed off at any friend I had, but I digress. It got physically/emotional exhausting because of the friendship I made, so I packed up my stuff from Chad's place and moved in with my friend, Ali. *(No parents, living on my own for awhile LOL sorry, felt like I had tp preference this.)* For a year, after our break up, Chad tried winning me back with grand gestures like buying me coffee and snacks and professing his undying love for me **DURING SCHOOL I MIGHT ADD.** But when that didn't work, He eventually got really sour. He would lure me out to bars, promising about changing and getting back together bc he changed, and We would get drunk enough to do sexual stuff with then pretty much tell me off. He would call me disgusting, a slut, a whore, etc. and threaten to tell the guy I was dating at the time *(even tho I would tell the current guy everything anyways, bc we had a open thing going on)* over and over again and try to ruin any possible relationship I would have with a man.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually that finally came to an end by the fall of 2017. He told me he was purposely tried to emotionally manipulate me to ruin any relationship with a guy I was seeing. Which came to no surprise to me bc I had a hunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after a couple months of no talking, he called me up to confess to me that he sex with my unconscious body after a night of heavy drinking with me. Which I was disgusted with myself after hearing this, and somedays I wish he never even told me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like because of all of this, I can no longer have a healthy sex life, or show my current boyfriend how much I love him because I cant engage or advance on him like I want to. What do you think? Is this the effects of sexual trauma or is it all in my head? I'm thinking about seeing a specialist about this because I want to engage in sex with my boyfriend that I love and appreciate soo much. :( Thanks for listening..

463,"This is going to be long cause I'm mostly venting, so sorry. Also on mobile. 

TLDR: Didn't get the raise I was expecting after busting my ass for this company, probably cause it was my first year. Lease is up in September, and my parents want me to move states to be with them. There is a position I want with this company that could be remote, but it would be better to move to a different state to network for it. Idk if I should stay with this company and chase that job, or leave this company and find another job. Also, if I stay, do I move with my parents, or do I move for work and better my career?

Here's the long:
So I just had first my yearly review with the company I work at. Your standard 9-5 desk job in insurance. My boss went through my performance, the feedback she heard from other office colleagues not in my position or on my team, and was all around impressed and thanked me for my work. She said even though I was a new hire, I was scored very highly for my review.  3/5. 5s she said, were impossible, cause the company always says there's room for improvement, and that she's never actually seen a 4 before. So for a new hire, a 3 was beyond expectation, she even jokingly called me superwoman.

This is when she says ""The average salary increase for your scores in your position was 1.5%. Your new salary is $X, which is about a 1.02% increase"". My stomach dropped when she said that. I muted my phone and burst into tears (she's remote). 

I feel so defeated and unappreciated. This is NOT what I expected at all, especially after saying all those ""great"" things about me. I understand I'm new to the company, but I was thinking my raise would be about 2 or 3%. But this is literally $0.33 more an hour, $2.64 extra dollars a day. Wow. 

I busted my ass for this company, going above and beyond repeatedly, doing extra things for teammates, colleagues etc., because I like the experience (I'm almost 22 so I'll take what I can get). I devoted so much of my time and energy into my job, taking on extra projects, etc. To then only get 1% feels like a slap in the face. Idk if maybe I'm expecting too much, or being greedy? But this doesn't feel right at all. 

So here's my dilemma: The lease on my apartment is up in early September. My parents are moving back to our homestate this June, and want me to join them when my lease is up. I want to do that too, but there's not much out there for this company (they do have offices, but no positions I'm interested in). The only way I could move back with my parents and stay with this company would be to get a remote position, which I do happen to be interested in. My company has a major hub/network office with a lot of different positions/teams working out of that office in a completely different state, and if I were to move there, I would have a better chance getting the position in Operations that I want (the remote one mentioned). My boss knows I want that position, and is working on getting me shadowing opportunities and training in order to get there. My issue, is that were I to get that position between now and September, I could be, and probably would be expected to move to that state instead of with my family. My boss knows I want to move back with them, and she's said she'll work with that team if/when it looks like I'll get that job about me moving to my homestate and working remote from there. But now, after this slap-in-the-face of a ""raise"", I don't know if I even want to stick around with this company. 

I don't know what to do. If I leave this company so soon, it might be hard for me to find another job cause 1) I'll look like a deserter/disloyal (I left my old company for this one after just over a year and a half with them for various issues, one of which was not doing my review/raise evaluation when promised-they kept saying wait till May we have good things coming for you we just need time- by then they were 4 months late to review me but moving on), and 2) I'll be moving in September one way or another, regardless if I stay with this company or not. But I can't shake this feeling of being underappreciated- someone to walk all over and take advantage of. I doubt my salary will change if I get the position I want, but if it were to change, I'd probably get an extra 1% to make the 2% I expected, but there's no guarantee, and it's probably wishful thinking tbh. 

I've spoken with my direct teammate/partner (who I'll call C) about this stuff before, when the review process was first starting. She was comfortable enough to tell me she was hired in at a salary a laughable 3k less than what I was hired in at. I was hired in at the industry average, maybe a little less even, but C was not, despite having years beyond me in experience (she's in her 50s). She said that every year she got 2 to 3% (which is what I was expecting), which she laughingly said was just enough to keep up with inflation. She doesn't think our company cares about competition because they can just replace us easy (basic gruntwork, standard position for insurance, we're a dime a dozen). For the past 3 years, she has worked so much overtime that she essentially gave herself the raises she thought she deserved. As of last year, she had worked enough overtime to make an extra 3.5K- no joke. This woman works herself to death for this. I have to kind of fight her about not taking vacation because she wants that overtime (when I can tell she's completely burnt out, I push her to take a Friday off and rest, not often though cause it's not my business). 

I don't want to have to give up so much of my personal life just to get the money I think I'm worth, but with a ""raise"" like that, I might just have to copy C. I only do overtime when it's absolutely needed, otherwise, it can wait until tomorrow (our deadlines aren't that strict). 

I just don't know what to do. This year is already turning into a disaster. The only thing I'm certain of is that I'm moving states in September, but do I chose my family, or my career?",14Mar2019,1

465,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

So, like the title said... I am 26 years old, and having no clue what to do with my life... or rather, I do have some clue, but I don't know how to achieve those things. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, I was pretty good and interested in STEM subjects, but my family was poor so I missed out on going to a university, thus I went to work on cruise ships. I came back with a lot of savings a few years later to find my mother dying of cancer. I put all my savings towards saving her, but to no avail. She left me a small flat in which I live now, so I don't have to pay rent. (my father died 15 years ago)... and now I have no clue what to do with my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dream was always to enroll into a STEM college, but here it is near to impossible without some financial backing, because you have to have perfect attendance to classes, however, part-time jobs are non-existent, so there is no way to support yourself. Also, banks over here don't give out student loans that cover living expanses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about picking up any job I can find at the moment, and while doing that, to do a course in a programming language like python or C++, and try to find a job with that and then to immigrate to another country (legally), where part-time jobs or uni coursers that allow you to have a job are more available.

&amp;#x200B;

What's your opinion on it? Any advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: 26m, europe based, has a flat, no savings, no debt, no certifications asks what to do with his life. Oh, I also speak 4 languages, have hobby-level knowledge of math and physics and technology in general, have some idea of search engines, copywriting and fitness. ",14Mar2019,3
466,"Yeah. This is a bit of a weird situation for me chief. So I have 2 older mates, who are brothers, and I’m into their sister (closer to my age). Can I have you lads personal opinion. Would you be at all phased by if your mate tried to get with your sister. I personally wouldn’t care, but I don’t really know about other people’s perspectives.",14Mar2019,1
467,"I don't know how to react in this situation. To put it simply, my friends and family don't talk to me for ages, don't bother with me, and then call me up or message me saying they want to visit me and don't bother. Any advice would be appreciated. I really cannot talk to anyone else. My parents worry about me being abroad so I don't want to worry them further and my boyfriend understands, but its harsh only having 1 point of opinion. Its a bit long, but I ***really, really*** need some help. I dont want to be the bad one in this, this has been on my mind for a few months now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 sisters and 2 friend groups back in my home country. 2 of my sisters are fine, but 1 is a serial freeloader. She lived with me for a while, tried to steal money, stole half of my wardrobe, had trouble controlling her anger when I called her out on it. I was threatened multiple times and she emotionally abused my parents, which I cannot forgive her over, as my father has a stress-induced heart condition that worsens under stress. Since moving she hints at coming to visit but she hasn't contacted me barely. Twice we have video called, and she only showed interest in how big my house was, I expect her to try and steal and think it's 'all expenses paid'. I love her but she puts in minimal effort and expects to visit me. I understand she is my sister, but after everything I feel used.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I have a friend group who I've known since I was around 12, called Group A, another from when I was 16, who I will call Group B. Group A and I were close but drifted apart and are friends now. They met up with me before I left and expressed a strong wish of seeing me again. Group A created a chat and around december said they planned to visit me. They figured out when and even booked time off. But since then no one is talking. Its not my job to tell them more information,  I have told them enough. I thought their intentions were nice, until talking to group B.

&amp;#x200B;

Group B learned of Group A's intentions to visit me and said that some friends from Group A were using me. Group B and my boyfriend had plotted to visit me as a surprise, but Group B have given up. They only really seemed interested in seeing my boyfriend. Im suspecting a friend from Group B has a crush on my boyfriend but I cannot confirm (she acts different around him, acts a better friend even though we have been friends longer). Nonetheless they shade them. I was ok with them visiting but they haven't even bothered to save up the money, they are going to brighton with other friends despite me saying we would pay for everything except the flights, which are only around 60 pounds return. Before I even left, they also didn't bother to see me, then faulting it on their 'depression, other issues' which I don't take seriously. So now, it looks like no one wants to visit me.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot possibly go back home until summer of this year, so understandably I just want someone to visit. Even if I visited them, they probably wouldn't do anything special for me like I would, and do, to them. It's been hard to me too, as I live in Scandinavia, and the past 6 months have been lonely and dark. I feel nobody cares for me. Im useless, I can offer the world yet people don't want to be my friend. If i cut them off they would talk about me behind my back and get a worse reputation than I already have for being the ex-weird kid and upsetting a friend from group B ONCE because she was bitchy I got with my current boyfriend because of I remarked ""dont let me talk to guys"" around 6 months prior to getting with my current boyfriend around a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Group B twisted my views of Group A now it looks like both can't be bothered to visit despite offers from me.  My sister just wants to visit to leech off of me because we are well off. I feel more and more depressed day by day. Nobody is here for me, nobody wants to listen to my sadness. Im just a free holiday, someone to use. I don't know what to do, let them walk all over me, or not allow it and get gossiped about. Am I wrong to think this??",14Mar2019,3

They are all in super bad places in their life now, and getting into bad shit and drugs and drinking all the time and it’s just pure negative energy to me. I remember being surrounded by people like that in that town and feeling like I had to do it to fit in and it’s just toxic. Everyone there knows everyone and talks about everyone. I feel like they two behind my back too and spread rumours and secretly try to wreck others lives for their own personal gain. 
Every time I see one of them msg me I just don’t feel good. I know it’s going to be pointless drama that I am better off not hearing about cause I don’t care! But I’m always nice to them and try to just brush it off. 
And I get so terrified of bumping into them while with my boyfriend (who can get super jealous and super mean about things too honestly).. and i stress because these friends just say embarrassing stuff or stories to me in front of him, or just put me in a weird spot. 
I’m just so done with everyone I use to know. They’re not good for my mental health and I just hope I could enjoy my trip without anyone seeing me back for those 10 days.. I know we’re going to be out doing lots so it’s going to be hard and im not going to just hide in a house to avoid being seen. I can just see one of them running up to my while I’m with my boyfriend and our son and just saying stuff that will embarrass me or get my bf mad at me. (For instance when my bf and I broke up 2 years ago I talked to a guy who was a friend to one of those friends, and they kind of set me up to talk to him, cause my bf was busy with this other girl, and I needed someone to talk to.. it never turned into anything more than that and I stopped talking and eventually got back with my boyfriend, but he doesn’t know about that cause he doesn’t need to know. He was doing worst.) But he’s the type who would still try to make me feel guilty about it or get mad at me about it and that’s the last thing I was during our trip. I’m scared we’re going to run into that guy or one of my friends will ask me in front of my bf if I still talk to him. i know I’m the problem for A lot of my feelings, it could’ve been prevented if I made better choices in life.

478,"A few weeks ago, I posted to a confession forum about an event that happened at my work. 

Three men were beating and attempting to pull this girl into their truck, and I had been the one to confront them, and then call up my management staff in order to stop them. They drove away after we all got there, and the girl had noticeable welts and was hurt. From what I saw, it was a near kidnapping. 

Now, I didn't want to spread the story around at work because it wasn't really other people's business. I figured the management would take care of the police contact in order to look over the cams, and we wouldn't have an issue with it. People would ask about what happened, and I would tell them the quick and simple of it, and THAT'S IT. I wouldn't give explicit details, because in reality it wasn't their business. Overall, I shouldn't have said anything... but I did. 

Now, yesterday... a fellow coworker came up to me after we had closed the store and told me she heard the rumors that ""I had spread around about the girl nearly getting kidnapped"" and it's fake. 

I asked her what she was talking about, and she said she had talked to a supervisor about what had happened that night (someone who wasn't even there...  and a girl who definitely isn't a fan of mine) and that supervisor told her that I was lying. That I was just overreacting and that it was just a misunderstanding from a few people that night (as in, those people were just arguing outside of our store... they weren't hitting or attempting to grab that girl outside). She then proceeded to tell me that the managers didn't even call the police, and that a ""kidnapping incident"" outside of our store is practically an *every week occurrence*. 

#bullshit

Ok... so this upset me a little bit. We were on our way out anyways, so I just told her what actually happened... told her to not spread the story, and left. I called my dad (because he was the one who I had told the full story to and he had given me advice beforehand about the incident) and told him about what this person told me. I was a little uncomfortable with the fact that, because this supervisor doesn't like me, she has no issue saying that all I do is spread lies, as well as telling another girl at the store that kidnappings were very common near our store. AS WELL AS SAYING THE MANAGEMENT DIDN'T EVEN CALL THE COPS ABOUT THE INCIDENT! 

The amount of stupidity is astounding. 

But now, I pretty much lost credibility at my store... because this one person heard something they shouldn't have, because people need to know absolutely everything. So now, because she is a supervisor, she thinks she knows all, and is telling people lies. 

What do I do? Should I just drop it? I feel like I just lost a ton of credibility and trust from people; and it sucks because it was really tough to run outside and see this happening to this girl before. My post about the incident is still up, and in that it shows how upset I was about the entire thing. I wouldn't lie about that... especially something so serious. 

tl;dr: I got called a liar about an incident I was the first person responding to... and a story is spreading about how my side of it was fake, and nothing was done for the girl who was nearly kidnapped. ",14Mar2019,1

480,"I am a new employee who is working for a rather nice company. One of the perks I am offered is subsidized rides to and from work. There's a co-worker who's route coincides with mine. Let's call her Ichigo. I log in at 10AM, which means the cab arrives by 9 15 AM. Ichigo boards at 9AM. Occasionally I get her in the evening too, but generally I leave later and play ping pong a bit more, and go home a bit late.

Ichigo has her earphones plugged in, and talks on her phone. A LOT. Initially, I thought she might be going through some family issues which is why she is talking so much. But as time went by, I realized her conversations were utter trash. It's the most random shit. Some Facebook drama. He said/ she said. Laughing at some dude's physical traits. Complaining about not getting a raise. And her voice is SO ANNOYING. Fuck. I want to smash something when I listen to it. It sounds like Dolores Umbridge if Umbridge was a diabetic swine. I have literally missed the cabs to use Ubers a couple times because I had a bad start to the morning and could NOT deal with that annoying fucking voice for 30 minutes, and would pay for not hearing that.

I am building up hate for a person, who is actually just talking over the phone. I just recently realized this (which is what inspired me to write this up). I don't think it's good to hate people for something they might not even be aware of. But I am too scared to talk to anyone in the office, because her term in the company is around 3 years in some weird humanities field (as in, I don't understand the role; not that humanities is weird). And I'm pretty new. And she's a female. And I don't want unnecessary drama in the office ""oh he hates this person, wtf"" and random politics.

I have an apartment for now, but I am planning to find a proper home in a few months, since both money and time is tight at the moment. But that's still a few months of traveling with Ichigo, with no guarantee that I'll actually shift. I thought I'll just suck it up for a few months, but I am really dreading it and I arrive at the office frustrated and negative. Here are some alternatives I tried:

- Headphones. While it really helps during the ride, I can still hear her voice through it. And it spoils the podcast a bit. And it's incovenient to fiddle aroudn with my bulky heaphones in the cab. Also I use them literally the whole day, the cab was supposed to be the few minutes I gaze out the window and have a bit of a breather in the morning.
- Ubers. My wallet burn. I am a slave to the captilalist society. No no no.
- Trying to go earlier. This makes me have to be ready at 8 15 AM.. This ain't fucking middle school, the company provides flexible hours and I want to work at my convenient time. Besides, I show up early anyway and I like the balance of getting work done, and unblocking the team in meetings and discussions in the afternoon.

481,"Hey everyone, so let me clarify a little bit. My parents broke up 8 years ago, my brother has been living with mum (I ran away from mum at 14) and I live with my father.

So my brother (Matt) goes to a private school cause my dad thinks the support networks is better for him there. My mother is telling the school and Matt stuff about me and telling the school to not allow me to see him (havent seen him in 3 months)

I’m a full time Tradie (construction worker) in Australia and often finish at lunch time so I decided to go see Matt and bring him some lunch so I walk up to the principle of the school and ask to see him. He tells me “I see how sad matt is after seeing you” but that awkwardness and sadness shouldn’t be there when I’m talking to my fucking brother , and everyone says to me that he looks up to me as his big brother. 

The principle also commented “it looks like your on the drug scene” because of some stuff my mother told him, He said that right to my face...

Today I go to see matt and I walk in and I tell the principal that I don’t want him calling my mother (like he did the previous time) so I’m talking to him explaining that I want to see matt and I see my mother walking up the stairs in the corner of my eye as I’m talking to the principe. There is a reception office next to the principles office so Im pretty sure someone  in reception called her. I felt like barging the door down and screaming, who the fuck called my mother?

I wanted some advice on what to say to the principle to proceed to try and see my brother, do I just walk to a classroom and ask where he is? And what do I do about the idiots calling my mother?

482,"Can't exactly call this rape because there's a part of me that feels like a huge part of this is my fault, but I was coerced by a friend (""friend"") into having sex while blackout drunk; a friend that I had been very express with not having feelings for, not wanting a relationship or dates or anything besides friendship with, but I guess in my intoxicated and heightened emotional state, it seemed like an okay thing to do. I have zero memory past joking around *platonically with our clothes fully on*. If you want to read my whole thing I posted about it a few days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/azv7y2/i\_remember\_literally\_nothing\_about\_last\_night\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/azv7y2/i_remember_literally_nothing_about_last_night_but/) 

I have a bit of my own narrative, both from things he told me (which he remembers everything, btw) mixed with what makes sense for me and what I know of my behavior and thought process...and despite what the lady at Planned parenthood seemed to think I do *not have hidden feelings for this person*. Before that gets thrown out there. 

I just feel gross and I don't know how to move on and start concentrating on normal things again. It's not like I was attacked or hurt; I feel like my recovery process for this should be relatively simple and yet this is the fourth/fifth day that I haven't slept normally, I can't bring myself to reach out to friends (including one person I'm dying to open up to for both the fact that he is a dear friend and I feel like he would be understanding...plus I feel like I might have betrayed him) but I just can't convince myself it's worth dragging him out to tell him about some stupid thing I let happen.

I'm not a stranger to one-night stands, but on *my terms.* I have used my body for my own benefit, but this is the first time I just laid it to waste for someone to use. I feel like a disgusting, worthless piece of garbage because I don't feel like a victim - I waver between being overwhelmingly angry at him for not heeding my wishes I had ALREADY expressed and between thinking I take all the fault because I practically gave myself up. Stupid me for thinking I could have a fun night drinking with a friend and end up getting fucked. I guess I'm just never spending any time alone with a straight man ever that I don't plan on sleeping with.

What do I do? How do I re-focus on normal life? This is an immature question but when is this going to get better? When am I not going to spend the entire day swallowing trembling bubbles of regret, self-loathing, and anger? My anxiety is through the roof and I'm practically waiting for the opportunity to just throw my hands up and give up. I've only missed half a day at my full-time job to go to Planned Parenthood, hoping they'd have some guidance about unwanted sexual encounters or some help figuring out what happened or moving on, but they wanted my to just talk about it with them in the (albeit empty) lobby. I know they've heard worse stories so mine probably seemed tame to them but I couldn't even stop myself crying trying to explain why I didn't want to just talk about it out in the open. I felt like an inconvenience. But that's all I've been able to open up to... my manager who was worried, and the girls at PP who saw it like a stubbed toe. And then my other post on Reddit that got a response I didn't expect. But I haven't skipped work - I've just been sitting here technically getting everything done while my mind hazes with obsession.

Sorry this is so long. I just have never been in this situation before. This is the first thing even remotely close to this that has ever happened to me. I've always been the strong woman on the initiatory end of sexual encounters...even when I let them think otherwise. But I trusted too much in my own tolerance and my friend's ability to resist temptation, and now I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - had an unwanted, drunken sexual encounter with a friend and now I feel like a disgusting piece of garbage and I don't know how to move on.

483,"I don’t know who I am anymore. In high school, I had many friends, I was in choir (I loved to sing), I was in all the musicals/ plays, I was on the varsity dance team, I was just really involved.

But two traumatic years after graduation, here I am laying in bed completely lost. I don’t want to go into it too much but I lost all of my friends after they backstabbed me, my abusive father ruined the relationship between him and i, my precious puppy that lived 15 years passed away, etc. It was a really shitty end to high school and now I’m attending part time in college because I don’t know who I am or what I want to study. My self esteem is shot. I have been diagnosed recently with major depression, social anxiety, and ptsd, and i’m showing early signs of paranoid personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. I guess I’m just really fucked up.

The hardest part is what I want to do in my future. I hate living in the house I grew up in because there’s horrifying memories and damaged relationships here. I think I want to go away to college but I have no fucking clue what I wanna do. I got accepted to get my bachelors in Dental Hygiene at a uni starting this fall but It’ll be 4 years until I finish which scares me so much... I’ll be 24 when I finish... and honestly this is just a career I chose because the job outlook is projected to increase + it’s pretty good money.

The most sad part is when I feel torn and panicked about whether it’s what I want to do or not I get the question “well what are your interests? What do you like to do?” and I don’t KNOW. Those things I used to do in high school aren’t things I do anymore. And I can’t tell if it’s because I’m depressed and don’t have energy or if I just grew out of it. I don’t have enjoyment in my life and I haven’t had it for the past two years. Real life sucks so bad. I’ve even tried seeing a therapist but it didn’t work. I feel extremely hopeless.

My biggest fear is that I’ll finish school and everything, start my life and regret not finding what truly is my passion and be unhappy for the rest of my life. What if college isn’t for me? What if I need to just live in an apartment with people and make music? What if this college opportunity is the right way? The pressure is eating me alive and it has been for 2 years. Living this way is torture.",14Mar2019,12

I had a bad experience with getting my blood taken when I was younger, and I've never really been the same with needles.

My last experience going to the hospital was really embarrassing because I waited in line for the lab and then proceeded to cry and continuously move my arm away every time she tried to move near me. They ended up telling me to leave because they had other patients, which I totally understand.

I've tried really hard to build up my confidence over the years by forcing myself to keep up with my shots.

So far he’s missed at least 4 days because of a rainy day. 
Last week he missed Friday. And now this week his missed yesterday Wednesday due to “ stomach flu” and he’s missing today.

I’m still yet to see said medication. 
Every month he goes to the dr at least once or twice because he’s “ not feeling well”  either headaches , or stomach plains. I feel at this point my 8 year old brother is a master manipulator and knows how to get out of school because mommy will believe anything and everything he says.

486,"This isn’t the most serious thing that’s ever happened but the situation made me uneasy and i don’t know whether i should do something or tell someone. 

My mum was complaining to me furnishings in our house and how much she hated everything in it. She only got progressively more frustrated the longer she complained. At this point in her venting one of my (two) cats came up to her for attention. My mum yelled at her to “leave her alone” and made a kicking motion with her leg. She didn’t actually kick the cat (i’ll refer to her as tabby) it was more of a ‘shooing’ motion. This isn’t the first time she’s been annoyed with the tabby cat (she tends to be quite clingy) but for some reason this specific moment made me feel really uneasy. 

When I later asked her about she said that  the tabby cat was being annoying. However when my other cat (black cat) showed up she was excited and said hello to her, so I asked why she reacted like that to black cat and not tabby cat. She told me that she doesn’t like the tabby cat because she is too clingy. She then went on to say that she isn’t even sure if she likes cats anymore. Because when her friend was over she was very excited when she interacted with tabby cat and my mum said she doesn’t feel that excited or care that much about cats. 

I thought she was just exaggerating so i said,
 “If tabby cat got sick you would be worried though right?”
i meant that statement to come across as a ‘see you do care the cat’. Instead mum just said,
 “do i really have to answer that” paused for a while and then just stated “I don’t know.” 

Her saying that really bothered me. We’ve had these cats for almost 4 years and i genuinely cant understand how she could be conflicted about whether or not she’s empathetic towards our cat. 

I feel uncomfortable around my mum now and i don’t know what to do. Is this kinda crap normal? Should i feel weirded out? 

I don’t know whether i should tell my dad or not because i don’t know if it would be helpful at all or just create unnecessary drama. I don’t have anyone i feel comfortable enough telling this to. Should i do something or tell someone, or just pretend it never happened?

Out of each eye individually everything is fine, but with both eyes open, it feels funky. Kinda like a vertigo feeling.

Now, I know that there's an adjustment period for glasses. I get that. But I just compared my old prescription to my new, and I'm a little shocked at the change in axis (the number that corrects astigmatism) and it's starting to make me wonder if this is normal or if I should ask for a re-evaluation. My two prescriptions are as follows:

OLD:
SPH	CYL	AXIS
Right (OD)	-0.75	-0.25	+5.00
Left (OS)	-0.50	-0.50	+70.00

496,"Hey Reddit. Do any of you ever feel like I do? I'm a 21 year old male, almost 22 now. Since I've turned 18 or so, I've been in a massive emotional slump, and have no idea how to get out of it.

I was doing well in college, but never really had good study skills so I started failing hard when difficult classes hit. I ended up dropping out for a bit, but I'm starting university this fall. If there's anything I want, it's a degree. However, I already feel like I'm behind for losing and wasting all of this time. At this point, if I do well, I'll graduate when I'm 24. I had a bit of a vision issue occur when I was 19, and it along with the stress school brought completely drove me into the gutter. I would just cry in the back of the class for the dumbest reasons that would bring me anxiety. I just couldn't do it anymore.

At some point, I started running from life and hanging out in a chatroom all day hitting on girls online, and oh boy, that period of my life almost drove me to suicide. I stopped. I can't be on discord or any platforms of the sort, and I prefer it that way.

I'm currently working, and I love my job, but it doesn't pay very well. I'm entry level IT, and make around $35-40,000/yr, which isn't much in California. Additionally, the job has me putting 60-100 miles on my car daily, which feels like I'm wearing it out prematurely. Why do I stress so much about these things?

I'm applying for new higher level position jobs, but I'm not sure how I'm going to juggle work and school in the fall. I'm really worried and wondering if I should just take out loans.

And don't get me started on relationships. I'll do this thing where when I develop a crush, I'll start projecting all of my hopes and dreams on to this person. It used to be really bad, and I would creep on them like a complete shut in. I've gotten better about those things, but I'm still as single as ever at 21. It's depressing.

I don't know, it really feels like I'm just failing miserably at life. My parents constantly express their disappointment, I wanna lose weight, and I'm constantly anxious about everything and feel like I'm failing in life and am not gonna succeed.

Is it ever gonna get better, or am I always gonna hate everything? Why is life so stressful?",14Mar2019,2

They rarely talk to each other but I’m not stupid that I can tell my bf is attracted to my sis or something Just by the way he acts when she’s around. My sis tho doesn’t act the same way towards him, she’s nice to him but not flirty or over friendly. I just feel like he tries hard to make a good impression with her around. Another thing I’ll add about my bf is that he’s a pretty flirty guy. That type where he’s touchy and just up in girls’s personal space even in front of me. Anyways so one weekend my sis came to stay at our house, just to hangout. My sister and I were drinking just us two, outside in the backyard while my bf was playing video games inside. So I get pretty shit faced since I’m a lightweight n apparently my sis says that she was buzzing that night but not wasted like me. I remember throwing up outside sort of, at this point I’m blacking out. The next thing I remember is being in the main bedroom with my bf, waking him up as I came in all drunk in the room laying next to him falling asleep. The next thing I remember is throwing up on the bed, my bf wakes up n gets real pissed off yelling at me and he goes and gets my sister to come get me (she was still outside.) she comes in and takes me and then we go into the guest room just me n her and i pass out. The next thing I remember is being woken up by my sister at around 6:40 in the morning. The time I passed out from being drunk was around 2 in the morning. My bf leaves for work at 6 am btw. I fall back asleep again n We wake up later talking about normal stuff, she tells me she had stayed up all night, everything seems normal. Later on my bf comes back from work and my sis and I are still talking. I go and talk to my bf but he doesn’t wanna talk to me giving me the silent treatment (I know he’s pissed off cause I woke him up in the middle of the night) n then later that day my sis leaves and that’s it. For some reason I strongly believe something could have happened between them while I was passed out. Here are my reasons. 
A) feel like my bf has some weird crush on my sis (so why wouldn’t he take advantage of the fact that just them two are alone together) 
B) no offense but when my sis drinks she’s very easy with guys. She has told me many stories about her sex encounters with guys where she admits if she hadn’t of been drunk in those situations she would have never had sex or gave in so easily. 
C) the other day my bf was joking around with me talking about fingering my ass and he goes “I know you girls like that shit.” “I know you girls like that shit????” Referring to fingering ass. Let me just add he never fingers my ass n I never ask him to cause I don’t care for that. Some reason as soon as he said that my sis came to my head cause a while back I remember her telling me that she’s into that with guys that she has sex with. 
I know that she’s not the only girl in the world to like getting fingered in the ass but Like wtf is he gonna say that when I don’t even like that shit.
I’ve asked my sis about that night, over the phone I didn’t full out ask her if they had sex (I was embarrassed) so I just asked if he was being creepy or flirty towards her that night when I fell asleep. She told me no that he’s never been creepy or whatnot. Idk why even with her telling me no I don’t believe her for some reason, my sis use to lie to me a lot back then. (Real quick a while back my sis informed me that a friend of ours told her that my bf was being flirty/creepy towards her. Just adding that gives me more reason to think he could cheat.)
In my mind I just imagine it went like, 
Me passing out from being drunk, my bf being the one who came on to my sis with me asleep, n my sis just giving in since she was drunk. I know I sound so stupid but I don’t feel comfortable, feel like their hiding something behind my back. 
What should I do? I try to ignore my crazy assumptions but I can’t.",14Mar2019,0
510,"Hellooo Reddit!

So my boyfriend and I try to outdo ourselves every year with what we gift each other and how we gift it. We also give many smaller gifts rather than one 'big one'. This year, I'm making him a big crossword with the clues leading to what his presents are. He'll get the presents when he guesses the word. 

I have a few ideas for hints, but reddit is the perfect treasure chest for asking people for help with this sort of a thing!

My gifts are: 
1. A book written by Tom Hanks (His favourite actor)

2. A Bon Jon autubiography (His fave musician)

3. Fake poop (The one that looks SO REAL - an inside joke)

3. A small Nerf gun (Also inside joke because people drive terribly in out country and we always joke about needing something harmless to shoot at people who cut us off)

4.Play Do and Make Your Own Slime (We are both in our late 20's but enjoy having off days where we behave like kids sometimes)

5. A new capo for his guitar

6. Something from his favourite football team (Manchester City)

7. An eye mask (for sleeping in, in the morning - he works late but finds it hard to stay asleep past 8am because of the sun)

8. A 'travel fund' box

9. A professional massage

10. A surprise lunch date

I'm super excited to see what you guys come up with! Thanks in advance, lovely people of reddit. Even an idea for one of the gifts would be amazing &lt;3",14Mar2019,0
511,"It was a busy interstate during rush hour traffic. Traffic started to cruise, then it stopped. I didn’t realize it stopped, the person in front of me was just not moving anymore. I’ve never been in an accident - never even had a ticket - I’m a good driver. I drive on the interstate to work every single day. I don’t know what happened. As I was hitting the person in front of me, I guess, the person behind me hit me and I was trying to hit my brakes and my car was just being propelled diagonally across 3 lanes of traffic. I clipped another car as I was being flung across the interstate. My car absolutely was unresponsive. Two more cars piled up behind the one that hit me. The person in front of me decided to go to the hospital (they were able to walk and talk) for a minor concussion, I think. I have full-coverage insurance. I just paid off my car, now it’s totaled. I feel like a terrible person, even though there were other people that were hitting me. If I hadn’t hit the car in front of me, maybe they wouldn’t have hit me, and so on. Or maybe they would have. I’m not even getting any points on my license. It’s all a blur and I know I could have died. I also could have hurt someone else. I did and I didn’t. I’m not even sure what I’m asking - no one is seriously hurt, I’m not seriously hurt even though I should probably be fucking dead right now, but I don’t know how to shake this sinking out of regret in my stomach. I have anxiety anyway and I just...I don’t know how to cope with this. If anyone has ever been in a similar situation, how have you gotten through it? How do you deal with making mistakes? I feel like I’ve just fucked up so bad. I know I have. I just don’t know how to deal with that.",14Mar2019,1
512,"Friend lost a bet to me, I get to trash her hair as a result. She's confirmed I can do literally anything to it, including getting it messy, cutting it etc., and told me not to hold back since she wouldn't have had mercy on me had she won. Right now it's blonde and down to her shoulders. I was thinking about dumping food in it, like tomato sauce or nutella or something, then cutting it a bit shorter. I'm sure she'd be ok with that, but would I get away with going further, like shaving some of her hair or dyeing it? And if so I need suggestions for what to do because I am not creative enough",14Mar2019,1
513,"I have a problem. I'm all for sharing, but there are certain things I pay for so only I can eat them. My family doesn't seem to understand boundaries and labels on food, and instead rip open bags and help themselves. I absolutely can't stand this and will no longer willingly share. 

My home life is a dog eat dog world. If you don't protect your food, you don't have any. My family is completely broken and unstable, and asking them politely does not work. 

I tried to research lock boxes but the ones that pop up on Walmart/Amazon have bad reviews that say they are cheap. If anyone knows of a solid, well reviewed crate, I'd really appreciate it. This has gotten to a point where I NEED to get one or I simply can't have food in the refrigerator anymore.",14Mar2019,0

Rather than go into a long backstory for explanation, I'll just say I've never really had to search for a new residence before and I'm feeling out of my depth. I'm relatively poor and I have several cats, which makes the situation a bit more complicated.

516,"(19F) For the past few years I noticed that I have anger issues and they're getting worse

Everything and everyone ticks me off, it doesn't even matter if it's a stranger, my friend or my mother, every little thing - when someone breathes too loud, is annoying or won't stop talking and so on makes me want to physically attack them.
 Just the thought of doing so makes me feel a little bit relieved. I really don't know how to make it better, I'm in senior year now, getting ready for state exams and people are making me angry at school and at home so I really can't escape the things that make me feel that way. 

At every chance I get I'm trying to look for a reason to start a conflict that would result in a fight. 

So here I am, asking all mighty Reddit for advice and help ~",14Mar2019,2

518,"Disclaimer, I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes Im very angry and stressed and need to write this down as soon as possible 
I’m really stressed and I didn’t know where else to go. I’m bisexual and have a girlfriend who has also been my best friend for 3 years, we very recently as in a few days ago started dating. I am still in school so this all takes place during school hours.

This all starts when I was talking to one of my friends about how I wanted to tell my now girlfriend (who will sometimes be referred to as Sasha) that I liked her, my friend will be called Jane and my other friend will be called Brit, they were sitting on the desk behind me and I was sitting next to FA (fucking asshole) and I was telling them about how she said she likes me but I’m scared to tell her I like her back. And very unfortunately FA overhears and decides he is going to join in our conversation, (there needs to be a little backstory here about FA, he is not only Janes ex boyfriend which is why she really doesn’t like him he is also my girlfriends ex boyfriend back when she thought she was bi, she now knows she’s a lesbian, he also had a massive crush on Brit) at first he starts to try to give me advise (very bad advise he told me to get her drunk and then fucking rape her, I understand this was a joke but it was of very poor taste) he tells me I should just go for it. That night I do actually tell her and I went very well. Nothing happens over the weekend with regards to him but Sasha asks me to be her girlfriend. Then on Monday I have another lesson first period where I sit next to him. When I get there all my friends are quietly freaking out about me and Sasha being together (I forgot to mention earlier but I hadn’t come out to everyone yet only a few of my friends) and FA asks me if I asked Sasha out when we sat down to where I tell him that she asked me I was then talking to Jane about it and the say “I know you won’t but please don’t tell anyone” to which she agrees because she’s a normal functioning member of society. I don’t think much of FA knowing about me and Sasha and go on with my day. A couple hours after I get home I get a message from Sasha saying that her whole science class had found out about us (at this point we hadn’t even been girlfriends for 24 hours) and she was profusely apologising because she obviously knew that I wasn’t out yet. I instantly put my blame on another kid (we’ll call him Austin) who overheard me talking to Jane but then I remembered that he didn’t even know who my girlfriend was as he just heard that I had one and was asking me all day who it was. But I didn’t immediately blame FA either as I thought that he couldn’t possibly be that stupid as he also knew that I had only come out to very few people. So the next day I go into school and loads of people know and come up to me ask me about Sasha and if it’s true that we’re together. We weren’t in school on the Wednesday so that brings us to today where I go into school and even more people know. This is where it gets dark. I had English second period where I sit next to Jane. Everything is going fine until A1 A2 and A3 walk in (they sit on the row behind us every English lesson) I don’t think much of it until A1 asks me if I’m part of the community which makes my stomach drop. I turn around and ask what they mean and they proceed to say that they know that me and Sasha are together and say a bunch of shut that honestly makes me really sad. And I tell them that I’m bi and I really don’t want to talk about it. But they keep pestering me and asking me questions. I turn to talk to Jane who has a really sympathetic look, and I say how I knew it was FA to which A2 confirms. I’m telling Jane how I feel so so incredibly angry at FA but then I  start feeling really sad about how he’s forced me out of the closet which I didn’t want to happen because I wasn’t ready and was still terrified to tell people all three A’s are still talking about me (side note I heard someone talking about me to FA when walking to English). And I start really worrying about my older  sister who goes to the school finding out then telling my parents then my whole family finding out and I start to tear up and start having some kind of panic/anxiety attack about who knows. Jane calms me down but I still feel very betrayed and sad. I then start having a full on mental breakdown and start preparing to run out after class to go cry in the bathroom. Class ends and I manage to stop myself from crying two more times and go with Jane and another good friend to go down the stairs and somewhere more private to talk when A3 and starts trying to ask me another question to which I tell him to stop and go away. Naturally Jane is pissed and wants to beat FA up she then informs some of my other friends what FA has done. One of the friends Jane tells sits next to him in our next class we’ll call her Hero (cause she really is) and she proceeds to GO OFF at FA about how it wasn’t his place to tell anyone and I can see one of FA’s friends (who also told a bunch of people about me and Sasha) glancing at me. We then all get up to do a task where we walk around the classroom and FA walks up behind me and says exactly this “my sincere apologies it won’t  happen again” (which I now realise did sound pretty sarcastic and insincere) he didn’t even look at me when he said it. Hero then comes up to where I’m sitting and tells me that he thought it was okay because I never told him not to tell anyone which is ridiculous because it was obviously implied. We sat next to each other in another lesson and he didn’t talk to me or even make eye contact. Another side note Sasha found out from a friend that I had a mental breakdown and like the angel that she is she calmed me down and told me everything was gonna be okay. 

Sorry that this is really really long I just needed to vent and I doubt anyone has actually read this whole thing but if by chance you did, thank you so much. There will probably be updates for anything else that happens❤️",14Mar2019,0
519,"She doesn’t know my reddit account, so I'm not using a throwaway. We’ve been dating for four years, and we have discussed marriage before. I really want to spend the rest of my life with her, and I don't know what I would do without her.

Right before her father died he gave me his blessing to propose to his daughter. Her father’s funeral is in a couple of days, and I have decided to propose to her at the end. I’ve thought about it since he passed and I think it will be a glimmer of hope in an otherwise sad occasion.

However, I am conflicted on what to wear. The only person I told about this was my brother, and I want to keep this a surprise to everyone, so I plan on wearing normal funeral attire. But I also thought about maybe adding a splash of color because it is a happy occasion too, and I don't want the engagement to remembered by the sadness surrounding it. What do you think? Also is this a good way to propose? Since I'm keeping it a surprise, I haven't gotten much feedback.",14Mar2019,0
520,"I am M24 and she is F23. We have been in each other’s live for only 3 years but in non stop communication. We met each other through work and began shortly dating afterwards. After a year I broke up with her because I was moving to a different school 4 hours away. The real reason was because I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to be in a real relationship and so it scared me. 

After two months we began to see each other everyday. We’d hangout or have sex as many chances as we got until I moved. But even then talked all the time and visit each other. 

It was really good at first. Probably the best out relationship had ever been. But she graduated from college and began her career. She moved cities and it still put us 4 hours away from one another. 

When this happened the relationship had changed quite a bit. Hanging out was fun but the sex became stale and really basic. We both felt we had to hide our true emotions from each other in fear of ruining the relationship. And she began to say she felt like she owed me sex for making the drive to visit her. Which is terrible and I would refuse sex when she felt that. 

She made more friends and we called each other in October to finally figure out what was happening to us or what happens when we find someone else. The call ends with her asking to get back together. I told her to give me some time to think about it because to me this would be an end game scenario. After two weeks I get back to her and say yes. 

But she tells me she thought I would say no and began sleeping with another guy. And that’s fine. It’s her life, she didn’t have any obligation to me. (Still hurts like a bitch) She said she doesn’t think the timing is right, she wants to live her life while young, when I finish school maybe. 

The relationship gets bad. And it’s because she has this other guy. She claims up to this day she’d never date him but she stills had a very strong emotional connection to him. We fight. They fight.  They have a very toxic relationship in short. We talk about everything we should do. At one point recently he hurt her emotionally so bad (didn’t ask what was said) that was was crushed for a week and thought about driving into a pole. But of course he calls and they are fine now.

Anytime some bad happens she comes to me for support. During the time they were apart because what he, I visited her and it was just like old times. Sex and all. But as soon as they fix things up it reverts right back. And now I’m visiting her for Spring Break like we planned but I can tell it’s weird for her. It’s been one day with three more to go. We’ve kissed. Held hands. Slept mostly naked together. But I can tell it’s because she’s letting me and not because she wants to. 

And leading up to this I thought it would be the last time I’d see her. A last and nice weekend together before goodbye. I’ve done all the things I should have done for her when we are dating. Cleaned, cooked, flowers. It’s mostly for me to remember how to show my love for someone when I feel it and it’s actually there. So that hopefully the next time I can do it right. 

Sorry for the long post. If no one reads this that’s fine. I needed to tell someone. My last day here I’ll sit down and have our first face to face conversation about us and it’s end. 

Any suggestions for this week or end would be nice. ",14Mar2019,1
521,"So this girl thinks I was trying to talk her more and be more than friends, when really I just wanted to reconnect with her as a friend and just talk more but now I’m pretty sure her friends dislike me and don’t want me talking to her at all and her friends won’t even look at me, now I’m just getting really nervous and not sure if I should keep talking to her because she said she didn’t want to lead me on when all I wanted was to be a better friend and take her to prom as a friend ANYHELP??!",14Mar2019,1
522,"And I don’t mean like I need validation for my pictures and posts.

Just the more I read the more angry I get for not sharing the same views as the majority.

I’ve been using Reddit for about three years. Certain subs make me think no one has morals. Others make me think that everyone’s trashy. Other make me think that we’re heading to a society that’s gonna be way too sexually liberal.
Other make me think no one cares for consideration. 

Then apps like Instagram make me think everyone’s obsessed with displaying their lives. No one has a bit of originality and base what’s good and what’s bad depending on what their idol celebs think of it.

Then shit like “trashtag” is another example of people only doing it to fit in. Or that stupid three person swing dance.

I feel like no one can just be simple about life and just keep it to themselves.

So therefore I feel alone.

And I know advice is to stop using social media.

524,"Hi there,

In June I will finish my College Degree here in Germany and I got two offers for a job that I really would like to work in. The first offer is from a big Company wich offers me more money (compared to the other offer), they would pay for my ride costs and I would get other benefits from them, but I had to move to a different city wich is approximately 2h away from my current place of residence. The other offer is from a lot smaller Company wich offers me less money and probably will not pay for my ride costs, but the Company is based near my current place of residence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im very uncertain on wich offer I should take because I fear the distance between my family and my Girlfriend (2 years together). Furthermore I have fear of building up a new friends group since the new city is the biggest city in Germany and I don't know anybody there.

In addition to that I don't know how high the impact of the gap in salary will affect my life since I have to pay my own Apartment, Food and everything in both cities.

I hope you can give me some advice :)

525,"So I've been having a lot of trouble with myself lately. I've been fine for most of the time but now I'm in trouble.

 I recently worked really hard for my exams. In fact, I studied almost everyday throughout the year. Here in India, we have board exams and the papers are not corrected by teachers we know. It's a huge deal here. I studied and most of the people I knew goofed off. But still, somehow they all managed to do better than me even though they were failing a month ago in the preliminary exams. So according to them, the examiners were lenient and allowed them to cheat(the education system is fucked up here). I was too afraid to copy and I didn't want to put my efforts to waste. But in the end, I was the one who got left behind. I wonder if I wasn't good enough... everyone who had expectations from me, I let them down.

Another thing that's bothering me is art. I've been drawing for about 3 years now and I've been practising a lot. Yet, people who've just started drawing can make better pieces than me. It's like all my efforts were for nothing.

In the end, I wonder if hard work even matters. Is it just the talented ones that get to be on the top? Does hard work have no value? I don't have talent and have to really struggle to get the easiest of things done. Now I know, I'm acting like a jealous prick, but that's how I feel right now. Can anyone please tell me how to deal with such feelings?",14Mar2019,1

528,"I go to a top college. I was dating a girl, and her friends found my throwaway reddit account on r/asktrp . I made the stupid mistake of putting way too much personal info to the point that it was obvious that the account was mine. She told me she archived all of the posts. I asked her to delete them, and she said ""I'll think about it."" I asked her why she wanted to keep them, and she said ""I need proof that you manipulated me."" She said that she would tell me if she decided to delete them. I believe I never manipulated her, and I know that I never intended to. I explained that I disagree with TRP, but I was interested in hearing their perspective. She said that the fact that I associated with the community and valued their opinion was bad enough.


In all the posts, she found one sentence she found as misogynistic. It was a metaphor that was never intended as such and I believe to not be misogynistic given the context. In fact, none of the views I expressed in my posts to r/asktrp were different from the ones I had explained to her, although they were expressed in a harsher, less PC tone. 


When she told me, it felt very rehearsed. At the end, she told me sternly ad repeatedly to get out of her house, even though I was going to the door with no hesitation. I wanted to get out of there just as much as she wanted me out.

530,"Hey Redditors, 

That's probably a very cliché problem amongst teens nowadays, but I've completely lost motivation on studying for school (sorry for my english btw!). 

I'm 17 and really driven to make money. Like literally. I have a few very small businesses online and a blog which make fair amounts of money every month. I feel like school is just holding me back and I am thinking of dropping out, being a stupid teenager as I am. If I dropped out, I could be making enough money to fully support myself and grow the businesses too. 

Since wages in my country aren't very high, I feel like it's just useless to study for my next exam. I don't want to work for someone my entire life, living paycheck to paycheck. That's what schools basically teach us to do. I'm even having a test tomorrow, but I can't seem to concentrate due to how unmotivated I am towards studying.

532,"Throw away for privacy reasons and I'll do a dl:dr at the bottom cause this might get long.

Im a 23 year old single father of an amazing four year old girl. It was a surprise pregnancy with my now ex wife who I married out of pressure from both our families to do so. After a year of trying to make it work, we both agreed to split before it started affecting our relationship. We both still care about each other and are great friends even now, we just don't love each other that way. When we finally did split we agreed to do an amicable divorce and because I had already dropped college and was working as a ""chef"" at an upscale steak house and she was in college it was decided that I would be a better role for primary custody. I had a lot of help still from family but I worked two jobs early on and had to live with my mother for a year.

Fast forward to about a year and a half, I moved on to self learning IT and have a great job that pays me well especially for my age. I have my own apartment that we have just moved into and am still the primary custody holder. It's been almost two years since the divorce so I decided it was time to start looking again. I started using bumble but at this point I just don't feel like hookups are what I'm looking for in my situation. I'm also not looking for someone to play step mom. I wanted someone to date me for me and my daughter just be a part of that, but i don't need a mom for her. Her mom is a fantastic mother and I respect her mom and the sacrifices she has to make as well. 

I front load my height on the app profile because I'm sitting at 5'6 and while height doesn't bother me (I've happily dated someone 4 inches taller that me) I get some people have an issue so if that's a problem for them I'm fine with them passing me from the start.  In the last year and a half to present day I have dated three different girls age ranging from 21-24. In all of these relationships things have gone fine, really not much fighting at all and the last one we only had one small fight early on. I don't feel like i tried to rush anything and definitely wasn't dropping the love bomb early on. I ended up having a first meeting with quite a few more than three but if I didn't think they would be a good fit obviously I wouldn't continue with them. I say that because I would wait till after the first real date to tell them about my daughter and let them decide if that was too much. A few did say yes and that was fine no hard feelings. Three of them said yes over this time frame. 

All of them ended pretty much the same way. ""You're an amazing guy and I really feel like if the situation was different we could make this work and last, I just don't see myself with a child in my relationship any time soon."" I've gotten the same advice from everyone basically saying well they weren't ""the one"" and hey just be single for a while figure yourself out. Unfortunately the advice I'm getting is from college students or recently graduated ones and my parents. But the truth of all of this is and the reason I've typed all this out is, it fucking sucks doing all of this almost alone. I work my 9-5 m-f. I pick my daughter up from her after school care program and I make us dinner or meet up with the family or close friends. We go home and I play with her till it's bedtime and then it's just me on the couch or on my computer before it's lights out again. The weekends are my daughter and I's time to get out and enjoy fun things to do around the city. Who I was seeing at the time was also always welcome to come to these and only one time did it not go well. Friday night is the one day a week my mom consistently comes to watch her and spend time with her so I can go out and try and be a 23 year old for the night. This was typically also the night I would have dates but mom always offers if I wanna add a night to that. My daughter is first and foremost the most important thing in my life and I'd stay single till she goes to college if that was best for her. But I'm just lonely. 

So I guess i don't know what else I can give in backstory but I'll reply to you if you want more info with in reason. Any advice or ideas is greatly appreciated even if it's just wait which is what I expect. Thanks guys :)

533,"TLDR: Failed miserably during my first two quarters of school. I have the option to switch majors for one last try (losing financial aid and gaining loads of loans), or drop out of school, work for a little bit then join the military to secure a job, tuition, and better responsibility/discipline skills.

I'll try to keep this concise. Basically, I'm a college freshman currently enrolled in the engineering program at my school. I failed every class my first two quarters. This happened because a) I let a couple of assignments pass by undone b) I fail to make up said assignments c) I become anxious/depressed because of missing the assignments and having a lower class grade and d) I stop going to class due to anxiety/depression. 

I think the reason this happens is due to a number of things. I don't like my major (I wanted to become an aeronautical engineer, not a computer engineer). I subconsciously feel like I'm not good enough, so I sabotage myself. I'm not very good at seeking help when I need it, despite having some good friends that would surely give it if I asked (it's a lot easier to internalize my problems and pretend they don't exist).

The past few weeks I've known that I will most likely have to drop out of college due to my own ineptness. As a result, I made a plan where I was going to work for a couple of months, build up a small savings, then eventually join the airforce so that I can secure a job, learn better discipline and responsibility skills, and secure tuition for going back to college later.

However, this morning I learned that I have the option of switching majors to stay in college for one more quarter to see if it works. On one hand, I really like the idea of switching majors into something that I'm passionate about, like political science or something. On the other, I would lose my financial aid which could cost me around $10,000 just for this upcoming quarter. I also have a pretty low confidence in myself actually even being able to pass a quarter of college classes.

I'm in the U.K, have anxiety disorder classed as a disability and struggle to get out of my house most days. I have a degree in Graphic Design and have 12 years experience in industry, alongside 9 years with in house experience. Unfortunately my circumstances have changed to the point where being in an office is no longer an option, and as such I am struggling to find a legitimate job I can do from my home.

When working before, I am more than aware I would have been able to do that role from home, but it was the companies decision to deny that option.

There is nothing stopping me from working a regular 9 - 5.30 job 5 days a week, and I would of course be 100% committed to hitting every deadline and maintaining as much contact as a client or employer would need.

I have tried fiverr, freelancer, redbubble, teefury, teepublic, indeed, cv library, totaljobs, reed, jobsite, as well as asking for support and advice from employment support.

The general consensus seems to be that there isn't a single job in the world that would allow me to work as a contracted, permanent employee that works from home.

Does anyone have any advice on what I could do to make this a reality, or have somewhere they can point me, an agency perhaps, that specialises in helping someone in my situation?

I've considered retraining in another field too, coding for example, but my funds are extremely limited and as such I wouldn't be able to pay for new software or computer.

Thanks everyone.",14Mar2019,2

Last night I was visiting and one of the dogs had torn up the blinds through his cage while he was gone. He beat her so bad, with his hand, with a glass bottle, hit her in the head and picked her up by her neck. The other dog got angry and growled, so he proceeded to beat him too. He has hit them with a drumstick, a chain, punched and kicked them,  he bites their ears and hangs them by their collars. They cry out loud and choke. He says that it’s necessary so they won’t misbehave anymore. It’s just so disturbing and it breaks my heart. They’re so sweet. Last night it went on for so long I couldn’t bear it anymore and left.

542,"Summary:I dated this girl. She saw her ex over the winter break(i allowed her since she wouldn't stop saying how she didn't like him
). She then was dodging me on purpose since she had conflicting feelings for me and her ex(who kept texting her even though she did ignore the texts). We talked and she wanted to break up so we did. We go to same college together and her ex is 3 hours away at her hometown and sadly she's basically my neighbor. Anyway, for a month we did no contact since we wanted to be friends but when we had a chat she said she was with her ex now. I decided I did not want to friend with her because I wanted to not linger around a girl I liked and give her space for her new relationship. I also admitted I was a bit frustrated about how she dealt with the issue and how I was angry at her ex for talking to her over the period we were dating. She now is gossiping about me and even said I was misogynistic for being angry about her talking to her ex(which is a natural thing to be angry about). I texted her about talking and discussing the issues instead of talking behind my back and being a coward about it. Im wondering if I should confront her or just continue to go through life. I did not gossip about her and in fact I made sure to not step down to her level and I told people to tell her that I think she is a nice person(she's just angry at the moment and confused). 
Details and banter: It seems she's insecure about something. She cried an hour before we talked (the talk about being friends after the month of no contact). So maybe she's pissed she can't have me and her ex since I used to bring her places and do a lot with her and now I'm gone. Her reaction is quiet childish I my opinion",14Mar2019,2

This semester though, she decided to move into the dorms (her building is across from mine).

She’s good friends with my boyfriend and recently he was talking about a kick-back with his friends (i was going as well), she said the same thing again “Sick invite man” and wanted my boyfriend to invite her to it. we have two friend groups together, and she’s in two of my classes. Sometimes I just don’t want to hang out with her? I don’t know, it feels like she’s kinda became codependent on me and we hang out way too much, which is getting on my nerves.

Anyways, back to the point. One of my friends said jokingly, ""I am scared because you know so much about science and you were born in Iraq."". Well, of course, we went back to what we were talking about earlier. Soon, they said something else racist and extremely stereotypical: ""Do you know how to make a bomb?"" and of course I said no.

546,I'm old enough that tattoos have been legal for me for a while but I still love with my mom. I'm in college and have 2 jobs if that changes anything. My mom always hated tattoos and told us kids that we weren't allowed to get any until we are out on our own. My sister got some long before me and my mom found out and was pissed. One night I decided to finally get one I've been wanting for a while and it was sort of impulsive. I really like how it turned out but now that it's real I'm horrified of my mom finding out. It's in a spot where it doesn't draw a lot of attention but it is visible if I'm wearing short sleeves. I've been hiding it for a week and I'm at the point where I feel like I need to tell her before she suspects something since it's been warm. I didn't think I would be this afraid to tell her. I'm stressing hard about this. None of my friends parents hate tattoos so I don't have anyone to talk to. I know this doesn't seem like a big deal but to my mom it really will be. I'm scared she's going to kick me out and I just can't afford to move yet otherwise I would. Does anyone have advice for me?

549,"Last summer I was diagnosed with intercranial hypertension and 6th nerve palsy. My spinal fluid doesn't drain and builds up creating intense pressure and pain, sometimes paralyzing my eyes, or messing with my vision, and other things. Medication isn't helping keep the pressure level leading to frequent spinal taps. Nothing is keeping the headaches and other pain under control from the pressure.

550,"Okay so, my BF(25yr) and I(25) have been together for 3 years. We have lived with his sister(mid 30s) for about 2 1/2years. 

We both work full time and are in school full time. We can't afford a place of our own right now while still being in school which is why we live with his sister at the moment. I graduate in May and him in August. We pay all the bills beside mortgage, which she pays, and we buy our own groceries. 

We both stay in our room when we are home. We honestly only come out of our room to do laundry, or cook meals. We also have a medium size dog, that we do everything for. She doesn't mess with things and stays in our room, or with us at all times.

Since we have lived with her, everything we do is a problem, and anything that goes wrong is also our fault.

SOME EXAMPLES:
1) last summer, she found a liziard in her room, and it was our fault it got in there because we have the dog that goes outside to use the bathroom. Her room faces the backyard and has its own door to go outside. We use the main door to let the dog out which is completely opposite of her room. 

2) We do the yard work and get fussed at because the grass is cut too short or because theres dead spots in the yard due to the weather.

3) We get yelled at for a plate or cup being in the sink, but she'll bring multiple cups and plates out of her room at a time and leave them on the counter. And then we are left to wash them and put them away or they sit there for days.

4) We are constantly woken up late at night or early in the morning from her having her phone on speaker, talking loud on the phone, her tv being turned all the way up, and just in general being loud. We get woken up to see if we have something she could borrow (ex: charger, or medicine if shes sick). Etc. 

5) There's a constant battle over the air. We(my BF and I) try to keep it at a decent temperature, about 70. We wake up sweating at night because she ""is freezing"" and turns the heat on, or vis versa, we are freezing because she is ""too hot"". 

6) She constantly blames us for the house ""being a mess/disgusting."" Which we do the dishes and counter nightly, and sweep/mop biweekly at least

7) She constantly gets into our food that we have bought (enough to where if it doesnt have to be refrigerated we have to put it in our room), and assumes that when we cook we will cook enough for her too, or if we end up going out we will pick her up something. 

I mean, the list could go on!


We have sat down to talk with her about this stuff and have even asked multiple times for this stuff to change and her to leave our things alone. 


Are we in the wrong for asking her to leave our things alone, and getting mad when we get yelled at over things we can't control? 

We plan on finding a place of our own as soon we we graduate, and we have started looking for places, but is there any other options we could do before then?

Edit/ TLDR: 
BF and I live with his older sister while we are still in school. We pay all bills besides mortgage and do most of the house keeping.

552,"I am 22 my wife is as well. We had our son about a year ago, putting us at 20 when I got pregnant. Before I found out I was pregnant I was kinda a wild child, drinking and getting high on the weekend, I was still in that rebel against my parents stage because up until that point I was taking care of my younger sister and didn't really get to be a teenager. Yes I know I was immature, I still am I'm sure.


So when I found out I was pregnant (no I did not cheat, he is biologically both of ours) we had a long talk and landed on keeping him. She always wanted to be a mom and I saw this as another way to be better than my parents and figured that I would grow to love being a parent. I was very wrong. 


Being a stay at home parent is hard, caring for a baby is awful especially since I don't handle emotions well. I can't reason with him and I end up sobbing most days. Unfortunately we can't afford daycare and I can't take over working because I have to give up schooling to take care of the baby so I'd barely make above minimum. 


The reason I'm the one that stopped schooling and not her is because formula is expensive so I breastfed. 


We (my wife and I) rarely spend time together outside of sleeping and an hour we have before bed because her job as a nurse has long hours. 


I'm miserable and it's making her worse as well, there is no solution that ends with us being happy. We already live at her parents, switching will make it so we can only afford necessities and we'll still not see each other, talking about giving him up leaves her unconsolable and hurts for me as well.

I was the quiet kid and the teacher's pet that sat in front of the classroom, always asking hundreds of questions. I'm the kid that tries so hard for grades, and everyone thinks is super weird. I'm always emotional, crying in class all the time when I fail at a test or doesn't get something right. I wear pinks and bright colours and talks about nothing about movies or books at lunch. I'm \*that\* kid.

The people I hung out with were incredibly against boyfriends or being romantic. I was the outspoken one in our little group, out little group of outcasts. Now, that's changed, they all have boyfriends and I'm left completely alone.

Alone.

I'm 17 years of age and yet I've never had a crush on anyone. My friends say that it's because I'm asexual, and joke that I'm going to grow up and be the old lady with a hundred cats. I know they're kidding around, but it kills me every single time. I've been friends with them since I was eight. They say that I'll grow up to be alone.

Alone.

I don't want to be alone, I want to marry someone and have kids and have a good life. Instead I'm going to grow up and see all my friends have great lives and be happy. I'm going to be alone.

I already know i want to donate about half but a lot of the stuff i paid a lot of money for and still have tags or i took the tags off but have never worn them (the amount i have that I've never worn is insane) so I'm having trouble letting go of certain things if i don't get anything in return for those items.

And just to clarify, I am donating a lot of clothing worth a lot of money, name brands, certain things that I've never worn that i personally dont think is cute so I want it out fast even though i know others may love or suit it better. Other things that I love but fell out of love with so its a tad worn so not sellable but still so cute. And i have a seperate pile for garbage so I'm not donating trash.

565,"I am 18 years old and don't know how to solve the issue I've been having since I've hit puberty. I live with my parents and my brother that is a year younger than me. 

When I was a kid, I was always the good child and my brother was the one always getting in trouble.

Since we both started high school he has been studying way more than me because the high school he is going to needs way more effort than the one I go to. We have a curfew of 11pm and there were some times when I was late a few minutes and my mom got really angry with me. I was never punished for my behaviour until recently but I feel like it was fair. 

I have never been good at maths and it is the only problem i have in school. My mom decided to ground me when I got 2 on my last exam (the grading system here is different; 1-5, 5 being like an A and 1 being like an F) which doesn't even mean i didn't pass it it just means I got the lowest passing grade. She told me that all of my other grades are perfect but I need to work on maths and ended up grounding me until I get a better grade. My curfew was moved and I almost wasn't even allowed to go out of my house. 

I have been also going through some rough time with my boyfriend so my mood was always down and I didn't feel like talking to anyone at all. My mood being down, I skipped school for two days and when she found out I explained to her that I couldn't make myself go considering all that I've been going through for the past few weeks (also my depression has started to kick in again (she also didn't believe me I was really feeling horrible until I brought home the diagnosis of depression and anxiety and told me I was just imaging the whole thing) and I don't feel really accepted in school with my peers). My parents were angry with me but I didn't get in trouble (it also never made sense to me that I got in trouble for small things but the big things just go almost unnoticed and I don't get in trouble). 

The last straw was today when I told her I'd be home around 5pm but got home at 5:30 because I had to go pick something up for a friend who asked me for a favour. She got angry with me saying whe doesn't trust me anymore, I have let her down and that I lied to her saying I'd be home around 5 and I wasn't. She said she feels like everyone is more important to me than she is, that everything was going great for the past few days meaning I have been trying to communicate with them more (I also managed to make our curfew a little later than usual which she agreed on immediately) and that yesterday I was late on the phone with my bf and today I was late home, she doesn't know what is going through my head, that she can't understand me, she feels like absolute sh*t, she doesn't know how long she can take.... Then she mentioned my skipping school like it was a problem now but the last time we were talking it wasn't a problem, she said she doesn't feel like she can trust me and she bashed the hell out of me. 

I don't know what to do anymore and how to explain to her that I am responsible enough to know what's good and what's bad for me and that it isn't such a big deal me coming home half an hour later especially since I have nothing to do for school tomorrow and I would just be on my phone the whole day (which she also doesn't like) locked inside the house. 

She said that I am lying to her all the time (but when I asked her she couldn't recall the last time I lived apart from the class skipping) and she doesn't even believe me I was with who I said I was with and doesn't believe me I was late because of a favour my friend asked me for. She said she will start telling me everything I say is a lie and that one day she will just give up on me (which honestly sounds great because I wouldn't have to put up with these things every so often for literally doing nothing wrong).

I don't know what to think anymore or who is in thw right and who is in the wrong. I don't know how to deal with the pressure she is making me go through because of school and her overreacting. 

I feel like I'm being treated like a child (I know 18 is not that old but I feel like she is treating me the same since I've turned 13). She blames my behaviour on puberty every time something isn't the way she wants it to be. 

I should also note that she kinda has a drinking problem and she gets drunk a few times a week just sitting at home drinking beer in front of the television. (My grandma - her mother also has a drinking problem and is diagnosed with a lot of diseases including depression, memory loss and bipolar and she is also torturing the whole family; she has been to a psychiatric hospital multiple times, has tried to kill herself by jumping off a bridge and most recently broke glass on the door of my aunt when she didn't let her in (my grandma hates her and is making her life difficult since she moved in). She also has really depressive comments every time we come to visit saying she is better off dead and that we all want her dead. Her condition got much worse since my grandpa died a few years ago. My mom is distancing me and my brother from her but she still visits my grandma regularly and then gets home all frustrated and taked it out mostly on me.) 

I smoke cigarettes and she doesn't know that because it would make things even worse but it's the only thing that can calm me down (the legal age to buy cigarettes here is 18). I try to be at home as less as possible because I feel like it's becoming a prison for me and I don't like getting home finding her drunk or just getting home and being yelled at and being put down for the stupidest things. 

The only person supporting me through all of this is my boyfriend who says to talk to them but I tried so many times and got nothing out of it I don't really see the point anymore. 

Also I want to move out as soon as possible but I don't have any income to pay for a place to stay or food or anything. 

Sorry if this is all over the place and if there are any grammar errors, I live in a non English speaking country. I tried to summarise as much as possible but there is still so much more I could write to explain the whole situation even further.

If anyone has any advice, please it would be really helpful or even if you just have something to say or give the whole situation a new perspective please do. ",14Mar2019,2

568,"I've always been terrible with women. I'm young and all people ever talk about is sex, so I find it really hard not to focus on it. When guys discuss i I don't care, but when girls do it makes me angry. Discussing which male celebrities are hot, guy's appearances, dick sizes, muscles, etc really gets on my nerves. Especially since people say ""women are less visual"" which is fabricated horseshit. I know a lot of sexually active young women too who are always talking about birth control and their sex lives. I try not to listen but I can't avoid it. It makes me feel inferior, brings my depression back to the surface and reminds me there is a huge part of the human experience I am missing. It also brings my utter lack of intimacy to the forefront of my brain for like an hour afterward. Women talking about guys they talked to, fucked, etc essentially makes me feel like a piece of shit. I got into a fight with a spoiled, bratty girl over Dearborn, Michigan. Essentially people were saying racist shit ""Dearborn is full of terrorists"", but I thought they were saying that Dearborn had a lot of Muslims. She got pissed off, rightly so, but because of her pompous ""woke"" attitude and her ideas that we are all small town hicks (She recently moved to my tiny town in northern Michigan from a rich area in the Carolinas) I thought she was being a ""smug liberal"". I flew of the handle and told her to shut the fuck up out of nowhere. She said something, I got and and started pointing at her while yelling. She then get's in my face, all the while I'm screaming ""Come at me bitch!"" because she started walking up on me. This fight had been boiling over for a while because she always used to talk about how she preferred black guys, how Michigan was a shithole, how men are rapists etc and I just fucking snapped. I've been suicidally depressed since about late 10th grade, and I used to be very into the whole Incel boards. I stopped reading them because all it did was make me feel worse. Before these boards I already saw women as a bunch of shallow, bitchy cheerleaders, so seeing how attractive girls acted every day combined with that led me to a pretty harsh conclusion about what women want. I looked into TRP, and I never applied any of it. I sat there and stewed, looking for something to prove me right. To prove that I was an unlovable beta, that I'm a pussy and an asshole that deserves to be alone. I've been told I'm good looking, and when my acne isn't flaring up and I'm skinny during the summer months I could be considered attractive. I can't hide behind being ugly, I genuinely just am a worthless sack of shit. It hurts a lot, and I know it isn't women's fault but I can't help but be angry at them. How dare they be insecure? How dare they complain about being ""lonely""? They don't have a fucking clue what lonely is. They don't know what it's like to want to put a gun in your mouth and turn your brain into modern art. I'm very sad and dejected and whenever they remind me bad things happen. I smashed a 14 year old's IPhone six that he got form his dad because he was bullying other kids, breaking their things etc. The truth in he called my mother a bitch to her face, and I lost it. He was playing on his phone, being a smug shit while insulting my mother, because she is the bus driver and had to stop the bus because he was being a little shit. I saw his smirk and lost it. I charged up to the bus, and starting screaming about how he needed ""Shut the fuck up."" I just grabbed it, and I meant to pretend throw it on the ground and it slipped. The case flew off and the whole screen got shattered, as well as bent. If it wasn't for my school I would likely have some kind of record from these incidences. I don't steal, do drugs, or anything like that, and usually I'm docile. But my anger is going to ruin my life. Strangely enough I am not angry at women that are unattractive. I feel like fat or ugly girls get what it's like to be lonely and struggling with intimacy like I do, so perhaps that's why. But I can't get therapy, because my dad will let me, but he mocks me the whole time. He says ""they're not going to tell you anything you don't already know"". Now he thinks my acne is from stress because he is genuinely a fucking idiot. I love him, I really do, but he's retarded as fuck. He doesn't understand depression at all, and he never will. I can only talk to my mom, and she has mental issues to so it makes her upset whenever I let my veneer of happiness drop. I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I also quit therapy because I felt fine, but my depression came back. My dad also said ""I thought you were over this"" in a condescending way and I genuinely considered cold-cocking him in the jaw. I drop some mac and cheese. ""Normal people don't do that."". I break something on accident. He says ""Normal people don't do that."", or ""You're fucked up."". He is not a bad guy but he drinks beer every day and works at Camping World, and when I call him a dumb hick he gets all whiny. So I'm a bitch because I want to kill myself, but when I call him a hick he isn't some big tough tradesmen anymore? He loves me, and I love him. He really does hope for the best. He tries to help, but he's too old school for his advice to work, He thinks a trip over the summer will ""make me a man"".",14Mar2019,1
569,So I am a navy brat. That is a child of a man in the Navy.  My parents have been happily married for 30 years and before that they dated for 5 years so all together that is 35 years.  I am going to school and am still living at home because I cannot afford to move out.  A few days ago my mom freaked out on me saying that I didn’t have any morals which really upset me understandably and then in an effort to apologize confessed to me that one of the times my dad was deployed for a year she had a boyfriend.  I am completely shocked and quite frankly appalled.  I am angry that she even told me because I feel very strongly about cheating and feel that it is an unforgivable offense in a relationship.  I have always been proud of my parents strong relationship and have always wanted to find one exactly like theirs.  My mom is one of the best people I know but I feel so confused about the entire thing.  I wish she had never told me but she did and I am having trouble coming to grips with it...

572,"My uncle, although not related by blood, is one of the only uncles I know from my mom's side. My uncle and my mom were super close when they were younger and she cares deeply for him. My uncle later on started doing drugs and my mom was not happy about it. Eventually he became a full fledged addict and my mom had to cut off communications with him. She told me stories about him and her as kids and admitted that she still cares about him and would do anything for him if he stopped doing drugs. 

Today, me and my grandfather went to a Dollar General store to pick up stuff for my grandpa's place and he also bought a newspaper. We dropped off his stuff at his house and went down to mine. He was looking at the obituaries and went white. 

My uncle passed away at 36 years old on February 6th. It's March 14(as the day of this post was written). I was completely shellshocked at this. He was already cremated but the Ceremony of Life was intended for a later, unspecified date. 

I became very depressed and sad, although I haven't seen him since I was nine, I still cared for him despite his problems. 

Now, my mom doesn't know this. She has no idea. And me and my grandpa agreed not to tell anyone else in our family until tomorrow so everyone has the weekend to process it. It hit me hard, but my mom'll be in a worse shape than I am.

My oldest friends know me very well and I feel comfortable enough to be around them for longer periods of time, because I know they wont mind me wandering off to be by myself or whatever. My newer friends, such as work friends and online friends don't. They're always asking me to play games with them or go out to the pub or meet up etc etc. (To me gaming/talking to people online is as much socialising as irl stuff is) I tell people about the way I am, but most really don't seem to understand. I'll sometimes get people saying 'oh yeah, I'm anti social too', but they still go out regularly and hang out with their friends all the time. 

It's not like I don't like these people, I call them my friends for a reason, but I like being alone the vast majority of the time. A lot of people think I just don't like them or I find them annoying or something, but that is far from the case. I hate being the way I am and am always feeling extremely guilty about it, even so I can't help the way I am.

So I have had about 400 dollars go missing from my wallet. I work as a stripper currently, so I have a lot of cash, which my housemates all know. I usually will just keep my cash in my wallet until I can deposit it..I know it’s irresponsible but I actually know and like all of my housemates and legitimately didn’t expect any of them to steal from me. 
On Wednesday night I counted my cash before I went to bed and had $650. When I went into my wallet Thursday afternoon, I only had 250. I literally didn’t leave my house all of Thursday, in fact I barely left my room. Which means if someone did take it, it must have been when I was showering or something.

Also, they took all the 50 dollar notes I had, which is weird, because I don’t know why someone would think I wouldn’t notice every single one of them suddenly disappear.
I live with 3 people. I like them and consider them friends, so I’m actually very hurt by this.

Called me a cunt amongst other things because I forgot her movie tickets on the counter that she bought **separately** when she decided to crash my friend and I seeing something in theaters for my friend's birthday.

Mocked me and my brother for my mental illness (borderline bipolar) and his AID (he has Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome, it's very rare and is about as horrible as it sounds) because we're ""fucked up"" and she's glad she's not like us.

&amp;#x200B;

Drinks, uses molly casually, and regularly goes to get fucked up on weekdays, but still judges me based off my life choices and claims that I'm boring because I prefer hangouts to clubbing and only use weed and have bad spending habits online. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mocks me for my music taste and makes grand assumptions about my character based off of traits and interests I had when I was 12 and haven't exhibited since I was 16, and disregards when I correct her and say I'm no longer interested in those things.

&amp;#x200B;

Abandoned me in her car at the mall when I was having a panic attack (I'll admit that was partly my fault, she doesn't know how to deal with it and I crashed her and her friend's outing)

&amp;#x200B;

Sits in my room on my bed knowing full-well that I don't like it because my room is kind of my only safe space in my parents' house (see my post history to r/raisedbynarcissists) and when I ask her to leave, she again calls me a selfish cunt.

Anytime something unexpectedly doesn't go her way, she shuts down and pretends she's either dissociating or ignores all of us until we tell her to stop being selfish and let her sit in her room.

&amp;#x200B;

Yells at me and hits me for making small mistakes that are normal mistakes people make. (she screamed at me for 2 minutes in her car because I accidentally cut in front of a marine in line when I wasn't paying attention. I apologized when I noticed and he was very polite about it)

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we're on spring break and she said we would leave Thursday, so I made plans Friday afternoon. we discussed this the week before, but yesterday, she randomly decided we should leave Friday to ""get another day in""... which I'm fine with, but I had plans and I don't want to cancel them just because my sister wants to leave later. I don't have any contacts, tampons, or extra medication for my mood disorder, and after telling her this, she gives me the silent treatment and then lies to me about going to the store when really she just goes to the beach. Now I'm being petty and doing homework and cleaning the condo so she feels at least some kind of guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughs at me when I get irritated with her for doing this shit. It's not funny, it's incredibly insulting and disrespectful to me specifically, and I can't wait for all this shit to bite her in the ass. am I wrong in wanting her to have repercussions for her behavior? I'm not a confrontational person when i know it's a losing battle, but I can't spend more than a few days with her before this kind of stuff happens and I can't be around her for the sake of my own health... what do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - my older sister acts like a brat and mocks me when I get upset about how terribly she treats me sometimes. Am I wrong to want her to fail? or am I just overreacting?",14Mar2019,1

594,"Hello,

I am 19 years old, living in the UK, and planning on breaking contact from all my family members due to personal issues which I would rather not disclose at the moment. My mental health has been very poor over the last 2 years and part of it has to do with my family. I will be going to university in September and that is when I will begin living independently. Since I have social problems, I have absolutely no friends, so I will be completely alone once moving out.

My question is, seeing that I want to isolate myself completely from them, what steps should I be taking to prepare and be entirely self-sufficient? Moreover, are there any important documents, such as my birth certificate, that I should make sure to keep with me before leaving?

Currently, I am studying a full-time course at college and working on getting a part time job to save up some income for the future. 

I am doing my own research into this as well, however, I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could give me some useful advice for my situation because I am very worried about the future. I do not want to end up very mentally unstable to the point where I do something regretful. 

If you have any more questions, please ask. Thank you.",14Mar2019,1

But towards the end, I decided that I was going to work hard and make something of myself. So my first year of high school I focused on my studies, took a few honors and an AP class, and participated in several extracurriculars (a sport, a few clubs, etc.) I ended up the year with almost all A's, and I was satisfied and proud of myself. So I started this year confident, took some more, harder, honors and AP classes, and thought I'd be fine. However, pretty much everything since then has gone to shit. I lost focus, stopped going to most extracurriculars, and my grades have been slipping. School just feels like a massive waste of time, and I hate everything about it. I'm always tired (only get 4-6 hours of sleep) and am worried that I'm blowing my chances of getting into a good college. It seems like I can never pay attention in class and stay focused on my work.

I wasnt really sure where to post this but recently my friend got a new phone and when she was making a new Instagram she noticed that a profile that was not mine showed up with my phone number?? Well I looked up the account and sure enough there is a private account with my name that matches the one she sent to me. I do not have my phone number linked to my profile idk why I just never set it up anyway I tried to set it up and it would not let me saying the number is already in use.

Another thing is that this account that is not mine has mutual followers and I have requested to follow it several times now and have been denied. I'm starting to get paranoid that this account is someone making fun of me or something along those lines but I have no way of knowing and when my friend tried to follow it she also got denied. I have contacted some of the mutual followers but only two have read my message and none have replied. O.o now before you say I am jumping to conclusions I have reasoning for believing this is some type of harrassment because my freshmen year of college I was slutshamed and bullied about my eating disorder to the point that I ended up having to transfer schools.

609,"
I come from a family that my mother makes the decisions. My dad was uneducated and had a close relationship with his family, at the first couple years of their marriage the money from his work would be controlled from his father. My mother would fight with him to give her money to go to the market. 
I was an unwanted pregnancy for her and i understand her cause it was difficult for her to raise me and my brother without money. 
Til i was 5 or 6 we were doing great economically,even though he still gave money to his brother to raise his familly. 
A few years later my dad without thinking made a bad decision,wanted to open a business but he got scammed  hundreds of money( he gave the money without a lawyer in front of the people of the bank by their advice to the dealer) and got in prison for a few days cause they framed him. 
The next years my family's mother helped us when they could (paying our bills,helping my brother to his education) ,my uncle blamed my mother cause she didnt protect my father from losing money. 
We had a place that we rented sometimes but usually the people that we rented the place wouldnt pays our rent for month or even years, my mother and i would have to ""wake up"" my father to stand legally against them. Cause every time he would ask them for my they would say to him that they would do it in the next couple of days,but we knew that it was a big lie and he was to blind to see it.
Im studying a subject that isnt make me really happy,i want to study something else but i am tired of studying and spend 4 years again in the books. I have a choice to go to a college for that but it doesnt have the same impact with a university degree and i dont want to spend money for something like that. 
From 2014 til now my family supports my brother cause he studys outside for his Doctor degree. I had agree to stand back and support him so he can achieve his dream but i didnt think that think wil take such a route that there will be days that we dont have money to eat or money to spend money for something that i want to buy. This case made me to close up, i didnt have any friends to go for a coffee or a support. 
My family is overprotective and if i wanted to search for a work they made me lose my hopes. Which i found out now that it was a mistake and it would help me to feel better and make money to help. 
A year and a half ago was a guy 14 years older that was interested in me, i wasnt really into him. I was scared that if i was in a relationship with him i would my miserably just like my mother, but i liked the attention that he showed me. When my brother found out about him  having a thing about me and we exchanged a few words,i understood that it was wrong so i stop talking to him.
Now there is a guy that seems like he is really nice,hard working that likes me. Hes looking fine outside and i thought that if i get to know him better i would like him more cause love at first sight doesnt exist. I now found out that he didnt finish the school cause he wanted to work for what he loves. My problem with that is, that im scared with his low education he will be judged from my family and when a problem arise he wont be cable to overcome it just like my father.

611,"Some background- I am studying 2 hours away from home at college, whereas my best friend is still in our home town.  She has always struggled with anxiety and the though of going away to school caused her a lot of stress. Her parents treat her like shit, and have kicked her out over four times since she was 13. She has had a boyfriend for about 5 moths now. We don't talk on the phone all that often as she is a part time commuter student and works full time, and I am a full time student. We always meet up when I come home and it feels like we were never separated.  The point is, we don't talk frequently, but I still consider her my closest friend.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings us to today. I woke up at 7AM to study for my math exam, and at around 7:30AM I received a text from my friend telling me I needed to call her immediately. I assumed she was having an anxiety attack, and I always call her in these situations and calm her down. Upon her picking up, I could tell that she was hyperventilating. I started asking her what was wrong so I could help. She said, ""I am afraid to tell you"". I told her she could tell me anything, and that's when she told me she was pregnant. She has been experiencing symptoms, and took three tests this morning. All positive. She then revealed to me she hasn't been taking her birth control, and her boyfriend was unaware of this. She kept saying, ""I never thought this would happen to me."" She is very pro-life, and is adamant about both carrying out the pregnancy and keeping the baby, despite her not wanting it. She has not yet told her boyfriend or her parents. I am the only one who knows. Her not telling her boyfriend about her lack of birth control was a horrible decision, and she knows this. She is worried she will be kicked out, broken up with, and will be left alone with a child she didn't want. I have no idea how to support her. What the hell do I do? Has anyone dealt with something like this?

613,"I kind of just moved into an apartment building a few months ago.  I’m a smoker and have a VERY bad habit of flicking my cigarettes.  I did this and my neighbor one apartment over got really pissed and told me to stop.  He’s right, that was fucked up, and it’s a really bad habit I need to break... so now, after I finish smoking, I 100% put the cigarette out, take the butt back in with me and throw it in the trash.

However, a month passed and I came home and my neighbor was waiting for me at the top of the stairs.  As I passed, he screamed at me to pick up my butts and that I was a slob.  They weren’t my butts at all.  I got a little scared and just grabbed an empty soda can and went and picked up all the butts I could find, all while he’s screaming at me that I’m a slob.  

I’m kind of a mess, anyway, because I suffer from some pretty severe social anxiety.  All the neighbors outside were just staring, and I just silently picked up the butts.

Also, when I first moved in, he wasn’t bad, but he asked me to keep my porch light off because it shined in his bedroom (his window is right next to my front door).  I said it’s fine and I’ve kept it off, but sometimes I can’t see at all to go down the stairs to work.

I’m not a noisy neighbor at all.  I don’t have friends over (major social anxiety), and I don’t do drugs, of course.  I’m really quiet and I just keep to myself.  He’s right that I shouldn’t have flicked my cigarette butts, but I stopped the first time he yelled at me.  Severe social anxiety will make you do that... it’s like I’ll do ANYTHING not to get yelled at like that.

Today, I came home for lunch and there’s a plastic bag of cigarette butts hanging from my door.  I took it off, having a feeling it was him.  After I ate and came back out to go back to work, he’s sitting out in front of his place, and I can feel him staring at me as I get in my car.

I’m starting to get a little scared and kind of frustrated.  Those AREN’T my butts at all.  I know I fucked up at first but I don’t do it anymore and haven’t for months.  What should I do?  Am I being harassed?

It's been pretty back and forth (where she would want us back, continue to flirt and be sweet towards me but never quite let us be without keeping him around) but at this point I can feel my mental health taking a toll (at one point considering suicide- even if it was momentary  I hate that I even got to that point).

623,"I'm looking for a little bit of advice, insight, or just a sound board for this particular situation. 


I have been at my current job for almost 6 years. By that, I mean that I have been in the same facility for
6 years. I am currently in my 2nd position. To put things bluntly, I hate where I am. Let me explain, as
shortly as I can so I don't ramble.
My first position here I came to from working at McDonald's right out of college, because I was getting
married, had no real job experience, and needed the money. Being employed here meant I have access
to health insurance(T1D on an insulin pump), it was better paying, and a steady schedule. After my first
year or so here, I switched positions to essentially help out the VP of my facility, whom is directly over my
department supervisor. Here are some reasons I feel(know) that I am so miserable here:
my department supervisor has a poor attitude, in which she will come in already upset from something at
home and then in turn take it out on us here at work.
nobody seemingly knows how to read their emails-I am a member of this ""fun committee"" board, which
means I help with decorating for our major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, helping come up
with ""fun"" things to do on these days. They're supposed to boost morale, but every time something
comes up for this ""fun committee"", it feels like I am pulling teeth, whether it is to inform them on what
they have outlined for our day, or whether it is asking them to read their emails for the details(and they
don't because they end up coming to me and asking what's going on). I get a lot of ""i don't get paid
enough to do this"" or ""why should i do this"" attitude.
one employee in particular(who's cube is on the other side of mine) is constantly on her phone and loud-
and I cannot bring this up to my supervisors, because they are guilty for doing the same thing. I'm talking
about, this employee is on her phone for at least 8 of her 9 hour shift. FaceTiming with her boyfriend,
calling her boyfriend, etc(I have headphones and a lot of days have to turn them way up to drown her out
so I can concentrate), and I have a laundry list of other issues with her(her attitude mostly).
when I ask to take time off of work, it's always seeming to be an issue. The vacation schedule had
already been sent out, and I had requested off for a couple individual days but was told by my supervisor
""we will have to see what the vacation schedule looks like"" and these days I was asking off for, I was not
going to NOT take them, because I was going out of town for my best friend's wedding, for which I am
Matron of Honor. When I take time off work, I am stressed that when I come back the supervisor will
rattle off all these issues she had with my work, which either aren't that big of an issue, or my supervisor
makes those SAME mistakes(or worse) but still somehow holds the standards for me higher. (and God
forbid you point out she makes those mistakes, nope, in her mind she's a saint!) I am stressed to even
ask for time off aside from a vacation, even though I earn this time off the same as anyone else does.
**my supervisor is also a micromanager, so when a small mistake is made, my anxiety goes through the
roof because she uses phrases like ""you better not keep making mistakes"", and she's also very poor at
disciplining anyone. as an example she bitched at me once and then goes ""i have this problem all the
time with xyz"" and i was floored that she would just openly share things like that about another
coworker**
*When I first started working here, you were supposed to inform your supervisor that you were interested
in moving. However, rules have changed a lot since I've been here. Since that isn't the case anymore, I
was thinking of just filling out applications and when I was fortunate to find a match, put in my two weeks.
I am looking to work at a healthcare facility, as I have my phlebotomy certification. I currently work at a
bank. The reason I am considering even giving a heads up about looking for other employment is that I
am worried(as I've heard stories before) that she will make my last two weeks as miserable as possible.
That leaves me to think two ways, either ""i will make it these two weeks and won't have to see you
again"", or ""i will quit before these two weeks because you drive me insane"". My husband said that he
believes if she acts that way it is to get me to quit before my 2 weeks because then they wouldn't have to
pay me a severance or what time I haven't used. But, honestly, I would like to do this as quickly and
painlessly as possible. What are some thoughts some of you might have about that? There are other
things, but those are my big contributing factors to wanting to find employment elsewhere.

624,"My best friend (lets call him Ben) was always a really nice, kind lad. He was always single, never had a girlfriend until he hit his early 30's when he met someone. Things moved really quick and he moved in with her and her children, and was happy to be a dad to them. I was happy he seemed happy. I didn't see him for a few years as he did the thing most of us do and neglected his friendships whilst he was loved up, but this was completely forgivable as the intentions were never bad. I love the guy.  


I met her not so long ago, she seemed cool, very talkative and not shy which I liked because there was no awkwardness, I was happy for him.  


We now both see each other 5 days per week as he has just started a job at my place, and we car share the 70 mile trip to and from work. He drives. He has begun to open up about her a bit and the relationship isn't rosy. (Who's relationship is perfect right?). She is possessive and controlling beyond belief. He cannot even have a conversation with me during the car journey because at the very moment I get into his car at 7am, she calls him on the hands free in the car and he simply refuses to ignore it. She rudely insists on keeping him on the phone with absolutely inane small talk for the entire journey, all the way to and all the way from work. If shes not ranting about someone who just looked at her funny in the street, shes trying to be hilarious and evidently loves an audience. I sit there wishing she would stop being so fucking rude, shut the fuck up and allow the man to enjoy his commute with his best friend and colleague without having to listen to her inane bullshit. I am at my whits end with it. She calls him throughout the day at work. He cannot socialise outside of work hours because she will be pissed off. He can't sit on the computer game with me unless she says its ok. She is horrible. She oozes bad vibes, and (sorry to be shallow) she is fucking repulsive to look at and her attitude stinks like shit.   


Do I just ignore this or do I tell him to stop being so fucking whipped and let him know I think shes a prize dick head? Would he want me to tell him? What would you do?

628,"ill like you to take a moment to think about who should we marry that would lead to a really good relationship. did you have a chance to think about it?

to have a good answer, you have to be specific in your answer (look at scientists or surgeons as two of many examples of very specific answers)

after you've thought of a complete answer, then continue, but if you dont you should have the chance to think about it

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~

when we ask ourselves who should we marry, this is the current conclusion i've come to so far:

1. you should marry someone that you enjoy being around, and makes you **happier** than you already are
2. you should marry someone that **communicates well** with you &amp; **understands** you well
   1. this part tends to be helped by being more educated since this is learned
3. you should marry someone that is **reliable** and that you can trust
4. you should marry someone that is the same as you (meaning the **same important values**)

these are **basic** attributes/qualities all my friends &amp; ppl have (this includes singles &amp; also those newly married)

in a good relationship, of course both would have these. this is also a good reflection on the future

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

this is about the kind of person most ppl should marry that would very likely lead to a good relationship

**q**: when it comes to the kind of person most should marry that would very likely lead to a good relationship, what are things not already said that are needed? or why are these not needed?

* your reasons for why you have any given opinions is what i'll like to discuss

&amp;#x200B;

im sure (i mean im guessing) that there are good info on the web on who most ppl should marry for a really good relationship, but i've not run across any that i can atm recall

**q**: but do you know of any good things i should look at and why it is good?

&amp;#x200B;

after you've thought about all of this, please reply if you're experienced, and have specific reasons for your opinions, and ill like to discuss your reasons

look forward to it =)

one class is kind of easy but the other i marked as Pass/No Pass meaning there's no letter grade, you either fail or pass.  so basically i'm taking one offical class.  i hate to seem like i'm asking for pity but i just feel like killin myself. i dont know why i manage to fuck everything up and never learn. i have zero motivation towards anything. i have no idea what i want to do with my life but this is just eating me away and i want to know how i could take the best course of action to reverse my fuck-ups.  kind words of encoyragement would help i just cant do this anymore the shame and guilt are eating my life away, thinking of my friends telling me how stupid i am for missing, my parents yelling at me, my FAFSA money probably getting cancelled. this has gone on for so long in my lfe idk how to fix it.

I've been manipulative, disrespectful, and downright hurtful to my SO. The scary part is that I don't recognize that I'm even doing it.

I've been soul searching a lot today and picking apart the reasons why I've been this person. I figured out why I've done the things that I've done. I know that they're wrong and I regret them so much. I feel immense shame and guilt..Embarrassment even. The thought of the things I have said and done is a hard one to process because of these feelings. But I know it is SO important if I am to grow and move forward.
 
I started wondering how I got this way.. I think it's because of how I grew up. My mom mainly raised me, because my dad wasn't around us much growing up. My mom is a disturbingly manipulative person, even to this day. I think that's where it all started. Now I'm wondering how to break the cycle. How to be more aware of my actions and words. Can I even mend this relationship? We both want our relationship to work out..But I don't want to stay if we can't mend things, or if I can't change.

632,"I'm a 22 years old gay male in college. Ever since my pre-teenage years, I find myself constantly obsessing over people. By obsessing I mean keep thinking about them, where they are, what they're doing, imagining possible scenarios in which we meet and have a conversation. It has happened a few times with people I meet in summer camps, school trips and, more recently, college. 

Currently, I'm obsessing over this guy and it's driving me crazy. He's my age, we firstly met because we were randomly assigned for the same internship a few months ago, and thus had to work in group and spent every morning together. I'm always thinking about him, when I'm eating, having a shower, going to sleep, while I'm studying, I'm thinking things like where is he now, what is he doing, when I see him on his phone, I'm thinking ""who is he texting?"", I've stalked his Facebook countless times, I know stuff about his family, I see him with a new shirt or a new watch and I want to know the brand, I notice myself using the same words and body language he uses when talking to people, I want to know who is he friends with, why is he friends with them, I see him talking with someone and I want to know what is he saying, it's just stupid and I feel I'm a miserable creep.

I've tried everything to take him out of my mind, with other guys we just part ways eventually and never see each other again, and the obsession goes away, but with this guy I keep seeing him at college, we're not in the same group anymore and don't see each other as often, but we have many classes together and I keep seeing him. We keep bantering with each other, I usually like to get on his nerves with stupid things like putting used tissues in his backpack, and when he sees them he immediately knows it was me, gets furious and starts to wrestle me like he's pretending to beat me up. I also randomly jump on his back for a piggyback ride because I know he hates it and I do it just to tease him. On the other hand, he's always messing with my hair, shoving me against walls and doors, hiding my notebook in the paper bin, calling me funny names... I've tried to ignore him completely, even being intentionally rude to him, and at first it kinda worked but then he somehow senses it and comes to me, asks me if I'm okay and starts to tease me again to cheer me up and grab my attention, and it goes back to what it was and we keep bantering with each other again. 

You might think I have a crush on him, but I don't think so, I've obsessed with people I don't find particularly attractive. He's mildly attractive, 7.5/10 I'd say, but he's not really my type because he's kinda muscular/bulky and I prefer slim guys like me, he's not my type psychologically speaking either, he doesn't have a good sense of humour and he's a bit tacky in the way he talks, sometimes it doesn't sound natural, I don't know how to explain, but he dresses pretty well. Most girls I know think he's handsome and fit, but has a shitty attitude (he's a bit arrogant because his parents are rich and he likes to show it).

Does anyone have any advice how to stop this, it's not as bad as it was some months ago, but it still annoys me. Am I being a childish idiot creep? I'm sure he thinks I'm an idiot and a loser, and he does not lose one second of his life thinking about me when we're not with each other, yet I keep thinking about him when I'm at home or somewhere else and it makes me feel ridiculous.

634,"Good Afternoon, 

I'm currently working with a Non-Governmental Organization on one of their project they offer. The project is done in phases. I just started one the 2nd and 3rd phase. The first time I dealt with the 2nd phase everything was already planned out, schedule, and budget; they just need people and they offer me the job as Admin and Logistic officer. I had some set backs in the 2nd phase with the consultant, but the Director General handled that. And as the 2nd phase transferred to the 3rd phase over the New Year holiday; the Director General requested I come into the office over the 2 weeks as the transfer happened, and I got paid from the NGO for those 2 weeks. 

Now, however, the project is transferring from the 3rd to the 4th phase, and the Director General said it would take 2 weeks to happen, and that I should come into the office during that time. I then I spoke to the Financial Officer and asked if I will be payed for the times I come into office, and she said yes, but from the NGO, not the project. I had no problem with that.

Now though, I learn from one of the enumerators I was responsible for under the project that the Director General will be using all the enumerator from the project I am on in a different project. And he also told me that the Director General told him that the project will restart mid April, and not withing 2 weeks. The Director General hasn't spoken to me about these changes at all and I have been into the office for the past 2 weeks as she requested. 

Also, today is March 14; we usually get paid every 15, and ending. I notice everyone in the office is getting their 15th pay check, but I haven't receive one. I have been in the office everyday for the past 2 week, like the Director General requested, and the Finance Officer said I would get payed for my time but I haven't received a check today. 

I have nothing here to do. I just read for school while here. I also help the Finance Officer file documents when she asks for help, and I'm also helping an M&amp;E with some logistics for her project. 

What should I do? How should I go about talking to the Director General, and how should I address this not getting paid thing?? ",14Mar2019,0

Health Issues (it's gross):

About 2.5 weeks ago I suddenly out of nowhere I became ill in my stomach and bowels. I thought it's just a stomach virus and brushed it off. Bloating (stomach like a rock), mild nausea after eating, nasty toilet stuff. Also I never feel ""relieved"" after going the bathroom. Sometimes I'll sit on the toilet for 30-60 minutes at a time without going. My stool looks like thin little pencils or dots the size of a pea. Before it was solid and normal. Nothing too painful but definitely steady discomfort.

The biggest problem is, it hasn't gone away! I tried every diet change possible, drinking more water, resting, etc. Nothing is working. Grilled chicken with lettuce and whole wheat bread gives me just as much trouble as ""bad"" food. Honestly, something feels seriously off. I've lost about 10 pounds and take 1 or 2 bites of food before I feel full and have to force the rest down and then suffer the aching in my intestines from it.  I would have to stop myself from clearing a plate and eating too much before.  I have no idea what the problem is.

Healthcare:

I turned 26 in February and lost my parents coverage at the beginning of March. I applied for a plan on the exchange 3 weeks ago. I submitted 2 documents from my insurance company showing I lost coverage. They said I had to wait for document approval and didn't think much about it after that.

So last week (Weds) I finally decided to go to the doctor and it was still pending. So I called them and they said there's absolutely nothing they can do to speed it up and I'll have to wait for a specialist to approve it.

It's still pending today. So I called again today and asked for a status update. The lady told me she looked into it and my documents have not even reached a specialist yet. She said it will take another week and up to a month+ at this point. I was pretty upset. It's literally just a form that says the date my coverage ended from my insurance company.  She told me if i'm sick now she will give me an address to a ""public health facility"". I googled the address after and it's a drug rehab and mental health facility.

I don't make a lot but I can throw $200 on a credit card to go to my doctor. The problem is that seems pointless because at best she will probably want to give me some meds which is more $. At worst she will want to test me and send me to a specialist and theirs absolutely no way I can afford that.

I was up to 4am last night on that toilet and this is seriously messing with my life and I feel like I'm just going to wither away while I wait for them to approve my coverage. The other part of me thinks this is just anxiety and i'm an idiot.",14Mar2019,1

I am 19 y/o male to clarify. 2 weeks ago, i quit my job because my manager refused to cooperate with my part time schedule scheduling me doubles 4 days a week and working 6 days when i am attending full time classes during the week. I was fighting that issue for around a month (relatively new job) until i just quit. As soon as that happened, my girlfriend of 2.5 years broke it off. The job wasn't the main issue it just opened up the main issue being she wasn't happy (we have had this issue for months but never managed to follow through with the break up). Anyway, I have always been struggling with depression but once this happened it went through the roof. Fast forward to today, I haven't gone to class in 2 weeks since it all happened or done any school assignments or anything like that i have no motivation or drive to do anything but smoke weed and play video games all day. I have also lost 15 pounds from not being able to eat because of emotions and it makes me feel nauseous. I have also started smoking cigarettes since it happened. 

This is my current thought process as of right now. I do not care about anything in my life or myself or anybody and i feel guilty for some reason. Here's where it gets important. I have seriously thought about joining the military because i don't have any idea of what i want to do in life (right now a ""computer science"" major, not really down with that 100%) and I do not want to go to school and stress about that and a job. Its my second semester and i feel like school isn't for me. I want to join the military just to feel like i have a purpose, but I am a heavy marijuana smoker and have been since age 16. It would take me months to get clean for a drug test, and i have relied on weed to get me through my life and i've tried quitting but it turns me to an asshole and i get more depressed. I have told my mother about the military, and she loves the idea and says that she will go with me to the recruiting agency right now but i cannot tell her that i smoke a lot of weed and cannot get clean for a piss test anytime soon.

 Well, back in November he was fired for doing something stupid so he's been living off his 401k that he cashed out as well as money from his mom. He never cleans, takes out the trash etc but is always on my ass when something is wrong. Forexample, the garbage disposal broke and he hounded me to call the maintenance guy while I was at work. My friend doesnt have a washer or dryer at his place so during the weekends I'd let him do laundry at the place. Once travis lost his job and was home constantly, he told my friend he had to pay 5 everytime he does a load. He has only been on 2 interviews which he didn't get. I recently started working from home to save money on gas and he kept bitching about how he ""misses peace and quiet"". 

The lease is over on the 15th and I told him over 2  months ago that I didn't want to renew with him if he wasnt going to get his shit together. When I  resigned my portion (60 day) I saw that he didn't.  He hasn't signed the 30 day either. He didn't say anything and basically became a hermit in his room. Ive noticed boxes and that he has been packing for the last few weeks.

Anyway, Travis told me this morning that he was going to the leasing office to resign his portion of the lease and I lost it. He told me he had some interviews planned and didn't want to move back in with his mom. He even cleared the boxes out of the living room.

My friend is going to sign the lease on Friday, after she is paid so that way she has enough for any fees etc. She already paid me for her part of April's rent. I told him and he told me to give it back. Hes now saying that I'm betraying him by kicking him out and letting a girl take his place. I doubt they'll even let him resign since its past the 30 days.  I don't know what to do. Help?

I had an assigned roommate freshman year, became close with her, she left to attend a different school but we stayed in touch. The entirety of this second year first semester ( 5ish months) we talked every single day for hours.  And then she came 5 hours to see me for the weekend. Right when she was driving away from my house I texted her I had a crush on her and she’s never spoken to me again. I messaged her on Instagram after a week of not speaking and when she saw my message she deleted her account. Then she deleted all her other online accounts so I couldn’t interact with her. It’s been two months, and it feels like hell. I really lost my best friend overnight. It’s such a crazy overreaction I don’t know where it’s coming from at all, if she hates me is disgusted by me is terrified I have no idea. But it’s been two months since she’s disappeared and I don’t know what to do. I want closure but more than that I want her friendship back, I’m not sure how a crush could have this effect on someone.

664,"i’m not even sure how to start this, i just have a lot going on in my head right now. oof :( i’m gonna try and keep this as short as possible. basically, right after being made into an emotional and sexual outlet for someone having relationship problems, i started to pick up video games again and tried to find some friends to play with online (which was something me and shitguy did all the time). and i did! i met a good group of friends online and i got particularly close with one of them. 

flash forward to like a year and a half later, we’ve been talking almost every day for hours at a time and we’re really tight. i would say the dynamic has always had a little flirty undertone to it, which of course makes shit complicated :’) and it gets more complicated when around 6 months ago maybe, we both admitted to each other, in verbatim, that we both “have the hots” for each other. it wasn’t romantic really, but wasn’t just pure sexual lust either. or so i thought. 

so we’ve been playing games, flirting, sexting, and calling each other almost every day and it’s been cool! but here’s the thing: when i’m sexually attracted to someone, it’s deeper than just physical attractiveness. i really only feel sexually attracted towards people i, y’know, actually like to be around and vibe with. i guess i assume the same about others but i guess that’s not a thing. because last night, he cried and told me that for the past two years he’s been romantically involved with this other girl and that they were having relationship problems and he’s afraid she’s going to end it. 

so uh i feel a lil fucking blindsided! and played! again! this is the third time this has happened to me :+)

i keep asking myself when is it my turn? when am i going to be first choice? why do i keep letting this happen to me? i don’t have answers to that. but does anyone have any ideas on how to proceed? this isn’t fair to me and i want to confront him, but he’s super not okay right now. i just don’t know how to feel or what to do.

671,"I recently had a long-term plan of mine fall through, and need some objective advice on what I should do next. Long story short, I went to teach English in South Korea but got deported after about a month. The worst part is it took me over a year to save up, get the certification, and find a job over there. Now I'm back home living with my parents without a clue of what to do next. My original plan was to see if I liked teaching with this job, and come back home with some savings and maybe do my Master's in education. Now I'm totally lost because I have to hit the reset button on everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I need some advice on what pathway I should take. I have a Bachelor's degree in Media Studies, and a College diploma in Web Development, but I haven't touched any of that stuff in the 2 years since I graduated. Should I buckle down and look for a Developer job? The truth is I was never that good at it in the first place, but I have classmates who (in my opinion) were worse and have found decent jobs. Or should I look for another teaching job in Thailand or Vietnam? I enjoyed the 2-3 weeks of actual teaching I did in Korea, but I feel this experience has soured that a lot. Or should I save up again and do a working vacation in Australia or New Zealand? A big reason I wanted to teach abroad was to get out of my hometown which I hate to say the least. I've been stuck here since I graduated in 2017, and I feel I need to get out to clean the slate and clear my head. However, I just turned 25 and I feel if I were to waste another year just to realize I want to get back into Web Development, it may be too late. Basically, I'm stuck between wanting to travel (which I've never had the opportunity to before Korea), seeing if I like teaching, and deciding if I should try to find a job in my field of study.

675,"So, currently I'm 20. I'm in my 4th semester of college, going for an Associates Degree in Network Administration. My parents (Mom and Step-Dad) are supporting me while I go through college by giving me a place to live. I graduated from high school in spring of 2017 and started my 2 years in the fall of 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I had an interest in computers. I loved working on my personal desktop whether it was cleaning it, upgrading it, fixing it, etc. It was always interesting for me working on computer hardware. My step-dad works as a Network Administrator and suggested to me that I should go to the technical college he did to pursue the same career. It was an interest of mine, but I was never really fully on-board with that as my career choice. I asked them if I could just take one year off after high school and apply for the fall of 2018. I had a plan for a job working at a local grocery store that pays their employees very well and offers a way up the chain without any degree so I can pay for me living there. Then while working there for the year, I wanted to really find myself, find what interests me, and basically find what type of career I want to work in. However, they did not go with this plan. They convinced me that if I didn't start college now, I would never go and then I wouldn't get a degree. It feels like they guilt tripped me to applying right out of high school because I still lived with them. Now, I don't blame them for this and it's not their fault at all, they were just trying to be the best parents they could be, and I still love them to death. But I feel like they kind of forced me into the career when I wasn't even certain it was for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, fast forward a year, I'm 19, in the 2nd semester of college and my step-dad offers me a paid internship at the job he is working. He talked to his boss and his boss agreed to hire me. Obviously, I took it because I needed the money. It was very slow at first because it was a small business with only about 7 employees, and the boss wasn't sure of my abilities, so he didn't really hand me a whole lot of technical jobs yet. However, as time went on, I was able to prove myself and take on more challenging projects. During this time, I got a real feel of what it's like to be a network administrator and needless to say, I was miserable. The biggest problem for me with being a network administrator/computer engineer is working with customers. I have really bad social anxiety and hate having to talk to people I don't know, even more so when the way I interact with them can determine the status of my job. There was one situation where a lady brought in a laptop on my off day, so my co-worker started the fix, then the next day I finished it. So, when I called the customer to tell her how much it would cost (I think it was like $200) she began freaking out on me over the phone. I know the price is a lot for how simple of a fix it was, but I don't choose the prices, the boss does. I held my composure the best I could until my step-dad saved the day by having me transfer her over to him so he could deal with her. After I transferred and hung the phone up, I had to go cry in the bathroom for about 10-20 minutes while waiting for my anxiety to calm down. I hate confrontation and this lady was making me feel like a failure at my job and I wasn't able to handle it. For the time that I had that job I never had to deal with a customer that bad like that again, luckily, but it still bothers me to this day because if I am going into this career, I will have to deal with people like that and I don't know if my anxiety can handle it. So basically, I was miserable because I had to deal with angry people that didn't like the prices, or they didn’t understand something no matter how much we explain it. (I know, my plan of working at a grocery store would work with people too, but it wouldn't be something I would do for the rest of my life.) So basically, I got a taste of what it was like, and I didn't like it. It wasn't for me at all.

I am trying to motivate myself to just get this last semester done and then figure it out when I'm done, but this whole situation is making my depression worse because I feel like everything it pointless at this point and I have no idea how I would ""figure it out"" once I graduate with my degree. I was pretty sheltered up until about senior year of high school and am still new to this whole ""adulting"" thing and I just feel completely lost.

I have been volunteering at my church on the tech team for the past 2 years. It is a lot of fun and I love the people I get to work with. However, in recent months I have decided that I want to give myself space from Christianity due to its effect on my mental health. 

I have a friend who I met at university. When I was Christian, I brought him to my church and he became extremely involved (hosting Bible studies, going on mission trips, volunteering, etc). He is huge into accountability and texts me often asking if I've read Christian books he gave me or a Christian podcast he sent me. I don't plan to read or listen in the near future but I'm scared that if I tell him I'm no longer Christian, he will mention it to my church and get me kicked off of the tech team. 

This friend and I have confided in each other before that we prefer our Christian friends and wish people could be Christian like us. I feel disgusted to have ever thought or said such things. I'm scared that people will think less of me.

We have several wannabe YouTubers filming everywhere they go, even taking photos in the hallway. Almost everyone here has an Instagram account. We are living our life in the digital sphere.

A few months ago, right after a small accident, I went on a tangent and started making some inappropriate and offensive jokes with friends. This quickly escalated to me joking about pretty disgusting stuff that I normally would be repelled by. I don't know why I did it.

Recently I got hold of a YouTube video that I can only assume was recorded by someone walking near us, perhaps one of the students, filming me saying the most disgusting stuff. The clips were cut and out of context, and there was even some voice modulation. Everything was shown, and my voice was clear. I broke down.

The video now has over five hundred views and from time to time, people bother me about it. I am currently applying for colleges, but I am completely helpless. I know many have already downloaded it and it's not going anywhere.

Text her again, asking why she isn't replying? Should I just ignore her until the mid-term ends and talk to her about it in uni? Should I just not talk to her anymore at all?

Is there a polite way/better rephrasing to say ""please, no hugs""? I feel that because this 'hug people at first interaction' is so engrained in some people that if someone were to say (in almost any phrasing) ""I prefer not to be hugged"", it may upset them.

I don't think it's at all unreasonable to want to preserve my personal space (I'm not extreme in this, I'm fine with a hand shake, and please stay about an arm's length away). It just seems so tricky and frustrating because it seems like either way, somebody's toes are going to get stepped on.

700,"I just moved out into my own apartment back in October.

This was a (not going to name it) East Asian subreddit, where it only features one country. I asked (stupidly) what the people (living in East asia) thought of Anime. I asked because people like to think that anime is apart of this culture and it has become ubiquitous around this country. But I want to know what they personally think because a cartoon shouldn't judge a wonderful culture right? So I got banned. I messaged the ""message"" and the moderator said that it was a dumb question. Fair enough. I told him my intent then consequently got muted for three days. I explained right after that I apologize then explained my Intent. His response was rather, vague. Muted again. Waited a couple of days then responded. Muted again. Waited more days and asked if there's anything I can do to make it up to them. Then I asked how come they kept repeatedly muting me, when we could have conversated on one day, back and forth.

709,"Hello thank you for reading. I apologize if this is hard to follow but I am very shaken up.

when I was like 12-13 years old, I was at a sleepover with one of my friends and I couldn't sleep so I was up playing on my phone. My friend next to me, who I was very fond of and close to was sleeping. I made an awful mistake and decided to move his hand and use it to stroke and pat my butt. After I did this, I was instantly ashamed. Instead of doing the awful thing I did, I instead wrapped my arm around his and held onto him as I tried to sleep. He didn't budge, and when I got up to use the bathroom (I was in tears) he was still asleep.

So today he came up to me and said he wrote a letter to me. He said it was ""to touch base"" and let me know all of the things he was doing in life, what his aspirations are. He's seeing a therapist for past drug issues, and gender dysphoria and he said it covered that as well. The only thing is, I'm sad and scared thinking he may know what I did that time and it affected him so he wrote me a letter about it. It's worth noting he sends everyone letters, so I'm not the only one. He also mentioned the letter is for both me and my sister... so if it was about that subject, I don't think he would have mentioned her.

I feel so guilty. if he mentions it in the letter I don't know where I'll go from there but my mental state is already Shakey because my dad has abused me my whole life and I have PTSD because of everything he's done to my body...

I don't know what to do, I just want to end everything. I'm an awful person for what I did. Am I just being paranoid?",14Mar2019,1
710,"Hello,I have a little problem with romantic relationships in college(and in my life in general).Well,I tried to ignore this aspect of my life,but it seems to become more and more disruptive for my mental health.

 Straight to the point,I never had a real relationship(mainly because I'm shy around girls and I don't feel comfortable expressing my emotions).

 I talked with some girls since I started college and it went pretty okay(even dating),but it was nothing more than a simple friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now,it's time to be honest with myself and you guys:

&amp;#x200B;

 It's this girl which I like,physically speaking,I talked to her,but I don't think she is very interested,I texted her and the conversations were pretty bland in general,even if we discussed some interesting topics.When I meet her in reality(we have same classes),she seems to be okay with me(she puts a beautiful smile on her face when I salute her) and we even chat on rare occasions.Keep in mind that she didn't texted me first never ever.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now,the tricky part.There it's another girl which texted me first,months ago(even if I knew her barely) and since then we started to talk and knowing each other better,and I must say,her mind it's sharp.She seemed interested in me since we started to talk but I choosed to ignore this aspect and continue the friendship.Everything was okay until she confessed to me that she really likes me and it would be nice to be something more than just a friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if I knew that she likes me,I still was shocked.Not wanting to destroy anything,I said that maybe a relationship it will be a possibility in the future.She said that it's okay and we must see how things are going to evolve between us.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is: The only girl which is really interested in me,doesn't appeal to me physically(she looks kinda underage and I feel uncomfortable to be around her in public),on the other side,intellectually speaking,we are a match.

&amp;#x200B;

What I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

I should try a relationship with her for experience(I must say,I'm curious as a cat about how a relationship is) or I should keep trying with the other girls(even if I feel like I'm going to fail miserably)?

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say that I'm not an asshole which use others for my personal gain or something,I'm just an confused individual.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I really need an advice because I fell like I'm between hammer and anvil.

715,"Hello.

I'm a full time student and work part time. I was told upon being hired that I could ask for less hours at any time, them knowing I'm a student and only hiring students. I've worked here since January. Minimum wage in my state.

The manager is absent to say the least. I've only ever seen him once aside from when I was hired. He doesn't seem to like talking to employees and forces us to email him. Two weeks into being hired I was given 25 hours when I was told that I was going to be working 10 or less. I shrugged this off until they did it again.

I emailed him that I needed more around 10-15 like we agreed upon when I was hired. He took every shift away except one 5 hour shift.

I was told by other employees that he was giving trainees so many hours because he doesn't feel like hiring anyone while he's moving, despite having people call daily asking for him and about the status of their application. Over 100 applicants. Ok...

The next week, the week after the 5 hour shift, hours returned to normal. Normal as in, way more than agreed upon. I was working every weekend Thursday-Sunday 6 hours each.

It's midterms and I'm more stressed about work than school. I'm a full time student. I'm only working to put groceries on the table and help supplement paying for housing so I have less debt.

So I emailed him again. He schedules a meeting and promptly takes every shift away but Friday. Not what I said at all, but okay. 

I come in today and he hasn't answered anyone from the store. He shows up 20 minutes after the agreed upon time and walks to the office. He barely will look at me. He then proceeds to tell me that I've ""only worked less than 50% of my scheduled shifts"" and ""you only work one day a week. We can look at it if you'd like :) ""

I responded that I've actually worked every day every weekend for the past few weeks. I've been worried more about work than school. 

He just shook his head and scoffed at me. Eventually laughed. Told me ""how it works"", despite having previously told me I could cut my hours. It ended with me saying I'd rather have less shifts and he said ""Okay"" and did some smile and sent me off. Didn't fire me, but essentially said he'd better never hear from me again. I've worked my ass off for this store and I felt like he just took a dump on all of it.

I've worked other places before and never seen such bad management. The turnaround rate is high.

Extra info if it matters? He knows I have a medical disability, just not what. IDK if that means anything but I'm registered with the accessibility resources with my school. 

Boyfriend said to go in tomorrow and take it to corporate and prove them I'm good over time and just take it. Grandmother said not to go in tomorrow and turn in my shirt. I'm kind of with my grandmother but want other perspectives. She's worked in customer service for years and managed the state liquor store for years after that so I trust her. I'm just worried about my ability to get a job in the area in the future. I'm going to definitely apply to other places to find a summer job and just do work study next fall.

Rent money is covered, and I can make money via art for the time being outside of work.

Should I not come back or listen to my boyfriend and just take it? It's not worth $8.15 an hour imo, when I've worked for $9.50 in the past.

718,"Im 16 years old and I played various sports, but my passion was always football. Last year during my sophomore season, I was in a perfect spot to be a full time starter both offense and defense on a relatively talented team (They won state championship this year). I ended up getting injured three different times, which allowed me to only play in 3 or 4 out of 12 total games. I was so devastated because I had lost my spot because I was injured in the preseason. After healing I played a few games but got injured again (both were knee injuries). I remember when I finally came back, I played so hard my coach apologized to me after the game privately, telling me that he was sorry he didnt put me in as much and saw how hard I was working after the injury. He told me that I was playing full time next game (because I always split 50/50 at runningback and cornerback), and I was super hyped up. Next game on kickoff, I injured my ankle really bad and it took well over 6 months to heal. At our last game, I came into their meeting room, around 4 coaches there, and I apologized for not being able to play my best and show them what I could do because injurues prevented me. I was so emotional about it that I even cried a little in front of them. I didnt play my junior year so that I could train and prepare myself for my senior year of football in hopes that I would be able to redeem myself for all the lost playing time from sophomore year. Now, I dont know if I should play. Either way I will be happy, but Im trying to really figure out if the risk of injury is worth it. After all, it is my last year of football cuz I dont plan on playing in college. I want to decide if I should do football or not play football.

723,"I'm asking this because I've never gotten a straight answer. My one friend that knows about this stuff believes that my mom is emotionally abusive.

(Sorry for structure, it's a lot and I don't have a coherent way to order everything)

My mom has always screamed at me when she got really angry. We would go through periods where we wouldn't fight as much, and periods where I was really scrared of her. The earliest stuff I remember is her calling me ""evil"", ""selfish"" and a ""sociopath"". This happened around when I was 10-11 but those words have been bounced around a lot. I still believe I am evil and selfish, and those words caused me a lot of pain.

Last year I planned to kill myself because I believed I was evil, and selfish and attention seeking. I thought it would make my mom happier, because it always seemed that I was the greatest pain in her life. I thought I deserved to die because I had hurt my mother so much. When she first found out I planned to kill myself she said sorry for her words. A while later she said that I was being sensitive and that she couldn't be blamed for words she said years ago, and that me wanting to kill myself was just a way for me to hurt her.

My mom always thinks I want to hurt her. She thinks I clean things badly just so I won't have to clean that again and she'll have to do it. She's said before that I hate her, and that I only want to hurt her.  She said this even after she knew I wanted to kill myself so I wouldn't be a burden on her. In her eyes, if I'm avoiding conversation with her I am either in immense emotional anguish or I just want to make everyone feel miserable, and that I hate her.

After my mom found out I was suicidal, it was a month and a half before I saw a counselor. Things have gotten worse recently, and I asked her at new years to talk to someone and possibly get antidepressants. Then, she said she'd do it the next day. I've mentioned it to her about 3 times since January but I still haven't spoken to anyone about depression.

Many times my mother has said she couldn't believe that I had real friends, because if I treated them the way I treated her, they wouldn't like me. I don't think my mom hates her child, but I do think she hates me. When I was around 12-13 she always talked about how she missed ""her baby"" or ""her child"". I think when I became a real person she realized she didn't want a person.

I used get really bad social anxiety and I she would always get extremely angry at me. I remember once she asked me to go sit somewhere with some girls and I couldn't make myself at all. I started crying and she just got angrier at me. This was in public, and after I still had to go sit there.

I'm used to be an extremely picky eater, and I still kinda am. Every single time we go out with other people or someone eats at our house there must be a mention of how I am a picky eater. How ""it used to be just pizza"". Or how I ""only eat pasta"". Something along those lines. I've always hated it. And usually it's not even true, I just don't like eating in public and with strangers and I'll usually try things in a more comfortable environment.

Last year I also got into weight loss and started counting calories, and I would usually eat under 1000 a day. When my mom found out she got really angry at me, and she said I wasn't focusing in school or taking care of her. 

However, i don't think my mother is a bad person. She pays for my school, she usually let's me get things if I ask. In most cases she's quite lenient with me. I do a bad job of housekeeping, I'm terrible at cleaning, and a lot of the time I am lazy. In a lot of cases her words are justified, and I do sort of believe that I am being too sensitive when it comes to holding on to words she said years ago. 

It's just that talking about this with my friend really made me look at it differently, and the way she handles her anger isn't very good. 

Am I playing the victim here? Am I really just being sensitive to words that were said a couple times? Is this even something serious?

Tl;Dr : my mother's actions and words have had a huge affect of my sense of self, is this something serious or am I just sensitive?

Nobody in this group seemed to pick up on this guy (age 57) being weird or creepy, so I trusted that he was alright. He eventually went to a different Sunday evening group that he liked better. (I talked to some of the people from this small group about their read on this guy, and they said that they didn't see any red flags, but people will show what they want certain people to see. I agree.)

Anyhow, he invited me to his house a few times, and I was like ""uh, ok."" His kids and other people would often be there, but not always. I know now that this was a stupid and naive move, and I've wised up. I noticed there were several red flags I ignored. Here they are:


One time, we somehow got into a conversation about people who couldn't have kids, and he stated several times that if he were ever in a situation to do this, he would likely ""donate his seed"" (his words).

It takes me a while to become comfortable in someone's house, so to deal with this discomfort, I ask what I can do to help out around the house. One sunday afternoon, he responded with ""I'm going to go get changed out of my church clothes and into something more comfortable, but I don't think you'd want to help me with that.""

I was walking into a gas station and he pulled into the parking lot driving straight towards me, honking the whole 25 yards, parked, and got out of the car. I walked into the gas station as soon as I recognized it was him.

He texted me twice over about 2.5 months, and I deleted the texts without responding. Then, he tried to add me on Facebook, so he got instantly blocked. After that, I texted him and politely asked him to leave me alone and explained why I didn't want to have any interaction with him. His reply was ""I am not rejecting you. You know where to find me should you ever change towards me. But to show as how I mean to honor your request, after I send this text, I will delete your number from my phone and your contact information from my computer."" Honestly, why would a 57yo male need any contact information for a 25yo female on his computer?

 Am I out of line to be appalled by this whole fiasco? I know I'm somewhat socially naive, but I'm wising up and trying to see people for who they really are and I'm much quicker to back away when I see red flags. I'd like outside perspectives on this. (I know I ignored some red flags. I learned a lot from this, anf will not make the mistake of being so trusting.)",14Mar2019,0
727,"Me and my gal met last year at a party, we've been dating for 5 months now and we've had a blast together. About 30 minutes ago we just talked about college and how our expectations are completely different. She said that she wants to go into college with a clean slate, no relationships, nothing. She's very independent and I respect her decision very much. I get it, you wanna have fun and fool around and what not, but I can't help but start tearing up when I think about her being with someone else. She said herself she doesn't believe in marriage or anything and I haven't really thought that far into the future even either. I myself want to go the same area (location) of college that she's going to but she still thinks that all college relationships end badly and that she'd rather start the year of college as friends and still be part of each others lives than end the year as enemies or something else.   I'm struggling to let her go. I'm scared that when she leaves for college I'm not going to be able to let go and fall into the proverbial ""hole"" of depression. This might not resonate correctly to any of you but I really love this girl, all I want is for the best for her, even if it means that we can't be together. I don't know what to do except try and learn how to let her go her own way with open arms, if that makes sense .",14Mar2019,1

732,"So long story short, I’m a full-time student taking about 5-6 classes a semester, I am about to finish my Spring semester of my freshmen year in college, college is new to me because I was home-schooled my entire life so it’s a HUGE change.

I live in an apartment while my parents are half-way across the world, and work 2 part time jobs, about 35 hours all together, a week, while juggling school and also babysitting for friends and my sister who live nearby. 
As much as I love my jobs, and I am going to school to be a teacher for younger children, I have a lot of friends spread out throughout the U.S/Canada, who are also in college but aren’t working/only work during the Summer. I want to be able to visit them, but financially I am barely able to pay for rent, utilities, car, phone, etc. 
 
Even though college is fun and stressful, like college should be, I wonder if I should just stop and work just to make money to travel. But I’m not struggling in college, I’m not bored, I just really want the opportunity to see friends. But between having to travel from mid-east U.S all the way to California, Canada, or back home half-way across the world, traveling will not be cheap. But I also want to enjoy life and traveling while I can.

My friends travel back and forth between school, friends, and home, and sometimes I get really jealous of the amount of freedom (?) they get. I know there are people in college who are struggling to stay in, or financially struggling, and really if you were to look at me I’m doing great for a full-time student working 2,
almost 3, part time jobs. But I really wonder if what I’m doing is worth it? Am I going to miss out on seeing friends before we become adults and become busy with ‘adulting’, will I be able to enjoy traveling after college as much as I would have if I went during my college years? 

TLDR: I’m a full time college student who’s enjoying college life with almost 3 part time jobs a week, who wants to explore life a little more.

733,"Hello all,

I am 22 and my brother is 24. We have always been close and he will always be my best friend. About a month ago he invited me to live with his girlfriend of about 7 years, in their home. About 2 weeks ago he told my that his girlfriend split and won’t be living with us anymore.
  I will not drag this post on as I really don’t like putting his business out there. Long story short my brother is hurting and I don’t know how to help him as I haven’t been in a serious relationship ever and my mind has been going some place dark. I have always had anxiety and a vivid imagination, so the other day when my brother spent a couple hours in his game room,  I was scared he would hurt himself. The next day I literally had to slap myself in the shower as I imagined something horrible. Fast forward to today, I found out that he has been writing a letter to his girlfriend, and that is why he has been in his game room for so long.
 
I don’t know what to do if she doesn’t comeback, I don’t know how to be there for him.
I hope more than anything to see them get back together, and see him happy. I’m terrified that won’t happen. To me it seems like she was waiting for me to move in, so that he wouldn’t be alone. The only reason I say that is, it doesn’t seem like you walk out on a relationship of that long on some random  Thursday, she must have been thinking about it for some time.

I want talk to him, but we have never been super emotional towards each other. And I don’t know what to say to make it better, or what to do if he pushes me away.

I’m sure I didn’t do a good job explaining the relationship between him and his girlfriend, but I’m sure you can imagine what it’s like being with someone for seven years. If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d like to know how you handled it, but any and all advice is appreciated.

My brother is an active Reddit user so I will be removing this post in about an hour, as I am not sure If he looks here too often. So please if you have any advice please post it quickly 

Thank you all",14Mar2019,1

Anyway, her replies came later and later, till she didn't reply to me in over a month back in September.

Then she reconnected with a huge wall of text, I replied back, she gave me another reply and then promptly ghosted me yet again.

739,"I (28F) have been in a relationship with my fiancé for several years (recently engaged).  I am very attracted to him, but my sex drive has become virtually nonexistent.  I don't even think about sex or masturbate anymore.  When I do masturbate, I have a hard time orgasming.  I used to have a much, much stronger sex drive...I was thinking about it and fantasizing multiple times a day, and I would pretty much masturbate daily.  Nowadays, I can't fantasize, and I am always dry.  Sex has always been painful for me, so I have always had some difficulties with it (I have a past history of growing up in an evangelical environment, sexual assault, and rape).  My last boyfriend used to pressure me into sex when I didn't want it, and he was very resentful about it if I ever declined him (and I wasn't even having problems with my libido then).  But my sexual experiences have really improved after first getting into a relationship with my fiancé.  He actually cares about my ability to enjoy myself during sex, and he constantly makes me feel desired.  My fiancé is very understanding and compassionate about this issue, but I know it is frustrating right now.  Unfortunately, the anxiety and guilt around this makes my sex drive worse.  

My sex drive has been steadily declining for probably the last 2 years or so.  I don't really know why, and I don't know how to fix it.  I tried getting tests to see if there were hormonal issues, and there was nothing my doctor could find.  I have tried counseling and therapy, but nothing has helped.  They suggesting ""spicing things up in the bedroom,"" but I find myself to be a very vanilla person.  Due to past sexual abuse, I really REALLY don't like anything remotely kinky because it makes me feel degraded.  The only thing I can handle is pretty vanilla.  Even then, I have a hard time with it if he does something that makes me feel degraded in the slightest.  I don't think there's anything wrong with sex (I even teach human sexuality college classes...I'm very informed about it sexual problems, but I don't really know how to handle my own issues).  It's just that I personally don't like anything else.  Now it feels like the things I used to like I don't even like anymore.  Nothing satisfies me or even stimulates me anymore. 

I used to take antidepressants for a while, then I stopped for a couple of years.  Now, I recently tried going back on them, but they haven't helped my sex drive at all.  I'm sure there are emotional factors affecting this (I constantly feel like I'm getting old and ugly and I'm pretty stressed out sometimes).  But I don't know what I could possibly do because these issues are a part of life, and they aren't going to go away.  I don't want my libido to be gone permanently.  I don't know what to do anymore.",14Mar2019,1

I have never really had trouble learning, and if I do I am pretty capable of going over information a couple of times and memorizing it pretty quickly. My short term memory is great, but I have especially recently been feeling... Stupid? It seems like I am having trouble retaining information over time. I'll read something one day, and then remember the main point of it the next day, be able to recite that information, but then feel the rest of the information disappear as I am speaking, leading to me looking dumb half way through a sentence. I have trouble focusing on somebody when they're speaking, I don't retain half of what they are saying, because I can only focus for around 45 seconds. I am CONSTANTLY forgetting words and their meanings. I'll be able to use a word, and then if I'm asked what it means- I draw a complete blank, and cannot explain the meaning of a word that I just used moments before. My biggest issue though is the forgetting of words. I forget words at least three times a day if I'm talking a lot. It's really embarrassing and it makes me feel stupid, especially since I am in school for a really demanding engineering degree, and I am starting to feel like my other scholarly friends are judging me. This has been going on for about a year now. Last year, when I was a waitress and I was doing a lot of memorization at work, and my boyfriend noticed that my word forgetting was getting better, but now, I feel like it's going back to being unbearable.

My brother was diagnosed with ADD, and started taking Adderall for it, but said he didn't like the side effects. I have lately been thinking about trying it too, but all the recent hate against it has made me rethink... Should I be concerned? I just hate this feeling.

However, she is still in immense pain and barely able to walk even with crutches. Due to Backpage going under, she is unemployed and uninsured. She is also currently attending school.

750,"(First of all; Since english isn't my 1st language i apologise for any grammar/spelling errors in this story) 

Alright so a bit of backstory. I went to highschool ( or our equivalent to it (5th to 8th class ) with this girl and i really liked her. I personally think she might've liked me too but im really bad at recognizing signals / if someone like likes me. We sat next to each other 2 times in those 4 years ( Random seating / chosen by the teacher ). 

So after highschool I've decided that im gonna write her ( wich is unusual for me since im very shy and socially awkward ). Some problems I didn't quite thought about at the time really got me thinking after I wrote her. 1st one is that she is moslem and I'm an atheist. I have no problem with moslems but I'm afraid that it was one for her. Maybe her father wasn't tolerating a guy with another religion dating his daughter ( especially an atheist ) or she didn't want to date someone with another religion. She also is one year older than me. Which doesn't sound like a big deal but at a young age it probably is. Even though I am much taller than her ( 6 vs ca. 5,5 feet ). 

But now back to the story. I wrote her that I really liked her and thought she was one of the most beautiful and funny girls i knew ( Which I now realize was probably way over the top ( again, socially awkward and so on ))  So afzer that she wrote me that she kind of liked me too and so on ( I don't exactly remember ) So as stupid as I was I wrote her: ,,Was that a yes or a no?"" And she said that we could stay In constact if I wanted to and we then small talked a bit but im very bad at that so because my last braincell was probably drowning I just stopped writing her ( not knowing what to say ). 

That was 2 years ago and I spiralled into depression and socially isolated myself way more than what would be considered healthy. Im still too shy to talk to any girl on the street or dm one. I really don't know what to do and thats why im asking for help. As far as I know she doesn't have a boyfriend and doesn't really socialize as much as other girls her age would do. What should I do next? Because I really have no fucking clue lol..",14Mar2019,1

Hey everyone. Here’s some context before I start. There’s this huge toxic clique of girls at my school that a couple of my friends have a burning desire to take down, saying that they’ll even go as far to plant fake evidence to do so. One of my best friends, who also happens to be my crush (C for the purpose of the story), and my other male friend (A) hangs out with them but aren’t like the others. C and A hang out together a lot, but there’s no romantic stuff going on between them. 

Anyway, right before Christmas break, I heard some of C’s so called “friends” talking behind her back. Saying stuff like “that’s what it’s like to be friends with C”. I didn’t catch the entire conversation so I decided to hold off from telling her. 

Since my 2nd semester started, a few of the girls in that group joined my study hall class where I sit right next to them. Instead of doing work, they sit and gossip. There’s been multiple occasions where one girl who used to date C (they’re both bi) has talked shit about both A and C and made fun of how they’re always together but not dating and in a “toxic relationship”. I have absolutely no idea what to do with this information. I’m not sure if I should tell C and/or A now, tell my friends who want to take down that group, or wait until the girls in my study hall start gossiping again to tell them.

I’m 5’2 and 16f almost 17 and I weigh about 104 pounds at most. But my weight tends to fluctuate a lot. With my lowest being 90 pounds. I’m naturally a very small person with a small bone structure. And I think the reason it’s so hard for me to gain weight is because I wouldn’t eat when I was little which caused me to have a growth deficiency. 

I’ve tried going on a diet to gain weight and honestly I just feel sick when I try to eat that much. And I love food don’t get me wrong. But eating that much has been hard for me cuz ever since I was little I’ve been used to eating barely anything.

Honestly, I understand where she was coming from, and although I was 'right' about the system she used to randomly assign the shift to me, I feel like absolutely shit. I ended up crying on my lunch break. I just dont know what to do to move forward. I have since apologized for behaved so inappropriately but I really feel like this mistake is going to not klonly hinder my reputation but my opportunities to advance. If anyone has any suggestions or has ever done something like this that they deeply regret please share your experience or any advice. ",14Mar2019,2

I was invited to a party by some acquaintances from college. I am trying to decide whether to go or not to go because:
My on again off again boyfriend for years will be there and a girl that was a friend that he slept while we were on again off again. They eventually ended up dating and her and I just hated each other because I felt so betrayed. He and I really just stopped speaking. Since they broke up, he and I were seeing each other from time to time and occasionally sleeping together (dumb I know). The problem is we all have mutual friends. Almost a year ago we all ended up at a party of one of our mutual friends. Her and I begin having an altercation and he basically got me removed from the bar. After that I told him to stop contacting me. I saw him a few weeks back and he tried to hook up with me but I said no. 

Overall - do I go to this party of our mutual friends or not go to avoid the both of them and the drama? I want to do what is right but I also don’t want to let them being there make me not go and see friends I have as well. At the same time, no one is dating anymore, why should this still be an issue?

Other note is that technically they are both closer to the guy throwing the party while I’m more of an acquaintance. However some other good friends are going. 

TLDR: Ex and his ex who he slept with who was my friend going to a party that I was also invited to. Do I go?",14Mar2019,1

761,"I turn 21 in May, and I am currently living with my parents because rent is high where i live and it was a temporary place to stay while i arranged to join the military or federal service, i do however have a mental health history which is making my joining either service a bit difficult. 

Before today, they've taken away my debit cards because they thought i was spending too much money (despite me giving them rent money on time and on time.

Since I don't really have an option to live that would be as cheap or convenient for me, I've just put up with it, despite things being ridiculous with them at times (getting angry i got home and slept and didn't clean the kitchen despite the fact i hadn't been home for over 12 hours and hadn't eaten any of the food they'd made).

I've thought about just moving out, but I'm talking to them i was threatened with having my possessions destroyed (laptop, tablet, phone, tv, all stuff that I've bought, including all my clothes and a couple of suitcases) and to have my money taken away(they have my debit cards, plus about $700 saved away in their safe) and would also be excommunicated from the family, not being able to talk to not only them, but also my two sisters, and would never receive any help from anyone, and that i would live a pathetic life, alone. 

Earlier today, after they asked me to clean the car, i misread a label and wiped down a cleaner instead of spraying it down with the hose.
This resulted in me losing all my devices (only have phone now because I'm at work) and being told repeatedly that I'm an idiot and pathetic l, something they normally do.

Now, that would be an appropriate reaction if i was maybe 14 and just living there, but I'm almost 21 and i pay to stay there, and I'm really sick of the constant verbal abuse which has caused me a lot of anguish, and I've actually considered suicide a couple of times because of it, and I'm pretty sure I need some counseling for.

Since I've been threatened when wanting to move out and feel unsafe in my house, could i call the police and ask them to help me gather my belongings and make sure i get my money back? I'm sure i have enough money (~$2000 dollars with checkings and savings) to pay for deposit and first month rent in a cheaper city,maybe and i can work 2 jobs to support myself like i do now, but how do I make a life for myself if I do this?

Despite all the problems, I do love my family, and I don't really want the police involvement to cause them any trouble, since my dad is BP. Would this affect his career? ",14Mar2019,1

We've chatted very briefly a few times, after hearing I had no plans he's asked me if I want to hang out tomorrow...I'm terrible socially, but it's better than doing nothing as I've no plans. 

He hinted that he's interested sexually - I asked what he had in mind for hanging out tomorrow, and he said something along the lines of 'I don't think you wanna know' and apologised for being inappropriate. I've been careful with how I've been talking to him as I believe this is his intent with me. I'm not into hookups and I could never date this guy, but I'm not exactly against the idea of sex either (it's been a while and I have needs!).

773,"TLDR: I like a girl who flirts with me but she is dating a guy that I am friends with. 



So I go to a VERY small school where everybody knows everybody. I get along with literally every person at my school I am not friends with everybody, but we all get along. Also, not trying to sound braggadocios, but just about every girl from 10th grade up either has or has had a crush on me. It’s not because I look like a model, just because I am funny and my school has slim pickings. So there is a boy in my class that we will call Danny. Danny is dating a girl in the grade below me that we will name Marisa. I never really thought Marisa liked me too much. To give an example, Marisa’s class went on a kayaking trip and my class was supposed to go the next day, but I convinced my principal to let me go with her class because 1.) I am much more comfortable and involved on their class and 2.) I wouldn’t be able to attend the field trip the next day. So every time we came to a stop on the trip, myself and a few other people in the class that kayaked on a regular basis would grab the people that were not so skilled and guide them to the shore. I reached my hand out to Marisa and she said “uh, I have a boyfriend.” And not in a joking tone. She did things like this if we brushed shoulders in the hallway, or made any physical contact at all. Side note, Marisa is by far the cutest girl at my school, so that had a lot to do with this. So about two weeks ago, Marisa started giving me these little sassy “Hey (insert my name)” and I would say, in a sassy tone, “Hey Marissa.” Then that progressed to her hitting my shoulder in the lunch line, and other things like that. The other day, my class went to get breakfast at iHop during the first two periods, so I just merged with their class because, while I get along with everybody, my class is the only one where I am not really close to anybody. I would say I am friends with everybody in the school except for my class for reasons that I will add in a note at the end of this. Anyway, so for the first period, I went to a room with no kids so I could work, and then the second period, Marisa’s class came into the room I was in. Marisa sat right across from me(not her normal seat). We were sitting at a rectangle table in the middle of the room. She kept kicking my feet and giving flirty looks. And no, I promise I am not just over thinking this, other people have noticed too. Also, this is important , Danny gets to leave school at 12. So I am in Marisa’s history class because I had to skip it last year to make up another credit. My teacher has a jeopardy game that we play before tests. We had a lot of people absent today because of a bug going around at school, so we two teams of two and one team of three. I was on a team with Marisa and she did two things she never would have done before. For one, she hugged me, and she is not one of the people that hugs everybody. Number 2, she asked if I would sit next to her, so I did, leaving about a foot of space so I didn’t get the “I have a boyfriend” response. She then scooted her chair over so that the legs were interlocked. Then every time she would laugh at something, she would burry her head in my shoulder. Now usually when girls do stuff like this, I just don’t react so they get the message that I don’t like them, the problem with Marisa is that I have had a crush on her since forever and always just assumed that I didn’t have much of a chance with getting close to her. Now, since Danny leaves early, obviously she doesn’t do this in front of him, but as SOON as he leaves, she starts acting like this. Danny is one of two people that I enjoy the company of in my class so I don’t want to mess that up, but at the same time, I really like Marisa. What do I do? Usually I would operate by the bro code, but I really don’t want to this time. 




If you were wondering, when I was young, my class would do things like make a “cool kids club” and I would be the only one not allowed to join. Along with two old classmates bullying me all the time due to my past family relationship since they all had the perfect cookie cutter family. Basically, my dad worked out of state so I only got to see him maybe once a month and they bullied me for it. The whole class just went with it though. I just don’t feel like getting involved with them again, really. ",14Mar2019,1
774,"So long story short, four or so months ago i [19M] started chatting with a girl [18] on instagram and things we're pretty cool: just enjoyed talking with her; used to have long, spontaneous and also very serious chats. Immediate psychological chemistry.

Now it just feels kind of unnatural? not quite sure how to put it: our conversations have become less profound and seem kinda forced, with a general lifespan of a few texts.

We live kinda far apart and have met irl only once a couple of months ago: it was freaking awesome getting to know her. We genuinely felt pretty lucky to have been able to know eachother.

Now i feel like i bore her when we speak, and it just pains me to see something like this take the direction it's taking.

Look, i'm all for letting things be and let it happen: i appreciate it for what it was for me and obviously it's something of meaning to me, i'll always kinda cherish our past relationship;

but whenever i let things go a bit, with no solicitations she contacts me and interacts with me and initially seems like she wants to talk, but things kinda end up always the same.

777,"TLDR: My brother misses school, play video games for hours, doesn’t take care of our cat, smokes weed

I am sorry this became a long post and English isn’t my native language. Apologies in advance


A little background, my parents are divorced. I (25) and my brother (22) stayed with our mother. We have no other siblings. My brother was around 12 years old when they divorced. Before the divorce they were not living together for quite a few years as well. My brother was the quiet one and he still has some issues about expressing himself. 

Lately I moved to the city where my brother was living (he is 3. grade Mechanical Engineering student in a really good collage). I work as a Software Engineer and earn quite well as compared to other software engineers in other companies. We share the same apartment and since he is a student and I have a job I pay the rent and the bills and I buy the groceries. He has some private scholarships from some educational foundations. He was doing well before when my mother has been sending money to him. He even upgraded his pc setup. Since he doesn’t have any expenses my mom don’t have to send him money. (And also my mom is working as a child caretaker in his late 40s. I am trying to balance my wealth after that she won’t be working anymore)

So the issues are,
My brother doesn’t really care about his school and play video games all day. He sometimes misses the school and he lives his life as a reck.  He said he intentionally extended graduation to improve his grades to apply for Erasmus programme. But he lies to himself. We have a cat in the house and today when I came home from work I saw that my cat’s water bowl was completely empty and my brother was, guess what, playing video games. My cat is a little attention whore and meows when he wants to be pet. My brother doesn’t really care about him at all. Btw we both agreed on adopting the cat. He sounded like he was going to take responsibility.

The cat has some sort of allergy, we still don’t know for what but we need to be careful, and we both agreed on only smoking cigarettes in the kitchen where our cat aren’t allowed to be in. I was in another city where my girlfriend lives for 2 days. When I came back my brother didn’t really take care of the cat.

And I found he has been smoking weed in the house that we share... This is a really disappointment for me. My mom doesn’t know about this. If she know she may have a heart attack. She is extremely protective about us since she raised us alone.  I didn’t make a scene when I found out about the weed. But I angrily mentioned about that. 

In conclusion, I got really angry about all these stuff and I couldn’t get a health idea of what to do. I thought about making him pay some of the bills since he can afford smoking weed and buying new hardware for his pc. I and my mom actually don’t know what to do. She knows about everything btw except for the weed. ",14Mar2019,1
778,"Today my friend had told me and a group of friends ""Don't come to school tommorow"" and ""I won't skip you"". Now this friend is known to make edgy and offensive jokes, but he kept repeating that line to us. He is also known to repeat jokes multiple times to get us to laugh, but this isn't something that somebody should just say multiple times. His tone of voice was neutral, not displaying any seriousness but it didn't sound like he was just joking. I tried to confront him afterschool about it but he was very vague and dodgy about it. However this could be my fault as I wasn't very direct about the threat. I at first thought maybe it was just a joke because he never really seemed unhappy or anti social but now I think about it more I become very uneasy and unsure. I am also warried about the ramifications for any outcome. If I fail to warn the police and any other authoritive figures many would be slaughtered because of my ignorance. If I falsely warn somebody, I could run into legal trouble by falsely reporting an innocent person and ruin a friend's life. I would appreciate any help given to make a decision.
