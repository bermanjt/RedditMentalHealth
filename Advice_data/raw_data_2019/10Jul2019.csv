7,"For a little context I moved away from my hometown 8 years ago and lived on the other side of the country for a year. While I lived in this other city I met a girl and we had a one night stand. A few months down the road I moved back home. Well about 6 years ago I went back to visit and ended up seeing this girl again, when I saw her I was drunk enough that I didn’t remember anything after arriving at her house. So I go home after this visit not knowing if we even slept together. Fast forward about a year and we reconnect on facebook, I see she has a daughter now but I also see pictures of a guy with her in the hospital holding the baby, the caption saying something about how they’re going to be amazing parents, so on and so forth. I didn’t really think much of it until about a week ago when I visited this city again. While I was in town I met up with another girl who was a mutual friend of me and this other girl, only to find out from my friend this guy in the picture I wasn’t the babies father and that In fact she had no idea who the actual father was. She no longer has custody of the child, her parents do, she has a drug problem that she had before we met so her memory is probably even less reliable than mine was that night. I don’t even have a way to contact her anymore, no one knows where she’s living and her Facebook either has a different name or doesn’t exist any more. From what I remember the little girl has the same hair color and eye color as I do, and the timing is close enough to where the little girl could be my daughter. I just don’t know what to do in this situation",10Jul2019,1
9,"First of all, let me give you some info. I am a 21 year old male from the Netherlands and about a year ago I got out of an abusive relationship. 

I was 17 when we started dating and in the first few months everything was fine. We had a lot of fun and she let me do my own thing. After a while though I started to notice she kept getting upset when I wanted to meet up with my friends and eventually even with my best friend. It got to a point where I didn't even wanted to tell her I was going to meet him because I was worried we were going to fight. 

This continued for some time and eventually I stopped meeting my friends altogether (I know it's wrong now but I felt like that was the only choice). I hoped everything would improve but the opposite actually happened. She even got mad when I was going out to eat with my sister for her birthday.

Some physical abusive also took place but I can handle a few punches. She would lose her shit if I even looked at a girl and I wasn't allowed to make new friends in college. 

So basically she fucking Pavlov'd the shit out of me and conditioned me to associate normal human interaction with abuse and before I knew it I had no one left. Even the relationship with my parents was damaged. That's what she wanted, me all by myself nothing to hold on to but her.

Eventually she got sick of me and she left me. Looking back it's the best thing that could have happened to me but at that time I got extremely depressed and was prescribed pills for my frequent panic attacks.

Luckily a few months later I got in contact with an old classmate of mine online and we are now dating.

The problem now is that I get extremely anxious everytime I have to meet someone new and I am unable to talk to women altogether. I'm also afraid to meet up with my friends again. I know my new gf wouldn't make a fuss but I'm just unable to do so. It's been a few months now and I'm losing hope. Please help me

Sorry for the long post

How would someone actually do this without getting caught?
Apparently you can pick a restaurant or café and do it there, however if it's crowded then people are more likely to see you coming or going, or if it's empty then the employees are more likely to notice.
Also how would you enter and leave the restroom? I can't imagine that you can enter or exit without having someone notice and even if you exit at different times then someone could come in to the restroom.

12,"I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. I feel like I'm a pretty tame person. I only have 4 friends that my parents know very well. I'm a very high achieving straight A student. I've never snuck out, don't smoke/drink/have sex/do drugs, and don't really ever go against them. The craziest thing I've ever done behind my mom's back was going to a Starbucks with my cousin once while she was at school. However, my parents treat me like a bad kid. I am unable to step outside of the house without parent supervision. If I want to take a bike ride my mom gets a chair and has me do laps in our little cul-de-sac while she watches from the drive-way. If I want to go on a walk then she comes with me or else I can't go. I cannot choose what I wear, what I eat, my career, classes, friends, job, or what I do. I have to wear extremely modest clothing (full sleeve and floor-length dresses or floor-length skirts and full sleeve tops, basically no skin or anything with shape). The only reason I have gotten a phone was that I would be unable to log onto my College's system without one. Whenever I bring up that she doesn't trust me I always get yelled at an put down because I'm being ""ungrateful that I can even go to ... or do ... at all"". She says her biggest worry is (AND I AM QUOTING THIS) ""some other kids might do bad things and then blame you and you won't have an adult there to vouch for you"". What???? Other times she knows I want to ask her to go somewhere and will suddenly plan an appointment or another event on that day. Sometimes I don't realize how weird my life and it feels like no matter how good of a child I am it will never be enough. My older brother (he's 21) used to sneak out and hide things really well but I wouldn't dare try anything like that. Right now I'm getting ready to apply to some top schools out of state and I'm afraid I won't be able to go. I'll be 17 when I graduate high school and legally they can stop me from going even if I get a full scholarship or amazing financial aid. If I were to go to an out-of-state school my family would simply get up and move (father has a verrryyy flexible job).

When I was a teenager I wanted to be a rockstar like my idol, but I chose to not persue that dream because I felt that it didn't suit me (and it didn't, back then), so I chose psychology. I began to persue my psychology degree, but it took me longer than needed because my depression got in the way of my studies (and my life). While working on getting my bachelor's, a life changing tragedy happened, it changed my perspective on the world, it changed me.

28,"Hi Peeps, I'm a 15 yo guy who wants to move to Japan. I love anime and manga and such, I think it'll be bliss to be there. Don't think I'm moving to Japan just for anime and that shit. I'm genuinely in love with their culture and festivals they hold. I find their cleanliness extremely attractive and their work ethic at the top of the world. They're known to be quiet, and dislike rowdy people. I'm a pretty rowdy person, but only to my close friends so I don't think there will be an issue. I'm talking about all of these things I love about Japan but there are a few problems moving to Japan:

1.) I don't know Japanese

2.) My parents are Chinese and they hate Japan (They may end up disowning me or something along those lines, This isn't some speculation they might actually do that)

3.) I want to move there while I'm still young (Think 26 at the latest)

4.) Moving is expensive and it'll be extremely hard for me to obtain funds to move there

I have a plan in motion, but it still has issues. I could learn Japanese by myself (I'm currently in Sophomore Summer) until Senior Year and apply as an international student to a Japanese college (TokyoU would be Ideal). From there I'd study at Japan, get a part-time job, and then get a citizenship/permanent residence since I'm required to be there x number of years. That would be ideal, but my parents likely wouldn't approve and wouldn't fund it, thus making the plan a failure.

A second option would be to study at a good college in America until I get my degree. (I'm thinking finance for the purpose of it's use and validity in Japan unlike law lets say) From the time I'm in college til I graduate I can save up money to move to Japan. This of course is still not financially stable since college students barely have enough to pay for rent/food etc. I'm kind of at the end of my line here, any advice?",10Jul2019,1

He says he doesn’t have a connection to her, that he loves me and he only wants me.

We really get along together, and he does sweet things for me like talk to me all the time, keeps dates, has lots of fun with me, you know normal boyfriend stuff. I really love him but there’s been some stuff that just makes me want to give up.

First, last week he told his friend about some really personal things I had told him and the friend told me that’s how I found out, last week was my only weekend off for the next two months and he wanted to prioritize video games over it, a couple of months ago I was in the hospital and he didn’t really acknowledge it until a day later but then was pretty good and stayed with me. It’s always little stuff like that never something huge like cheating. He’s also been dangling engagement in front of me, but hasn’t saved for a ring and also tends to think of himself vs us. Sometimes I don’t really know if he cares about me at all. It all built up to today where he decided to accept a work trip and told me he wouldn’t be there for my birthday. 

Probably the worst thing he could have done because I had a really abusive ex for 3 years in college. 3 months into us dating he forgot my birthday. Like intentionally ignored it even though he lived 5 minutes from me. I broke up with him, but got back together because he insisted he cared. Worst. Mistake. Of. My. Life. It cost me so much, and I just started feeling better from that relationship a short while ago.

... so that was the straw that broke the camels back. To me, him choosing to go on that trip and miss my bday without even talking to me about it but rather telling me that it’s just not happening makes me feel worthless to him and like I am wasting my time. I feel disrespected in addition to the other things I mentioned.  It’s not the birthday it is what it stands for.

I realize this might be petty but I feel really hurt by all of this together. I feel like I’m tired of explaining to him and communicating because there’s just something else after. I’m tired of feeling disrespected and undervalued. I want to just start checking out. I’m starting to lose feelings. It’s hard to articulate everything.

I really love him I don’t actually want to walk away I’m just hurt. 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend doesn’t mess up big time, but does do some slightly disrespectful things it’s really building on me and while there’s good things he does the bad is making the logical side of me say that I need to walk. The emotional side of me wants to stay",10Jul2019,1

44,"We are both young 20s females and this is my roommate who moved in with me a year ago. I never had a friend like this who is (on the surface) a nice and decent person, like for example she brought me back a necklace as a gift from her vacation, but after each encounter with her I feel drained and phony.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an introvert but I am really picky about my friends..they tend to be other introverts that I can spend time with and chat all day with even and actually feel recharged. But I talk with this girl half an hour and I am just WORN out. She tends to complain a lot.. not just complain but complain IN DEPTH about all the ways she has been disadvantaged in life. Also she talks way too much about being at a disadvantage because of her looks (she is a chubby girl) and how no man will want her because of her looks. She is also always lumping me in the category with her ""Why can't girls like US get a man to love us like those skinny beautiful chicks?!?"" I even tell her I am single by choice and have no problem getting men but this is also a very tiring thing to keep trying to prove something so dumb and shallow.

&amp;#x200B;

TBH I am thinking of just avoiding her from now on but I feel guilty as she is a nice girl and also she has depression and has mentioned she has thought about suicide in the past because she felt so lonely. I really don't know how to handle this!!!!!",10Jul2019,2

46,"My husband and I are seperated and my lease ends in August. I was going to move back in with my parents and telecommute because they told me a month ago I could. Last week they dropped the bomb that they no longer want me to do that. So I have to A) move back in with my parents, quit a job that I love (amazing benefits and they over pay me) and try to find one where I’m from. B) find a place here and struggle to make ends meet because the cost of living is super high and I’m down to one income. Or C) move in with my aunt and uncle for a couple of months and have an hour commute (right now it’s only 20 minutes). BUT I will live rent free. The disadvantage is I will be living under their roof and will feel like a bother for a while, as a long drive back and forth to work. I’m leaning toward C, but the long commute keeps holding me back. 

The separation was not my choice. My husband is good to go- he got a job and a house and is basically worry free (he didn’t tell me this until he asked for the separation. The very last minute) so that’s another kick to the ass. 

Hoping for brighter days ahead, as well as some insight.",10Jul2019,1
47,"I would love to join the LGBTQ Pride Center for my county, unfortunately my hateful, spiteful neighbor is a member there and speaks badly of me.
She's done this h.s., back then she'd smoke cigarettes (everyone did) and instead of telling the truth she'd blame it on me instead of being honest and admitting she did and mutual friend's. Her mother had the nerve to say my mother was a bad parent for letting my friend's smoke in the house.
My gf and i went to gay pride and someone took our photo, yet I'm unsure how to get a copy as i don't want my neighbor to create worse drama. I saw her at pride and she refused to look at (trust me she saw us) me and my gf or politely acknowledge us. I'm not sure what her problem is, yet i would like to join the Pride Center, without an issue. What should i do?

50,"I started my first full time salaried position at the beginning of the year for a small fossil fuels company. This company is one of many under a much larger umbrella corporation, but for all intents and purposes they are completely separate from one another. I whizzed through my probationary period with nothing but positive reviews and even received a raise after only 3 months for my performance. 

One of the reasons why I stood out to my boss, the VP, is because I’m always looking for more stuff to do. I work 8 hour days in front of a computer, doing a job that for all intents and purposes can be done in less than 2. I have a handful of other coworkers who have been there longer but they are content to spend the rest of their time talking or fooling around. This is well known to my boss, and she consistently agrees that there’s not a lot to do in the summer and that she doesn’t understand how my coworkers aren’t bored all of the time and also asking for more stuff to do. You may be wondering at this point why they don’t trim the staff, but the job is very weather dependent (think utilities), and while it is dead in the summer, it picks up substantially in the winter and the job is far too intricate to hire temporary seasonal workers for. 

Because of my worth ethic, my boss approached me about a month ago and asked if I could lend a hand to one of our sister companies for a few days to help them got caught up on some paperwork that they’d fallen behind on. I happily agreed because, again, I was just so bored and figured this would help me kill some time and make my work days go by faster. Cool, no big deal. Only the “sister company” is not really a sister company but the passion and family legacy of the CEO of the whole umbrella. And it wasn’t “a few days of paperwork to catch up on” but over a months worth of accounting work from a former employee who quit unexpectedly and left zero notes on the process after having worked in the role for over 11 years. 

It’s almost a month later and I am still doing this  full time role IN ADDITION to my actual job. I’ve reinvented the process, taken a mound of data and turned into into an efficient and smooth system that manages multi millions. The CEO of the corporation is beyond impressed with me and all of the work I’ve done and wants me to absorb this position into my hired position at the very least, if not entirely abandon my original position. My VP loathes this idea and is fighting the CEO to keep him from “poaching” me because they do not want to have to hire a replacement for me. The CEO does not want to hire anyone else because he feels as though I am the only suitable person for the position at his company because of the strides I made. It’s a clusterfuck, quite frankly. This whole situation was supposed to be resolved yesterday, and I was supposed to finally get an answer about what my role will be but lo and behold, they pushed that off until mid-August because neither one of them wanted to relent on the issue and their solution was to “revisit the issue in a month and see if I could successfully absorb both positions”. 

That brings me to today. Part of my role for my CEO is AP/AR and today I had the pleasure of processing an invoice from my VP to the CEO for all of the hours I spent working on the CEOs stuff. I approached the CEO about it and he stated that it seemed fair. Okay, fine and dandy, cool. My work for the VP hasn’t suffered and it makes sense that they’d want to make a little money off of the situation. 

Here’s where I need advice: am I entitled to a piece of this via a raise? I realize that I have only been working this dual- position for less than a month but I’m still making the same amount I would have been had I not agreed to help. Moreover, the VP is billing the CEO more than DOUBLE what I even make hourly working for my original position alone. I have an extremely bitter taste in my mouth having to write a cheque to my VP for my own hard work without seeing any turn around on my end, with double the work load. Who would I even approach about this? My direct boss who hired me for my actual job, the VP, or the CEO of the entire corporation, who I also happen to be working closely with? 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",10Jul2019,0
51,"Listen, I don't know how some of y'all do this but I need advice..?

There's this guy I knew in high school, he was really nice, dorky and fine. He's extremely social and outgoing. Never had an issue talking to him. However, I never really thought of it of nothing more than infatuation. We graduated and we have each other on social media and he got a girlfriend and we chat if we see each other but that's it. 

5 months ago, I saw the guy again and he was kinda flirty and I was a bit confused why (thinking he was still with his girl) and he announced his his life has changed. He changed majors, travels more, got a good job and ended things with his girlfriend. Now, everything clicked. However,  I still didn't flirt back even though he broke up with his ex-girl a year prior. Also, I felt guilty doing so. 

Recently, posted a pic on Instagram, and he liked it an proceeded to like allllll my other pictures on Instagram. Listen, I suck at social media ""flirting"" because to me it's so odd even though I was born during this era. 

I just have question..
Does he want me to DM him? If so, isn't too straightforward? 
I honestly think it's odd he just didn't message me instead of liking all my pics?
Isn't it too soon? 
What's the art of sliding into DMs?

52,"I'm a 19-20yo girl and idk, since I've just started my holydays, i feel like i'm just going to spent 24/7 in my room drawing and watching anime as I've done all my life. 

A couple of years ago i was in a group of friends, but things didn't go really well, I had feelings for a friend and the he kind of abused of me for a months until he really almost raped me when drunk using force. Til then i tried to stay away. The thing is... I feel like I've never fit anywhere. That group was the only i thought i fit. 

Then i started collegue and tried to start over, there i met my actual and first boyfriend. Thanks to that i almost never feel alone again and i can truly trust him and we went for a more or less a same past and understand each other. That year I dropped college to move to another to study What i really wanted to study.  

This year i met a lot of people that shared hobbies. I thought i could do Friends and so, but i'm the type of person that never takes presence in anything that people literally forget about me, and just look for me when they need help with the assignments. Lot of people told me that i had a really boring life and that's sad. Yes, i always felt kinda sad too. (For example, I've never really celebrsted my birthday, and the only year I wanted i talked to my Friends and they told me they didn't feel like It)

This past year and a half i just relied on my boyfriend to do social life. But he also has his Life and his friends. Everytime someone tells me ""your life's really sad"" o my bf tells me he made plans with his friends, i feel kind of lonely.

To evade those feelings i rely on my hobbies, but not always works. Having class was fine, since that was almost half of the day, but now... 

Every time i see anyone having social life i feel like i'm missing most of my ""youth memories"" and i feel like doing something funny with some more people... I remember that I've never reslly been accepted anywhere, like i'm wasting my time in doing anything... 

Til now, my worries for my professional future were more important, like if i could do a living drawing or doing 3D things and not being a failure and so, but know... I feel like i should enjoy my student life while young


Am i the only one that feels like that? Is It normal that at my age i don't have any friends? What should i do?

57,"My mom, sister and I moved into a apartment complex 2 years ago. We have a 4 year boxer dog name Koda and later we got another boxer dog name Khloe who is 2. 

In our complex, there are a bunch of stray cats in the area and these guy multiply like rabbits. Koda began going after any cat she sees when we take her out. She even fakes needing to go to the bathroom to go out and chase cats. 

Not long ago, we saved a baby kitten. We were gonna try it a new home but plans changed and we decided to keep it. His named his Calvin. Very cute, sweet and playful kitten. 

We showed the dogs the cat and both had different behaviors. Khloe behaves really well but Koda chases Calvin to under the bed and rushed into the room whatever chance she gets. The other day, my sister held Koda to try to train her not to go after him and when Calvin got close, Koda grabbed him by the head with her mouth. My sister pulled her away and she quickly let go. Calvin got away unharmed. She did it again to a stray kitten when I took her to the bathroom. The kitten got away unharmed as well. 

We’re really confuse on why she does this. Khloe does go after cats but only because she’s curious. She does go up to Calvin and doesn’t attack but tries to play with him. We don’t understand what is up with Koda. 

What should we do? Is there any kind of training method to use that will not make her go after cats? Any advice will help us. Thank you!!!",10Jul2019,1

62," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

about two months have past since they first started to go out and me and him started to become really close. at this point i’ve realised that i started to catch feelings. the feelings grew stronger every time i texted him. 
eventually him and my best friend broke up, i felt sorry for my friend because i thought their relationship is going to last. but what hurt me more was that i knew i wouldn’t be able to get him even though he’s now available. 
after their break up we became even closer and our other friends, including my best friend started to get a bit jealous of that. his ex eventually got with someone else so i decided to finally tell him how i feel. i found out that he feels the same way about me and he felt that way for a long time. 
everything was amazing. whenever i went to see him i felt a bit anxious but excited. i felt like i literally won at life. but after the first month i started to feel like that feeling of excitement started to go away. which scares me. most of the things about him seem to irritate me and i try to make this perfect guy out of him. and i don’t get that because back when he was still with my friend he was literally the same but i had much stronger feelings for him. i just don’t want this to be the end. and i only seem to be hurting him. i need help",10Jul2019,1

66,"I recently started dating a guy. It's been about 6 weeks and things are still very new and we're feeling things out. I do like him but I notice we don't have a lot in common and it can be hard to make conversation at times. We had a talk a few weeks ago that we are exclusively dating but without the boyfriend/girlfriend title until if/when we feel ready for that. 





Well, I have a trip planned to France in a few weeks with friends that will last 1 month. This trip had been planned since before I met the guy. Because our relationship is new and I'm still not sure where it's heading, I've been thinking about talking to him about our situation before I leave. I may potentially break up with him, or see if he wants to put things on pause, or what have you. I've been talking a lot about this with my friend M who's going to France with me. I've confided things in her and been asking her for advice.







Over the weekend we were all out at a bar and M made a comment about how she's going to ""slut it up"" in France. Later that night, the guy I'm dating approached her and was asking if I also planned to ""slut it up"" in France. He ended up opening up to my friend about his feelings for me and telling her that he also plans to talk to me about us before I leave, and he even had a predetermined day/place this was going to happen (at a party we're going to in a few weeks). My friend was asking him if he'd be open to an open relationship situation with me while I was traveling, which kinda makes it sound like i DO plan to slut it up. Basically he was asking her for some inside info about me which I do not like. And she got to have a convo with him about my relationship that I would have liked to have. 








So fast forward to today. M told me that she ""wasn't sure she should tell me"" but that she had a conversation with the guy I'm dating. She tells me about the whole convo and I'm a little upset. I'm upset because 1) she wasn't going to tell me about it and waited 3 days to do so and 2) he had a very in depth convo about our relationship with M when he really should have talked about it with me. And 3) M got to have to convo I wanted to have and seemed to represent me in a way I really did not want her to. 







All this is compounded by 1) M told me a few weeks ago that she needs to ""watch herself"" around this guy because she's attracted to him and would go for him if I wasn't around. 2) He and M snuck off to do coke together at one point in the night (M hates coke, she never does it and 3) M's instagram stories had a lot of pics of him in it the next day. 






I feel like they're at a comfort level that makes me feel insecure. I told M I didn't like any of this and she yelled at me and threw me out of her house and said I was accusing her of something. I texted her after I left to clarify that I am not accusing her of anything but I don't like that he was seeking info about me and she engaged in a convo she knew I was waiting and thinking about having. She said she wanted to talk in person. Then when I asked if she wanted to talk today, she never responded. 






So question: am I being totally unreasonable? Am I right to feel upset by some of these things? She's out of town now and I won't see her until we board the plan for France in a week.",10Jul2019,1

74,"Hello, posting on a throwaway because I feel like this scenario could be recognized and other people know my main account. Buckle in this might be long.

So let’s rewind to a couple days ago, one of my very best friends who just returned from a long trip messages me early in the morning about what a bad night she had. In the past, I’ve been very good about taking care of her and making sure she is comforted for EXTENDED periods of time if something happens. We’re talking weeks-months of me checking up on her.

She unloads her woes of the last night which involve her unveiling a long-term secret relationship with one of our best friends. A best friend I’ve had a small crush on for a very long time (which she knew about). However, I have a boyfriend and as a result it’s not something I would ever act on or do anything about because I love my boyfriend vv much. 

So she unveils this to me and I am shook to my core. Then, she goes on to unveil how this motherhecker and her had gotten drunk with some other people I don’t know and proceeded to hang out with. Somehow, this turned into a cuddle session on his bed and him eventually making out with this girl who wasn’t my friend. 

Naturally, the girl I was friends with (the one texting me) gets mad and tells him to stops. He doesn’t, so she leaves and apparently hears them do the diddly do ...loudly. She leaves.

So I angry texted him and he’s claiming he doesn’t remember anything and blah blah blah. I’m pissed as hell at the both of them. 

Let’s move on to the part that makes me the most angry. The two that have been secretly dating?? Yeah both doing it under the nose of the guys longer-term girlfriend of like 4 years. And not an open relationship folks.

Do I pretend everything is fine? 
Did I lose both friends or just the guy? I’m just finding it hard to get past the fact that she knew I was into him and then also knowingly pursued a relationship with him while he was still in a relationship.

77,"So earlier today my older brother (M24) came out as bi to my parents over Skype (he doesn't live with us atm), didn't go down well at all they didn't want to know anything about it and told him to think about what he's saying, fully rejecting it. Now they haven't said a thing to me about this whole thing and pretending like nothing had happen, only for my brother to contact me (F21) about what went on when he came out and how upset he was saying he wants to die.  I am extremely saddened by their response because I have personally asked them how they feel about gay people and they said they're not bothered about it and fine with it, and my dad has asked me before if I was a lesbian and that its ok if I am (Im not lesbian nor bi), and all of the sudden my brother being bi is somehow bad and something they look down on?  
I am even more saddened by the fact that they know he suffers from anxiety and depression and now they've only made things a whole lot worse, making me very worried about my brother's mental health. I don't know what to do, should I confront them and tell them that this is not okay and tell them to apologise? After all they have no right to judge my brother if the bible tells them only god can judge. They're putting their twisted outdated beliefs before my brother's mental health. Im extremely angry about it all. But I need help with how to tackle this and support my brother because its affecting me too and lost a whole lot of respect towards my parents and crying just thinking about it all and how he feels.

79,"I’m a 24 year old female (as of tomorrow). 

I recently reconnected with someone who I used to talk to in college. He lives in Maryland, I live in Pennsylvania. We broke it off when we both wanted different things. He wanted something more casual, I wanted something more serious. We really haven’t talked since then - this was 4 years ago. At that time, we simply just went on a date or two and hung out, we have never been sexual. 

He ended up leaving school and went to the policy academy in Florida and I didn’t think of him at all after that. He ended up reaching out through Facebook about a year ago saying that we haven’t talked in a while, he was still interested and etc. We briefly talked and snap chatted. He admitted there too he wanted something casual, again I wasn’t into that. We again stopped talking. 

About a week or so ago, I sent him a Snapchat just out of the blue. He was reading into it that I was being flirty and it meant something, I assured him over and over again I didn’t mean anything by it. 

Today, he snapchatted me saying that he would still be up to pursuing something and that he would come visit me. I asked him what his intentions were and he admitted he wanted something sexual. I told him I don’t want just sex, I wanted something more with someone. He then went on to tell me that he would be up to giving it a shot. He was talking about how we wouldn’t know if things would work unless we tried it. 

We’ve been texting and I guess things are fine. 

He says he’s changed a lot since school and that he’s a lot more mature and everything, which I can’t really say he is or he isn’t since I haven’t seen/talked to him in years. I gave him food for thought and explained to him that I cannot leave PA, or really the county that I am in. I have a government job with a pension and so on. So I’m not willing to give that up. He told me if things were to really really work he’d be fine with leaving Maryland because he’s not tied down to it. 

To be honest, I don’t know if he’s saying all of this just to get into my pants or he has actually changed/grew up and would be interested in pursuing something. How do I know what’s bullshit and what’s not? I’m open to getting to know him again but I really do not want to get screwed over.",10Jul2019,1

Most of my days consist of me playing video games for hours on end (8 hours a day most days). Playing video games and going to the gym are really my only hobbies right now. The reason why I can’t find a job is because I had certain things I had to do at the beginning of the summer, which cut off time to work.

I went out partying with my friends during my first year and a little of my second at school but partying is just not for me. I’ve been to a few of the many events that my school has held hoping to maybe meet more people but that didn’t work. I find that I’m most comfortable at home but I want to get out there and meet new people. I’ve never been in a relationship and hope to maybe find someone before I’m 30. I’m quiet at first but once you know me you’ll know I’m outspoken and a little eccentric. I’m a very open person and I’ve been told I read people well. My friends say I’m easy to get along with but hard to get out of the house. I will say though I’ve been to a lot of different places since starting college.

88,"Hello reddit. I am a college student. My school is a specialty school that takes you through multiple states (to get a bachelor's, I did a portion of my education in NYC, and a portion of it will be done in LA.) Choosing this school seemed like a no brainer. I was going to be focusing 100% on my craft, and get to go to two of the most exciting cities in the U.S (the school is also semi-prestigious)

However, I just feel...displaced because of it. My hometown (where I am right now for the summer) doesnt feel like home to me anymore. I finished my schooling in NYC, and I never quite felt home there either. Now I'm going to LA, and while I'm excited, part of me is dreading it. I had a tight nit group of friends back home. In NYC I was always an outsider, I never built a support. Since I've been away at school, my friends back home have kind of...moved on. Since I've been back, I feel almost like an intruder during gatherings. Like I've lost my place in the friend group and am now just a burden. We've been bickering as well, something that we usually never did. My home and family life are unstable at best (for reasons that would require its own seperate post). 

The one light at the end of the tunnel, is that my SO is currently also in LA. I'm hoping school will be more bearable with them there. But my freshman year was...hard. I hated it. Not just for the people, but my classes, everything. I've even began to question my major. A thing I've been sure of my entire life. 

Im terrified that I dont have a place anymore. If I cant make LA my home, I dont know what else to do. I'm watching my other friends from home get ready for their next year and loving the college atmosphere, but I dread it. It seems like my life has kind of come apart at the seams. I feel guilty because people have spent so much money on my eduction, and I have yet to have a pleasant experience.

91,"Hello all. As I am typing this, I am well rested. I have been well rested since late May. This will come to an end at the beginning of August and I need help because the dread alone ruins my day when I'm thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I work nights and I live across from an elementary school. When I moved in, I fully expected to hear the sound of traffic in the morning (doesn't wake me up as I've lived in the city for years) and kids playing on the playground and teachers shouting at children to ""get down from there"" several times a day (also not a bother because they aren't really loud until after lunch). What I did *not* expect was the sound of Frank Sinatra and Toby Keith so loud in the morning that it makes me jolt out of my sleep in a disoriented panic.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a crossing guard who parks across the street. From 6:30 am until 8 am, he blares his music loudly. In the warm weather, it is particularly bad because he has his windows rolled down. At least when it's cold it's only loud when he gets out of his car to help someone cross the street (which is frequent).

&amp;#x200B;

When I first moved in, I was extremely reasonable. I went over and told him it was too early for the music to be too loud and asked him if he could turn it down. He said that he would turn it down a little, but that he wanted the kids to be able to hear music on the way to school. I wanted to ask him ""Why the hell do you think anyone needs to hear your music on the way to school, let alone at all?"" But I didn't. I just reiterated that I would appreciate it and that my family would appreciate it if he would keep it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not hear him for two days and then he went back to doing the exact same thing. I started calling the non-emergency police number to ask them to stop by and talk to him. I even watched them pull up and talk to him for a while. As soon as the officer drove away, he turned the music right back up.

  
I did this a few more times, calling the police and complaining. I was polite, gave them my name and number if there needed to be any follow up. Every time the same would happen: the police pull, the music turns down, the police drive away, and the music comes back with a vengeance. It was clear at this point he was being spiteful.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally I had enough one day because I was having a great sleep and remembered the crossing guard would be there soon to ruin it. It really made if feel like there was no point in even trying and it woke me up just as frustrated as if he were already there. It was 6 AM when I got dressed and went out to my truck to wait for him to pull up.

&amp;#x200B;

When he got there, I pulled up behind him, chose a particularly bass-heavy song, put it on repeat and cranked up my volume. My truck was rattling, and everything in my being was telling me to stop because I can't stand being a jerk and was feeling truly sorry for my neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

The crossing guard acted as if I was not even there. He kept looking over at my truck and then looking away but never played his music (it would have been futile over my own). Eventually he got back in his car just before 8 am and I pulled up beside him.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him ""I can do this every day if I need to."" He just said ""Ok, but I have a right to play my music."" I asked him why he insisted on playing it so loud and let him know that he was truly affecting my life because I was only getting a few hours of sleep every morning. He just said that he would take that into consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days of silence, and then once again the music started blasting. I called the police a few more times but it was always the same.

&amp;#x200B;

94," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

101,"Hello!

I am currently renting an apartment with my sister (first time both of us have moved out), so it was a first time learning experience for both of us, but because we are related, it was easy to just say ""hey I paid for this. you owe me this much"". We split rent 50/50 as well as utilities, but she had electricity in her name and I had internet in my name.

My sister is now moving out and I am searching for a new roommate to take over her half of the rent when the lease is renewed at the end of next month.

I figured since I'm the one who has the place and already lives there and I'm looking for someone to rent out the other room in my apartment, I would have everything in my name (except for rent. They would need to sign the lease and write a check for their portion of the rent each month)  and they would pay me half of everything (electricity and internet and water/sewer/gas). Is this a good way to go about this? If not, how should I do that?

Currently I have an internet plan that is plenty for my sister and me since neither of us are gamers.  I was told by the internet provider that if one/both of us were, we'd need a bigger plan.  What do I do if my roommate is a gamer/uses more/goes over the monthly plan? Do I tell them up front the plan I have and how it's sufficient enough for the two of us now but that if they require/want more, they can pay the difference? What about if they say it will be enough but they go over the allowance/use way more than I do on average? At that point would I tell them to pay the overage fee? Do I give them another chance before charging them the overage fee and just include that in the 50/50 of the bill for the month, or do I charge them the fee and then give them another chance to not go over the allowance before upgrading the plan?

Does anyone in a roommate situation have any experience using an app to acquire funds each month for utilities and such from the other person? I saw that there are a couple of apps that make bills easier between roommates. Should I go this route or just have them pay me via Venmo or a check or something?

I'm a fairly clean and organized person and one of the reasons my sister and I living together didn't work out was because of our different lifestyles. She wasn't as clean as I was and we'd get into arguments about how we expected different things from each other. How do I make sure the apartment stays clean in the communal areas (kitchen, living room) without one person picking up the slack of the other person? Although we both would have our own bedroom and bathroom, how do I make sure that they keep those clean too so that we aren't charged a fee to have them cleaned when we/they move out? Is it weird/unnecessary to have a chore chart? If it isn't weird, how would I go about doing something like that? Do we both talk about it or do I just make a chart and talk about who does what/how often/etc?  What about household products like paper towels/sponges/laundry soap/dryer sheets/dishwasher detergent/dish soap/etc? How do we figure out who pays for what? Does one person buy them and then just require the other person to pay them 50/50 for it?

Since I already live in the apartment, I already have kitchen appliances (pots, pans, Tupperware, silverware, dinnerware, etc) so do I just share those with my roommate or do I use my stuff and they provide their own and use their own? With my sister, we share everything but the Tupperware. My sister is notorious for losing Tupperware (and silverware \*rolls eyes\*) so I made sure we had separate Tupperware for that reason. I've got glass Tupperware and she had plastic and I'd personally prefer my glass Tupperware to only be used by me. Am I allowed to tell my future roommate that my Tupperware is off limits? Is it normal to share communal things like pots and pans and dinnerware and such?

I'm sure more questions will pop up as I think more about everything, but for now, those are the questions I have.",10Jul2019,1
102,"Hi. These last few years have been hard but I have kept on going but I feel like these last few weeks I have reached my breaking point. I feel so hopeless, useless, and just a waste of resources. Yesterday was actually my birthday (I turned 22) but I spent most of it breaking down and crying after holding so much in for so long.

I know seeing a therapist is the way to go but so many things stand in my way to achieve that. First off I still live in my childhood home with my dad. We are down to a single car and due to his extremely hectic work schedule (he works 100+ hrs a week) he uses the car most. We can’t afford another car right now. I don’t nor have I ever had a job (I live sorta in the country; would need a car to get anywhere). Any money I have is what my dad gives me. We don’t have any health insurance. He always pays out of pocket. The thing is is I could ask him for some money and he’ll give it to me, but I don’t want him to know I’m seeing a therapist. I won’t get in trouble with him, it’s just that he’s **always** under so much stress from work that I don’t want to pile more on top of that. These past few weeks I’ve seen just how much physical and mental stress has got him stretched so thin and I feel so sick and helpless knowing there’s nothing I can do, and I’m terrified of what will happen when the exhaustion get the better of him.

So long story short, does anybody know how to find the cheapest and easiest way to see a therapist? I heard Better Help was a scam; is there another site like Better Help that isn’t a scam?

It's not that I'm bad at arguing; I've even been reccomended debate as a school subject before. I generally don't show any of that fear, but it's only getting worse the older I get, to the point where someone's vaguely argumentative post I agree with on a subject I feel equally passionate about it feels like there's a pit in my stomach for the next hour and I have a hard time maintaining a chill facade.

Any advice on how I can stop or somewhat reduce this feeling? Just flat-out avoiding conflict is bad, and has had real consequences for me in the past, but I don't know what else to do.",10Jul2019,1
104,"I'm 18 and at university now. 

I grew up in a community of mostly Latine, and Filipino folk. I was white (still am). Anyway, for fourth and fifth grade (this happened in fourth iirc), I had this dope teacher who I freaking loved. She'd had my sister before, and I got on with her just as well. 

(This bit just makes it a hundred times worse.) Since kids are dicks, I got singled out a lot for being the only white kid in elementary school. I told her about it and she opened up about being bullied for being the only black girl in school. She was really there for me, and made me feel a lot better. 

That said, people fucked with me *a lot*. It really fucked up my social development after elementary school. Dumb shit that I can laugh at now, but really catalyzed my self hatred and depression. Dealing with it every single day really got to me. It only rarely got physical, mostly name-calling and teasing. 

Anyway, there was this one kid in class - a Mexican - who I sat across from and we had a little rivalry. Anyway, he was sitting there talking shit, calling me a bitch and stuff and I was totally over it. I was completely powerless to these people and, in my rage, thought of the worst word I could think of.

Excuses time! I remember in my nine-year-old mind I thought, since he isn't black this word isn't **big bad** it's just bad like the word bitch or something. 

Anyway, I call him the N word. He tells the teacher. And I remember she just looked at me with this shocked face, and walked away. I just felt like the biggest sack of trash in the world.

She seemed to forget about it, but I didn't. I couldn't look her in the eyes again. I couldn't even speak to her. I left elementary school and didn't come back until I was seventeen to tutor kids. And she remembered me and smiled at me and waved and... I still couldn't talk to her.

I still think about it. And today, in a spell of boredom, I found some of my old teachers' Facebooks, including hers and thought, what if I just sent her a message? 

What do you think?",10Jul2019,0
106,"Hi guys, I'm seriously in a pickle right now. My grandma (86 yo) lives with us in the house. She cannot walk without a walker and has really bad arthritis. However, this doesn't stop her from wanting to clean the house. I'm busy with a bunch of college deadlines and both of my parents work long long shifts (12 to 15 hour shifts). We always have a bunch of boxes around the house or random things on our desks. My grandma has always loved to clean, but recently, every time she cleans she will fall. She has already broken both her arm and her knee. They are now both healed, and guess what she is doing again? Cleaning. I have no idea what to do about her. I spend a majority of my time at home and working from home because I have to take care of her, but recently it really has been getting out of hand.

108,"I’ve been with this girl for about a year. On the topic of depression, I’ve probably had it for the last few years and if I’m being honest it’s taken quite a toll on my life. Constantly feel tired, irritated, unworthy, etc. I’ve found a therapist I occasionally go to but nothing like medication is involved. Before we got serious, I forewarned how just how like negative I can be and that my depression may impact the relationship. We seemed to kind of brush over it and assume everything was fine. The other day I snapped at her, just a very nonchalant response to one of her upcoming things she was talking about. I’ve been in a rut lately, just not being able to get out of bed and doing basic things. I told her about this as like “hey, I’m gonna need space and I’m not in the best mood, sorry” I do feel very bad, and I took responsibility for it immediately and apologized, even though she says apologies don’t do anything, which I guess I agree. 

I thought everything was fine, as in I didn’t think my depression was putting a wedge between us, but I guess I was wrong as I just got a long message saying how I need to man up, work harder, and fix this relationship. I haven’t been making any decisions for us as a whole and haven’t scheduled anything date wise, because I just assumed she loved doing it, as her personality is very like dominant and type-A. I’m also a very passive person and people pleaser at heart so I’m not the typical masculine alpha male.

It honestly threw me through a loop. I’m just very upset at myself for not realizing how much pain I was inflicting and that this relationship was going downhill. I feel like she deserves way more than I’m giving her right now, which is nothing. I love her greatly and it’s nothing against her but I just don’t know how I can keep being in this relationship for her sake. She’s upset that I’m not trying hard enough in the relationship and I don’t know how to tell her that I’m just not that guy then. I wish I could try harder, but I just don’t know if I can even TRY.

I’m just torn on how to tell her that I’m not in a place to be in a relationship and can’t give her the proper support she needs in the relationship, and probably won’t be for a while. Please help. It’s been a terrible day.

TLDR: Revelation that relationship has been tanking, depression and bad attitude is fueling the fire, and I don’t know how to end the relationship for my gf’s sake.",10Jul2019,1
109,"This is my first time on this sub-reddit and for the past few years, I have felt that almost everyone seems significantly better and more productive than I am. 

For context: I am a student studying for a major examination this year. It's been last year since I had this feeling that others are more talented than me and would often score better grades. I remembered failing tests that I thought I would do extremely well in and sometimes when I thought I did well, others did way better. 

I used to be one of the top in my school and right now I feel like I am stuck in a rut, with habits I keep trying to change.

Just recently, when I was doing a math paper in class, I was stuck at one question and decided to ask my math teacher for help. She decided to ask another student who apparently had the solution in his head already. Afterwards, I realised that some people have already done the question easily.

I once took an official test globally and it showed that I was in the top 3% range in the country for mathematics, but now it seems like everyone else is getting better than me.

I know you shouldn't compare yourself to others, but it can be very depressing to know that you have reached a plateau while others are getting better. I don't hate anyone but just myself.

I use my handphone frequently, browsing youtube but not social media and video games. However, others play games all day and still get better results. 

Any advice? Thank you.",10Jul2019,0

111,"Alright, this might be a long one and there are a lot of moving parts, but I'll try to keep it legible.  I'm going to try writing this as objectively as possible so that you can try forming your own conclusions of the situation. Feel free to ask questions.

  \----------------------------

My family is largely from New York, however, a good chunk of my father's side moved to Georgia about 20 years ago. This included his sister Stephanie and her family (we'll hear more about them shortly), his brother (my uncle), and his mom (my grandmother). 

I dont think anyone would disagree here, Stephanie's side of family is the troubled one. THey were well off when I was growing up, always traveling and living a generally lavish life, but fell on hard times about a decade ago and never financially recovered. Stephanie ended up raising her grandson son (who's now in his early 20s), while the daughter ended up living with other guys and lived a drug fueled life. Stephanie's husband, who is in his early 40s, lost his family for domestic abuse and has struggled with drinking for the past 5 years or so. They're honestly a pleasure to be around when we have family gatherings, but the stories that we hear from that side of the family about cops showing up to the house, internal family fights and whatnot are pretty insane.

So, my uncle, we'll call him Mark, has a very tragic story, but it's also something that he shares with so many other Americans. Through some manual labor, Mark injured his back when he was younger, was put on opiods and fell into a life of addiction and depression. Mark lived in Georgia with his mother, who passed away a few years ago. About 10 days ago, he ended his life while watching the sun rise. 

Mark was reasonably close with my dad, who still lives in New York. My dad seemed to be the one person that would listen to him rant about life and would try to help him sort out his physical and mental demons (either offering to help with finances for back surgery, or just talking him through his depression). About 6 months ago, my father told me that Mark wanted to name me, my sister and my brother as the full recipients of the contents his will (phrasing?). We were asked for our social security numbers and DoBs and they were given to my uncle. At that point Mark also started to liquidate his belongings, sending my father boxes of his things to sell so that my dad could send him the money. The writing was clearly on the wall, we could even read it then, but he always refused any sort of help for his demons

About a week before he actually commit suicide, Stephanie received a letter from Mark saying that he was going to kill himself. She called the police, who went to his house for the umpteenth time, he refused to open the door for them but verbally said that he was alright and they were on their merry way. Following that event, Stephanie told him that she couldn't deal with the threats anymore, and that if Mark was going to kill himself that he should just do it (she told my father this). When my father heard what was going on, he booked a flight down to Georgia to see if his presence could help. 3 days before he was supposed to fly down, there was another death in the family and my father cancelled the Georgia trip to go to the wake here in NY. During the time that my father was \*supposed\* to be in Georgia is when Mark killed himself. 

My father told me a few days after Mark's death that although we were the ones that the estate was supposed to go to, he didn't think that was fair (in regards to Stephanie and her side of the family), and was going to try to split things up a bit, as he was told he'd be the executor of the will. The story that I was told is that as my father was trying to explain this to Stephanie on the phone, she exploded at the first mention of the will and the estate and hung up the phone on him. A few days later, my father heard from Stephanie's husband, who said that she was really overwhelmed and decided to get away for a few days with her son. At the end of the week, she returned, gave my dad a call and said that A. **Mark's house, which nobody was currently living in, had been burglarized** and that B. she was ready to talk about splitting the estate, but insisted that there was no existing will. 

Here's what I've been told about the burglary. I was told that someone had broken into Mark's safes, which were apparently the size of a walk-in freezer (legitimate safes). There were also holes cut into the ceilings. When I asked what was taken, I was told the info that I got was that since there wasn't really an inventory before the burglary, nobody actually knows. Mark also had lots of guns, which I guess were in the safes. Apparently those were left untouched. Stephanie also said that her and her husband had walked through the house, which is how they know that there was no will. 

My father, who is very overwhelmed with everything, doesn't see anything really questionable here. I suggested that, as this is all very out of his wheelhouse, that he contacts a lawyer who might know how to proceed in these sort of situations, and he said that Stephanie's daughter's new fiance is a lawyer and will be taking care of things. ""If they trust him, then I trust him"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess in short, I don't think I trust them.   

  

Sidenote: I feel like I can't really say anything about this whole situation without being biased because my name was in the pot of who gets the estate. As nice as it'd be to inherit something at the end of the day, that's totally on the backburner for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't really know how to proceed here. I'm afraid to bring this up to my father, because I feel like that's when things really blow up, but at the same time, things seem so questionable (at least to me), that it's worth asking questions.

120,"I've been moved out since college - around 3 ish years ago. I obviously kept in contact with my family but not a lot because they stress me out and fuck with my mental health. (literally every time my SO and I visit, we leave and I break down because I hate spending time over there.) 

Anyway, I called my sister yesterday and talked to her about my mom and her boyfriend's impending break up. She's been with this guy for 10 + years - he practically raised us. It seemed like the relationship deterioration between the two had been really abrupt so I wanted to get my sister's take on it cause she still lives there full time and I've been gone for so long. When I brought up the boyfriend, my sister got a bit quiet and tried to change the subject but it seemed odd so I pushed for more information. She eventually swore me to secrecy and told me what was on her mind.

So my mom has been emotionally/physically distant from her boyfriend for a while. My mom even admitted to me that she was emotionally but not physically cheating on him with someone else - which didn't surprise me. Her last marriage ended with her emotionally cheating on her husband with her current boyfriend. She also did the same thing to my dad while she was in a relationship with him. I don't think any relationship she's been in since I was born has been broken off clean.

It's annoying and I think left my siblings and I with a lot of unresolved issues, but it's what she does. 

So they've been distant for around two years now and I just didn't know cause I live far away and everyone is on their best behaviour when I come for a visit because they are always so infrequent. Question answered.

I didn't think there would be anything more to add, but I notice my sister was still avoiding talking about him and seemed to outwardly dislike him. My initial thought was that they got into a fight or something so I pressed for more. 

I found out that she's been going to therapy and is on a lot of medication because she has been dealing with a lot of depression. Again, not a shock. It runs in our family. But she said it has been spurred on by a few incidents the summer before. 

When my mom started distancing herself from her boyfriend, my sister and him began to spend some more time together. It was like father/daughter time - and as her relationship with my father isn't the best, it was something I thought was a positive thing. However, one afternoon, they were watching movies and she laid down on the couch and put her feet on his lap (a casual thing in our household. We often use others as foot rests.) Apparently he decided he wasn't comfortable enough as well and laid down behind her, cuddling her like we had often seen him cuddle mom growing up.

Obviously, this made my sister uncomfortable but she didn't say anything. She just froze. 

There were a few more instances like this - ones where he would smack her ass or just say things you wouldn't say to your daughter. More and more, she felt scared to be in the house. Eventually, she told him to fuck off (bless her pre-medicated bluntness) and cut off all contact. For a few months, the moment she got into the house, she would go up to her room immediately and lock the door and that was that. He started sending her love notes, started searching her room when she wasn't home and just proving to be all around creepy. 

Eventually, one of her friends moved in with them and started sleeping in her room as well. With him as her guard dog, she felt a bit safer but she is still in the house with my mom's boyfriend. 

I never saw any indication of predatory behaviour before I moved out (in fact, it's so far off of the person I thought I knew that I'm questioning everything from my childhood) but she was so shaken when she was talking about it that I believe her. She wouldn't lie about something like that. 

I was sworn to secrecy -with specific instructions not to tell my mom because she's not ready to talk about it yet - but I want her out of that house ASAP. She won't accept my help and frankly, beyond kidnapping her and bringing her to live with me, there isn't much I can think of doing that won't break her trust.

Examples would be cussing me out for not doing something or because I had done something she didn't like, taking the money I got from my dad to buy cigarettes, and that I had a major hand in raising my sisters. Now, this would make me upset to a point, but I also knew that I could have had things a lot worse. She could also be really nice and I have a lot of good memories with her. I could talk to her when she was in a good mood it was just on her off days that she would go off. Regardless one day my boyfriend and I were going out one day (I was 20 and still living with her but had a job, had the few bills I paid, contributed to food, and helped financially when it was needed). I'm not gonna lie I was really bad with keeping my room cleaned. I had a lot of clothes and not a lot of space for them. She got mad because I was going out with him since my room was a mess. And she ended up cussing me out in front of him. Like I said before this was a normal occurrence for me and I completely forgot about it. However, my boyfriend didn't and that day decided he didn't like her. Now, present day, my boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 3 years, we have a gorgeous baby boy together and have lived together for a year. I still have a relationship with my mom though I'm not a big fan of her fiance. My boyfriend really isn't happy about it and wants me to cut her out of my life.

Anyways, today I went to her house to visit and my boyfriend got upset because he didn't want me to go. Usually, if he doesn't want me to do something I don't because he works out of town and if he objects to something its because he's worried it might be harmful. His worry is that I might visit on a bad day and she will go off on me or it might cause me to stress out and he hates when I'm upset and he can't do anything about it. So I had a good visit with my mom and sisters, but feel so bad cause I know he's upset that I went over there. I know he isn't trying to be controlling and is only thinking about our sons and my safety and the fact that by going over there has made him worry when he should be paying attention to work.

So, to give some background. My dad promised his dad, my grandfather, on his deathbed that he would make sure to take care of my grandmother. Despite this, about ten years ago she decided to live with my aunt. 

My aunt is a parasite. When I was a kid I was ignorant about what she was. When I grew older I found out that she; had a kid during high school and gave her away and refuses to speak with her. Has been arrested for drinking and drugs multiple times (The reason my grandmother is living with us is that she got slapped with a DUI). She has been to rehab multiple times. And, has basically completely drained my grandmother of her finances.

The worst part is that my grandmother has remained blissfully ignorant, preferring to remain a neutral party. Whenever my dad or my mom has a problem with something my aunt decided on without consulting them my grandmother just replies ""oh, you know how she is"" or ""That's just how X is"". My grandmother, after all of this, refuses to condemn any action on her part and simply goes along with whatever it is. And, whatever idea my aunt has, she is automatically supportive of it and doesn't run it by my dad at all or even ask for specifics.

Look, I know that parental love goes a long way. But, when your kid has screwed up multiple times and has screwed you in the process I think it's time to act. It makes me angry because she was the head of human resources in a sizeable company. in the '60s as a woman. That's admirable, but after 3 years of this, I can't help but see her like a spineless fool that obviously disobeys her doctor's orders.

I've tried to be a third party myself. But, after she has tried to humiliate us at weddings, family get-togethers, etc. that spurred me to get involved. I tried getting them to talk with my aunt and the rest of the family for support. That seemed to make things even worse. My aunt's true colors came out as she told my dad to stay the fuck out of her business, even though he's had to shell out money in order to clean up the mess she made.

That's what made me want to make this post. My dad is a humble and honorable man. He doesn't deserve to be humiliated, ignored and overstressed like this even though he seems to be the only one doing anything to fix this. Her kids and the rest of my dad's side of the family seem to be completely on her side and have only thrown money at her situation for years (even now, even though my grandma is practically homeless and broke). He's had to pay far too much, both financially and mentally, to fix both my aunt and grandmother's problems and take care of my grandma. And now she wants to go live with my aunt hundreds of miles away without even thinking things through

So, to finally get to my question. What can I do? Am I just powerless in this? My grandmother's old-world sensibilities have been obnoxious and have made it so that we have no privacy in the house. So I can't say I'm sorry to see her go if anything I'm glad she'll be gone. But, I can't help but think that there'll be a repeat of last time, call it a sixth sense if you will. 

Is there any advice I can give my parents that will help any of this?   

I know this was a long post. But, I need any advice at this point. I'm using a throwaway account cause I feel like I'm going behind their backs a little bit.

tl;dr: Dad is burnt out, aunt is a selfish bitch, grandma is an idiot. OP is completely lost and worried.",10Jul2019,1
134,"Hi all, 

I wasn’t sure how to title this post, but basically before certain things I get extremely nervous, to the point it makes me really shaky/shivery and (sorry, TMI warning) gives me diarrhoea, and I’m just really done with it at this point.

I am not an anxious person generally, it’s just 4 specific things that affect me;

1. Flying
I have a fear of heights. Usually the nervousness and sickness comes before the flight/during take-off, but once I’m in the air or landing I’m totally fine.

2. Amusement Parks
Honestly this one is so weird, I love places like Disneyland but I hate rollercoasters (part of the fear of heights I guess) and even though I know I don’t have to go on any scary rides (so I don’t go on them), just being at the park (even though I love the parks) makes me feel sick.

3. If I have to tell someone something
I know a lot of people get nervous if they have to tell someone something important or embarrassing, etc., so I doubt this is unusual, but this also gives me real bowel issues.

4. Dating
So overall I’m kind of inexperienced in this field, so that could definitely be the cause of this part of the issue but before dates and even during dates sometimes I feel really sick. 

I’m also lactose intolerant (which as many of you probably know causes bowel issues) and I’ve found recently other things like onion and chilli set my stomach off a bit as well.
I’m wondering whether maybe because
my stomach is somewhat sensitive, that when I get nervous, it just also makes me feel sick?

Anyway, sorry for the hella long explanation about all my issues, but I’m just wondering if anyone else experiences this, or has any idea of what the cause could be? 

Outside of these 4 things, I don’t get the bowel issues, and like I said in the beginning, I’m not an anxious person by any means. If I’m just nervous about something, I don’t get shivery or shaky, it’s only these 4 things that make me shake.

Also, if anyone has any advice about calming nerves in general, it would be much appreciated!",10Jul2019,1
135,I sent something SUPER dumb to my crush. I’m more like an acquaintance to him and he hasent answered. What should I do? I cannot talk to him irl so I’m nervous...,10Jul2019,2
136,"So I'm going to preface this with it is a long story so bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have this core group of friends I have known since I was 4 and I'm now 25, one of them is ""Mark"" and he is currently engaged and buying a house with a to put nicely kind of bitchy girl. For a long time my other 2 friends and I have suspected he has some serious issues. He is always lying, talking about weird shit, acting like he's a macho man and got all these women, he always brings up his ""body count"", and we've caught him multiple times lying about sexual interactions he had denied vehemently. Up until recently we kind of just said oh it's Mark being Mark so it's not our problem.

My other 2 friends, Nate and Alex have always suspected as well as I that he has a serious sexual addiction that needs professional help and now it's becoming a serious problem.

&amp;#x200B;

In the last year my brother's best friend started dating this girl who Mark used to have a fuck buddy type relationship with and in the last 6 months he has propositioned her for sexual activity at least 4 times, the most recent time being 4 days ago on the 3 month mark of his engagement becoming official.  To add some background to this story, my brother and his best friend are also 2 people I consider MY best friends and so this type of behavior is fucking my spot up. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother's best friend's GF is a nice girl who doesn't want to cause trouble internally in our large friend group. She also is afraid he will try to black mail her if she opens her mouth because he's brought up embarrassing sexual encounters they had in the past in a somewhat threatening way and he's also made it a point to tell her that he's only told 2 people he has a ""sex addiction"" and if it comes out he'll know she spilled the beans. He claimed he goes to therapy, that his fiance knows, and he's been ""clean"" for a while but he's also made it a point to let her know that if he was going to cheat it would be with her. Knowing Mark for 21 years, I know that almost all of that is bullshit besides the idea that he has a sexual addiction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mark has consistently separated his fiance from the group, he doesn't tell her about group outings, he lies about where we are, makes up stories as to why she can't come. It's so bad that i literally unintentionally caught him in a lie at the bar one night when I asked her why she didn't come see a movie with us and she said he told her it was a guy's night and me in my drunken stupor yelled rather loudly that we established up front the night we bought the tickets outright with the intentions of our girlfriends coming along. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason i need advice is simply this; Everyone looks at me as a pseudo leader in this group. My girlfriend and Nate often refer to me as the spoon that stirs the drink and that people value my opinion and point of view more than anyone else's and I as this influential person need to initiate some sort of conversation to A. tell him to knock it the fuck off and B. encourage him to get help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth be told I don't believe Mark is that bad of a person, I know what addiction can do to a person. My other brother not the one mentioned before, is a recovering heroin user and I see how he has abused and manipulated my family's trust and i think something similar is going on here but I'm really asking a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do i even approach this situation?
2. is it fair that this falls on me?
3. Am I wrong for feeling like my friends only want to blow Mark's spot up because they don't like his fiance too much and they're not really acting in her best interests?
4. Is my friendship with mark salvageable at this point?

I'm stuck in between wanting to help my friend Mark and restoring the fair and safe environment our friend group cultivated and not really wanting to get involved because at the root of this I feel like it isn't my problem. I'm a man of principles so the latter is starting to fall down especially since I don't know how I can stand on an altar as a groomsman at this wedding knowing whats going on.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My one friend who is engaged keeps trying to fuck my other friend's girlfriend, she wants nothing to do with him and everyone in my extended group of friends wants me to lead the charge and call him on his shit. What Do I Do?",10Jul2019,1
137,"Recently my mother married someone who we'll call H. H is a pretty nice guy, but like all nice guys, he's got some flaws. I think he's racist. There are many reasons i suspect this but i am going to give you the ones i can think of at the moment. Help me decide: is he actually racist or am i just judgmental. I really just want to rant somewhere and get advice. 

1. I've posted somewhere on reddit about my step-brother (H's son) saying the n-word. I believe that this is behavior passed on from H himself.

Context: we have chickens. When naming them, H comes up with the strangest names that anybody would not dream of naming their pets simply bc of the blatant insults included with his descriptions of the names. 

2. One of our chickens is a leghorn. Leghorns are normally all white. H decided to name this chicken Cracker, which is a white racial slur, though admittedly not the worst one.

3. We have another chicken whose breed i do not know. However, it is completely black. (Based on number 2, i think you can tell where this is going.) H named her Oprah bc, and i quote, ""she's big and black.""

(^both of these chickens have already had names given to them but H decided to change the names to fit his own wants.)

4. H will constantly talk about many things pertaining to black people. He'll sometimes make fun of them as a ""joke"" and i believe I've heard him make a joke about watermelon once.

5. He's rubbing off on my mother which i do not like. We were watching Taylor Swift's new music video which had in the beginning, that one guy wearing a  rainbow jumpsuit and dancing. She and H just start laughing at this guy for no reason at all. 

6. I'm worried that I'll become like him and that would be the worst thing for me to become.

Just to clarify, H is a great guy but he talks about and does some questionable stuff. I don't like some of it and that's led me to believe that H is racist but I'd also like some insight from the people of Reddit.

Have a good day y'all!",10Jul2019,0
138,"Based in Ireland. Here’s some background. I’m 24 turning 25 shortly.

So I have just over 12 hours to either accept or not accept a spot in a college course. The degree is Computers with Software Development in an Institute of Technology rather than a University.

In my current state I wouldn’t qualify for free fees or any financial aid as I live at home with my parents. I work local but I’m not great with money so I have less than 2000 in my account. I still have over 2500 left to pay on my braces over the next year as well as car insurance that costs me 220 a month.

The course itself seems okay, but I would prefer to do a Business Information Systems (BIS) degree as it incorporates business into an IT degree and I could do a course which features a work placement as the one I have been offered, does not. 

I would prefer the BIS course but the main problem I have is that it would require another year of waiting. My parents are adamant I do this years course but I know it’s mostly to get me out of the house and because I’d be “too old coming out of college”. 

I don’t know what exactly it is I need to hear but I don’t really have anyone to bounce this off so I hope at least person can just lend me some advice because I’ve slept 2 hours in 3 days because of the stress this is putting on me.",10Jul2019,2
139,"I just got into a lease with two other roommates in my house. I knew both of them before this but did not know their political leanings.

When I came home I tried to not start a big confrontation but stated that I did not agree with him or his views to which they both kind of laughed it off and didn't do anything about the poster because I was ""overruled""

140,"M24 here. Been in a relationship that has had some ups and downs for the past 2 and a half years. I’ll tie this all together.

Last weekend I went to a music festival with group of really close friends, we all work together. One of the people in our group is a girl who’s like one with the guys, we always hangout as a group. 

Well on the last night of the festival, her and I pretty much spent the whole day and night together. We had some party favors that helped us experience the festival in the best way possible. Her and I shared a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life. We saw one of our favorite DJs and it was the best night of my life. I’ve never felt so free and the whole night when I looked at her I just saw this ray of sunshine coming from her. I’ve never shared an experience like that with anyone, I can’t even describe it to a T.

I did not cheat on my girlfriend. I refuse to cheat on someone as I’d never want to be cheated on. But I don’t know what to do about this girl I was at the music festival with. I can’t stop thinking about her. I have friends that have been telling me that I need to find someone I can share those kind of moments with and I don’t know if I found her or what I should do. Should I talk to her? Bring it up with her? Or what? Been on my mind a lot since I’ve been back.",10Jul2019,1

What can I do to get back at him? I hate him with all of my guts, I find him to be a disgusting human being. My goal was to become independent and successful, and quickly move on and live on my own, but I feel like this is not enough, I want to get back at him first, I want him to feel the pain he's caused on me and my mom, and my siblings.",10Jul2019,1

My mom is chronically ill and can no longer live with him if she wants to get better. I feel like I’m in a Catch 22 and have no idea what to do.",10Jul2019,1
146,"My husband and I live my parents right now because we are in between moves so we will be leaving soon, but it’s been about 4 months since we’ve been here. I will try to make some points I noticed throughout time to help with an understanding. 

My parents are very stressed out people, they don’t handle stress well and I believe this is why they have constant arguments. I sometimes do see them trying to be nice but then one or the other takes what the other says the wrong way, or they didn’t like the others tone, or I hear them both say the other is a bully. 

My mom always says my dad says mean things to her under his breath, I have heard him do this sometimes. My mom sometimes nags at my dad especially after a long day of work, he works on forklifts for his own company so he’s also in the heat all day and he has no employees. My mom helps my dad with some paperwork stuff and calls but is home all day. She procrastinate a lot of the work but she does do housework too. She doesn’t really cook dinner for my dad which I’ve heard him say many times he just wants dinner when he gets home, but at this point it’s gotten so childish, when my mom has cooked dinner he sometimes doesn’t eat it out of pride? Idk. And sometimes he will eat it. 

My dad has also asked my mom to clean their room, it’s very cluttered with clothes everywhere, no room to walk to dressers, etc. my mom says she gets stressed when she goes to clean it so then stops. I’ve helped her clean it before and told her I would again but she literally won’t commit to it. I’ve also started cleaning it without her before but I can only go so far. My parents just went through a lawsuit with an old business buddy which is finally over, that caused a lot of stress. My dads mom (91) has cancer and needs care because she wants to stay at home and pass there, so he’s stressed about that and needing more help, even though we all help, we all can’t stay there all day. So that’s another stress. My mom doesn’t like how my dad used to take care of the yard (they live on land), and now she says he doesn’t care anymore so she nags about that. There’s a set of blinds that needs to be put up and my dad hasn’t done it which my mom complains about that too. I told her we could do it but she thinks he should do it. My mom has a lot of anxiety, vertigo, kidney stones issues and when she doesn’t feel good my dad doesn’t help her or he says “oh you’re sick again?” In a very unsympathetic way. So she then goes off on that saying he doesn’t care and I get that. My parents seem to do the same thing to each other about different subjects. They don’t seem to respect one another. 

Honestly they could fight about the sky being blue or light blue and somehow it would blow up. I have to hear my mom complain about my dad often and it bothers me because I want them to get along and I want them stop being mean to each other. It sometimes makes me look at my dad certain ways but I try not to and I try to love them both and help them. I told my dad when he was complaining to me about my mom I said well y’all should go to counseling it helps and he just shrugs it off. I’ve told my mom the same about counseling. My mom complains my dad doesn’t show her affection. But she says they always come back to loving each other but that it doesn’t last long, only if my dad wants sex or something. Then she said he’s mean all day. I don’t really know what to think anymore. It really is annoying to hear everyday but I get I’m also at their house. I just wish they would listen to what I have said and to go to couples therapy, go out and do date nights (they never go out together maybe sometimes to dinner but rarely). My mom is yearning to go out and do things but my dad just doesn’t like social scenes I dont think. I really just want help on maybe understanding what the fuck to do maybe just listen and don’t comment because honestly they don’t listen to me. They just like to vent. It’s so annoying how nice my dad can be to me but be mean to my mom. Idk. It’s exhausting and it affects my moods and doesn’t make me want to be around. But then sometimes we have a great time. It’s so weird and bipolar I feel like. I guess I just want some guidance and I hate to feel like “I can’t wait to move” because I do miss them when we don’t see them but then it’s like damn here we go whenever we come back to visit.

I thought nothing of it till I noticed these cuts all along her arms and legs.

153,"TLDR: got addicted to porn, watched some really nasty videos and now I hate myself

So I’m 16 and I started watching porn at a relatively young age, since then I watched it pretty much every day. I had some pretty normal fetishes like femdom and humiliation and I’m fine with that. But eventually I was addicted started to watch weirder stuff and in a few years I was watching some really really gross stuff like toilet play and even scat on a few occasions. None of it was immoral or harming anyone, and I’m pretty sure I was only watching it for the humiliation and how taboo it was. When watching the videos I even felt ill and covered some parts of the screen with my hand yet I still watched it.

I’ve quit porn now and I’ve been clean for a few months now, I’m trying to improve myself and I’ve been exercising and going out more and my desire to watch that stuff has completely vanished. I still have femdom kink but I’m fine with that honestly.

At the time I didn’t really care, I just watched what I wanted to watch and didn’t think much of it, but now I can’t stop thinking about it. I utterly despise myself and I feel worthless. Sometimes I see that type of porn mentioned and made fun of online and it really gets to me, I feel like a degenerate freak. I’m also worried about having to hide stuff from people, like if I tell my future wife about this she’ll hate me and think I’m a pervert. I feel like I’m concealing some dark secret from the world. I feel like everyone I love and all my favourite authors and musicians, if they knew about me and what I did they would also look down on me.

I feel so much shame, I feel like an outcast and different from everyone else, like there’s a glass wall separating me and the rest of society.

What can I do to make this type of self hatred go? Is there any way to make the shame end? Will it go eventually? Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit, if there’s a better place to post this please let me know.",10Jul2019,4
154,"Last June (of 2018), I was taking a geometry class at my local math center with three other girls who were in my class. The class was extremely hard for me like no other math class has ever been - I barely understood the basics and was struggling towards the end. I had repeated the previous level three times over two years, and had just moved up to the next level. Unfortunately, the teacher and I were not on good terms. I could tell that she disliked me in class because of the way she looked at me when I got a question wrong (extremely apathetic and didn’t even help me to try to get the question right). Finally, the last day of the class came and I was looking forward to the end of a long, long year. The teacher, who I’ll refer to as Mrs. Elena, decided to have some ‘fun’ math activities, so I was put into a group with 3 other girls in my class. They all somehow knew each other and were extreme gossips. Oddly enough, the teacher told them to be quiet on a regular basis as not to distract the class, but they either faked guilt when saying sorry or ignored her, and the teacher pretended like nothing had happened and went right back to teaching. Obnoxious as they were, they got most of the answers in class right and seemed to have no trouble with the material. I’ll describe each one of these people. Girl 1 was reserved about her feelings, but you could tell that she was pretty cunning and lacked empathy when you looked into her eyes. Girl 2 had no sense of decorum and often criticized other people in a way that was meant to be ‘humorous.’ Girl 3 was kind of like a miniature version of Girl 2, except she was two-faced and usually acted normal around other people. Anyway, when I sat down with them to start the group activities, they immediately started tittering and said ‘welcome.’ At that moment, I got the sense that they were faking their friendliness, but I tried to smile and make it through the remaining minutes of the class. Then, the teacher decided last minute that we were going to go outside for break time. We sat down and ate some baked goods together. I was trying to block out the meaningless conversation; then, after the food was eaten, I ended up standing with the other girls in a corner of the yard. They started acting charming and ‘friendly’ once again, talking to each other about how I was a ‘cool person.’ Then, Girl 2 asked if I was offended by some parts of meme culture (i.e. offensive memes) and I smiled and said no. This took place at the end of a long year where I had experienced a lot of hardships at my school, notably bullying. I had an extremely fragile mindset and felt constantly afraid. At that point in time, I was naive and did not know about meme culture yet. I think the reason why I agreed to things that I wouldn’t have agreed to was because I was secretly seeking acceptance. After the questioning, the girls talked amongst each other as if I wasn’t even there. Girl 3 called me a ‘normie,’ then proceeded to say that I was ‘cool’ and that with a little work, I could ‘be fixed.’ But then, as we were walking around the building, I noticed something on Girl 1’s phone. She was replaying a video on her Snapchat story of what I had just said. I was horrified. I repeatedly asked to her delete it, but she just kept on walking away and ignoring me. As the girls were talking to my other classmates (all boys, easily controlled by them), I was beginning to go into the stages of shock at what had just happened. From there, the class ended and I went to my next class. Afterwards, I noticed that one of the girls had added me on Snapchat. I deleted Snapchat for three months and began to feel an extreme sense of panic whenever I thought of this incident. My chest physically hurt and it felt like there was a hole in my heart when I was perfectly healthy physically. The only people I told about this incident was my best friend when we were hanging out one day, who looked concerned and told me that I should probably tell the principal about it. I told her no, because I was so scared about what would happen if it got leaked and one of the colleges that I wanted to apply to found out about it. I was so focused on college at this time that I completely ignored my personal well being, which I realize now was such a mistake. About a month after the incident occurred, I ended up confessing the entire event to my mom, who was outraged. She demanded that we tell the principal about it, but I absolutely begged her not to. For some weird reason, I was petrified about what would happen if a college that I got accepted into kicked me out because of this. That worry, that fear, has consumed my life up until now. That fall, I enrolled in an algebra class on the weekend (my mom fought so hard to secure me a place in that class) and I entered it on the first day, realizing just then that it was the exact same 3 girls and teacher who had ruined my life last summer. I felt like my chest was caving in, and they started faking friendliness again once they saw me. Girl 2 asked me why I hadn’t contacted them on Snapchat last year and Girl 3 said that they had missed me so much. Ironically, Girl 1 stayed quiet this entire time. We did an icebreaker in the beginning of class, where I stumbled on a memory game because of how nervous I was feeling around them, and the three girls broke out in snickers. I felt absolutely horrible for the rest of the class. Even though algebra is a subject that I normally excel at, I struggled to find the answer to the problems because of the teacher’s vague teaching methods and the girls’ constant snickers whenever I got a problem wrong. The teacher acted apathetic and unhelpful as usual, always moving onto another, more ‘knowledgeable’ student. At one point, I was called up to answer a problem on the board, and couldn’t think about the problem because of my nervousness. I heard Girl 1 quietly snickering to herself and making an underhanded comment about me. Just then, the bell rung and all of the students filed out of the room. I honestly wanted to die at the end of that class. I told my mom in the car and begged her to let me transfer to another algebra class, who simply dismissed them as being ‘silly girls.’ After I’d poured my heart out to her a couple of months earlier, I was shocked how trivial she’d made it out to be. I know in my heart that she truly does care for me from the depths of her soul, but that...just made me feel worthless, like my pain was automatically invalidated. I did briefly consider transferring to another class at that level but with different students, but none of the other ones would work out with my schedule. I did end up transferring to another class, which was much easier and had a teacher who I was on really good terms with. This teacher truly cared for me and I loved her from the bottom of my heart. She asked me why I was taking this class when it was beneath my level. I should have confessed to her right then and there what was going on, but instead I made up some false excuse and told her that taking the easier level class was the only way that my schedule would work out. Unfortunately, my mom got aggravated with me taking an easier level class and snapped at me for obsessing over a couple of stupid girls. The kids in the class that I was taking were super genuine and friendly; I even made friends with one girl who was really talkative and kind. But the class started to get very tedious after about four weeks because of how easy the material was. I breezed through everything three times as fast as the other kids and was facing a dilemma: should I stay in the easy class and be bored out of my mind, or should I transfer back into the class that was at my level and be tortured? I asked my best friend about this and she told me that I could ask the staff if I could transfer into her class. It worked out, and I ended up going to the math center on a week day to attend a class that was at my level with a person who I was perfectly comfortable with and had known for a long time. The teacher was okay, but my classmates were really amiable and authentic, if not a bit eccentric in their sense of humor. I had about eight weeks of peace and serenity, until...one day out of the blue, Girl 1 walked into my class and sat down near my friend and I. She barely said a word during the first class, but I could tell that she was observing our class dynamic silently. I felt exceedingly uncomfortable with her prescence, but most of the class went pretty smoothly. The next class, she showed up and took a seat towards the back of the classroom with the more ‘popular’ kids who apparently went to her school. This relationship was awkward. She made small talk with them on occasion and tried to look engaged, but I noticed that even for a couple of weeks afterwards during break time, she would promptly disappear out into the hallway and not come back until class started again. That class, she triggered me when break time started. I had not known the answer to a problem and had asked the teacher how to solve it. While I was at her desk, receiving assistance, Girl 1 promptly walked over and placed her foot onto my chair, staring apathetically across the classroom as if it were the most natural thing to do. I stared over at her, shocked, as the teacher continued on explaining directions to me. I spent that rest of the class talking with my friend and this group of four other girls. Something notable about her was that she walked through the classroom with a smooth, brisk air, as if she owned the entire place. I could tell that she was a very subtle, manipulative person. On the third class after she had first arrived, she was not there and I felt relieved, thinking that she had come to class for a makeup session due to a short period of being unable to attend her regular algebra class (maybe a sports event or a chorus concert or some other event). But on the fourth class, she started coming again. Rarely did we ever speak during these sessions (because I was with my friend), but I remember once, I heard her snigger while I was asking the teacher a question in front of the whole class. Even though I barely interacted with her, on the fourth-to-last class of that semester, my friend was not there, so I was sitting all by myself in a pair of desks. When she walked in, I felt so freaked out and terrified that she was going to pull something on me that I moved back to the row of desks where the group of four girls were sitting and tried to make light conversation with them. I don’t know why, but that sensation of being alone really freaked me out and caused me to make up various excuses not to attend the last four classes of the semester (i.e. I have a test tomorrow, finals are coming up, I feel exhausted from school and want to go to sleep). My friend texted me asking if I was going to be at class and why I had not came on the last day, when we had a party. Now, I regret not having went to the math center and wasting $320+ of my mom’s money. She really works hard and I feel so guilty for making such a big deal about something that could have been fixed by a quick chat with the principal. I feel so foolish right now. I’ve always had this math center as a safe space where I could learn and chat with other people, even when school was really harsh on me, and now that’s being taken away from me. No matter the outcome, I just really want to move on with my life and feel happy for once in two years. Is it worth it to talk with the principal one year after this incident happened?",10Jul2019,1

167,"Forgive me for odd formatting, I'm on mobile, and I had to repost because the mobile app is funky sometimes and confused me.

Anyway, I work at a pawn shop style store where a woman came to trade in her switch, for cash. She only had the handheld part though, and we have to have the dock and cords etc. to take it as a whole system. I told her we could take her controllers, or she could potentially sell it on Facebook market or something akin to that for like $100. She declined and said she doesn't care, because the switch won't charge.

So I take her joycons (the controllers) and give her the cash for them, she says I can keep the 'screen part' because she doesn't have anything to do with it. This is the part that is the actual system. So I keep it. I let it charge for a few hours, and it actually does charge and come on. It was just So Dead that it took a couple hours to get off of 1%. 

It has some really good games preinstalled on it, and I'm trying to see if there's a way to transfer the games onto my own switch/personal account when I realize the switch still has a credit card attached (which I deleted the information of immediately) and it just..... Feels off. In order to get the account on my personal switch I have to use the email address (which I obviously don't have access) or contact support, but... I really don't know if this switch belongs to someone else and I want to do the right thing.

Do I go ahead with moving the stuff over to my switch, potentially alerting whoever the original owner was that I know have their stolen switch, and make me look bad, or do I trust this is all legitimate and do it anyway?
I don't want to seem judgemental, the woman was very kind and friendly, not like our normal customers with obviously stolen merchandise, I've just seen a lot of theft at my job and don't want to be part of it.

188,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Sorry if formatting isn't the greatest. 

As title says, it's about a family member I work with, and have been for 5 years now. My mom (M) and her sister (my aunt, A) have always fought while I was growing up, but nothing too serious, generally just an argument here and there, and I was usually not around when the big fights broke out. It wasn't until I was 18 (25, F) that I realized it was an unhealthy relationship. My mom is an extremely caring person, always putting someone else before herself, so 2 years ago M realized she needed to set some new boundaries with A since M was always getting hurt, which lead to a lot of family drama. Basically long story short, A has alienated herself from our family, and M is still taking it pretty hard, but slowly grieving her relationship M used to have with A. 

I work a Monday to Friday job with A, and I absolutely love my job, but A keeps bringing family drama to work at every chance she gets. For example, we work in the office together and as soon as we are alone she brings up the drama, or we are having a general discussion at lunch with our co-workers and A finds opportunities to basically trash talk my parents in front of all my coworkers (A has never liked my dad, even though he has always treated her the best he can, despite being hated by A). It is making it extremely difficult to handle at work, to the point I joked about calling her a deatheater to my boyfriend since A is sucking all the happiness from me at work. 

Over the last 2 years I could write a 10 page essay about the nasty things she has done to M, and to myself, but I want advice on how to set healthy boundaries for my relationship with her at work (I only see her at work now, and the rare family function). I don't want to quit my job, but that is basically the route I am considering right now since it has gotten so bad. I still love her as my aunt, but I don't know how to talk to her without her turning it around back to me (she's great at manipulating things a person says). 

Thanks for any, and all advice!",10Jul2019,1
189,"So long story short, my mother caught me 18F having sex with my boyfriend, 18M. She knows I was on birth control, and I have been dating for a little less than a month with this person. At first she was cool about it and not very angry, but at one in the morning she came in my room yelling at me telling me I wasn’t her daughter, that I am easy and a target for men now, that our neighbors were going to try to assault me, that she threw her life away for me, that I ruined my life, threatening to tell my father and even threatened to commit suicide. She took two or three sleeping pills, I believe to scare me or manipulate me? She’s gone crazy like this before but not at this level. She said she lost all respect for me, and that I was a whore over and over again. This morning, I left the house and met up with my boyfriend at the gym to try to discuss a game plan. I decided to spend the night at a friends house, especially since that morning my mother (who skipped work) told me she didn’t want to see my face. So, I followed that request and went to my house, with my boyfriend in the car, to pack a bag. While I was doing that, she asked where I was going, and I told her that I was sleeping over at my best friends house. She basically replied telling me that I was lying and was just going to have sex all night like the whore I am. She then told me to leave and never set foot in the house again, and she took my car, my house key, and tried to take my phone. My dad is a truck driver out on the road and I don’t know if he knows anything, but my gut is telling me he would also disown me if he knew. I have important documents like my associates degree (early college), my birth certificate, and my social security card, but I have no job (my parents discouraged me getting a job) and am going to college soon and don’t have my loan taken out, need to go to an orientation, and need to move up to a college three hours away. I know I have support from my friends and boyfriends and their families, but I just need advice or even just some consolation or anything really. Thank you so much in advance, it really means a lot.
Tl;dr: got caught having sex, mom was fine at first but then started freaking out in the middle of the night, kicked me out the next day and now I’m stuck with no job and heading to college severely underprepared. Help.",10Jul2019,1

191,"I coach kids and my boss disagrees with me on how I should be teaching a certain skill. The sport I coach is known for being particularly hard on the body and I understand that, but I also think that if there's a particular thing we know is bad for the body and if we could be doing it a different way, we should. I have been taught by other coaches that keeping your legs straight in a certain skill will put unnecessary pressure on the lower back, so I have been taught to have athletes bend their knees. My boss wants the athletes to keep their legs straight and I've asked them multiple times about changing the way we do it and pointing out that I've been told that it causes back pain, but it honestly kind of feels like my concerns are being brushed aside. They argued that our sport in general is hard on your back so why be especially concerned about this skill. I've even looked for peer-reviewed articles to try and find more information about why it hurts their back. One problem is that there hasn't been a ton of research in this area, which is frustrating, but the things I did find point to straight legs in the skill leading to pressure on their back. I love my boss as a person, but as a coach they are making me feel really frustrated right now because I'm scared that the kids we coach are going to hurt their backs. It feels like if I keep bringing it up it'll just look like I'm being stubborn and that I just wanted to be right, but at the same time it's really hard to just drop the conversation when I'm still concerned. The way my boss talked to me today gave me the impression that they don't want me asking about it anymore. They have a lot more experience coaching the sport than I do and I respect that, but at the same time it's frustrating feeling like I'm being dismissed. 

Am I overreacting?",10Jul2019,1
192,"Apologies, this is going to sound really cheesy

So, 3 years ago I met someone. And from the instant I met them I was practically head over heels for them. Since then we've become best friends. Helped each other and stuck with each other through everything life has thrown at us. I've literally never felt closer to anyone in my life and I honest to whatever gods may be out there love them. And I've never felt like that before. I've had crushes but this, nothing like this..
2 years ago I was going to ask them out. But on the night I was about to, they met someone else... and they've been in a relationship happily ever since.
All this time I thought I could move on, be happy for my best friend. Find someone else, but damn it no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try for two years. I cant stop loving them, I care about them more than anything in the world. And even after two whole years after they started seeing each other, just the thought of them being together makes me feel sick and throws me into a hole of depression (which has led me to write this). 
And now that they've been dating for 2 years, it feels like I'm losing them more and more, we spend time together less and they spend more time together. And when we do spend time together the person they're seeing is constantly messaging them. Whenever I look over it feels like they're on their phone and that they'd rather be with their partner than their best friend.
I know they're together, and they love each other but gods damn does it hurt. And in the end of it all I just want to spend time alone with my friend without feeling like a third wheel or an awkward bystander.

I love them deeply, and I want to be with them, and it's getting harder and harder to set those feelings aside. It's starting to worry me that I may be pushing them away, but at the same time I need to actually see them to push them away so I'm completely clueless.

I'm so confused and dont know what to do...",10Jul2019,1
193,"I [25F] dated john [30M] for 3 months. We hung out 3-4 times a week and spent the night at each other’s apartments multiple times a week. We also had lots of sexual experiences in that time. Eventually john broke up with me because he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was upset about it.

Then I meet mike [30M] . He asks me out to dinner. Upon creeping on his Instagram page I see he has several photos with john. So I messaged him saying “hey, I dated john for 3 months. I just wanted to let you know for the sake of transparency and I totally understand if you don’t want to have dinner anymore”

He tells me john is actually one of his best friends but it’s fine, we’re all adults and it’s not a big deal.

But this all kind of rubbed me the wrong way. If the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t be okay with dating/sleeping with someone my close friend had already dated/slept with. 

Why was he so nonchalant about it all? Plus, if things worked out, I would have to see john eventually since he’s part of mike’s friend group. It was just too sketchy of a situation for me.

So I decided to text him and cancel dinner. He told me I was being silly and that dinner wasn’t hurting anyone. I stood my ground.

194,"My (17f) boyfriend (17m) and I have been dating for nearly two years. We’ve definitely had our ups and downs but we’re very happy together.

A few days ago, he got his first part time job for the summer. A 4pm-10pm shift at a local fast food joint...and truth be told I’m not handling it well. 

As a backstory, my parents are divorced and I spend half the time with my mom and stepdad and half the time with my dad. Its completely 50/50. My entire life, my dad has always been the laidback parent while my mom has been overprotective and strict. At my moms, I’m not allowed to leave the house (only to go to school or band practice), have my phone for more than 2hrs per day, stay up past 9pm (11pm on weekends), drive, and most important for this tread...get a job.

I’ve found myself becoming very jealous of my boyfriend and even more resentful of my mom and stepdad. I’ve been wanting to get a job for the longest time so I had a chance to get out of the house and not be completely cut off from the world when I’m at her house. The fact my boyfriend gets home and tells me all about the interesting stuff that goes on at work while I’ve been cooped up in the house with no outside contact (I have an old phone I use to talk to him at night, but my parents don’t know about it) makes me cry.

I know it isn’t his fault whatsoever and I haven’t told him anything I’ve been feeling, but I need advice as to how I could make myself feel better. I’ve tried sitting my mom down about getting a job multiple times but the answer is always, “This is my last summer with you home, I want to spend it with you.” (I’m about to be a senior in highschool) so asking to get a job won’t be an option.

Reddit, please help me. How do I deal with this without taking it out on my boyfriend when it isn’t really his fault (and him working is just triggering resentment for a situation implemented by my parents)?",10Jul2019,1
195,"There are many times my dad gets mad at my little brother who is 10 for no reason at all. Today for example we were having rice and chicken for dinner and my little bro was flattening out his rice to let it cool better, my dad got all mad at him and was saying that he didn't have any manners for doing that and that the only way to cool it off is to blow on it. He said something like ""dont flatten your food out, you have no manners, if you want to cool it off you put it on your fork and blow on it"" even though all of my siblings and me have done that thing previously. Another time today was when my sister was talking about her new job and she mentioned how she had to train someone in her old job that didn't know how to clean windows. My little bro then says ""how could they not know how to clean windows"" my dad then pops in and says to him ""dont be assuming stuff about people you dont even know how to clean windows"" and then he starts saying that he does and he even cleaned them the other day. I wanted to speak up to him and say ""you got mad at him for assuming but then you just assumed he didn't know how to clean them"" he says little things like that constantly to my little bro and it's even brought him to tears because of what my dad says.

198,"It's a long one. And I'm probably just venting but I also hope someone can give me good advice. I want to get better. 

I'm a female in my early twenties. I came from a middle class family. We had enough of everything but we could not afford more than what we needed. My parents were very frugal even if there were things they could afford. Hence, as a child I was raised to want less and ask for less. Also being the elder one in the family, I was expected to be the adult for my younger brother. For example, if wanted a new toy, my parents could convince me otherwise. I never fought for them more than necessary. 
My brother on the other hand cried for things until he got what he wanted. These things never bothered me because I thought it never bothered me. Also for context, the reason my brother was born was because society demands a male heir in my part of the world. But now as I am living away from my parents alone with my roommates, basically being an adult, I see patterns of my behavior that are disturbing to me. 

I believe it's how I was raised that has affected me. I was shy and never spoke much. I was treated like a boy when my family wanted to. I was tom boyish. I could not choose the clothes I wanted to wear. My mother told me what was best for me and I never fought back. Even if I did, it was not for long because eventually I saw that she loved me in her own way. But then again I was treated like a girl when society demanded it of me. Act like this and that. 

Now, as I am by myself I feel like I'm not my own person at all. Everything I wear, choose, think, are the result of what has influenced me and what I was exposed to growing up. So now my problem is that I overthink. I used to overthink a lot before as well, but now I'm questioning my very being, my own identity. Do I even have one? 

I'm depressed I suppose because something as simple as trying to have a night for myself, I have this long dialog with myself. ""It's okay. You want this. But what if you're missing out on something. No. It's okay. What if you offend your friend."" And so on. I know my friends won't think like that or even if they do they won't take it to heart. But I feel like I'm disappointing all of them. I am trapped in my self-made bed of self hatred.

My overthinking wasn't always this bad. If I wanted to do something I just did it or not if I didn't want to, but it's getting worse. It's getting worse because I've been trying to be independent. I always used to share all these inner thoughts to my best friend, but we eventually started drifting apart because we live far away from each other. Either I was too tired from work and university or she was. Our lives just became different. Still we try to keep in touch, but it's not the same. At the same time, a part of me tells me it's okay. I have to be an adult and what not. I can't go on crying about every little thing to my best friend. 

Well the thing is I am a loner and she and another friend of my mine were the only people close to me. Now all the friends I make, I try to be emotionally distant because I am always so emotional and I always overthink, that I don't want to burden them either. In that I'm losing touch with what a friendship is. I feel like the relationships I'm forming right now, I'm only being selfish and using people when I need them. Although my intentions are good, my actions speak differently. I talk to them when I need to. Otherwise I'm just in my room listening to music or studying.

I've tried to go to a counselor at my university but I don't know, I'm afriad I guess. I was going to have an appointment but they didn't pick up the phone. And I thought I could be better by myself. But recently I hurt the only friend who cares for me really bad because of my overthinking and overanalysing of my own thoughts that I can't separate fact and opinions and even get them mixed up with my own emotional projections of a situation. 

I want to be a better friend. I want to get to know who I really am too beyond this body. I get confused a lot in my mind. But I even want to go to graduate school and study a lot and make a contribution to the society. But I'm lost. At this point, I just hate myself.",10Jul2019,5

201,"Using a throwaway account because my friend knows my username and they are very active on Reddit. 

I should start by saying that I have worked the same position for nearly 4 years and there is no room for advancement in the company. I work as a receptionist at a hotel. I am in an dead end job. I don't hate my work, but I do wish it paid more and I think deep down I realize I can't work this position forever.

My friend works the same position in another hotel, but they are a supervisor. They make about 5 dollars more than me an hour. They are stepping down from their position though and going back to school. They half heartily mentioned that I should apply as it would be good for me to have on my resume, I would make more money and would have the chance to work together. So I applied. And I had an interview. But now I am having second thoughts on saying yes if the position is offered to me.

I love my friend dearly and I consider them basically my only friend. We do everything together and our days off are usually spent hanging out with each other. I know if I take this position, the possibility for us to hang out will basically be nonexistent. They are planing on working weekends when not in school and plan on spending their summers working their full time. If we work in the same place, my days off will be their work days and vice versa. I do not know if the higher pay and job title is worth limited quality time with my friend. There is also the slight issue that I will be taking my friend's position so I will become their superior. I think our friendship could withstand that, but it is also a worry.

I understand it is unrealistic to think we will be able to continue like this. SOMETHING will come up and we won't be able to always hang out. But accepting the position feels like I am the one pulling the trigger. 

So, I need some advice. Is it wise to turn down a high paying position because I am worried how it will affect a relationship with a close friend?",10Jul2019,2

204,"So im having a bit of a mental dilemma.

When I think about life. My head ends up always rolling back to one thing. Its a thing I've wanted since I was a kid.

A family. 

Im a guy, im 26, and currently im single. I've always looked forward to the day I could be a father to kids of my own with my wife (whoever that may be), but dating isn't really the easiest thing. I know it was never really easy, but I feel like it's just gotten harder as the years go by.

So in the last year or so Ive been on one date and I've been stood up/ghosted I cant even count how many times. The one girl I did end up going on that date with I felt like I had tons in common with and we sat there and BS'd for hours over coffee. I wanted a second date, but she claimed she's not the greatest with social media/texting. So when I would try and set up a second one. I would get alot of radio silence and eventually I feel like I ended up kind of ruining it for myself (in all honestly).

Long story short I was alot more insecure at the time when we dated. I had just dropped a ton of weight, but I still was really deep in depression and I unfairly kind of whiped all of that at her. I assumed that she was toying with me for attention and when she left for collage I kept trying to keep it going in hopes that my fears/insecurities were untrue. Then I had heard she started dating a girl and I snapped at her about it claiming that I asked her to be honest and if she wasn't interested in me to just to tell me and not lead me on.

Eventually flash forward about a year I fully appologized to her and pretty much said that no matter how she felt about me and that I totally respect it if she doesn't want to associate with me anymore and that at the very least I owe her a full apology for my ridiculous actions.

Since then I have had conversations here and there, but all extremely casual and they never really went anywhere, but I keep thinking back to how fun that date was and honestly regretting how stupid I was because I feel like I actually had a good shot at something with her.

Occasionally she still likes my posts on instagram here and there, but it's pretty much been radio silence from the both of us. We havent spoken in like a year-ish.

So my dilemma is should I try and reconnect or do you think it's too far gone to revive? Plus im not even sure she's into men anymore.

Im not gonna lie I'm currently feeling pretty lonely. Im totally happy with who I am and I'm okay being by myself, but I really wish I had someone to just spend time with and talk to.

Ultimately I want to reconnect, but Im worried my loneliness is getting the better of me. So I thought I would get some other perspectives outside of my own.",10Jul2019,2
205,"My friend had talked a lot about ""Fallout"" to me during my 7th grade. I didn't think much of it until I decided to just try it out. I was trying to find a download online but nothing worked and the more I looked, the more hyped I got for playing the game. I decided to find a good price on it but everything was on Ebay and expensive because it was a great old game.   A week ago my test scores from the state for my CAASP of NWEA had come in and I had studied hard for it  and got a 95%. My dad was so happy that he said he would buy me ANYTHING. Quote un Quote: ""I proud of you. I'll buy you something. What do you want? I'll buy you anything: Toys...(And more examples of what I could buy)."" I couldn't believe it. 

At first I wanted to buy a nintendo switch or a google stadia, but I didn't know how to get any games on them for free after I bought them.  He said we could go to target(This was a few days after he told me i could buy anything) and I first set my eyes on the nintendo switch. He looked at the price and was astounded. Quote un Quote: "" What? I can't buy this!!"" We argued more and I broke down in the store(I cry very easily). 

Then at home I showed him the price of the google stadia, which was $129 and came with the same response. A few weeks later we were going to Disneyland and he said I could buy something cheap there. I refused my urge to buy the stuff tourists buy there since my eyes were set on a videogame, ""Fallout."" After Disneyland he said I could have a budget of $50.

 I asked him to buying $51 worth of steam games since I always had got the trashy ""free to play"" games on there. He denied me. I then decided to buy JUST the first two fallout games and they seemed awesome. They were expensive, as said before, and both games were $51 in total. I didn't wan't to get an answer of no this time. I wen't as far as watching a dumb video to persuade people. He denied me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, today I asked him what i had to do for him to buy it. He told me to do 100 math questions on this dumb scootpad thing, which gives you algebra problems multiple choice.  The dumb scootpad thing doesn't even track whether you get the problems right or not;It just checks how many you've completed. Even though I knew this, I still actually put my head to trying to get the answers correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what he said afterwards. DENIED. He acted as if he never told me to do the problems and just ignored me when i told i did the problems and that i wanted for him to buy it. I have no doubt about it. He's a cheapskate and a liar. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help. Either tell me how to persuade him or get back at him or SOMETHING PLEASE. HELP ME HERE.

(Also, just so you guys know, I have never bought a videogame ever, except for some stupid roblox shit. I download games from the internet. I don't have a console. I wan't to be a gamer. I aspire to be one. I will be one, and he will not stop me no matter what.)

You see, I’m kind of in this situation where I’ve fucked up my education so I’m going to an “alternative school” (basically kids who’ve gotten kicked out of school have to go here to finish) and I don’t have any real friends other than her. I have some acquaintances that I rarely talk to and only hangout with when I’m with her (they’re really just her friends and I sometimes tag along) 

She started becoming friends with this guy that she has feelings for and hasn’t really been hanging out with me? And I get it, high school crush “oh my gosh he’s so great!!!1!” So I get that she’d want to be around him and talk to him a lot. It’s just that she used to invite me out with them and her other friends but now she doesn’t. (Which I understand they’re her friends and I’m just tagging along. It’s not the “they are her friends” part, it’s the not thinking of me? Or” not wanting to hangout with me” part, I suppose?? I’m sorry this is really shitty dumb teenage drama)

There have been times where this guy has been in situations where we thought he might’ve been in danger or having a very rough time with his family and she would not stop worrying about him and she would literally just sit there and tap her foot worrying about him for hours. (When the situation turned out to be a misunderstanding in the end) 

And I feel that she doesn’t care that much about me? 

“Boohoo your friend wouldn’t lose her mind if you stubbed your toe. Get over yourself.” I hear you, I really do, it’s just that I really care about her but I don’t want to keep stressing over this and about her if she doesn’t even want to be around me anymore. 

Now the advice I’m asking for is how to bring this up to her. She’s very stubborn and thinks she’s “right” in a way. She can be an asshole to others and to me (but not as much), and she doesn’t really see a problem with it or recognize that it’s unnecessary and a bit rude. 

It’s easy to say “just drop this friend if they’re an asshole!” but in reality this could just be a different situation or a misunderstanding and I’m blowing it out of proportion. I really honestly just want to see another perspective or some advice on how to bring this up. This is me getting this off my chest because I’ve been thinking about this for so long.

We’ve been through so much together and she’s supported me through hard times and I have supported her through hard times. I would really like to get past this.

Thank you for reading this post, I hope your brain isn’t too fried from reading this.",10Jul2019,6

My car was driving fine but recently started making horrible noises. Sounds like you’re shaking up a tool box.  It still turns on and drives but I know it’s going to just die eventually.

215,"I recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in May, and the job hunt has been gruesome. I've had maybe 3 interviews that I would consider something full-time and for my career, among hundreds of applications since January. I've had some offers at retail stores as I have been trying to pass time, but these offers were very low or just not enough hours. To add onto my situation I have been living with my grandmother rent free. I'm very grateful for this, but I'm also a few hours away from my closest friends and in a town that really has no sort of night life or socializing for people my age. Needless to say if it wasn't for gyms I'd be doing absolutely nothing. I recently got offered my old job during college, it would be part-time and decent pay. Arguably as good as it gets when it comes to part-time jobs where I'm from. I thoroughly enjoyed this job and would love to work there again. But by accepting this job it would require me to move, pay rent, and in a sense put a hold on my search for my career. I am nearly out of money, and accepting this job would allow me to have a decent income with the opportunity to even find a 2nd job. It takes a big hit on my ego, as being a college grad I would have never guessed I'd be struggling and taking low wage part-time jobs but it's my reality. I guess my question is, do I continue to bet on myself and hope to get a job within my career that is full time without an income or do I move out in order to get a decent job as well as be among friends. I'm more than happy to answer more questions about my situation and would appreciate some feedback. I have gone to family and friends but their response are in short ""doing what would makes me happiest"". I'd love and appreciate a real and logical answer, thanks.",10Jul2019,2

217,"I have a problem! I had an ex that made me change country to move with him by persuasing me to quit my job! Then I met his mother who was made like a pet from his father and him! I told him that I don't want to become like his mother and I broke up with him moving to another city. Ah, before breaking up, when I found this job he was coming everyday with 2 bottles of winefor dinner fueling my then drinking problem. So, I started my new job and broke up. After a while he persuaded me to be back together. He rent with me a nice very expensive apartment. I found a young handsome guy and dumbed him. He didn't pay the rent and I got in big trouble because I couldn't afford. I was asking my mother etc. I believe that he was talking to my mother presenting stuff in a distorted light. I lost all my - not that many economies - from that - I was also spending on myself before I realized the thing with the house. I was Airbnbing it as well so I was getting money also from that source. So, because of this somehow (I believe he revealed it) I had trouble at work and my contract was not extended. Because I was doing my PhD, I got depressed and crashed my car etc, so HE offered to help me (he never paid like 1000 euros to fix my car) by paying my debt and soem other things like the rent. My contract was extended for 2 days per week only so I had to accept his financial help in order to pay the rent. One day, a friend of minetold me that he called her and told her that I was diagnosed with schitzofrenia. This is not true, I was seeing a Psydoc but for the depression, they never madicated me or treated me for schitzofrenia, I believe that the doctors would have revealed it to me. So, I stopped talking with her because I needed his financial help and he was threatening me to not contact her. Let me say at this point that if he is sued for slander, his career - and he only cares about his career - is over. So, I believe he was afraid and he forced me to lose my friend and not learn other things or reveal to her the truth. I am still unemployeed and he helps me financially, and he controls : my boy (he threatens to leave me if I don't leave him, I lost my boy at some point), my productivity, he forces me to do work for him unpaid for ""my career"" and wait to apply for jobs until the papers are in press, I apply for jobs and he acts like happy but beats me and starts slamming doors because I ""did something that pissed him off and I am ungrateful for his help"". My mother stoped her financial help to me calling me names etc and my sister told me that HE said to her that I am schitzofrenic and HE HIMSELF took me to the doctor. This never ever happened, he never ever saw my diagnosis - which btw is not schitzofrenia hahaha. The thing is that I tell him to employ me and he tells me that he cannot while he employed his roomate and friend (M). His boss is an old supervisor of mine and he helped him when he was fired from his department by employing him ( but he will not talk to this boss for me). He doesn't want me to be financialy independent and ruins my career. He interferes with persons that I know as well (friends and colleagues) and  I don't want to imagine what he tells them. The point is that throughout our relationship as well we were very competitive, with me being smarter and more accomplished, in terms of recognised intellectual independence etc while he published his bosses idea and I know that soem experiments were fraud. 

How do I escape this, since all this affected my career and probably what he says led to me being discriminated against from my boss and colleagues and friends, without me having an actual problem - but people see me unemployed for example and they think that I am o disability or something like that - BUT I AM NOT.

221,"For some context, I have a unicornuate uterus. It's half the size it should be and one of fallopian tubes is both not functioning and disconnected from everything. My estimated chance of getting pregnant is about 30 to 40 percent but a chance of miscarriage around 50 to 70 percent.

My mother is frustrated and wants to be a grandmother. Says that the doctor told her over and over that she would miscarry with me so she had to quit her job and just rest at home. She tells me ""it's possible"" and that she ""there's no right time to have a kid"" but the one that frustrates me the most is that she tells me that the doctors don't actually know anything and that I should just get pregnant to satisfy her need.

She's definitely suffering from empty nest syndrome. My issue is very rare, so there's one specialist in the area that is always busy. I've been told to not get pregnant until I've gone through the surgery of removing the one fallopian tube because then it'll be a better estimate and judgement as well as worry about the chance of an ectopic pregnancy.

229,"  

I’ve never posted on reddit before so my apologies if this is out of place. But I need some outside thoughts on my current life predicament. 

I found out a few months ago that my step-daughter is pregnant, she 14.  My husband had her young too he was 20 when she was born.  

I came into her life when she was just over a year old. I was younger too… and I won’t lie kids were not part of my lifestyle at that time. I was into parties and going to college. Now that I’m older obviously I’ve learned a lot over the years and I try to stay as involved as I a step-parent came be. We live over an hour away but I’ve went out of my way to help go to sports ect.  I’ve also stayed out of the discipline, because I’ve also thought that’s the true parent’s role. I mean if she’s doing something insane, I’d surely let her know, and possibly take the toy or phone or whatever she was into at that moment away. I support her 110% and would be there for her in a flash if she needed me. I love that girl like she’s my own.  She grew up with her mom who in my mind has never been a great role model and we had her every other weekend. She’s broken so many promises to the little girl over the years it breaks my heart. Her mom has had terrible boyfriends around all the time, some of which I think were abusing the mom and the kids (she has two other kids, with two other dads).  The mom always told her before she came to see us “what happens at mom’s house stays at mom’s house”. I mean now that I write this, I sound like an idiot that should had seen all this coming.  I mean I did. But what the hell can I do? Her mom “hates” me. I’ve been told that over and over through the years from the kids. On the weekends we could get her, she would come to us and be legit wearing rags as a baby so we would buy her new winter coats, hat’s anything and we would never see it again. I’m sure her mom was selling, pawning or whatever terrible mothers do. The kids got caught stealing young too. After we got sick of buying new things every time, we saw here we would keep the nice things at our house. The little one would layer pants and shirts to get them back to her mom. She was like three when this started. The little one stole from my sister’s house at like age seven and we busted her. I don’t think she’s ever seen me so irate before that. She got caught with her mom stealing at store. I could go on and on about how horrible her childhood was and dammnit do I feel like the worst person around that I didn’t try and save her from it. I didn’t know better… I just stayed out of it. A step parent is a difficult role the way it is. I’ve also gave my two cents to my husband. 

I just never thought I would be dealing with a 14-year-old expecting a child, when I myself haven’t even had a child. I’ll be a damn Step-Grandma before I’m a mom.   When I first found out she was expecting I thought It was a dream, I legit cried for days, didn’t know what to think. So many emotions were going through my head and I didn’t know what I wanted to believe. I still cry myself to sleep because I can’t fix this. I can’t help her. I can’t say anything. She had ruled out an abortion right away, and I’m fine with that. I know PLENTY of people my age that are looking for a child and can’t have one of their own. I really have been pushing the adoption route but I don’t want to be too pushy because I’m not the parent and I don’t want her to stop talking to me. I’ve showed her profiles of families looking for kids. I just want her to know her options. Her mom is over there planning reveal parties and baby showers in her damn dream world while I’m over here crying my eyes out. 

It’s like a rock and a hard place. Her mom is not letting her talk to anyone about it and won’t let her see us without her older sister around to make sure she reports all conversations back to home. Her mom “broke” her phone so she can’t get in touch with us. You know what her mom’s first question to us was? Do you think that I won’t get child support from you guys anymore now that she’s expecting? Are you kidding me? Then she took the girl down to the local support office found out just how much the state will pay her once this child is born and got a wic card and all the free stuff she could get her damn hands on. This MOM lives off the three kids support checks and a tax return.  It just sucks. My first question was what are we going to do about school and the mom said “I gave up on that this year she’ll just have to do online school and go back to school after she has the baby.” Then it dawned on me that she can’t even drive herself to any of her appointments ...this part is good. You know what the mom said?! She told me “She can drive, she just can’t get caught” ARE YOU F’EN kidding me. 

We’ve been talking to lawyers trying to find out if we can get her out of there. We could. With the history we have (you only have 1/13th of the story) probably pretty easy but it’s going to cost around 20 grand and by the time this baby is brought into this world we have less than three years till she’s 18. My husband and I continue to tell her life isn’t going to be easy with whatever option you choose. Life will not be easy with us because we are going to push you. You will finish school; you will have a job and you will have to help us out around the house. Seams simple right?  Life is too easy with her mom for her to want to leave. Even if we did take her out of her mom’s house, I can see her running back. I know she will. We tried to take her when she was younger and her mom convincing her to come back to her and her mom promised us, she got her crap together. The in-laws are mad at me because I don’t think we should use all of our savings to get her out of something that she’s just going to run back to. I’d rather push her and use that money for her future.  

And my parents are all mad at me and think I should do something… not really sure what. But they are mad because I haven’t given them a grandchild. Frankly I don’t think I can. Concerting how fertile my husband’s family is and my husband I have been together for 14 years and not once … not once have I had to take a pregnancy test. I have NOT been on birth control for 10+ of these years. I’m so stressed.  I’m not even sure I want kids of my own, I can’t even control the mental health of my own life right now let alone a small child. My husband and I were just thinking that this would be the year we would figure it out if we could have children of our own. And now we are dealing with a 14-year-old. She’s told us if she does do the adoption route that she doesn’t want to keep it in the family because she feels like it would be a burden on them and a consent reminder of her “mistake”.  I’m so lost, so depressed and I just need an outside voice to wake me up from this damn horrible dream. How would you handle this?",10Jul2019,1
230,"I'm really going to try to condense this as much as I can but give you the biggest picture possible...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So me and a high school friend (I'm 21 now, she's 22) have been messing around with one another for again recently for like 6 months now (initially we did in high school), no strings attached or anything so it's great. Now, to make this point sooner than later, she is one of my best friends that's a girl (we never had a history of dating or anything) and has a very attractive personality and we always have a fun time regardless if anything occurs. Her at a glimpse: she is into 'bad boys' and has a history of some rough relationships with addicts, fuck-ups, etc., so she herself grew to be somewhat of a bad girl, but I LIKE IT. A lot. And idk why.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we usually go out to the bars and many times we run into people we know from high school, so we get caught up in hanging out with them too. Many times, the most random people we'll run into, we end up finishing off our night with them when I don't care for these people whatsoever. The most recent occurrence from this past weekend went down like this:

We went to one bar, met people there of course, and left with these randoms to another bar. It's now midnight and we end up staying till close, so 4:00AM, and our time there was fun; had drinks, took pictures, danced, whatever. Well, when she's drunk and maybe also on another drug, she get's sexual (even sober she's still horny). Well, she finds and talks to a random guy, more interested in him than me, I guess. As we were leaving, we are about to enter my car until he comes up to her passenger side of the car asking for her number, and she ends up kissing him in front of me... We drove back to her house and had a conversation outside her house for some time....

&amp;#x200B;

It's 6:00AM now and she's still fucked up, so the talk we had probably didn't mean shit. I had plans to spend the night there until she got a fucking CALL AT 6:00AM from a guy asking if she wants to chill....wtf do you mean ""let's chill"", go to bed loser. Unfortunately, she tells him to come to her house. Once he gets there he comes into my car as we are still discussing what happened at the bar, he sensed a weird vibe. Me being upset, tells her I'm not sleeping here after that, so she ends up going to this guy in my cars house and sleeps there.... Now I'm fucking pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Her mom calls me the next morning, and her mom ADORES me, asking where she was and luckily we share locations with one another. So I told her and she got her daughter. Now she is still FUCKED up in the morning and her mom asks if I can come over and maybe grab her McDonalds on the way, so I did, because I care about this girl. So we had the same conversion from last night as if she would've sobered up and that we could talk openly. Nope.

&amp;#x200B;

She has called or ended up with another another side-piece over me after we made plans about 3 times now, and here I am, still wanting to be her first choice and I really don't know why. And honestly she makes it hard to tell that she, also, does like me and prefer me over the other guys, but then why tell me about these kids that ur messing around with as if I wanna hear it? She serioiusly has the audacity to mention that she hooked up with another guy over me after we had plans. If I were to mess around with another girl, she'd call me out and be super jealous, just as she made me. I am the jealous type so it sucks, and what's worse is that we aren't together and it STILL hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

MY QUESTION: Am I wrong for wanting to keep our connection strong, so that we can straighten things out and possibly makes things exclusive(if I were to, she'd care for me like no other), or am I wrong for falling in the same trap....? Again, she is a good friend and truly has a beautiful heart for people she cares for, such as me, which is why things are complicated. Shouldn't those who offer and give you a lot receive something similar in return? This post is sooo soft but I am just looking for advice that I can use.",10Jul2019,1

We are both seventeen years old, yet we both attend the same community college and are going to transfer to the same university. We have never really had any major issues before our break up, despite one or two arguments over things that had simple resolutions to. It has been about two and a half weeks since he had broken up with me, and I’m an absolute wreck. We have been texting everyday since the break up. I had apologized countless of times, reassuring him that he is a great person, I understand why he broke up with me, and telling him that I would do anything in my power to show him how much I love him. The initial week after the break up, he had told me that he was unsure if breaking up was the right thing to do. However, after a week he had decided that he doesn’t think we should be in a relationship right now, but maybe in the future. Also, he told me he doesn’t plan on talking to any other girls while he was deciding. I told him that I wouldn’t talk to any guys, not even as friends, because he is the only guy I want in my life at the moment. Him and I talked on the phone yesterday, where he told me that our chances of getting back together in the future are 50/50. Overall, I feel pretty left in the dark and confused. What do you guys think is the best way to handle this situation that would most likely result in us getting back together? Thank you so much!


TL;DR - My boyfriend of ten months told me he does not want a relationship right now, but there is a possibility that we can get back together in the future. How do I approach this situation in the best way that would result in us having a higher possibility of getting back together eventually?",10Jul2019,2

239,"I’m 14, have suicidal tendencies, have done self harm and have mental breakdowns where I smear blood all over the place. I have thoughts about killing animals and hurting other people, but never killing other people, just hurting them. My cousin is the only one who comes close to me because he also has suicidal tendencies, but he has never self harmed or had thoughts of harming other things.

As surprising as it may sound, I don’t have abusive parents at all. They raised me to be kind and gentle, they shower me with gifts and were very accepting when I came out as gay to them. They always help me when I’m sad. They both have anxiety, which I have too, but I’m the first one to have actual depression. I’m the only one who has had thoughts of harming other people and actually doing self harm.

I care for my friends and family, but do not feel anything when a pet dies or when someone who’s not my friend goes through a tough time. I hate my dog and locked him in a garage when I was 11. I loved the previous dog we had but when I died I felt nothing. I wanted to feel something but couldn’t.

Some people say I have sociopathic/psychopathic behavior. I don’t know if that’s actually true, I don’t know if those two things are inherited traits/affected by social environment or not.

I do have a psychiatrist, she knows everything but the blood smearing and animal harming thoughts.",10Jul2019,1
240,"First time posting here!

Anyway-

20F here. I work at a fairly large grocery chain in a shore town. Memorial Day weekend is one of if not the busiest weekend of the year here. I desperately need it off. 

Here's why:

I just recieved my associates degree from a community college and I am transferring to  university in the fall. I just found out that I need to attend a mandatory 3 day transfer specific orientation during memorial day weekend. I don't know what would happen if I missed it exactly, but we were told in no uncertain terms that it is absolutely mandatory. I'm afraid if I don't go that they will put a hold on my class registration or something. I don't think it's anything fun, mostly stuff on how to be safe at school and other boring stuff. It's not exactly how I would love to spend my memorial day weekend, but I've recieved countless emails and was told at the last orientation/registration event that we absolutely HAVE to go. 

Here is why I am nervous about putting in this time off request:


Work has been hell lately. I am one of the newest employees, I have been at this job since late April.  We have lost a few employees to maternity leave all at once and another few have put in their two weeks. It is very understaffed, and July 4th we didn't have enough coverage so we had to call in extra people who weren't scheduled. The manager is very, very stressed because we also got a new district manager and I guess things are just going rough with the transition.  I was up front during my interview with the store manager and told him that in September I would go back to school, stop working full time and that my classes would become my priority. I told him I'll work full time for the Summer, but since my school is *just* close enough to commute, I'd be stacking my classes and going the entire day 2-3 days a week. I would then only work 2 days or so during the semester to ensure I can keep my grades up.

I don't know one hundred percent that my manager remembers this. I know that by not working memorial day weekend whatsoever that I'll be screwing him over, but I do not see how I can avoid it. At this point I've accepted that I need to tell him, it's just a matter of when and how. We do not do schedule requests online, it is all through paper and we do not see if our requests were fulfilled until 2-3 days before the date typically as the schedule comes out a week or less in advance. I need to know that I have memorial day weekend off ahead of time. 

I know that if I were the manager, I would want to know as far in advance as possible about this. However, since this is such a rough spell at work, I am not sure if it best to wait longer and tell the manager closer to mid-August about how I need memorial day weekend off entirely, as I plan at the same time telling him my class scheduling. Because of school, there will be essentially 1 day MAYBE 2 for the entire week that I will be around to work when it is going to be the absolute busiest. He is stressed and upset enough as it is and I know he is going to be livid when I tell him (he doesn't have the best temper-!). 

So Anyway- I'm asking for advice on when to tell my manager I need off for memorial day weekend. Do I tell him now and risk him getting very upset with me and possibly rejecting the request there and then? Or do I tell him closer to memorial day weekend and risk screwing him over schedule wise and catching him off guard? I doubt he is even thinking about memorial day weekend yet since there's still a few weeks until then. Things are just so awful right now that I can not envision him having a reasonable reaction to this request at this moment. He's lost his temper recently on other girls who put in what are probably much easier to accommodate requests than what I am about to do. I know this is going to be very inconvenient for him no matter what, but I want to put in for this time off in the most considerate way possible. I would write orientation off, but I want to start school off on the right foot and I do not want to risk whatever consequences there are to missing it. Thank you in advance and sorry for any typos it is very late and I am very tired and stressed :/",10Jul2019,1
241,"I live in a 3 bed/2 bath house.  My girlfriend and I stay in the master and we have 2 roommates that stay in each of the other 2 rooms.  We split utilities 4 ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Both roommates have girlfriends that don't live here, however, 1 of the roommates girlfriends sleeps over 5-6 nights out of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned to him once that she's staying over too often and the next week she only stayed over 3 nights, but then it was right back to 5-6 nights. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on for several months and I haven't really said anything again because they pretty much just stay in his bedroom most of the time and watch tv.

&amp;#x200B;

The nice things are that they never cook so they don't use the kitchen and they never use the tv in the living room.  She doesn't have a key and she's never here when he's not here, which is good.

&amp;#x200B;

However, one of the reasons she's here so often and that my roommate never stays at her place is because she lives in her mom's house and her mom rents out half of her room... so rather than sharing a room with someone, she comes and stays with her bf for free while her mom gets rent and we have an extra person staying here.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't keep her things here, she just brings a big duffel bag with her every day, I'm assuming for the change of clothes she needs for the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Though it is nice that they mostly stay out of the way, it still bugs me that she is sleeping here more often than she's not.

&amp;#x200B;

What is a fair way to approach this?

Am I right to be annoyed or is it acceptable for her to stay so often since they stay in his room?

Should I impose a rule for max number of nights per week?  Should there be a penalty?",10Jul2019,1
242,"Hi guys. So a few days ago I was just sitting on my couch and I saw my dads phone next to me. I don’t know if this is a weird thing to do for most people, but I was bored and I just unlocked it and started going through some stuff. And this isn’t a weird thing for us, me and my dad have a really good relationship and I’ll be on his phone in front of him and he won’t care. I wasn’t snooping around in his texts or anything, just looking at photos and stuff. Then I went to his Instagram and scrolled around a bit. And since I was bored I just decided to search myself up through his account. Well, when I clicked on the search my eyes fell to his recently searched. And up popped some account with “hot videos” in the username. From the profile picture I could tell it wasn’t porn but like some sort of thing with women. I immediately got off his phone. But now I really really wish I hadn’t seen that. I don’t know if this is a normal thing, and I still love my dad. I also don’t know if he actually watched the videos or just stumbled upon the account somehow. I am most definitely never going to confront him about this. But it’s just a majority of the time I think of my dad in my head, my brain thinks of the account name. It’s really bothering me and I don’t know what to do. He’s also happily married to my mom for a long time (idk if this is relevant information). Will this keep happening every time I think of my dad?",10Jul2019,1

I’m not super close with his parents. we get along for sure and think they definitely like me, i’m just not a super open person until i’m comfortable with you, and due to them living a ways away we haven’t spent a lot of time together. but we definitely still get along and talk well when we’re together. so basically my question is what would be an appropriate way to show my support for him after his surgery while he’s in the hospital? normally i’d say flowers, but don’t think as a guy he’d love that. but idk. i don’t wanna seem weird. obviously a card will probably work. but is that enough? or can anyone think of anything extra to add? i just want them to know i support the family in this crappy time and am thinking of them. thanks in advance!",10Jul2019,1

252,"Hi, I would dearly appreciate some direction (tho mostly I think I’m just getting this all sorted in my head lol—TLDR below).

My brother, Ben, is turning 18 tomorrow and is headed to college in August. He’s got a good heart but a poor work ethic (he has strong interests though, which will help), and has some issues with mental health and dependency on substances (goes through about an ounce of weed a week, has history of depression/suicidal ideation, and last summer was hospitalized for a manic episode).  Early this spring, Ben was cheated on by his girlfriend of 2 years, though he seems to be doing okay because of a) therapy / support from friends/family, b) antidepressants, and c) he’s got a new love interest for the summer who seems like a sweet gal.

Ben has always had issues with homesickness and recently in passing said “I’m growing up and I don’t like it”.  Personally—I’m a 20 year old woman—I had a difficult time transitioning out of high school and into college (though things are much better now). I worry that, especially because he saw me struggle with this transitionary period, he is afraid of his future instead of excited—and I’m scared of the decisions (large and small, active and passive) he’ll make because of that. He’s generally a bit of a sensitive, lazy homebody, but he loves socializing and definitely makes friends easily—plus he’s going to be able to study what he’s interested in without debt. 

With his mixed bag of feelings towards this new experience, how to encourage an eager, positive attitude, adaptivity to change, and GROWTH in this chaotic time?

I just have a feeling Ben is going to have trouble (emotional, mostly) adjusting to his new life, and instead of putting his head down and working, he’ll choke under the pressure, wasting his time and education on all of his extremely poor habits from high school.

PS: looking at this giant block of text made me question my role in this— is it normal for me to be so worried about / questioning all this? Maybe I feel like I need to mother him — our mom has had mental and physical health issues herself over the years. Maybe I’m trying to insert myself as an authority figure to give him the guidance I craved from her during that vulnerable, scary time? #YouArentResponsibleforAnyoneElsesDysfunction............ +I can’t reach anyone’s potential but my own ......Is this all projection lmao


TLDR// my little brother is an extroverted but homesick stoner artist about to go to college.

268,"There are many times my dad gets mad at my little brother who is 10 for no reason at all. Today for example we were having rice and chicken for dinner and my little bro was flattening out his rice to let it cool better, my dad got all mad at him and was saying that he didn't have any manners for doing that and that the only way to cool it off is to blow on it. He said something like ""dont flatten your food out, you have no manners, if you want to cool it off you put it on your fork and blow on it"" even though all of my siblings and me have done that thing previously. Another time today was when my sister was talking about her new job and she mentioned how she had to train someone in her old job that didn't know how to clean windows. My little bro then says ""how could they not know how to clean windows"" my dad then pops in and says to him ""dont be assuming stuff about people you dont even know how to clean windows"" and then he starts saying that he does and he even cleaned them the other day. I wanted to speak up to him and say ""you got mad at him for assuming but then you just assumed he didn't know how to clean them"" he says little things like that constantly to my little bro and it's even brought him to tears because of what my dad says. What can I do about this? I'm already planning in speaking up to my dad next time he tries to be rude to my little brother for no reason. I'm gonna stand up to him then.

277,"I don’t know if anybody else does this, but I’ve gotten to a point where I’m always thinking about how to “self improve.” I obsessively sift through reddit subs like askmen, social skills or dating subreddits, in an effort to just learn as much as I can, in hopes that I can implement what other people have learned and what not. This pretty much takes a good chunk of my day just being in my head, seeing what I’m feeling, and then just searching away on the internet (mostly reddit) for an answer or something.

And you might get the impression that I’m not good with people or awkward, but I’m most likely just average and there isn’t really an immediate reason for me to be so paranoid. And the truth is that I’m honestly extremely paranoid about wasting my life, not getting to experience some of the other typical things people might experience like close friends, romantic relationships, night out with friends etc. And while I have had those things on occasion, those areas of my life have never been stable, and I’m DEATHLY afraid of being one big failure in certain like those.

It has helped in some ways, just triggering a sequence of thoughts that led me to realize something, but honestly it’s just this cloud over my shoulder of inadequacy, and I don’t necessarily know where it stems from (but I have an idea). I’d say that I’m at an ok spot right now, but I know that when the semester starts and I go back to uni (entering sophomore year) I’m just going to hit my low points again, and i feel incredibly hopeless being that it will most likely will happen, and I’m just going to have to go through that again.

I don’t know how to focus my energy on something else. Even doing physical activities, when I’m exercising there always has to be someone against me in the back of my mind, whether that’s the thought of my parents calling me fat, a rejection from a girl, or the belief that the world will love me if I’m physically fit.

I’m caught in such a neurotic cycle of always having to get better. It has helped a little in just progressing myself, but with that always comes comparison, unfullfillment, and just emptiness. I’m can say that I’m not really happy with myself right now, and currently the only time I feel okay is when I smoke weed or out on the “hunt” trying to accomplish something.

Seeing stuff that causes first hand environmental damage physically hurts me for some reason, to the point where my heart kinda squeezes itself and it becomes hard to breathe. 

  
As for money, I really hate asking my parents for money, but at the same time, I live really far from civilization, so finding a job is really tough. 

My parents are worried that I'm not hanging out with my friends often enough, and offer to give me the money for the outings, but I feel an immense amount of guilt whenever I do accept the money and can't enjoy these outings, so I've been limiting them a lot. 

Going shopping with my mom also scares me; she's not exactly an economical person, and watching her spend so much money in one go constantly makes me feel a huge amount of anxiety.

I've tried talking to my parents about it, and they keep reassuring me it's fine.

School is also bad; whenever I think about the tuition fee, I start feeling really guilty that my parents are spending money on me.

Here's the deal: this place has somewhat actively prevented me from having access to others, and I did not have access to many folks #s. I called who I could, including the restaurant (no one answered as it was 6am) and then proceeded to email both the manager that day and the GM.

I went to Urgent Care after once again trying the restaurant to no dice, and when I checked my phone later it had been blown up.

283,"I really need advice. And I always got plenty of advice from friends and family but I never seem to listen to them. My last relationship I posted on reddit and I ended up leaving for good after hearing from strangers and I felt amazing after. This was about the beginning of 2017. Not even a month of leaving my cheating ex, I met another guy on facebook. I didn’t feel the need to move on to another guy to get over my ex, I just figured why not. So two weeks after this guy and I began hanging out, I noticed he was sort of scary. He was doing drugs and he would always trap me in rooms accusing me of stuff that wouldn’t make sense. I should’ve have left then and there but for some reason I didn’t. Things just got worse and worse. He was in jail multiple times before I met him, and he went to jail twice with me being with him. While he was in jail, I was super faithful to him and I spent thousands of dollars on him for lawyers, commissary, and phone calls. Both times he came out of jail he ended up going right back to the same drug addict toxic person. There have been multiple incidents where I had to call the cops on him because I get so scared of him in moments. He mentally abuses me so bad. After so much of not being able to defend myself verbally, I would just swing at him and he’s a strong guy and I would always end up having bruises all over from him. After 2 years he finally admitted to me that he’s been on meth which I kind of figured but he always denied it. He has a son that he doesn’t even bother to see and is not allowed to see because of his drug use. He’s just a horrible violent person and I see the good in him which rarely comes out anymore. Each time I’m with him something bad happens. He smashed my car windows out, he’s on drugs so bad that he thinks that people are after him. I just can’t take it anymore and I want to get away but I don’t know where to start. He threatens me when I block him, he posts nasty lies about me on social media, and when he begins to get upset about me trying to leave him, he threatens to kill himself with the gun he is not even supposed to have. I’m just terrified because I never know when things are going to go down hill. I realized that I was happier with him in jail. I never felt so great in my life. My mom passed away in January 2018 and he was nothing but horrible to me around that time. But I’m mainly reaching out for advice because I found out that I am pregnant and it’s definitely the worst I’ve seen him since I met him. I’m most likely going to be doing this on my own, but I’m literally terrified of him at this point. And I reached out for help and I always end up going back with him. I went to the cops about him twice and no one did anything. His Parol officer was called and he didn’t say much. He didn’t report to his PO in 4 months. He stole $3,000 off of me that I won at the casino. I just can’t take it anymore. Can anyone please give me advice on how to leave him? My nan and I already kicked him out of our house so he is not living with me. But I get threats and I’m always afraid he’s going to show up at my house.

291,"So I recently posted this to TIFU, as an obvious F up; but the reaction I got was worse than I expected. Before I get into that, he’s a short version of what happened. I assumed I was home alone from how my parents talked to me before they left. Then managed to walked in on my little sister in the bathroom, not only was she completely naked but she also had anal beads in her ass. We exchanged what the fucks and I left only for my dick to make me go back in and ask her if she needed help taking out those beads. (I’m sorry, it was the virgin side of me) I’m thinking her being already horny had a hand in it, but she said fine, but in a shy way. The way she postures herself (spreading her cheeks) made me subtly ask if wanted me ""put something in"" and it actually worked in a way. And soon after, our older sister walks in on us going at it and is completely disgusted and pissed off. She cusses us both out but mainly was pissed off at me. Now despite my little sister wanting to be around me, our older sister will not let me hang out with her on threat that she will tell our parents what happened. She also shunned me and disclaimed me and gives me disgusted upset looks whenever I step in her presence. And the worst part, this is just day 2.

&gt; The more explained explanation is here if you want more details. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/caxr9d/tifu_by_having_sex_with_my_sister/

Now before this post I was kind of bothered my older sister (let’s call her Jazz) would keep us apart. But after the backlash, I was actually kind of disgusted with myself for doing this. And I don’t mean she’s keeping us from having sex again, no. Basically a few hours later after the incident, my little sister (let’s call her Rae), wanted to just hang out. And the thing is, my little sister is very shy. Since she graduated, she hasn’t really left her room much at all other than eating or bathing. Because of this, my issue holding conversations with girls, and her shy personality negated each other; and we were basically just housemates. Not even really friends to be honest.

But after this happened, I don’t know if it was just lust or what... but I actually wanted to hang out with her. I mean she asked if I wanted to watch anime with her; which, usually I don’t watch. But the thought of bonding with her just sounded great to me. Then when Jazz completely shut it down I felt sad about it. Like it feels like my chance to really bond before we all go our separate ways is just going to slip away. Then it’ll just be thar we’re related by blood and that’s that. Jazz and I are probably permanently on shitty terms, but I bonded with her, I know her. It just bothers me.

But now, I feel pretty grossed out with myself. The biggest problem is I somewhat still find Rae extremely attractive after the incident. I guess you never really look at family like you do other people. But I don’t know if I should just keep trying to push this out and forget it ever happened. Really I’m thinking if I stay away from her like Jazz wants, Rae will eventually close back up. Because at the moment she seems so open... she’s not going to get food and going straight back into her room as much, she’s started going into the living room with the family, her door is usually always open now. Just walking by, I see her glance at me and it pulls me right back into the loop. Should I back off or should I take the risk and try to get to know her?

TL;DR I had sex with my sister and our older sister caught us. And I posted the story to r/TIFU. After the backlash, I was kind of grossed out with myself for what I did. And I felt like my older sister had a point in that I should stay away from my little sister from now on. But her being so open and her offer to watch tv together just made me completely conflicted. I really don’t know what I should do especially since I know this is fucked up. I would appreciate any advice on this and I’m sorry in advance for sharing a taboo topic.

Haven't been smoking nearly as much weed since i got a reliable/trustworth coke connection. I get about a gram or so every other week. This has been going on a couple months? I think this is the 3-4 time I bought some from him. I take it home and use it alone in my office while i try and figure out what the fuck to do with my self while I'm high. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cover my bills (Just barely) and I got my god son a present he'll like. But any money I have ""saved"" is the money I made over the weekend. Im making decent money now but I blow all of it. If not on beer and drugs then I impulse buy shit I don't need. Bough a ps4 controller for my laptop and a new gaming mouse ($70 all told).

&amp;#x200B;

I talk about traveling after the summer and buying a car at the end of it. If I could slow down I probably could do that easily.

Am I at the point where I just have to stop? I don't really want to (obviously) but I want more and I have the resources.

303,"This is a throwaway account.

My (16F) parents divorced 8 years ago. The arrangement they had was that I was to live with my mother and visit my father every weekend. 

Things went well for a while, but about 2-3 years ago, both of them are began to act more possessive over me. My mother would forbid me from visiting my father if I had incomplete homework or if I had a slight cold. My father would constantly talk about how my mother was an utter bitch for being so strict. 

I love both my parents equally and hearing them rant about the other to me is hurting me emotionally. My mother would speak ill of my father around her family and vice versa, I feel like I'm the only one able to defend the other parent in such situations since clearly everyone around them is biased. But if I were to defend them, the parent present would think I was against them and I don't want to hurt their feelings. So I've always stayed silent. I'd always think about it for weeks though, and I'd beat myself up about not defending someone I loved. 

My mother would always be more sensitive after I returned from a visit to my father's place. Most recently, due to stress from school, I was extremely irritable and I gave her an attitude. It's not uncommon in our household since both her and I are extremely stubborn. Instead of brushing it off as usual, she shouted at me and said something along the lines of ""You always act this way after going out with your father. All my time, money and effort spent on you. And you still act like your father.""  I stayed silent and allowed her to berate me with words and insults about my father. Not long after, my father texted me about allowing me to stay at his place if I ever needed to. It made me incredibly uncomfortable to think that he believes I'm struggling in my current home, which I'm not. And I'd never consider living with him since I'm not too close with his wife.

My relationship with both parents is absolutely golden. I know they love me, and I love them. But sometimes, it feels as if they hate each other more than they love me. I know this is the depression speaking, but I think maybe their lives would be better off without me. I'm not strong or courageous enough to speak to them about how I find their behaviour immature and it makes me uncomfortable. I'd sooner kill myself then tell them they're a reason for my depression, I don't want them to hate themselves. 

I don't know what to do. I have a very important exam coming up at the end of this year. It would probably determine how the rest of my life goes. Due to mental and emotional issues, I can't focus on my studies and I just feel so hopeless. I would greatly appreciate advice about how to deal with my parents or even studying tips. Thanks in advance.

TLDR: My parents' hateful comments about each other puts me in a difficult position. Their arguments on top of my depression and stress from school is overwhelming and I want it all to end.",10Jul2019,1

305,"Sorry for the formatting.

I’m not sure what is going on right now between me and my crush. We like each other and we both know that we do. We used to hang out and talk a lot and then suddenly, we stopped. I was really confused and hurt as to why we stopped hanging out since we were getting along really well. 

Later, I find out that he stopped hanging out with me because he felt guilty that he kissed another girl. I had to hear that from another friend. I was hurt but at the same time, I didn’t think it was a big deal and we eventually talked about it and got over it. 

A couple of months go by and we continue to talk and I feel like he’s really into me. He tells me that he is going to hang out with some girl from a dating app. I was hurt but I thought about it and realized that we aren’t dating or anything so he can do whatever he wants. He played it off as using the app to make friends and whatnot. Later that same day, he tells me they didn’t end up hanging out. I was really relieved and believed him. A part of me thought that he didn’t hang out with her because of me. Almost a month later (basically today), I find out they didn’t end up hanging out because they were too busy making out haha. Again, I find this out through another friend (the same friend too). 

I am so confused. He’s so sweet and I can definitely tell that he’s into me but then why is he doing this? I think it hurts even more that I find this out from the same friend every time and that he never tells me. It sucks so bad because I’m always so excited to tell my friend that my crush did this sweet thing and this!! And it’s so crushing when she looks so uncomfortable and asks me if my crush told me about this. I’ve heard from other friends that he doesn’t deserve me and that he might be emotionally using me. However, right after they say that, they are quick to assure me that he is really sweet but is just an idiot. I know he’s stupid but … I just don’t know anymore.

What should I do? About this situation? About him? I’m really inexperienced with these kinds of things as I’ve never been in a relationship or even close to being in one. Am I being overdramatic? Since, we’re not dating or anything, it shouldn’t be a big deal right? But then why do I feel so hurt? I know that he is a human being and he can do whatever he wants. I don’t know if I’m being used right now and then later, he might just ghost me and forget that I exist. I can’t even ask my friends for advice about this, as this is the second he has done this and I feel just embarrassed that this has happened to me again. 

Tl;dr My crush (who also has feelings for me) kissed two girls on separate occasions and I always find out from someone other than him.",10Jul2019,0
306,"This is going to be a long one so thank you in advance if you read the whole thing. 

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 5 years and this is the worst situation that I’ve seen. So my girlfriend’s dad (let’s call him T) is an extremely narcissistic and abusive person. He is in his 60s and stopped working after getting laid off a couple years ago. Ever since, he’s been spending his wife’s money for everything. Also, my girlfriend’s parents have been making her work since she was around 9. They’ve been asking her for money all her life and they are still asking her for money to this day. When my girlfriend was in her teens, she put on make up for fun and T got angry about that. He decided to drag her by the hair across the room and made her take off the “trash” on her face. This is just a glimpse of what he’s like. 

Today I was leaving their house with my girlfriend and I waved and said bye to him and his friend(let’s call him L). Later on that day he texted me saying that I need to go up to them personally and to say goodbye. I said okay sorry because that’s my girlfriend’s dad. Once we got home and were about to leave again, he talked to my girlfriend personally and said, “if you sleep over at his house again, I will shoot you, your boyfriend, and his parents.” Keep in mind that we’ve been dating for 5 years and we’ve been staying over at each others places for years now. This was all because I didn’t say bye to them personally. Our parents are semi close but not that close. L talked to T and said that my father doesn’t know how to raise his kids. After I heard this, it made me angry because I don’t tolerate anybody talking bad about my parents, especially when they barely know them.

I end up calling L and confronting him about what he said. I asked him about what he said and he began to get hostile and angry. He kept saying “I don’t care about your dad or you like that, your family is your family!” After he said that, I just said “okay if you didn’t say that then you didn’t say it.” But I know that he did for sure. Then he kept on repeating that he didn’t say it and that he didn’t care about what we did. Once he started to yell more and more I eventually snapped and yelled back saying “OKAY I GET IT, IF YOU DIDN’T DO IT THEN YOU DIDN’T DO IT” After that, L told T and T completely flipped his shit! He called me saying how rude I was for yelling at his friend. T was full on screaming at me and not even giving me a chance to say anything.

After the phone call, he called my dad and yelled at him in the same tone for letting me yell at L. T is about 15 years older than my dad and T is super traditional in the sense where the elders automatically have to be respected no matter what. But my dad and T drinks and hangs out together in the same group of friends. My dad is extremely livid because of this and I don’t know if my dad will ever forgive him. I eventually ended up apologizing to T because my girlfriend was scared that T would make us break up. He ended up calming down but he tried to lecture me with TERRIBLE life lessons. He was basically saying how my dad was wrong for supporting me in my life and that I shouldn’t follow down the same path as my dad. At this point I was filled with rage but I had to stay calm so that my relationship with my girlfriend would be okay.  Also, T threatened to harm my family if I fucked up again. Now T wants me to apologize to L, but I don’t want to because I feel like I did nothing wrong.

Now I’m sitting here filled with regret because my dad is going to confront L tomorrow for always talking behind his back. I know I probably shouldn’t have called L in the first place to prevent all of this from happening, but I don’t know if I should say sorry to L just to make T happy in order to keep my relationship safe. I just feel like this is all so unnecessary due to T’s anger issues.

TLDR; I didn’t say goodbye to my girlfriend’s dad and friend personally, causing the dad to go apeshit crazy and threatening my family. I ended up confronting his friend and now the dad wants me to say sorry.",10Jul2019,1
307,"My brother has been drinking since he was a young teenager and it has been the cause of a majority of his problems. For a couple of weeks he was sober and proud. For the first time since we were kids he was actually nice to me and we were close.

However, he fell off the wagon and it has become worse. He routinely verbally abuses me and hits me under the guise of ‘playing around’.

Currently, I just lock my bedroom door as soon as I get home and eat/do chores/use the bathroom when he’s asleep or at work so that I can avoid being yelled at or hit in the face.

I spent entire month sending out CV's and the only offers I got back were call center jobs.

Other jobs I tried to apply to included: sales manager assistant, marketing assistant, sales assistant, junior marketing (I don't know exactly how it's called), junior marketing specialist, etc. I tried to get a job in these lower level positions that were in the direction of my studies.

It seems that there is really no alternative. I even went to see a psychologist because all of these situations give me existential crisis and we talked about my problems, opportunities but nothing came out of it (I will see her again, still helped to stay in a better mindset).

Maybe someone can give me advice?

314,"On a random Reddit account I had, I decided to troll and say some really bad things. Nothing was violent threats, but I made a bunch of inappropriate and insulting jokes to users and used a lot of swears. I did probably 10 bad comments in around 4-5 hours and then stopped entirely. Somehow, Reddit users contacted my university and an admission rep emailed me personally that some people have complained about particular comments on a Reddit account that they believe I own. I did not put any information that revealed my address or city or anything personal, but I accidentally said the dorm I was staying at and some academic scores I had. I'm assuming they ran the system through a database, and I was the one that matched those descriptions. The admissions rep told me that I am not in any trouble, and he wants me to come in to meet him. I have a few questions. 

1. Does the admission rep writing me in email saying I'm not in trouble guarantee immunity if I do confess it was indeed me that made those comments in that account?
2. Do I even need to respond to this email? If so, what would be the proper response that would benefit me the most in avoiding consequences?
3. Can I be punished if I admit that I made those comments?
4. Can I be punished even if I say I had nothing to do with that account, but they don't believe me and say the circumstantial evidence directly points to me? I'm asking this because the email tied to this particular account is a throwaway email, so even if they managed to get access to it, it would lead them nowhere. Usually, circumstantial evidence doesn't hold up in court, but I don't know how colleges could impose the rules in this situation if they think it's me.
5. How easy is it for my university to get more info about the account if they press Reddit? Would it be easy for them to access my IP address and link it to my address to prove that I indeed did own that account?
6, If you were in my situation, what way would you react to get the best possible outcome? Forget about the stupid thing I did and what is morally right. I'm not willing to suffer expulsion or academic probation or any dumb offense if I can easily get myself out of this. My current idea is to agree to meeting, and when I'm at it, say I have no clue about this account and any of the comments made. I was also thinking about deleting Reddit before going to the meet up and saying I don't even have the app. 

Note: I did not delete any comments or posts from the account or the account itself. I thought that would play into admission of guilt since it would happen after the email had come.

315,"Ok, so let me just start by saying that I don't have ""harm"" OCD. Idk what I have, but it's definitely not that. 

~~sorry if this is long~~ 

no real friends or anyone to talk to about this uh..  *issue*. So I guess that's why I'm posting here.

...

I feel like I'm.. not stuck but.. I can't plan for my future. Mainly because I Can't even see myself having a future. I see myself dead, or in prison, someday soon. I have these urges/compulsions ~~whatever you want to call it~~  that I'm just barely keeping under control. 

Now I won't get super into what exactly the urges entail cause I don't think it will help, but I will say it's not something that everyone experiences. Ex: Urge to push someone off cliff, Urge to hit someone crossing the road with your car, Urge to hurt something that's cute... etc.

Yeah, my problem? It's not that. I'm more on the ""kidnap someone, torture them, do things after they're dead"" side of things. 

So obviously something like this kind of.. gets in the way of everyday life. A little hard to be near people when your head is just screaming at you to do things. But it would be okay if its just thoughts, right? Correct. But it's not just thoughts. It's embarrassing to admit, but I get off on it. I don't know why, I don't like that I do. Well, actually part of me is fine with it, but the part of me that's writing this isn't okay with it. (No, I don't have a ""split personality"". Think of it like ""I want to eat these cookies, but I know I shouldn't"")

Alright so, urges, part of me is super into it, other part isn't. You see... the part of me that's ""super into it"" is about 80% of ""my brain"" I guess. What I'm trying to say is that its a lot stronger. So this thing that literally rules my life... is completely unspeakable, unimaginable to the average person. And when I say it rules my life I mean it, I spend anywhere between 2-8 hours a day thinking about it. Not only is it constantly on my mind, it has a physical effect on me. Adrenaline rush, tensing up, out of breath, stuff like that. Which I try very hard to control while around other people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok I think you get the idea. So I have this issue, but god I don't know how much longer I can keep it all contained. I can't tell anyone. I can't tell a doctor. I can't tell my parents ""hey maybe I should see a psychologist"". I can't admit myself to a hospital (too poor). Really no options, and NO telling my parents is not an option, and never will be. I currently don't have the money/the means to go get professional help, and probably won't for a few years.

What I've been doing to keep myself in check isn't healthy/isn't something I can do all the time. I do 4 things: 

**1)** If I'm alone I just let it take over and indulge it with either true crime stuff, real gore pics/vids, or just imagination. *Usually* I don't bother with irl gore stuff cause its never what I'm ""looking for"". Plus I've seen so much that I can make my fantasy look realistic while also being exactly what I want.  

**2)** If I have to be near people but I don't need to be super aware, I take whatever meds I can to get me to the point where I'm hardly awake. This doesn't make the urge go away, but helps a lot. I do this about once a week, but I really try to not to.

**3)** If I'm alone and if there's an excess of alcohol in the house that there wouldn't be a noticeable dent, I just get drunk. This is the most effective, but I very rarely get the chance.

**4)** More or less what I do everyday, suck it up and deal with it. Which might sound easy, but it's a living hell. The end result is me being constantly on edge, angry, stressed, which gets written off as having a bad attitude. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know what triggers it, but there's literally no way to avoid it ""acting up"". Because being near people is what ""triggers it"". Years of this has led to me developing depression, which means I kind of have two modes. Mode 1) depressed and empty. doesn't care about anything. tired all the time, brain is foggy, nothing matters. Mode 2) tons of rage compressed into a tiny ball that I'm trying not to drop, cause if I do I'll ""snap"".

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm getting at here is that I basically never feel any sort of happiness in my life. The only time I do is when I'm alone and completely ""immersed"" in one of my fantasies. And since basically nothing in life appeals to me other than this one specific thing that would end my life if I did it, I kind of can't plan for the future. No jobs interest me. I can't enjoy being near people. I'm stuck and there's no way out other than maybe killing myself. Not that I want to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does any of this make sense? I hope so.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I guess ""what advice am I looking for?"" is the question to ask. Honestly, anything you can think of, as long as its not ""tell someone"" or religious stuff. If you want to talk, we can.",10Jul2019,0
316,"Sorry if there are mistakes in the  post. I'm not an english speaker

I want to clarify that the ones who went to the trip were my father, brother and I. My mother stayed in my country.

So for my 15th birthday I asked for a trip to the United States instead of a party since I don't really like them and my family was okay with it. We planned the trip and all. I just wanted to go to Orlando bc of Universal but my father said we should take the chance and visit other places while we were traveling and I didn't had any problem with it. The trip started and everything was good until my father started to get mad at me for every single mistake I made even if it was worthless like if I didn't know how to say certain things in English he would get mad (I'm the only one who could communicate and had to be the translator the whole trip), if I told him to speak in our language first to know if it wasn't necessary for me to translate anything he would get mad, if we took the wrong way while driving he would get mad at me and a lot of shit more. It got to the point where he said I was being a burden the whole time and basically saying I was being a shit.

Well, let's go to the point where he threatened me.
We were in the airport ready to do the check in for the flight to home he got mad at me for some reason and I tried to stay away from him as much as I could. My father had trouble registering his passport at the check in machine so, to make the whole process of getting to the plane faster, I tried to help him and he got really mad at me, he started pushing me while I tried to tell him he was doing the whole thing wrong and then he threatened me basically saying he would punch me if I tried to do anything else. At that point I sent a message to my mom telling her everything but she's saying that I misbehaved too and I feel she's justifying the whole thing when I was searching some support from her and the only one who really supported me was my brother, at this point I'm really stressed and depressed to the point where I'm crying everytime I'm alone. The worst thing is that he acts as if he just didn't treat me like a piece of shit just some minutes ago.

I don't know what to do at this point. Maybe I really am a shitty daughter or I'm just searching for an reason why he treated me that way.",10Jul2019,1

Most days can be very tough for him. Especially as of recently due to his parents moving states away, a recent death within the family, him moving to a new apartment next month, and overall his schedule with work/band plans. He’s just very overwhelmed and it shows.

Below I just listed a few things that I’ve noticed about him. 
When he’s depressed he breaks down crying and screaming so badly when his mind is spiraling in thought. 
He loses sleep and over works himself. He feels guilt towards himself. No energy. Pessimism. 
When’s he really up, he’s so full of energy. His speech becomes rapid. Very optimistic. His sexual behavior is increased. 

I’m scared to leave him alone because he often tells me he’s scared to be alone. I’m doing my best to be here for him and to only try and guide him towards help, like therapy and whatever must be necessary. 

I’m planning on going to therapy myself for the sake of my mental health. I don’t know what would be best; separate therapy or conjoined therapy. 

I want to understand more about what exactly is going on with him so that I can do my best to love and support him.",10Jul2019,1
323,"I stub my toes often, probably 2-4 times a day. This traumatic dilemma has been haunting me for the past decade and  there seems no end in sight. I have tried multiple solutions like being aware of feet placement and awareness of surroundings. Often times, I feel and see that there is nothing in front of me, and I walk casually, only for my toe to then hit the side or corner of something and this excruciating pain starts throbbing in my toe. It gives me an instant contemplation of wanting to cut off my toe so I don't have to deal with it anymore, but then the pain dies, but I still want to kill it.   


How should I go about preventing or lessening the amount of stubby toes in my life?",10Jul2019,2
324,"Hi,

Once upon a time when I was young &amp; broke, I thought it'd be a good idea to be a cam girl for a few weeks to make some cash. I regret the decision very much now for several reasons but that isn't my main concern. I recently googled my old username for the 1st time and was horrified to find a few old photos of my profile pic. They are on a few websites that archive cam profiles. I'm trying to work through removing them since they were posted without consent. Google has a removal request form but I'm wondering if I should also directly contact the webmasters of these sites.

I've seen this copied &amp; pasted on the Privacy Policy page for few sites my old photos are on:

""If you are a model (or agent of) who has appeared on this or any other affiliated web site through an indexed site or an affiliation and would like to be removed, then please directly email us with your screen name and proof of your connection with the screen name/handle.""

I have no connection to the screen name or handle anymore. I'm also worried about trusting this removal process &amp; about sending a photo of myself again, paranoid something may go wrong. Before I contacted these sites I wanted to ask for advice first or some insight from anyone else who may have gone through a similar experience.

Thank you so much.

TL;DR: How do I remove old camgirl photos of me posted on archive websites without my consent? Should I trust the Privacy Policy page &amp; removal process from these webmasters?",10Jul2019,3
325,"My neighbors has had cockatiels for a while now, they had a pair. They were always poorly cared for, small cage, a seed diet (terrible for pet birds) , never goes out of their cage. I always heard singing, not recently they went silent, just a few chirps here and there. When I checked on them, I noticed that there was only one left. I took into consideration that the other one might be in the nest box, but a few weeks has passed and I haven't heard any singing or seen more than one cockatiel in the cage. Plus the fact the males are usually the ones that sing, meaning the one left behind is the female, so that cancels out the possibility of eggs (Also usually both parents stay with the eggs). Cockatiels live in flocks im the wild and do terribly on their own, so in captivity, they either need a partner or alot of human interaction, and this one never gets either at this point.  I feel bad for ghe bird and don't know what to do. Giving them some friendly advice seems out of the picture right now since they speak tagalog (I'm from the Philippines, and yes I suck at the language) and I'm terribly anti social haha.

326,"\[23F\] I got an earth science B.S. degree from a top 10 public university in the U.S. It took me 8 months to find a job (and i actually found it in my hometown)..I was then laid off from it 2 months later. I've done 3 phone interviews in 14 months and not got past that point. I asked the interviewers for feedback and they said I interviewed fine, they just chose people with more experience. I apply to all kinds of jobs, not just those in my field. I live in my parent's house in a suburb in southern California that's pretty isolated, ranging from 1-2 hours drive from major cities. 

Do you think since i'm not local that companies won't recruit me for entry level positions ? I've stated on my resume that I don't need relocation. I've been thinking I should move out to try to find a job (like to Irvine, san Diego, LA) , but that's super risky and I have limited savings. I don't know what to do.

 Also my home life isn't that great. I've felt really depressed since I moved back home. There are no people my age here. I have one 'friend' who I hang out with sometimes. Forget dating or meeting anyone. My parents constantly scream at me that i'm a disappointment and that I should have a job by now and that I majored in the wrong thing.

330,"Hello! Well to start off, this is about a girl that likes me. I’m a 24 year old male and I’ve been single for a while. Since my last serious relationship, I’ve kinda been working on myself. Practiced self love and making sure I eliminate most of my toxic traits that I have. Still and always will be a working progress. Haven’t really been dating but I do have several friends with benefits. But they’re nothing serious. Just the casual get together, go out for a few drinks and laughs and head back home and fuck then say bye till next time. 

Recently I’ve been talking more to one chick and she really seems to like me. She makes me feel special and she makes me feel loved. She’s amazing with communication and she’s such a sweet lover. She cares and listens to me, she’s also really beautiful  and omg she has the most beautiful eyes and freckles, plus she’s all tatted up and I just find that sexy as fuck. Anyways, she’s all these amazing things but for some reason I can’t seem to find the want in dating her. Im kinda baffled actually because she’s everything I’d look for in a woman but I just don’t feel it. But i do wanna date! I’d like to be in a relationship and be committed. But why don’t I feel it!? I even want too 

Idk if maybe this growth I’ve been through with myself has changed me a lot.. maybe this is the “I’ve been through so many things so it’s hard for me to love” bs or maybe I’m just not ready and it makes me sad because I’m really upfront about things and I will tell her that I’m not ready, even if it means we might have to detach. 

Has anyone gone through this? Do y’all think the want will grow out of nowhere? Or do y’all think maybe I’m just not really ready? Plus btw! How long should one wait before asking for commitment? Haha that’s just a question I’ve always wondered. Or are we supposed to just feel that too?",10Jul2019,2
331,"There's a guy at my workplace that has been getting on my nerves lately. When I first met him he seemed like a real honest and genuine guy. He even invited me and the rest of our team over to his place for dinner.  After working with the guy for over a year I am regularly surprised at his horrible work ethic. It first occurred to me when he made a mistake on a request I asked of each team member. When I made him aware of his mistake, he just handed the work back to me to expecting me to correct it myself.  At work we often get tasked with team assignments and he will try to perform the easiest share of the work or he will make an excuse that another task he was initially supposed to perform is more important. Aside from that he is often on social media during work hours or looking at his phone. I have indirectly brought this matter up with other coworkers and I think they are well aware of his poor work ethic but it is driving me nuts how he often avoids taking responsibility.  Even more so he is not contributing to the team and deferring work to the other team members.

Someone who's very close to me is going through a really rough time - and people are essentially picking on her, doing things that aren't overtly what you'd consider bullying but repeatedly teasing her. She's trying to shrug it off good-naturedly because she can't change it and has no control over what other people are doing - but it's making me so angry that I feel like punching something (figure of speech - I'm not at all violent).

She's in another state, so even if I wanted to I couldn't do anything about it - and I wouldn't know what to even do. Tbh, it makes me want to scream at these people to leave her the F alone.

336,"When I was 4/5 years old I remember engaging in sexual play with 2 other girls. 

1 was my best friend from daycare, Kaylee, and we were caught many times by adults it angers me no one interfered. 

The 2nd girl Kaitlyn must be a couple years older than me..... she must have been 7 or 8..... and we engaged sexually very often.... she was the daughter of my uncles girlfriend.... 

Ok let's fast forward 23 years.... I find out that same uncle molested my mother &amp; uncle throughout their childhood.... 

Which makes me wonder did my uncle molest that little girl? Is that why she was engaging in sexual play with me?? That's pretty normal for children who have been molested by an adult.

I cant remember who was first... Kaitlyn or Kaylee... as I write this out I think it was Kaitlyn.... because I remember waiting for her to get home from school &amp; me not being old enough to go yet... so she must have been first. 

Does that mean she molested me?? And therefore that's why I was engaging in sexual play with my best friend at school??

338,"This just happened, exactly 53 minutes ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get off work at 12, and after the drive home I usually get to my house around 12:20 or so. Tonight for some reason I was extra tired and couldn't even summon the energy to get out of the car. So I just reclined the seat and went to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up to a scratching noise at 2am sharp. I know that because my phone was on the dashboard and that's what the clock said. When I opened my eyes I could see a person there in the moonlight, it's a half moon tonight so just enough to see. I live out in the country, have no immediate neighbors, and have a long driveway surrounded by trees and I could tell immediately whoever this was had no business being there as it was neither of my parents. 

My car's fender has a really rough spray paint job and they were scratching at it. The sound of it is what woke me up. My immediate instinct seemed to have been to hold still. The person had a stocky build and something about it looked vaguely feminine, so my half-asleep mind thought it was maybe my aunt, or that it was morning already and people were waking up for work. But then I remembered that it was 2am and no one should be there. 

Eventually they turned around and walked off. I lay still for another 15 seconds or so to see if they would come back, and when they didn't, I got out and yelled ""Who's there?"". No answer.

I went in the house and woke my mom up, then took my car up and down the road looking for anyone. Didn't find them.

We have motion lights on the garage already but the parking lot is big and the person never got close enough to set them off. 

  
Is there any chance this was my mind playing tricks on me? I mean, this is crazy. I've heard of being paralyzed when you first wake up and dreams and reality somehow meshing, but I had a solid five seconds of looking at this person so I hesitate to call it that.",10Jul2019,26

While I was walking to work, a grey tinted van pulled up next to me, 2 guys came out, one approached me, the other opened the passenger door to the van. I dipped the fuck out, I thought I was going to be kidnapped or something, and though my best efforts, they caught up to me quickly and grabbed me. Suddenly three of these guys surrounded me and demanded to see some ID, apparently they mistook me for my brother. I already had some bad run ins with these fuckers so I developed some sort of PTSD.

Anyway, they mistook me, they forced me to give them ID, I asked if it was allowed for them to just take it, they said that they were police and they could. After that they started to interrogate me about my brothers, then, they left me while I was collapsed on the floor.

I ran back to my house as fast as I could but I didn't make it. I saw them tackling my brothers and taking them inside the van. I was crying and these police motherfuckers were making light of the situation and laughing. After that one of my younger brothers who had a panic attack the last time they came had it again, I calmed him down and spoke to my mother about what we were going to do now.

My family, however, doesn't believe in depression. To them, I'm just sad, or a little on the quirky weird side. It's a phase I'll grow out of. I initially thought that too, since I had these thoughts around my early teens, and I figured, hey, hormones are a little weird, that might be it. But years later, these thoughts have only gotten worse, and become almost daily.

My family also isn't rich. We have a good amount of money for the day to day life, to pay our medical bills if we ever need to. But like, we can't really afford to go out and buy another car, or another phone, etc. Because of this, during every two year check-up; you know how doctors give patients those papers with questions like, ""Have you been angry in the past week"", etc, to try and distinguish what patients might need therapy or something? Most of the time, I identify with most of the boxes, but I end up just marking ""No"" on all of them. Both my parents don't want me to have a therapist, because to them, it's a waste of money.

My mom has always never wanted us to do drugs or drink which is understandable. I never did any of that stuff but my sister has been interested in it for a long time and last night I found out that she has been drinking since junior year.

She asked me to pick her up from a party so I did and when I saw her friends helping her to my car, I had never seen her look or act the way she did and that screwed me up. She was crying and apologizing for doing it and I tried to reassure her and say it’s okay but it’s not okay to me. I just didn’t have the guts to say it to her face. If she was really sorry about it, why would she do it over and over again for the past two years? And she manipulated me into getting her home.

From an extremely low income and dysfunctional family, my parents are now going through a divorce. Currently living with my unemployed mom and my 19 year old brother who has been accepted into college. My dad is abusive towards me and I try to limit contact with him. I don’t have a car or license but going to make that happen ASAP.

My question is: what do you guys think I should be doing? I want to go ahead and start moving ahead in life but I feel as if the odds are stacked against me. I’m hopeful things will look up but obviously I still have to do something in the meantime. 

I don’t have a job at the moment and I’ve never had one. My family, close and extended, are more focused on helping my brother with college for whatever reason. Nobody’s really offered to help me or listened when I mentioned my goals, not really a big deal but it’s the situation. 

I want to go to college someday. I’m very interested in mortuary science, forensics, and counseling. But money is a big issue for my family, and my parents don’t really give me opportunities to be independent (ex not letting me have a license or a job).

352,"We're kind of threading on thin ice right now and we're clueless on how to deal with this... I'd appreciate some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation**: I play football for a local club and it's a tight-knit community. The kind of club were people feel more like a close group of friends, almost family, rather than people you hardly know and see every weekend before and after games. A woman who's also a board member has a son, who can't be any older than 18. I even doubt he is that old. He keeps sending DMs to minors who play in the youth teams, and he always poses as another minor, also from the club. These are heavily sexualized DMs, where he asks for dick picks, whether or not they masturbate, where he claims another minor performed fellatio on him, ... very disturbing stuff.

This happens every few months or so, he gets caught by a coach's wife who knows who he is and what he's doing, he then says he's sorry, backs off, it all dies down, and half a year to a year later, it happens all over again. Over the span of two and a half years, it's happened three to four times. The thing is that by now it's gotten so big that a lot of people know it's happening, but only a handful of people know who's doing it. Even his own mother knows 'someone' is doing those things in and around the club, but she doesn't know it's her own son.

Short of going over to /r/Hacking and getting help in hacking his phone and getting proof that way (like I said, we're desperate), we're \*this\* close to printing out all of the DM screenshots we have and confronting his mother with everything. We know it's this certain kid by now, and he's even responded to his own name in DMs when confronted, so there's at least that. Local police already has a file on everything but they refuse to (can't?) do anything.

The coach's wife I mentioned earlier thinks confronting the mother herself would be a bad idea, because her husband (a coach) and the kid's father go back a long way, and she's afraid that might destroy their friendship. If I can't find any other solution that could handle things a little more delicately, I'm inclined to print every screenshot I have (plenty) and go talk to the mother myself. I don't know her that well, only politely say hello every time and have small talk.

Whichever way this comes out, that kid is in some serious trouble regardless, but given that the entire club might suffer, we're looking for a way to a) confront him in private and b) settle the whole thing in private.

Any thoughts? I'd appreciate the help.",10Jul2019,2

354,"Ok, so this happened over 5 years. I had been taking a corse at a college in my city that is highly regarded. Part of the course was to do work experience, and as this course involved banking, the work experience took place with a notable bank. I was passing my courses (though I failed a couple of final exams due to stress caused by what happened), and I would have graduated, had I not been fired from my work experience at the bank, and given help by my banking teacher.

A few things to know about me, I was noted in my school as having learning disablites, as I had been tested and was given accommodations. I have Autism, but I wouldn’t be diagnosed with it until after all this happened. Also, when this was going on, I had been diagnosed with mild asthma, and had some medical tests result in seeing a specialist.

Ok, so as I said, I have Autism, and part of this is not getting social cues, for example talking a lot to customers. At one point I had a warning, which I took to heart. Now in the past I have had jobs where I was fired after ‘not correcting behaviour that I had been told about’ but never had managers, as far as I knew, told me. I suspect it was the lack of knowing social cues. So I did what I thought was reasonable, I asked the bank manager every day how I was doing, and he told me fine, every day, so I was pleased, and made sure to keep my conversations with customers of the bank (I was a teller) brief, as that was still ok.

As I said before, I had medical things going on, so I had several appointments. The last one was the issue I’m sure. I had seen a kidney specialist (nothing really of note) and a breathing test. This breathing test was because of me being diagnosed with asthma. Part of it I had to take this stuff that would bring my breathing below proper levels, do test, and then given something to bring it back to normal. Well it didn’t go back to normal, so I was given another dose,  not normal, another, not normal. I was given 8 doses, way higher then what is meant to be given to bring it to normal, but it finally did the job.

I had a shift for work experience the same day, but after what happened I felt sick. I still went to the mall where the bank was, my dad driving me, we agreed to see how I felt. Well I felt horrible, and like I would throw up, so I went to the manager, way before the shift would start, he knew about my medical appointments, and told himI felt too sick from my breathing test to work.

Within days, if not a week or so, I was working when he called me into his office and my teacher was there, he was firing me from work experience, stating that he has had to talk to me several times about talking to customers too much. Remember, I had been asking him every day how I was doing in that regard, and he was always saying I was fine. So I knew he was lying, I didn’t say anything there, and I couldn’t prove it. I did have a meeting with my teacher and her boss, head of the department later, where I told them he was lying.

This is where the teacher could have acted. In order to pass, you needed to have 150 hours in work experience, and she helped me get the job at the bank like she did with other students. However, because I was fired from that bank, I would have to start from 0, and she only extended the amount of time I could use to work, she didn’t even bother trying to help me find another job in another bank. And to top it off, she even said I passed all my classes for the course, so the only thing keeping me from graduating was completing the the work experience.

And guess what, I tried, I tried and tried, I couldn’t find a bank to take me for work experience. The deadline came and went. I was stressed, I didn’t think to do anything about it, to argue and try to fight back so to speak. I don’t know if I even could. But now I am older, and wiser and I am mad, and sometimes sad about the injustice. I don’t know if its possible to have anything done, so I’m wondering if it is possible, and if so what should I do?

'Hey I am sorry for being a ass hat with you I found the help I needed please forgive me and let's be friends OP I will help you in anyway I can I think you are a great person. I think you are a good person OP and I am sorry.'

While he didnt explicitly apologize for what he did to me (sexual abuse from the ages of 11-15) I can only guess that that's what he was referring too. He was also just kind of an asshole in general, Dee emotionally abusive and an absolute prick when he was drunk. 
This was my response. 

'Look, I'm gonna level with you, you abused me for years. I'm not going to forgive you for that. I can't and won't. It's good that you've gotten the help you need, but the help I need is still way out of reach because I cant afford it. Because of things you did, I have no desire to be your friend, and I'm not sorry for that. You did irreparable damage to me, and I won't reward that. I do respect the fact that you apologized though. Thank you.'

And that was it. The end of the conversation. I suppose what I really want to know here is whether I was wrong for not forgiving him? I've been thinking about it for the past couple of days. I dont want to forgive him, and like I said, he doesnt deserve it. I just dont know why I keep questioning the fact that I didn't.

360,"So I’ve struggled with my mental health for a pretty long time. It’s affected me going to work, eating, will to live, all of it
Recently I’ve been getting back on track with everything, and today I have a job interview to go to.
Last night I found out someone I used to be pretty good friends with was killed.
He was only 17, and the sweetest kid ever. He’s the reason I have a dog now (;doesn’t sound like much but my dog has saved my life multiple time over the two years I’ve had him). and I used to spend most days hanging in a group with him, so we weren’t close, but I did spend a lot of time with him. We also went to school together, even though he was the year below me (I am 19.) 


Since I’ve found out everything just feels incredibly dark and pointless again. I was nervous about the job interview but now I have absolutely no drive for it. I know I need a job so I don’t want to mess the interview up because of how I’ve been feeling.
It’s like, all of the work I’ve put in to not wanting to die has been completely erased because this poor kid was killed. All I can think about is how how he woke up that morning and had absolutely no idea it was his last day on earth. How he worked on himself (physically, he would come to a parkour training area we hung out at) every day for 3 years training constantly, because people were so rude to him about his height and weight when he was younger.
How he was so unbelievably sweet to everyone he met and would never hurt a fly. And the fact he was CONSTANTLY in a good mood. Nothing would ever bother him.


There’s just so many things running through my head, but at the time it feels so so dark and empty. And I don’t know if it’s going to pass, and if it is, when. 


How on earth do I get through this interview like this? It’s for bar/waitressing so their whole thing is about being bubbly and energetic which usually I can be. But now I feel guilty for trying to even smile",10Jul2019,1

So basically, I've had a lot of opportunities to hookup/date with a lot of girls in my first year and second year of college. I never took them either due to confidence issues or just being stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, When I hear about other dudes that hook up with a lot of girls in other colleges from my friends, I get mad at myself and almost feel lesser now compared to the guys who actually got laid in the end.

I feel Like I wasted great opportunities and I feel bitter just hearing that shit.

I'm also going through an issue which misaligned some parts of my nose and jawline, making me look less attractive I guess, Hopefully it heals, but this issue has made me more anti-social and I dont go out that much anymore due to it.

It was not where I usually went, but that time I wanted to try out 5 stars Yelp reviews. I ended up feeling disappointed. The hair stylist seemed to rush through everything to send me out my way. Less than a week, my hair turned out orange and I hated my hair. I finally went to my go to salon two weeks ago to have them fix it. I then wrote a bad review on Yelp, which later on the owner responded to me saying that they wanted details on when I came in, and to contact them to get a full refund. I was anxious thinking about if I had to confront them, so I asked my mother in law for help, since I used her card to pay that day. My mother in law tried her best, but the salon was rude to her, asking her why didn’t I contact them and why didn’t I say anything to them. They needed me to come in with “my payment”, and they said they were   “advised by Yelp not to send money or engage furthur with someone who has never set foot in our establishment. If your Daughter-in law wants her reimbursment, she will need to come in and bring original payment method her self.” I know it sounds really silly but it just doesn’t feel easy for me to handle the confrontation. I felt like I’m at their mercy to get my money back, which I know I should have tried to talk to them, but from my past experience , it didn’t work out well so I got nervous about it. At this point I don’t know if I should try to get a refund? I just don’t know what they’re going to treat me once I’m there.

I might be homeschooled for half of next year, but I’m not sure if it’s what I want.

Pros of homeschool: My mental health will improve, I’ll most likely do better in classes, I’ll have more time to get money for therapy, and I might even get a job and learn to drive.

Cons of homeschool: I won’t have any new friends like I wanted, I won’t get to take those art classes I wanted to take until halfway through the year, my grades might suffer, and my mental health will decline. Plus, if I like homeschool, I may not graduate from the high school that my dad went to, which is a huge issue for me.

371,"So, I've got this friend, let's call her Paris, whose entire paternal side is completely freaking bonkers.  I'm talking a grandmother who would scream abuse at her for hours on end, a father who's literally freaking brain damaged and will forget how he got somewhere (yet still somehow has a driver's license), a stepmother who is full-blown essential oils 'world is flat' 'every conspiracy under the sun', and a sister that they're doing their damndest to make just like them.  I have no idea how Paris became the woman she is, because she's smart, compassionate, ridiculously driven, and by far my best friend.  For the most part I don't interact with her paternal side much, they live far enough away that I'm never at risk of running into them, but I've met them enough and heard enough about them to know that they're completely freaking insane.  Most recently she told me about a fight with her father and stepmom about her sister having gotten black-out drunk with their knowing consent (she's 15 iirc), which somehow devolved into them arguing that the Holocaust didn't happen, and holy shit I have ***never*** seen Paris angry.  It was a few days later that I heard about it and she was still angry.  This is a woman who I would readily believe to be a reincarnation of Mr. Rogers, but they managed to make her beet-red mad.

So, I guess the advice I'm seeking is, is there something I can do for Paris?  Some advice I can give her?  I hate seeing her so upset.  I know I only really have one half of the story, but honestly, I can't imagine it being acceptable on the other.  I've given her an ear and been as supportive as I can be, but I feel like I should be doing more.  Should be doing something substantial.

376,"Hello, 21/F here, I don’t know how to approach it.

First let me explain. My younger brother has a different father (they haven’t been together for 8 years, my mother has been single since), and he completely skipped out about 4/5 years ago because he didn’t want to deal. I’m the oldest child of four, moved out 6 months ago, and my 19 y/o brother moved out recently. So now my mom is on her own with my sister who’s 11, and my severely autistic brother who’s 12. She does not work because taking care of him is a full time job. His Autism is so severe, he can’t hold a conversation, has angry freak outs, and gets psychical, hitting people or breaking things. It’s worse now because at 12, he’s 5’3 and 230 pounds- he is a BIG boy. As he’s gotten older and bigger, his behavior has only grown worse, he’s broken thousands of dollars worth of things, things my mom has no control over like IPads and phones and windows. My moms patched so much drywall on houses she rents. Always so messy even with her constant cleaning. He pulls clothes out of drawers and entirely dumps containers of things, and screams at the top of his lungs just because. 

Living in that environment was so toxic, I got out the first chance I could. I couldn’t handle anymore screaming and yelling and everything breaking and my mother crying so much out of frustration at least once a day...she’s losing her mind. I can see the deterioration of her health; taking care of my brother is killing her. She herself is overweight severely depressed and has no life of her own.

He was supposed to have behavior specialist 5 days a week for 2 hours, but so many have come and gone because no one wants to work with him. His school has deemed him a danger to other students and keeps him essentially in the closet all day, even during lunch and recess for the 4 hours he’s there. My mom thinks that bullshit and is deciding she’s gonna have to home school him. It’s impossible, and I love my mother so much but I don’t have anyway to help her.

I’ve just started researching care facilities but only found one across the country. How can I convince her it’s the best decision? She’s not considering because “that’s her son”, but how much can one person take on their own? Is there a way she could still be in his life regularly but getting real help? She can barely psychically handle him already, it’s only going to get worse with puberty. How can I change her mind?

389,"I've been watching this show. Basically, it starts normal. Two people are inlove. Then the love intrest switch like half way though, and one of the lovers go into a same sex relationship.

Now. I have nothing aginst that. I'm bi myself.

But...why does it bother me so much? Its an animated show. Why does it bother me when I see someone falling in love, they like eachother, then *BOOM* one is now gay, and they sorta break up. Person A moves on, poor them, Person B meets someone else, they kiss, shizzle gets weird in the fandom, the end. All be it, a sad ending to the show. But a welcome one. 

I really sound insane. But it just keeps me up at night. Its a  TV show, number one, and number two, I'm gay myself. 

I'm lost. Is it cause I'm so hecking lonely (partner wise), am I just weird in the head? Or is there some weird thing, where people feel the same way.

I hate this feeling I have rn. I do. Heacking hate it. Just so lonely feeling, like anything could set me off. I just need a hug, hot chocholate, and a blanket I guess.

390,"I’m 23, always have had dental problems am missing most of nearly all my molars including all back ones on the left And most on right. I’ve had some extreme periods of mental illness though feel in control of that (for the time being), got myself in to over 10k in debt though without ever going to school (though I wish I did), and have had no support from my immediate family, and none from extended family mostly because of some social issues I have that I don’t understand. 
When I was 13 my dad passed away, and his life was plagued with medical issues too. He had disability benefits before passing away that was supposed to go to my sister and I. Our mom is schizophrenic and unable to take care of us We moved in with our aunt who neglected our needs and used that money for herself in many ways. The only medical attention I got with her removed a couple teeth, and temporarily filled some molars which fell apart because she never followed up with my dentist, blaming it on me, so I never got the crowns I needed. So I .lost all those teeth plus one more badly infected, which as an adult I felt compelled to put on credit to get removed. I have some financial situations I cannot fully address here, but I had a situation that prevented me from trying to get state benefits, and when I moved away from that situation, I am being treated as no longer eligible, but as I cannot afford insurance, I’m suffering massively.
Forward to today, my jaw is shifting and going crooked. It’s begun hurting a lot more recently. I damaged something in my wrists overextending in a game called Beat Saber months ago and am still professionally undiagnosed and basically untreated . I have habits that I need psychiatric help, which I can’t go into here, I’m working a job that pays me just enough to get by with my debt payments, rent, phone bill, etc. but provides no benefits and is subjecting me to some pretty under stimulating and degrading work, which hasn’t helped my mental conditions.
I cannot think straight with all these problems piling up, my aunt doesn’t think much of them, my sister isn’t doing well financially and I haven’t told her how much I need help, though she knows I’ve got problems she thinks I’m taking care of myself better than I am. I never tell people I am, but everyone thinks I’m so mature and that I do so good for myself, but they don’t realize just how screwed all this stuff is making me. I am afraid to ask for help, but I know I have to. I don’t know how to help myself out of this mess I’m in and it’s overwhelming.

Best part is that my school is just 5 minutes away from my house, so I’ll have more time doing schoolwork than commuting.

* Should I take more higher level Math and Physics classes?
* Still no internship experience, but planning on applying this year. Just have no idea where and how to start. I live in Los Angeles.
* Would it be better to take more programming electives?

To start this post, I am not looking for sympathy or handouts. I am doing the best I can with all I have and plan to get out of this situation on my own. It is really hard for me to post this because I have made similar posts in the past on other websites and received quite a lot of judgemental and rude responses. All I ask for is advice from someone who may have known someone in my situation or have been through it themselves.

The job situation:

I am a 26 year old male and have no income or job. I have been out of work for over two years for personal reasons but am fully capable and definitely willing to work a full-time job with any physical requirements. 
I earned my GED and High School Equivalency, but have no college experience due to cost.
I do not do well in customer service situations as I have not had much (positive) contact with other individuals due to reasons beyond my control. In short, people scare me and I have very bad anxiety at all times when going anywhere outside the house.
I have no family that will help me. I have no friends.
I have no insurance of any kind.
I do not own a car and the nearest town is 40 miles away. I only have 3 outfits (clothing), none of which are suitable for job interviews.
I live in a small town with little to no job opportunities and have not been able to gain employment.

The home situation:

I am currently living with my significant other who basically keeps me alive, fed and sheltered. I am grateful beyond words for this but I cannot stay where I am.
My situation with my S.O. is tense, to say the least. They are not physically abusive, but I need to leave.

I do not know what to do in this situation as assistance programs in my area typically require you to have a job or be struggling with rent payments. Food pantries are the only reliable source of public assistance. The town I live in has no homeless shelter and I have been banned from (the safe) homeless shelters in the neighboring town due to my sexual orientation.

I would like to know if any of you have any advice for someone in a hole like this.

400,"18yr old female

Ok, so recently I did something that i never ever thought i would do; i fell in love with another girl. For some, this may not be an issue, but for me, it is. I have been raised very strictly religious and honestly agree with 90% of what my religion believes. My issue is that my brain is telling me two very different things; 

1. being gay is wrong. Its a sin and is not what God wanted for mankind. This feeling i am having is wrong, and is a trial set my god and Satan to see how strong my faith is, and I must push past this and show myself that i am stronger than this trial. to give you an example of how strong this part of my brain is; It is currently telling me that writing this post is a stupid idea, i will make everything worse and im not really in love with her and its all so silly.
2. I am who i am, and that cant be changed. I am seriously in love with her and she is my entire world, without her i wouldnt be half the person i am today. Nothing can be wrong with our love, it is so strong and pure, how could god not accept this? This world is so accepting and full of love, and so I should be too

My family isnt accepting at all, and my mother once told me that if any of her children were gay, they would not be a child of God and so they would not be a child of her, so i know that if i come out i will be kicked out of home, and of my family. Despite this though, i love my family so much, they everything to me, and though they may not be perfect parents or siblings, they are my family.

I feel that there is no good solution in my life, and it is making it hard to fight my suicidal thoughts. These are my options 

1. go on like this forever, never marry her or have children with her, keep everything hidden from my family and fight the constant battle with my two brains for the rest of my life - i dont want to live life if i have to do this 
2. Leave her, remove myself from her and become a good faithful daughter and child of God, move past this trial and become the person my family wants me to be, and the person I think i should be. But this will mean leaving the love of my life and breaking both of our hearts, leaving me with a feeling of what if...
3. Come out to my family, be kicked out and be left with no family. Live a life full of shame and internal conflict always shaming my choice, but live a life with my love, our new family and the life we make togther. 

All of these options result in mental conflict for me, but maybe if i choose the right one it will eventually fade out? 

Help, I just want peace in my brain without having to loose anyone i love.",10Jul2019,1

407,"I wrote out a whole post of exactly what happened but I feel no one cares so I’ll shorten it as best as possible.

TL:DR at the bottom

This is all just pretense for my question below, so you can understand how exactly I feel.


I had a best friend from a similar background I met at school through a mutual friend. I noticed he was really depressed so I invited him to sit with me at lunch. I helped him a lot through it and he became a more outgoing person through the years. We became very close friends from that point. It progressed to hanging out, playing games, and watching anime/movies together. His father moved for business to another town and he transferred schools for the last year of middle school. We continued to talk all the time. 

Pass forward to high school, his father moves again to a far away state and we get into a fight because I was being too bossy, but at the same time he wasn’t telling me otherwise, so I kept doing what I did. A big part of it (at least what I think contributed) was that I kept telling him that the certain group of friends he talks to arent a good influence, asked him to hang out more. 

He ghosted me more and more, until I asked him about it. Then he dropped the bomb finally. He was angry with me that I was too bossy, too naggy, etc etc. He said he felt pressure to talk or play games, or stay up really late. He said he wants a life, he wants to go to the gym and do other stuff. I complained that he wouldnt tell me how he really felt and that if he was more open and honest with me, things wouldnt have gotten so bad.

We took a year break because he told me to re evaluate myself and he’ll see me in 6 months. 6 months later, to be an asshole back, I gave him 6 months to think about HIMSELF and how he could have been better. A year later we start talking again.

(I’m getting too passionate and upset writing this so I’ll cut to the chase)

We start talking but he slowly starts ghosting me again saying that he’s gonna try not to use his social media and phone for a while do to a religious holiday. Of course I cool with that, whatever. He doesn’t speak to me once the whole time, while continuing to upload youtube videos, tweet, etc. I ask him whats up and why he’s acting like this and his reason is because I’m boring. He’s not having fun whenever we talk. 

At this point i’m furious. That’s just insulting at this point. Was all those laughs we shared one sided? Whenever we spoke did you want to leave so bad? All that time I helped you out with your depression (he was suicidal at that point) and you toss me aside just like that?


Fast forward to today, where he doesn’t respond to my last text I sent him 2 weeks ago, I’m sitting here going back and fourth in my feelings for the longest time. I really treasured what we had as friends. I treasured every moment with him, because he really lit up my life. I accept the fact that he turned out to be a backstabber. I accept the fact that I probably caused it. I accept the fact I was wrong at one point, and that I improved on myself. 

But I can’t fucking get over it. Every time I see his name on my old convos or he pops up in my mind, my stomach churns and my heart gets crushed and I feel like shit. I really want my old friendship/experiences/emotions back. But at the same time, how dare he treat me like this? I want to erase him from my mind completely. But my heart says it misses my best friend, and I can’t get it to shut up. I’ve given him too many chances.

Why can’t I get over my friendship I had with him? I want to get over but I can’t. What can I do to feel better besides try to repress my 6 years of friendship, and have it come up every time I think about something we did or talked about? Thanks..

TL:DR: Had a best friend who i got into a fight with, he started ghosting me after we made up, and finally he calls me boring and unentertaining so he no longer wants to be friends or stay in touch. I feel like shit, but I don’t want to. How do I stop feeling like shit?

411,"To give you some context, I have(/had) been crushing on this guy I know for about 3 years or so.  We 'got married' in this love story play when we were fourteen and that's how it all started. This is embarrassing but its also the truth, although this guy was probably never interested in me, or even if he was I made it go away with my own actions, but a few months ago I had started to become a little too obsessed with this guy... (I have stalked him ..and his mom and dad on Facebook and/or Instagram vigorously a few months ago..yikes) and there have been days where I have spent like two, three, four hours thinking about him. I have had more than 20 dreams about him. Although in real life, I have spoken, less than 50 sentences with him in the last THREE years. We don't even say hi to each other if we run into each other.
Anyway, something caused me to decide it was finally time to actually move on(I've tried doing it before but failed) a few weeks ago. Since then I've made considerable progress but ever since then I keep seeing babies in my dreams.( Dream 1: There was this tuition teacher that me and the guy would go to,(she's like above 50) and in my dream, she had a baby and I had gone to see him.)
Now dream 2, which I had last night and has been stuck in my head since then, is just so sick and bizarre. It was also very realistic in other ways..
I WAS PREGNANT. I was still the same age(17) but pregnant (wtf) . I was still in the same place where I live, but none of my close friends or parents were around. There were one or two people with me, I can't tell who they were but they were some random women/girls I have seen a few times at school. There were other people that I have seen (as I have lived in the same place for 14 years) but never spoken to, and they were giving me weird looks. And then I delivered the baby (quite easily at that 😂) I remember seeing the baby a little, but I don't know what it looked like. And then I was suddenly at my crushs house, with him giving me a lost and confused look, although I could tell what he was thinking and heard him thinking (in his voice) and here's exactly what he said: ""My brother is too young to make his d*ck work, we didn't have sex, so did my dad get her pregnant?""  
(OKAY WHAT?!) 
AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN 
There was an imagery of me getting intimate WITH.HIS.DAD?!?!?!  
(Reminder: I have only seen his dad in photos and seen him driving his car here and there(my crush lives right next to my house) but NEVER EVER interacted with him!)
There are some parts that I don't remember , but I probably woke up after that feeling SICK. And I still feel terrible. I can't even look my crush in the eye anymore. I don't want to keep thinking about him anymore. I was kind of congratulating myself on not having thought/dreamt about him for quite a while...and then this happened.
Could someone please explain what this means and tell me how to get this out of my head?! It's literally eating me away.",10Jul2019,0

I’m working in a warehouse on a short term contract.

I have a co worker who works evenings (I work days) we have around 4 hours where we’re both working.

He’s very hard to deal with.
He’s very controlling.

We have scanners for scanning packaging, one is his the other is for whoever else to share.
He will walk over and take ‘his’ one when there’s none free.. because it’s ‘his’.

Everything has to be done his way ‘why are you doing that?’ ‘No man, are you stupid’, ‘why won’t you just listen and do it the right way?’

He thinks everyone else is stupid, if I find a solution to a problem or something along those lines he always says ‘ah you’re not as stupid as you look’.

He expects you to work in accordance to him - ‘slow down man, slow down’..
He expects me/someone else to watch his stuff so someone else doesn’t start using ‘his’ scanner.
If you don’t he starts complaining ‘why can’t you just do as you’re told, are you stupid man?’

He’s a foreign guy so I think some of his language choices are as a result of that.

I know he worked in a high stress place before this and he’s use to running the show but he’s just a coworker here.
He’s the type of guy I’d hate as a manager because then you’d actually have to listen to him.

I’ve just taken to wearing earphones and intentionally not doing what he says.

He’s so hard to stand up to because he makes t seem like you’re being awkward.

I got annoyed over a retractable knife breaking while I was using it, he was joking ‘oh good man, yeah break it why don’t you’ and when I got annoyed at it he changed his tune to ‘hey man.. don’t get so worked up over things, it’s just a knife’..

But he will still tease and poke fun at every damn thing you do, but if it was him he’d be telling you to fix it for him.

415,"Hello all,

I am at the turning point in my life and I want to share my thoughts and maybe get some advice from everyone. Here is my story.

I am a 25 year-old (just turned) man and I'm having a very serious quarter-life crisis at the moment. I was living my life with the no regrets mindset for many years, or so I thought was. I was 100 % focused on my sports ""career"" and engineering studies (energy technology) at the university. I have been playing floorball (it's a sport) since i was 7 and studying engineering since autumn 2015. I was willing to give up basically all social life in order to be successful in those.

I've really not had any true deep friendships during the past 4 years and I started my first and only relationship just 11 months ago (we split up 2 months ago, which started this whole process and have been on and off since). I believed that getting the highest grades and learning as much as possible would lead to a great career, a big salary and ultimately happiness and fulfillment. I devoted basically all my free time to playing and practicing floorball, hitting the gym and running. I don't really regret doing sports because I have always loved it and it has probably been the best thing in my life. However, during the past few months I realized how empty my life has been and how much I have possibly missed out on. I feel like I have missed out on the ""normal"" student life and early 20s. Basically no partying, not much hanging out with the friends, no dating, no sex life. I was busy with my own stuff and just didn't find those things interesting or worth pursuing. Somehow, i feel like i haven't grown up and really matured. I have been too much of a perfectionist and not allowed myself to enjoy life enough. I have been chasing perfection so that I wouldn't have to regret later that i didn't work hard enough to achieve things. What the heck was I thinking about?!? My view on life and what is truly important has been so faulty.

Now, i feel like i have been betrayed because i am regretting the things that i did in order to not feel regret. I have realized that the engineering degree/career which i have chosen isn't what i truly want to do . It was a rational decision to pursue a career with good future prospects and which seemed interesting and still is, but now i feel that in the end it is not meant for me (it is another story). Even if it was, my GPA would really be pretty much irrelevant in terms of finding a good well paying job. It's all about personal branding and networking and all that bullshit, which gets you the job. I have one more year left at the university and i'm going to finish my degree as i can't apply for other studies until the next spring.

Now, the regret and the self blame are killing me. It really hurts so much thinking that I ""wasted"" my best years mostly on doing something which I don't benefit from. I'm really mad at myself. It seriously hurts like hell to admit that I have pursued a wrong career, made the wrong choices, made a mistake and there is nothing i can do to get that time back. I'm really having anxiety attacks as i'm diving deep into my thoughts and thinking what i could have been doing all these years and how much more fun everyone has had. It feels like i have wasted my life. I'm really messed up right now and afraid I might end up really depressed. Every day i spend in this misery is making me older, which makes it worse and worse. I have seen a psychologist and a doctor because of this and started counseling to get through this. I hope it will get easier.

All the people tell me I'm still young, which is true i suppose. However it is hard to start reliving those early 20's now even though i know that it is not too late to do certain things. I feel like there is a big hole to fill inside me. It just isn't easy to start spending more time with friends and acquaintances, getting new experiences and travel as everyone is already pretty busy with their lives. It also feels like i'm artificially trying to have fun as i'm trying to catch up doing some new and fun stuff. The only thing good in all this is that i am realizing this now and not after 5, 10 or 15 years. I have to believe that in the end it's all going to be better. I know I can still make a change. There just isn't really much I can do anymore. Not really many big choices to make. Not many new social circles to enter. I wish i could go back 5 years in time and do everything all over again. But i can't. And. it. is. killing. me. I guess slowly putting more emphasis on social life, building new connections and friendships and taking time for myself to enjoy life is the right thing to do now. I'm also going to continue playing floorball and put (way) less emphasis on my studies.

In terms of work life, one thing I am seriously considering on is making a radical change. I have done very serious self-contemplation and trying to figure out what is it that i want to do and what gives me fulfillment and makes me happy. I realized that I have known this for a long time already. I did my military service in 7/2014 - 6/2015 and thinking back, I was really at my best in the that environment. I enjoyed it. Later, I have looked back at those times with nostalgia and longing. Maybe somehow even wishing I could go back. Maybe I was not wanting to admit it to myself, but I just never thought it would be a possible career option. I already had my engineering study position granted before i even entered the military service so my mind was fixed on that for a long time before even beginning the studies. Right now, I'm thinking I would be so much happier if i had somehow ended up in a military career. And I'm regretting that I didn't end up there and that i didn't question my career choices earlier. Can i blame myself? I don't know because my studies and everything have proceeded smoothly and i have been content with everything. It just feels horrible that I've given so much for something i'm now unsure about.

So, i'm going to finnish my engineering degree next year and keep doing the things i mentioned. After that, I basically have have two options:

1. Continue on engineering field, find a ""nice"" job with a nice salary and always have this nagging thought that what if... Worst thing would be that I wouldn't even find a nice job, just one with a good salary.
2. Apply for officer school, graduate in three years and start building a career in the military.

Now my heart is telling me to follow option 2. The time to apply is next spring so I have good time to weigh the pros and cons. I just don't want to make a wrong choice this time. Basically, the biggest issue here is time. It has taken me soon 5 years to get my engineering degree. Am I ready to throw that away? Am I ready to spend the next three years pursuing another thing? I would be 29 at the time of graduation.

So here is everything that is going on with my life. Thank you for taking time to reading this, I really appreciate it.  I would appreciate any comments or advice from anyone. Pretty long story so I might not have written everything logically and I may have missed something so please ask me if something was left unclear.

418," 

I from Turkey, 45 Years old and have been married for 21 years, and I have one son.(I created this account because my son told me to do so, in hopes of getting someones help)

My husband has a business with his family and they run the business like a partnership. His brother, his business partner, has been stealing our share of the business for years, but my husband can't say much. His brother's daughters attend to private colleges and go to private universities. His wife always wears good quality clothes. They also bought a summer villa by stealing money from their company account and then furnished the interior aswell which costed again, a lot of money. When we heard about all this, we asked them about it but like always, they found a way to lie about it, for example they always say:We got most of the money from my wife's father.

My husband always tolerated this in order not to break his relationship with his brother/family. That makes me crazy.

Now I run a small cafe of my own. And with the money I make, I support our house, and I send money to my son in university. I'm tired of the other side eating our money while I sacrifice so much. And this has been going on for a very long time. By the way, I have tried to tell my husband about this partnership and how its going to affect our family for a long time, but he constantly tells me that his relationship with his family is not my concern, and as of now we are on the verge of bankruptcy.

After that, without my knowledge, my husband borrowed a large amount of money from my brother and my uncle and has not been able to pay it back for two years. And because of that, I can't even answer my brother's and my uncle's phone calls.

I don't know what to do next. I am open to any advice / help.",10Jul2019,1

I'm not very attracted to women's behaviour, I feel like they are just all robots when it comes to attraction, they are too much drama, and you can't trust what they say because what they say is all puzzles, I'm not patient enough for that shit and I am too proud to deal with it to get some pussy. I don't hate women I just like my space and solitude. Love is a myth anyway, unless it's for your own blood. 

However being a living thing, my instincts will get the better of me and end up fucking my life up because I got married and then divorced and everything has been taken from me, or I'm stuck in an unhappy relationship. I know it sounds bitter but that's what most relationships end up being. The spark only lasts a few years at most. But lights out always comes, then you have to deal with her for 25 years because you have kids to raise, even if you divorce, you still gotta deal with her.

So then I found this lady and her family, her husband, and I just wanted to befriend, they have this big apartment inheritance, so as she could be part of my network; well she has clearly took a liking for me, it seems she has never met a guy like me before, against all odds, stubborn, but nice overall; I honestly don't know what kind of men she has been dealing with before, but she has an idealized idea of me, she clearly has the wrong idea. I am as ugly as it gets. Worst the husband, has a thing for me too.

I am very down the point, so we have already discussed this stuff; but she gets confused and lost, and says a different thing each time. (I am even gay, she knows).

426,"Pardon my bad English, learnt it as a second language

Long post, requires long exposition :3

In 2016, I was dating with a girl that I had really good chemistry with and we were both really happy back then. We never got past the dating stage though, she only saw me as a good friend and left with another guy by the end of the year. Still stayed friends with her after the year. We barely talked or messaged until this year.

Fast forward to 2019

My gf dumped me (17M) for another guy that's much better looking than me on this year's valentine's, and I fell into a short period of depression back then (better now). But after I recovered I didn't have the urge to love anyone anymore. It's like love isn't important to me anymore, and I literally lost all passion to flirting with girls anymore (I used to be a very flirty guy). 

When my friends asked me ""Don't you like someone even just a *little bit?""*

I always replied ""No. Just friends and no further.""

I guess fate (?) brought the 2016 girl back to my side. We're in the same class this year and when I was depressed in March, she noticed and consoled me. Turns out the guy was just a playboy and never really liked her. He ditched her and she fell into the same phase where ""love isn't important"" anymore. She knows how I feel because she's been through the same scenario. She also stated that after she failed in love she won't start a relationship anymore until she graduates because she's kinda powerless and tired to go through all that shit again.

We became really good friends (again) this year.I know how she feels, she knows how I feel. I'm a guy that's really good at maths and she isn't,  I became her maths teacher after class almost everyday. She would make gimmicky jokes here and there and she advises me genuinely on where I could improve in life. It almost feels like 2016 - I would go miles for her and do anything for her. I guess fate really likes to troll me. We've been flirtatious with each other almost everyday, the looks we exchange, she's willing to share her emotions with me, etc. 

She doesn't wanna fall in love anymore. She just made me fall in love with someone that broke me down years ago.

Is this just really good long lost friendship or is a second chance for love? I honestly have no idea. i don't even know if this is just infatuation or whatever. 

Thank you to those that made it all the way here. I really appreciate any advice or criticism.",10Jul2019,1
427,"(Long post, sorry) The event that I learnt more information about happened about three years ago. The letter M will be used to refer to the girl in this situation. I had known M since eight grade and after volunteering and hanging out together, I began to develop feelings for her. The only problem was my parents were (and still are) very protective of me and restricted the things I could do as a result. I stopped myself from actually pursuing anything with her and kinda kept to just talking to her at school and over the phone. But during sophomore year of high school, M told me that she was moving. It was nowhere far, but we wouldn’t be going to the same school anymore and as a result, we would mostly likely stop talking. My sophomore self was convinced that I had to act and do something. So after trying to impress M by making a late night run to Taco Bell to get her food and by talking to her more. One day, she asked if I wanted to hang out with her and I obviously said yes and made plans to go eat with her. From what I heard from her, it wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t great either. For me, it was probably one of the worst interactions ever. I was a mess; a clumsy, nervous, and absolutely scared mess. I forgot where I put my money, I ordered something messy and huge (meatball sandwich), and I wasn’t that great at small talk at the time. But regardless I got through it in one piece and made it home. I slept through the embarrassment and the next morning, things were back to normal again. Except that a few days later, she abruptly cut off communications with me. No more Snapchat, texting, or anything else. I tried restarting the streak, but she would look at them and not respond. It was official, she ghosted me. Eventually I moved on and raised my self esteem up again and began new friendships and relationships. 

Now here is where the new information comes in. Me and a friend of hers were hanging out when she brings up M. She shows me her sinsta  and tells me how M has been up and down in terms of her feelings and mental health. She contacts her and they for awhile talk. She mentions me and how I felt like she ghosted me after we hung out. She then reveals that she didn’t really mean to do that to me. She had no intentions of doing it in the first place and she wasn’t trying to be mean. She had even done it to other people and I am guessing it was because she was going through a rough patch. This info brought back some old feelings and questions of “what if?”. Like what if I had tried harder or gone to see her? What if I asked other people what was going on? What could have happened if I did try harder?

After taking a look at myself and the situation, I realized a couple of things.

A) How do you unintentionally ignore someone and how do you not intend for that to be mean or at least rude?
B) If I am still hung up on this after a couple of days of thinking about it, do I still have feelings for her?
C) Just because she didn’t mean to be rude or to ghost doesn’t mean she wants to talk to me or would like to
D) I am just struggling with how I should react, because, how should I react to this?",10Jul2019,1

431,"TLDR at the bottom. 


About 6 months ago I suddenly felt depressed from being single all my life I was 22, now 23.
Also I live in a religious and conservative country. 

I made a post on reddit talking about myself and how How depressed I’m from being single and lonely. About 2 weeks a girl DM’s me saying she understands what I’m going through and would like to be friends with me. We live in the same city. 

I agreed we started texting. I would say this is the first time I started texing a girl from around middle school since I didn’t care about it. She’s 5 years older than me and her intention was to find me a girl around my age And I do the same for her. 

We talked a lot and I really like her, so about 1 month in I confessed to her but she didn’t believe me and I dropped it.  Two weeks later she texts me saying that she didn’t reject and would like to know each other more by meeting and I agreed. 

After we met I said to her that I really liked her and she said the same. 

To get to the point of things. I felt depressed all the time for the whole 6 months I literally felt like crap. I would get super moody and irritated when she takes long to text back. I would literally lose my ability to function properly. 

I would think about her all the damn time and feel very depressed when she’s busy or doesn’t give me enough of her time.  I would even cry before sleep

I felt like I was putting too much effort into her and she doesn’t do the same and only talks to me when she feels like, when I would always reply and text her immediately. 

I was at a point where I felt better not talking to her as oppose to it but I didn’t want to lose her and be lonely again I even wanted to marry her. 

So I mentioned this texting thing later and said that I feel like she doesn’t care when we talk because she takes hours and she said ok let’s get back to being friends. 

I couldn’t accept it and at the same time I didn’t want to lose, so I kept saying contradicting things like ok let’s be friends and the next day saying no I want more for 2 weeks until she hated me and doesn’t want to do anything with me and now I still feel terrible and depressed 

What the hell have I been through?

Now I’m back to square one, depressed from being single again.

436,"Hey everyone, 

I’m hoping that I can get advice from this big collective. I’ve been friends with someone we will name Natasha for a long time, about 14 years. We’ve been friends since high school, and I came into her life at a time all her friends had turned on her and we immediately clicked despite going to different schools in the same town. 

We were the best of friends, and told each other everything. Obviously our friendship changed a lot over the years with us dating boys and learning how to balance and prioritize, usually badly. We had fought a lot, and after about 4 years of a solid friendship we started going through this cycle of crazy fights that would make us not talk for 6 months to 1 year. Usually I was the one who came back to apologize. This has been going on for the last ten years now. When we “break up”, I feel like it’s worse than a relationship. I never get over it no matter how much time goes by. 

Our fights were always about some kind of miscommunication or one of us felt the other wasn’t prioritizing them and a conversation usually blew up into a fight that we would both walk away from each other. 

I’ve been doing a lot of spiritual growth and working through my mental health issues. My family divorced young and started new lives, and I don’t feel like I have close relationships other than Natasha. I have a small group of really good friends, but she was always different. 

This time around, as usual I was consumed by missing her. I stopped talking to her and kicked her out of my wedding because I felt like it was all about her, I was so frustrated that her life was so easy and felt she didn’t care about me. Again I wasn’t a priority while I waited for her to tell me what was going on in her life. 

But something that was different and confusing is that I worked on forgiving her. Truly forgiving for everything that went wrong, and learned that I can’t control others and their reactions but I can control ME and my reactions. It led me to digging deep and feeling like a lot of the issues I had were internally me bringing them forward and then not addressing or confronting them (I am terrified of confrontation). I feel like I spent years feeling like a victim to feeling in control. 

But it hurts now because I love and miss her and want to be her friend. We’ve always had a bond that doesn’t break no matter what. 
I’m not worried about having the friendship as much as I’m worried about it upsetting and affecting the people around me. 

My husband and friends look at her through this super negative light because of me explaining how I feel to them and now it’s awkward to think about bringing that point to light with anyone. My husband knows that we’ve started talking again, but he’s even told me he’s worried about me which has set this tone that now I’m anxious to talk about it. 

I guess, to summarize, I just feel like I’ve spent years blaming everything on her (and she’s definitely given me triggers and has her fair share of mistakes), but I feel like I’ve been a victim. Going through it this time I realized that because of my issues I had unrealistic expectations of her friendship, and was selfish in that I wanted and needed her attention when I needed it or I got insecure about losing her friendship.  Which in turn, made me lose it anyways. 

Any advice on how to handle with friends and family, or to help with the jumble in my brain is much appreciated.",10Jul2019,1
437,"I (19F) graduated school last year. I mostly spent the breaks between the lessons with a group of three people. One of them (19F, let‘s call her May) is one of my best friends and we still meet regularly. She introduced me to her friends (20F, let’s call her Lisa and 19M, Shawn), but we never really got close enough to tell each other secrets or personal problems, it was just a school intern friendship to have someone to talk to about shallow stuff and to not be alone during the breaks. May, on the other hand, was good friends with all of us and is still in contact with Lisa and Shawn.

So, let’s talk about their characters a little bit. May is a friendly, funny, confident and overall nice person to be around. Lisa is someone who says what’s on her mind, which can be hurting but it’s great to have someone who won’t pack you in cotton wool. She’s very confident and a bit loud, but I still got along with her. Shawn on the other hand is a bit weird. He has very low self esteem and because of that he often acts awkward and like he’s inferior, but he’s very friendly. He didn’t have any friends besides us. I like him and I always tried to be a good friend to him, but it’s honestly exhausting to try to start a normal conversation, since he’s even awkward and shy around me. He had a huge crush on that one boy and tried to get his number several times but he always got rejected, because that guy was straight. Even after we told him to stop trying and that he would find someone else, he didn’t listen to us and made a fool of himself over and over again. He’s nice and everything, but I just don’t enjoy being around him, because of his weird behavior most of the time. I can’t even explain it but he makes me feel uncomfortable and the same goes for most others that know him. Unlike most others, I was always nice to him, tried to help him with problems he had and defended him against bullies.

As previously mentioned, I still meet up with May very often. Lisa and I have lost contact over time, but we’re both okay with that. Shawn has texted me a few times during the last year and I always reply detailed and friendly, I even had a few in-depth conversations with him over WhatsApp. However, every time he asks me to meet, I come up with excuses, and I feel very bad about it. I even kinda want our friendship to end slowly and in good terms, like the one with Lisa, but I’m too scared to tell him, because I would come off as an awful human being and it would fuck up his confidence even more. I just wish he’d get tired of always being the one to text me first, but he doesn’t. It probably doesn’t help that I’m texting him like everything was normal, but I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I talked about it with May and she said I don’t have to meet him or stay friends if I don’t want to, but she has no idea on how to make that clear either. Tips on how to handle the situation would be very appreciated",10Jul2019,1
438,"I've had a rough few years, or decade, and its almost all self inflicted. At the moment I'm still an alcoholic. I lost my job due to a cocaine addiction and then went to rehab and relapsed and got suicidal and crazy and then stopped cocaine for the last 2 months or so. At this point i'm still an alcoholic though. 

I have no job and I have a girlfriend moving in with me soon. I have a very serious job interview tomorrow, a 2nd stage interview with a good company, and I want to do well, but I'm drinking 30 units per day to feel level, that's how much its taking. 

It went down from 50 units per day to 10 and now its gone back up to 30, and my key worker from the drug and alcohol service has said that if I stop it could be dangerous because I've already gone through a detox at rehab and an emergency detox at the hospital, so to stop suddenly again would be very stupid. He wants me to drink for the next 6 weeks until I can have a home detox, which I don't think will work either. 

I said to him that my mum, my dad and I think I need to just stop full stop now because I clearly cant moderate it at all, its just increasing again, but he is saying not to. My GP and doctor is saying to follow his advice as well.

Now because my girlfriend is the only one working and Im at home, im supposed to find a job, attend this and other interviews and also move and clear out her house and my rooms to move her in, and it all takes so much energy, but whilst on 30 units per day my whole body just cant be bothered. All im thinking about is that if I get some MDMA or cocaine then I will have the energy, ill have something to counteract the depressing feeling on my body that alcohol gives, but then Ill want more and more. 

Its driving me crazy.

And whats worse is that during all of this ""non"" cutting down that im doing, and everyone thinks its getting better when its really getting worse, im also developing a ketamine addiction. 

TL;DR: in short - Everything apart from my job is going well, and I havent done anything stupid for a long time, yet I can see its all about to explode",10Jul2019,1
439,"Long story short: I’ve been working with this company for 2+ years. I had finally racked up serious bonus money. I would’ve gotten 3.5k in 2 weeks!! 3 months ago, I got a new boss and she clearly doesn’t like me. We got into it over her being disrespectful and trying to deny me time off for my religious holiday a month ago. Ever since then, I felt like she was out to get me. Fast forward to 1 week ago, the fridge breaks on my day off and I get blamed for it because we weren’t properly filling out a temp log. I don’t hear anything about it for a week. Then, Monday she comes and accuses me of “falsifying documents”. I’m over everything so I sign the paper, then she fires me. I am just so annoyed because it was 2 weeks before I received my bonus, the timing is all tooooo convenient. Everyone is telling me to contact HR, but the HR people know because they approved it. Should I contact the labor department to get my bonus? Or the news? Should I fight it or just let it go since I signed the paper which equals admitting guilt when I was just trying to get her away from me? Not sure what to do! I’m not worried about getting a job because I already have one but I’m mad cause I worked hard and I deserve that bonus money!",10Jul2019,1

I immediately got upset about if and I went to my team leader and assistant manager and refused to take their food to them I wanted them kicked out but my team leader wouldn't coz he said I can't be sure they were making fun of me. later on I had to check the toilets and I walked upstairs to girls toilets and the door opens and it was them girls I looked up and the girl that laughed earlier smiled at me, and I overheard em saying whys a boy going in girls toilets and walked past me as normal.

446,"TL;DR My aunt was diagnosed with dimensia a few years ago. My mom (and uncle) seem to be really struggling but I live abroad. Am I being selfish by staying away? I plan to move in with my girlfriend next year in a totally different country. 

...

So basically the living situation is that my mom lives with my uncle, aunt, and cousin. This means that the burden of my aunts disease falls to my mom and uncle for the most part. 

Every so often my mom will mention how difficult it is and how much my aunt has deteriorated. Or how she's going back to the doctor because her antidepressants aren't strong enough. Today my mom told me she's going to see a psychologist because she's been feeling depressed and horrible recently (and probably for some time too). I'm getting more worried about her as time goes by. Their whole lives seem to be consumed by looking after my aunt. 

I've offered to go back to help them take care of her before, but they've always told me not to worry. Quite honestly I don't want to move back so I've always just left it there. I just feel guilty though. I want to have my own life but I also want to help them. I've also made arrangements to move to Taiwan with my girlfriend next year. Moving back would be a complete change in direction and probably the end of my relationship too.",10Jul2019,2
448,"I hope this don’t come across as stupid but this is actually really kinda bugging me lol. okay so a while back I moved away from home meaning that I’ve found myself in a situation with not many friends/ people to turn to where I am. I was lucky enough to have my friends of 7 or so years move to where I am not long after me. When we share our intimate moments I love these girls with my whole heart but at the same time I can’t stand the people they present themselves to others, especially on social media. I’m constantly so angry at posts they make that are totally against my morals which some being racist, sexist, homophobic and generally very self entitled which make me really uncomfortable to be associated with them. I’ve also recently hated going out in public especially on a night out with them as conversation with others is always based around them and how they’re going to be famous etc and I feel really out of place. Last year I ended a really toxic friendship with a girl they are still best friends with and whenever they have a fight they come to me and want to spend time with me but when on good terms I find myself being left out a LOT. I know you can’t get along with everyone and when there’s something good it’s okay to accept some flaws but are these things that should determine the ending of a long term friendship??

450,So my girlfriend and i have always had an arrangement. Basically we occasionally have her friends come over and we all have sex together. Once our daughter was born we put it on pause but shes old enough to sleep through the night now. The problem is that about a month ago we moved my mom in because her living conditions were terrible and having someone to watch our daughter with at all times has been a HUGE help. Shes on oxygen and barely leaves the house. Last night I asked her to spend the night at my sister's. I didnt explain that it was because one of my gfs friends really wanted to come over. She was upset because she felt like she gives us privacy and she is a bit of a homebody so getting her out can be a headache. I obviously didnt want to get into details with her on why we needed the house and honestly didnt feel like i needed to give an explanation. So now this is going to be a reoccuring thing with her friend from last night and weve been getting flirty with old friends again. I just feel like explaining the situation would be easiest for everyone. I dont know how to explain it to her though. Shes super sweet and not at all judgemental. I dont want her to have to leave every time. Not really sure how to proceed.,10Jul2019,1

452," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",10Jul2019,1
453,"This is a situation I’ve been mulling over for a good minute now. I’m not sure if I should give this friendship a chance of revival, or if it’s just time to call it quits. It’s not that we were friends for a long time, it’s just that she was the only friend I had made after moving, and we seemed to click right off the bat. But she did something that to me felt like a pointer stab in the back, but I can’t make up my mind. I’ve talked to other friends and they don’t think it’s worth it, but when I talk to my husband about it, he thinks I should at least try. What would you do in my shoes?

Little bit of backstory: My boyfriend (now husband) and I had been dating for about 2 months at this time (and by two months, I mean we had literally only been in each other’s lives for 2 months), and then he was sent away for about 5 months or so for basic training due to him signing up for the military before we got together. Since we hadn’t been dating for that long, we didn’t really have the conversation about whether or not we were gonna wait for each other during that time. We had literally no communication other than letters that he barely got the opportunity to send out and the once in a blue moon 5 minute phone conversation until he graduated. 
During the months with no communication, there was a guy (let’s call him Blip cuz that’s all he was) who came into my life who I started to feel attracted to. When he started to flirt with me, I immediately told him about my military boyfriend so he would know exactly the type of situation I was in. I’m a polyamorous person, so I explained that since we didn’t have the initial “wait for me” conversation, that I wasn’t against talking to this guy, and told him to let me know how he felt about it. Initially Blip said he was fine with it, and we “dated” for maybe a week before he completely ghosted me. (Keep in mind I had known him for longer than a week, it’s only that our “relationship” lasted for that long)
And I say those things loosely because I thought he was being sincere, but honestly, I’m not sure. Because after he got what he wanted (sex), he seemed to disappear. It stung for a minute, because I felt played, but I didn’t think about it too much because after that he didn’t really mean anything to me. 
Things between me and my military boyfriend continued, and I went to see him for his graduations and any free days he got. I realized that this was the guy that I wanted to be with long term, monogamously. And honestly since I rarely got to see him in person, or talk to him on the phone for too long, Blip didn’t even cross my mind when I finally got to see him. But at this time, with his basic training being close to over, our relationship was aiming more towards a serious route, and we were talking about getting married.
So one day Blip popped up on my phone saying he wanted to apologize and explain why he ghosted me. I let him do so, but none of it really seemed sincere, it felt like he was just trying to worm his way back into my life. I didn’t really want anything to do with it, so I mentioned that I was planning on marrying my military man, but of course this would come back to bite me. 
The day before we went to get hitched, Blip shows up on my doorstep and tries to make a big deal about what happened between us to my boyfriend. Of course, my boyfriend gets mad, and I tell Blip to get off of my porch, and pull him inside to try to smooth things over. This is where I personally fucked up. I should have just explained to him exactly how things went down, but I didn’t, I tried to hide it because I was scared it would be blown out of proportion. We ended up getting married anyway, but the one thing I hadn’t told him was that Blip and I had slept together because I was honestly so embarrassed. Like I said earlier, i felt like Blip played me. 

So many months later, we moved away to where we’d be stationed, I make a friend in the new area, and I guess I had mentioned the Blip story to her. I was having a shitty day one day, went over to her house, cried my eyes out about an honestly small problem that felt big at the time. But to me, in that moment, it felt like an important issue that we needed to get past. It was probably some kind of stupid couple argument along the lines of “I do more chores than he does, and he doesn’t understand that I’d like help once in a while”. —But my anxiety blew it up to the proportion where I remember specifically telling her that if anything happened to my marriage, I would probably be homeless due to the fact that I spent the rest of my money helping us move to where we needed to be stationed.— So I ask her to help me talk to him about it since I felt like he wasn’t hearing me. 
I bring her over to my house, I leave her alone with him for maybe 15 minutes to take a shower so they can talk, and by the time I get out, they’re both in my car, about to pull out of the driveway. I come outside and she tells me that she had a migraine and needed to go home. I tell her not to worry about it, to feel better soon. 
When my husband gets back, he’s furious, telling me that he knows that Blip and I slept together. I asked him who he had heard it from, and he tries to tell me that they made him promise not to tell me they told. I said if we’re being completely honest now, I need to know. He said it was my new friend. We fought about it for a few hours, but long story short, we’re still together, and we’re working through it together. 
However, I’m still mulling over why my new friend felt like she had the right to air my dirty laundry the way that she did.

To me, I feel like she didn’t have the right to tell him anything about it. I understand that I probably should have been completely honest from the get go with him, but that’s my problem, and I don’t think she had any grounds to stand on to say what she did. I’m not really even mad that he knows now, I’m mad at her for A) lying to me, saying she had a migraine and needed to go home, when in reality she was trying to hide what she just did. (As well as telling my husband not to tell me it was her)
B) doing what she did when I had literally told her that same day that if anything were to happen, I would be screwed since I don’t have any money to live of off, and I’m nowhere near any family of mine who could take me in
C) considering I had mentioned the Blip incident to her, I would have told her exactly how it went down, how it affected me, etc, and she didn’t consider how I felt about her saying anything, or how it would affect my marriage AND not to mention, she didn’t even know me until way later after this all had occurred, and didn’t really have first hand knowledge of seeing it go down with her own eyes.
I honestly don’t think she had the right to say anything, it felt like she was aiming to hurt me, and I’ve talked to several of my friends who knew about the Blip incident, and explained all of this to them, and they all have said they agree with me. They think I should just chalk it up to a failed friendship and move on. 
It’s been over a month now since I’ve talked to his girl, and I can’t stop thinking about it. My husband says I shouldn’t be mad at her, and that i should talk to her, and try to mend the friendship I had with her. But I don’t know if I could feel comfortable talking about any sort of relationship topics with her again, if I did mend that friendship. 
I’ve considered reaching out to her, to at least hear her out, and see where it goes from there, but I guess I just need more advice because I’m still confused and a bit hurt. My husband doesn’t really want to hear my back and forth about the matter, so I’d appreciate if someone would read this and tell me what they would do if they were me. 

(Also, if that doesn’t full cover everything that happened and how I feel, I’ll answer questions to better explain)",10Jul2019,1

455,"Around this time of year last year, my mom and two sisters moved to texas. Long story short, the stay was progressively getting worse.

We stay with our great aunt and she doesn't make things very enjoyable. Because of her attitude and the things she says to our face but how she switches over the phone, we distance ourselves from her.

On monday, she sent out a text saying that there are no babies in the house and that we need to fend for ourselves. But just yesterday, she said she would punish for a month because the siblings and I are not responding to her texts where no appropriate response can be given or one isn't needed. If we aren't babies, why do you have to punish us as if we are some?

Our mom is trying to work to get a place of her own, but her being a single mom and having to deal with the three of us is hard.

That example up there with my aunt is just the start. There have been other things said verbally and through text. She even tried to force her religion on us at one point.

She doesn't know us and we haven't told her anything about our experience back over in Maryland. Simply because she is loose lipped and spills our business to anyone and even her friends. Explicit information that no one else needs to know.

I would just like to know, what do I do from here? I can't draw, I can't sleep, I can't eat because if her. Everyday something is fussed about and I can't take it anymore. I want to lash out at her but I feel as though it is not going to solve anything.

462,"Sorry this is long but I really need help &amp; to get this off my chest.

I’ve been friends with this girl for 5 years. We’re like chalk and cheese yet somehow became great friends.

She’s soft, sensitive, girly, emotionally in touch, introvert at heart, yet ask how her day was and she’ll tell you exactly how it was and why, and she likes tea and picnics and romance and one on one time.
I’m extroverted, don’t like to express or dwell on emotions, tomboy, while I talk a lot I don’t actually share deep or intimate details, and I like extreme sports &amp; action &amp; adventure &amp; humour and group time.
Black and white, yet we share our core values and that’s what matters, friends often aren’t the same.

Now I care about her and she’s a great person... the problem is I’m starting to feel she’s too clingy and I’m definitely withdrawing. There are 2 major reasons why:

(1) I hate gifts when they’re over given. 
I’ve told her I hate giving gifts except if I truly stumble on something I know you’ll love. I don’t want to buy your friendship with meaningless materialistic things on a constant basis. This comes from I think, as a child, having an over gifting relative that almost made the gifts loose value. I want gifts I give to be heartfelt and special. Quality per se, over quantity.

Likewise I hate receiving too many. I’ve told her I’m an expert at pretending to love them though - gifting is sensitive and I don’t want to crush anyone’s feelings. Yet she believes my reactions to her gifts wholeheartedly.

I tell her I was brought up so that if you receive you must give in return - yet I’m not capable of giving as much as she does or as thought out as she does. It’s not in me. 
It makes me feel really horrible. I’ve told her. I’ve asked her doesn’t it feel bad to give and never get and she admitted that sometimes it does but she brushes the feeling aside because she understands that not everyone is a “gifter” as she is, and that she knows she sets the bar too high.

I’ve told her to stop. She doesn’t seem to get that I don’t like it though. Whenever I tell her, it’s almost as if it’s incomprehensible. She just smiles and says “but I honestly really enjoy giving! More than receiving!”
It’s a draining thing. She also wants to (&amp;fights tooth and nail to) pay ALL the time which ruins simple lunch... I feel like her little sister or daughter (in reality we’re a few months apart, and I’m the older one who makes more money). When I return the favour she gets upset that I paid.

(2) she messages ALL THE TIME. Every day. To share the weather. How annoying the lady in line is. That she’s hungry. Every. Day. I’m the opposite - I’ll end up in hospital and only mention it in passing a week later. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’ll initiate some rants and silly conversations, and message her all day every day for weeks and weeks in a row. But I also need space. I don’t like people getting too close or attached, especially people like her who over read and over advise and get so emotionally involved... when they do get too attached I automatically need to withdraw and recreate a bit of that buffer. She takes that as I’ve has a major life crisis that I haven’t told her about, and I need to exaggerate circumstances to justify myself so she doesn’t get upset that I don’t want to share with her.

These past few weeks I’ve been feeling resentful, my attitude had been especially sarcastic (my true, unfiltered self - which I generally need to monitor around people like her who get upset), distant, finding silly messages irritating, and the friendship is feeling very forced and one sided (her being the only side)... I’ve stopped replying to her and turned off my whatsapp read receipts in hopes of giving her the hint... but nope, still sending me completely useless things (+one message asking if I’m ok and that I seem off) every day. Every single day... with me not replying to any of them. Yet still replying almost immediately on our mutual groups chats. 

I love her and don’t want to drop such a deep and meaningful friendship... but idk what to do. Help???",10Jul2019,1

FF 4 years later and I’m hating every minute I’m around her. From the borderline abusive way she communicates to the “honeymoon” period after a fight that makes things seem ok, which they never are and the lack of motivation for anything. Things around her are always messy/disgusting and hasn’t held a job since, a long time. I have always fronted 100% of all of the bills which didn’t bother me until we fell apart. Now we’ve got a child together and I feel more and more as if I’ve made a mistake either with choosing my wife, or choosing to have a baby to begin with. My heart sinks when I see a mom out at the store with 3 kids because she’s a powerhouse of motherly energy and I’m envious she’s so strong.

474,"Hi. So like the title says, my friend (let’s call him griffin) continues to post mean-spirited things about me through Snapchat to his story.  Warning, petty teenage drama coming up:

There’s this new trend going on with this app called Yolo, where basically people can send in questions/statements to your Snapchat account anonymously.  The trend is that the account owner post a question, in this case “Give me a name and I’ll be 100% honest about them” and then people can swipe up, give a name, and then he will get notified and post about them.  

So last night I go to bed early because I wasn’t feeling well, and woke up about an hour ago for work.  As I’m sitting in my car waiting for my coworkers to show up, I decided to go through Snapchat.  I read what he posts about people, all of them really nice, and then I see my name.  He posts about how I can be an asshole from hell, constantly ruining friendships, and not a good person to be around.

This is the 5th time he’s posted about me on Snapchat via this ‘YOLO’ trend and every time he does I ask him to take it down because I don’t want my name out there, and I also don’t want people saying negative things about me on social media.  I then get the response, “someone swiped up and asked so I had to be honest” or some other bs response.

So what do I do Reddit?  His posts make me out to be some type of villain, while in reality he always plays victim when he gets called out for the fights he starts.  The start of last year he called me and my other friend (let’s call him Greg because he’ll actually be relevant to the story) his brothers and best friends.  We went throughout half of the year on pretty rocky territory (I was cheated on and dumped by an emotional ex and needed support, and he told me ‘I don’t want to take sides’) and then shit hit the fan at the beginning of this year. 
  I had a small crush on a girl, let’s call her K.  It was one of those passing things, but it was whatever.  Well Greg apparently had one also, and basically replaced me for her at our lunch table. Well a month or so down the line, Griffin asks me “hey Tordab, who do you like?” I told him I really didn’t like anyone that much, but he knew I was lying. After he continued to press me, I caved and said I had a small crush on K, but it wasn’t a big deal and it would go away because I knew Greg was getting serious with her.  

So what did griffin do?  Straight away told Greg.  His reasoning was, “I didn’t want to lie to my friend”.

That caused a major division in our friendship because I couldn’t trust him, but more stuff happened down the line that didn’t help.  Greg and K, Griffin and his girlfriend Rebeca, and other various couples could not contain their PDA in our drama club. Everywhere you go couples would be making out, and everyone was sick of it.  Our director acknowledged it was there but otherwise did nothing to stop it.

So people looked to me to say something, which I did.  I would just say, “Hey a lot of us aren’t really comfortable with you guys making out constantly, could you guys keep it on the DL?” To which they responded no and continued to do it more and more, in their words ‘just to spite me’.

Summer was supposed to be a good time to get away, but not so much. We reached out to one another to repair our friendship, and we played on a Minecraft server for our drama club, in which he was the owner.  One day I went to his house to give him stuff, but he instantly kicked/banned me for a day under the guise of ‘trying to steal his stuff’.  This was the tipping point because beforehand he would treat me badly, so I decided ‘fuck it’ and told him my mind.  My angry demeanor turned to one of a civil discussion, where I told him some solutions to make the server a fun place where everyone would enjoy it.  However, he took none of these solutions and played the victim card, saying that “since nobody wants to play my way nobody gets to play”.  We have spoken one time after that, where he sent me one of those, “I want to bring back our friendship and let bygones be bygones, even though everything was your fault because you are immature” type texts


Then he posted the aforementioned post. 

So what do I do?  I know these people treat me like shit and like garbage, but as we go into our senior year I was hoping to have a peaceful one but I feel like it’s already falling apart.  I would try and find another friendgroup, but the tough thing is that our drama club is so small, everyone knows everything and I feel my reputation has already been pretty tarnished by them.",10Jul2019,2

476,"Hello all, 

First time poster so if i do anything wrong please let me know. Bare with its a long one. 

The story itself is very long so I will be concise, I'm a 23M working in the R&amp;D department for a big company where I've been working for a shade over a year now, I like my job, no day is ever the same and my team are good fun to work with. As a fairly new recruit I occasionally get loaned out to other departments to gain expereince, it helps me sympathise with the start to end cycle of our products; in my time here I've been loaned out to mechanical design, software, quality assurance, sales and contracted testing all with reasonable success. Earlier this year I was loaned out to manufacture, I won't go into details but I was basically abandoned to build something with no experience in the area, no instructions, help or guidance and struggled through for a bit before someone else was hauled in to do the build while I shadowed (which was what should have happened in the first place). Needless to say I was glad to go back to my department. 

On the Monday just gone I was loaned back to them with some reasonable notice despite being in the middle of an interesting and highly profitable research project right now, but they need the man power and my boss thinks it will be good experience. Unfortunately the Saturday just gone (before going back on loan) I went on a hike and hurt my ankle, the issue got progressively worse and a friend of mine, who is a doctor, suspected that it was a nasty sprain and I should keep weight off it for the next two weeks or so and avoid strenuous activity for six weeks. 

So I'd been with manufacture for a total of one day (on my feet all day which almost certainly worsened matters and I was dropped into a similar scenario as before with them because they can't afford the man power to assist me), yesterday my foot wouldn't fit into my shoe because of swelling so I had the day off and today I managed to get myself in (just) but there was no chance of me going back to manufacture for at least six weeks as the building process is strenuous and I can't stand up all day to do it. I dropped effortlessly into my old research project and explained the situation to my boss and the head of manufacture. 

Its no secret I had a miserable time with manufacture last time around and its an unfortunate coincidence that I sprained my ankle so early into my loan period with them, the fact I got back into work today was a show of willing to still do some work despite my injury but in retrospect its come across as if I'm faking an injury to get out of it and there's some level of resent. 

What do i do to make people take me seriously? What can i do to avoid going back to manufacture and pretty much guaranteeing a fracture or break? Did I come back to work too soon? I don't know what to do..",10Jul2019,2

480," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

485,"I will be starting a new job in a couple of weeks and have recently learned that a colleague who I worked with in another department has also  joined the team. 

For brevities sake, I will simply say that this colleague harassed me and lied about me to try and get information from my previous manager about my contract. She saw me as competition from the day she walked in the door and tried to play games to “win” this competition. Luckily, the rest of my team, including the manager, caught on. Her contract wasn’t renewed and I sighed a big sigh of relief. Until now, that is.

I am scheduled to go through a training session with her and I’m struggling with whether I should ask my boss to switch me to a different session. I don’t want to disclose any specifics to my manager until I have been on the team for a while, we develop a good relationship, and only then if something occurs.

However, given the history I have with this colleague, I do have reason to believe she will be dishonest, domineering, and manipulative. She is someone who truly believes her own lies and truth and I’m quite keen to keep distance from her. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if she started to paint me as the one harassing her. I am sure she’s convinced herself that I found out she got a job on this team and followed her there. The idea of sharing a training session with her makes me ill with anxiety. I am not assertive by nature and I struggle with this kind of bully/victim dynamic, though it is something I am actively working on.

A friend suggested I convey that I worked with her previously and that it would be great for networking with the new department if I joined a different session, but my partner thinks this approach is not honest and I’ll be flagging myself as the problem person the day I walk in the door.

Obviously I don’t have an objective perspective here. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Or have any advice on whether its best to ignore for now or if I should take initiative before it becomes a problem? What would you do? What do you think a manager would appreciate the most?",10Jul2019,1
486,"I don’t really know what to say, I know my story is crazy and you’ll be (maybe) wondering why I’m not at a police station, but here it is:

1.	Why
In the everyday life, people see me as a crazy happy go lucky guy, but still very nice to people. I had great friends who really liked me and a girlfriend to, but all went to shit after one incident. To give some reasoning (not sure if I can call it that and I know the following will sound poetic but just read), my heart and body houses years of intense rage and anger combined with sadness and depression. It was destroying me from the inside because I didn’t know how to express it, so I just kept it. 

2.	The “berserk” accident
So, it was a normal night, playing video games and texting occasionally to my girlfriend when all of a sudden, she texted me: “don’t talk to me anymore”. I was confused so I asked why that one of my friend told her I liked another girl. I DID like another girl, but the only thing I did was confessing my feelings for her but leaving it at that and only be friends. I tried to explain it to her but wouldn’t listen. So, I was there, alone, betrayed by one of my “friend”. The next morning, there was school, but not knowing who was responsible only fueled my rage and I attacked the “friend” I thought logically could have tell her, the boyfriend of the girl I talked earlier. I was in berserk mode, a blind rage, and started beating him up. Is girlfriend tried to stop me but I just hit her and brutally pushed her aside. The others also tried to stop me but it took two adult to restrain me (I’m 16). This is what the principal told me and later showed me on camera doing exactly this.

3.	The aftermath
The boyfriend was taken to hospital; he was bleeding but I didn’t know the extent of the damage, is girlfriend was also bleeding but not taken to the hospital, I injured (light injuries) at least 3 people (2 “friend” and 1 adult). I was suspended from school for an unknown amount of time and I’m on watch until the police decide what to do with me. I refused every call from family and isolated myself from everyone.

488,"Like the title says, I’m having scalp and hair problems and I have no idea what to do. Psoriasis runs in my family, and I’m pretty sure that’s what the dry flaky patches are. I’ve seen other women in my family struggle with it unsuccessfully and when I developed it, I basically just came to terms with it. But any helpful tips would be awesome. 

Greasy hair (very quickly. After a day usually.) is my bigger problem. My hair is very fine and very thin (really good hair genes I’ve got obviously). I’ve tried everything I can, including:

-washing infrequently. I wash my hair 1-2, occasionally 3 times a week consistently for the last 7 years. This hasn’t improved anything. Before that I washed daily, so my hair was never greasy as long as I washed daily. Any second day without washing it would become greasy. 

-dry shampoo. It’s possible I’m not applying it correctly, but it seems to make my hair even greasier, regardless of heavier or lighter application. Advice on this welcome as well. 

-wash pillow cases, weekly. 

-avoid conditioning scalp 

-various shampoos and conditioners, some store brand, some salon brand, some recommended by my stylist after talking to her about this issue. The result is the same regardless and after spending so much on salon shampoos and conditioners, I’ve gone back to using garnier fructis. Most salon products were too heavy and I’d be greasy right out of the shower. 

-my hair is color treated, but that is very new, within the last year. It hasn’t gotten worse, just maintained, At least when it’s colorful, people tend to notice the color and nothing else. 

-haven’t tried any kind of oil because frankly, the thought of putting *more* oil seems counterintuitive. But willing to try any oil suggestions. 

I’m really at my wit’s end with all this. I have no idea what to do. I suppose I could just go back to washing daily, but my hair is long and it’s such a pain to wash daily. The lower end of my hair seems to respond well to infrequent washes, but anything above my ears honestly just looks dirty right away. It’s so embarrassing. I’d love any advice.",10Jul2019,4
489,"A good friend and the friend of a goodfriend and I were planning on going on a trip. We want to visit a good friend. (I dont want to name the country). We have already bought the tickets and made hotel reservations. However 2 months before the trip my good friends visa got denied to the country. Only mine and the other friends visa got granted. The other guy doesn't want to travel again and and my good friend also says that we should cancel the flight. 
They don't mind losing 900+ dollars but my parents were telling me that I should still travel alone.
They said I would be stupid to cancel the flight and get nothing back and that things don't work out the way they should. 
My 2 friends are planning a new trip and are planning to spend 400+ dollars to visit a country where you don't need any visa.
I told my parents that and we almost got into a huge fight because I wanted to do the same thing. They said they would never give me money again if I  dont fly. They also said my friend could easily try to get a visa again but he doesn't(which is true). 
I was begging them to let me go on a trip and support me they said I am being unreasonable and selfish.

I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty.

496,"Throw away account because my boyfriend uses Reddit often.  


Some back story:   
My boyfriend(33M) and I(23F) have been together for roughly 6 years, lived together for 5. At the very beginning of our friendship, he had an extremely well paying job that fueled his charismatic, personable, and ambitious attitude. As much as he complained about his job, I could tell he enjoyed it by the way he talked about maximizing his profits and silly anecdotes about his coworkers and clients. However, he started to arrive later and later into his office which eventually led to him being fired. He blamed it on his severe ADHD (yes, he was diagnosed by a doctor) and explained to me, as well as his other peers that his higher-ups should have worked around his mental illness.  


Now that his money is lost, he is a big hot mess. It's been about two years since he has been employed with said company and he has developed a severe gaming addiction. He spends easily 6 hours a day in front of his computer. There was one incident where I found him chatting up with other women on his Facebook with the intent of meeting up and courting them. He blames his ADHD, severe depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (YES, all diagnosed by the VA) on both the intent to cheat and the addiction. He is a veteran collecting disability, eating through his savings, and I chip in my half of bills to make ends meet. After selling all of his most valuable possessions (aside from his expensive gaming setup), I decided to take on more bills to ensure he is okay financially.  


Him talking to other women, his lack of desire to spend time with me, excuses to find a job, and me bearing the extra responsibility of taking care of him, buying him food, managing the house, and try to be there emotionally has taken a toll on my mental health and my self-esteem significantly. My undying loyalty that I was once proud of is now my biggest weakness. I have strived to be there for him and support him emotionally and financially but only to be felt like all this effort was in vain. I know I am enabling him by supporting him so much, but I don't know what to do other than that.  


We've moved past the cheating, he has been diligent to reassure me it won't happen again. But it still, it irks me to know that I wasn't/am not good enough for him to be in a monogamous relationship with me.   


I do love him and I'd rather stick with him to see him overcome this, but now I'm debating whether or not me leaving him would be the best for both of us. Please, any advice would help.",10Jul2019,0

498,"So basically over a year ago (probably around beginnings of June) I was flirting with this girl, she is pretty cute and everything. We really never got around to go out on a date, however, we did spend a lot of time talking when we had mutual activities. One night, when the flirting got to its peak, we both sexted. The next day, I felt really I MEAN REALLY bad, I felt it was inmoral, it was stupid and i had just done something disgusting. So I decided to stay away from this girl because I felt that I had done bad. This was probably a mistake, because I might have made her feel used or something, but to be honest I was also very mad at myself for letting this get too carried away.

One year passes, I am in a 5 month relationship with this other girl, which I treat with a lot of respect and, to be honest, am very happy with her. Turns out just yesterday (over a year has passed) this girl’s mom called my parents and told her what happened. I talked with them for several hours, they told me how disappointed they were at me, how this goes against all the principals that they wanted to teach me etc etc
I also told them my side of the story as I felt some parts were exaggerated making it seem like this was 100% my fault, which I think isn’t.

Anyway, my problem now is that Im very scared this problem might interfere with my relationship. My girlfriend means a lot to me, I regret deeply what I did and will never happen again. But this happened before I even met her (Btw my girlfriend does not know about this problem, Sunday will be 1 year anniversary of when we first met) 

Should I apologize to this girl’s mom? Should I just not say anything because it might get worse? I definitely plan on telling my girlfriend, just not right now as we recently got into a big fight and everything is starting to heal.",10Jul2019,0

500,"Little backstory. I am a Wildlife Control Operator in the USA, Virginia to be exact. For those who don't know what that is--I am the person you call when a wild animal is somewhere it's not supposed to be (usually things like bats/snakes/squirrels in houses). 

It is a super small company, I am talking 4 full time employees. I am the newest. The company owner lives out of state and the other two employees are dating/practically married.

Since I was originally interviewed over the phone back in November I have said I am free any day/time but Friday night (specifically the on call shift from 6pm to 9am Saturday). I maintained that all throughout my training and it still hasn't changed. 

The way on our call works is we all take a week 'On' and a week 'Off'. Meaning on weeks from 6pm to 9am every night Sunday-Sunday you are supposed to be available to take emergency calls. 9am to 6pm are regular working hours. 

My taking off every Friday has recently become an issue. Supervisors will text me Friday after 6 with a client and then follow it with, oh wait you're busy. They have not done this until recently. They also have started acting like they 'forget' I'm not on call Friday and want me to keep reminding them Friday at 6... Which I am willing to do but it seems incredibly passive aggressive to me.

Now it seems like my direct supervisor wants to have a talk about my on call 'stuff' as he put it. Should I stand my ground on this or am I being a jerk? 

Extra maybe helpful info:

1. The employees who are together get the same on call week. Meaning I am every other week and not every third. I don't know how they divide calls up at their house but its still just every other week for two people.

2. I have never indicated this was a temporary scheduling conflict. It has never been a problem until now.

3. They recently found out what it is I do Friday nights as in a moment of stupidity I thought I could share the information as we were all kind of talking about the stuff. I play D&amp;D.

4. I run D&amp;D for a group of 6 other adults (2 work retail, 1 works on call for an electronic repair company, 1 has their own business, 1 is a career firefighter and the last works a 9-5) and all of them have Friday nights off all the time with no hassle.

5. The company is fantastic and continues to be in spite of this rough patch. They are super flexible and have gone way above and beyond what anyone would expect of their employer.

6. I have offered numerous times to take a day (Mon-Thurs) that I am /always/ on call to make up for /never/ on call Friday. No one ever gets back to me.",10Jul2019,2

504,"A little back story... 

My mother (42 now) was married once before to my father that resulted in me and my brother being born. They then got a divorce many many years ago. (When I was 5 am now 18)

My mother then remarried to a very nice man who takes very good care of all of us. 

So back to the present...

My mother has been married for 10 years, and in that 10 years there has been 2 conflicts one happened 3 years ago, she was talking to another man and sending him very risky photos. My stepfather let it go and moved on. 

The second conflict is happening right now and is ongoing, (she is visiting her hometown where she was born) she has been talking to a guy who is in his late 20s who has a kid and a girlfriend. My stepfather does not want my mother talking him because he is a very sexual man and does whatever he wants. He ended up slapping my mothers ass one night when she was out and my mother told me and specifically told me not to tell my step father. 

A couple days later me and my mother got in an argument because she was being very suspicious the night before, in this argument I told her that she has to tell my step father what happened that night when the guy slapped her ass. She went over the moon mad at me and still wont talk to me (it has been over a week) 
She ended up telling my stepfather finally. He was glad that I made her tell him and he forgave her. He has tried talking to her since this happened and he only gets one word answers or the sorry cant talk. She then finally called him and she told him that she dosent want him coming here to visit her family (her family loves my stepdad) she dosent want the awkwardness when he comes. Sue says he us possessive and controlling when all he wants is the best for her, he has given her everything she has ever asked for. She is threatening to never come back home where she lives now, she is making my stepdad miserable. All she does is use his money and dosent understand money dosent grow on trees. She is treating everyone who loves and cares for her like shit. She thinks everyone is against her and wants her to be miserable. 

She is ripping apart my family I do not want to go through another divorce and I told my stepdad if she puts me through another I will never speak to her again for the way she has treated us. 

Few other little details 
She kicked me out of a family event for no good reason
She told me to go fuck myself when I'm her only daughter and we have been very close the past year

508,"A little background: My wife grew up in a well accomodated family. Her sister has always been difficult, she always disaproves my wife's life decisions, they never got along since they were kids. Specially now that we are all 30+ years, it has been getting worse, i think it's because my SIL dropped out from like 4 careers, and hasn't been able to stay in one job in years, as an employee or her own entrepreneurships, there's always something she doesn't like. She's not married or have kids, still lives with dad. I can understand she has some frustration or something bothers her.

We currently have been living 6+ years in another country, because of work. Our son was born here, he is 3 years old. And we visit our family 2 times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, during a phone call she tells my wife that she didn't like the way our son talks, mannerisms, different words, etc, that in this country are used correctly, but not so used in our home country. Here he goes to kindergarten, as he should, so it is natural that he speaks like the way they speak here. Says that we should be grateful because everyone in the family thinks that way, but she is the only one that is telling us.

That when we return to our country, we should put him in one of the best schools (that we can´t afford), so people don't think that he comes from a ""lesser family"" (that's my translation to the concept, you can tell english is not my first language hehe). That we should talk and correct him, so he talks the way we talk in our home country, because he comes from a good family, and that we should maintain the kind of life they had growing up, which we know we just can't (and we don't care, we are very happy). But for her it is terrible, i mean you can tell she is not caring for my son, but for how this ""would look"".

509,"I am apparently mentally fucked beyond explanation. I am diagnosed psychotic. I have done therapy, meds, supplements, countless tests, etc etc etc. I have done literally everything in the fucking book to get better and I am only getting worse. This is a brief summary of my symptoms:

 

\-depression

\-ocd

\-extreme, constant anxiety

\-very irritable

\-constant brain fog, sometimes just feel totally brain dead for hours after waking up. water, caffeine, food, exercise, etc don't help.

\-always tired no matter how many hours of sleep

\-hallucinations (they're kind of rare but definitely happen from time to time)

\-delusions, esp Cotard's delusion which is a rare disorder in which you truly believe you/people around you are either dead or in the process of dying/rotting away. It's absolutely fucking horrifying.

\-can't concentrate to save my life

\-weird memory issues, like sometimes I'll be driving on a very familiar road that I've driven on literally hundreds of times over many years and then suddenly, I'm like, ""where am I??? How did I even get here??"" It can last from just a few seconds to a minute or two. It's not like I'm old or have alzheimers or something, I'm only 25 and don't have like any sort of intellectual disability.

\-sometimes have this weird awful feeling of absolute dread waking up. It's not really anxiety. I don't know how to describe it. It's one of the worst feelings I've ever felt in my life. It's like the feeling you would get after something really truly horrible has just happened and you just feel nothing but total despair and hopelessness. It lasts for about an hour or two after waking up and I cry a lot and then usually I feel pretty normal 1-3 hours after.

&amp;#x200B;

These symptoms control and have destroyed my life. No explanation as to what causes them. As one last desperate ditch effort to figure out what could be the problem, I did a sleep study, a sleep apnea test. I had been reading about how sleep apnea can cause horrible symptoms like mine and how people who start treatment for it feel a world of difference. I was crying reading these happy stories of people whos lives had changed after starting to use a cpap machine. I was so desperately hopefully that this could be my answer. Today, I recieved the results of my sleep study that everything was totally normal. There is still no answer and this means there will be no hope of using a cpap machine to potentially turn my life around. Once again, my hopes of living a healthier happier life have been destroyed. I have no idea what the fuck to do. I cannot find the cause of my severe mental illness. Is it possible I was born severely brain damaged and this is just the way it has to be? What else is there left to do? What about a brain scan? That's the only thing left i can think of. Can a brain scan help people with seemingly untreatable mental illness?",10Jul2019,0
510,"It's all about genetics and the way i was adopted. Nature and nurture. They have determined the mess i am today. My parents are incapable, ignorant, weak, poor, mentally ubstable and useless and i have aquired all of these traits from them. Of course i am a bit smarter than them hopefully. I used to be an elite student in school and college but after a while i have totally lost all of my determination and hope. I can't focus on studying anymore because firstly i feel that my iq has dropped and secondly i know that it's gonna be useless. I doubt that i can get a job or the job i deserve after finishing the college and even if i do i wouldn't have the energy and skills required for it. So currently my only hope is getting a simple and linear job that requires almost no skills. My family has nothing to offer except making me more hopless and angry. The only worthy material thing they have is a household which is a mess on its own but the land is expensive. It could worth a few millions of dollars. But as long as they are alive i doubt that they would sell it. But besides that they have nothing else. My father rarely works these days and my mom is nothing and they are living like rats to be honest. I am just getting  scholarship from the university and i would have a job if i don't mess everything up but i am not satisfied by these kind of jobs and i am pretty sure that i can't put ebough energy and effort in it to be successful. I just want to give up. I always want to spend my time playing games, going out, eating and sleeping rather than studying and working. I feel that my mind has become dull, I have a weak determination and i don't want to work or take any responsibility. I have lost my morality and passion. I can't just do it and i accuse my parents for this condition. They couldn't just adopt me in the right way and they have left nothing for me to count on. I can't think of a bright future for myself. In other words i am losing my ability to cope with the environment and as the scientists say, the organisms which are unable to cope with the environment couldn't survive and are doomed to death and destruction. It's the process of natural selection. I am slowly losing my compatibility with the conditions around me and it would get to the point that i would no longer be able to function and make decisions and i would starve to death. I have no motivation. I feel sick. So what about putting an end to this on my own before it comes to me? I know that i don't deserve to live if things don't change for me. I am just waiting for my inevitable fate and tolerating all of this anxiety and depression. Death is the best option for me now. I know that i would never be a correctly functioning independent human and being dead is better than living such a mysery. But i want a painless death. I don't want to take any more pain even for a second. I am tired of it  I just have to admit that i hate my family and also hate the situation around me.

* I've been just internet searching answers for my summer class rather than actually doing the work.
* I constantly obsess over others and their lives', how they're better than me, how I'm missing out, and how I wish I was doing something other than what I'm doing. If I hear someone's in France, I wish I was there instead of here, etc.

* I can be at the best place on earth and still be incapable of letting loose and enjoying myself.
* I over-analyze everything in this universe, especially myself and my actions.",10Jul2019,1
514,"So me and let’s just call her Emma first met at university about a month before school let out for the summer. Everything was going great. We studied together, went on dates, and did stuff physically except sex. Emma also wouldn’t let me do anything below the waist on her because we technically weren’t dating yet and she is super against just hook ups. 

But during this time she didn’t want me to tell people that we were seeing each other because a senior in my fraternity tried and failed to date her and she didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I don’t know if this is just odd to me but Emma is the type of girl where a guy can try to cuff for months and, if she’s not interested, is not afraid to reject them every single time. That’s why when I first got to kiss her I saw that as a huge win in my book and knew I wasn’t getting friend zoned.

Anyways fast forward to the end of the school year. We both know that the long distance is going to suck and tried to find a best way to approach it for the both of us. I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive around a week before school let out and surprisingly...she said no. Which was odd to me at first considering this girl is super against hookups. Even drunk at a party—this girl will not hookup with you if you’re not dating her. Emma’s reasoning for this is that she said that she didn’t want to feel like we were obligated to talk to each other over summer. She said that if feelings fade it will be natural and we can hopefully start again next semester. Which I guess makes sense to me since I also didn’t want to have a forced conversation to stay in touch. I trusted that the reason she didn’t want to be exclusive was for this fact only and not cause she was going to see other people.

Start of summer everything was fine. We were texting everyday and facetiming whenever we got a chance. This went on for about a month until her internship started. Then things started to get a little more busy and she didn’t have that much time to call anymore. We went from around calling 3-4 times a week to calling 1-2 times a week. (Also some very important information I left out: there is a 15 hour time difference between us). Partially because I was more free, I started to put in a lot more effort to not lose her. (I.e. waking up at 6am to talk to her). I didn’t mind this that much as long as she was happy with talking to me. One day we plan to come back to school early. She has to fly into nyc so I said I’ll meet her there and we decided to stay there for a day together and drive back to campus together. 

*I’m just going to include this brief anecdote cause idk if it’s important or not. But there was a time during the first month of summer when she posted on her finsta a joke about her being single and I got mad cause I didn’t think how she was able to say that she was single even though we were still talking at the time. When I told her about this she said she didn’t mean it like that and that she knows that we have a “thing” but isn’t going say we are dating cause technically we are not. We had another similar argument about this later on because she is very serious about the dating label.*

Anyways back to the story. I end up booking us a hotel room for one night in nyc and everything is cool. We go on calling for around 1-2 times a week but still texting everyday. However with her internship and the 15 hour time difference, things are getting harder. 

Around a week ago things started not to seem right. She was being very “bleh” with her texts and whenever I asked her if she was free to call she was usually out but wouldn’t suggest a different time. I just let this go since I knew she was busy.

About 2 days ago this “bleh” stuff is still going on and I decide to talk to her about the hotel in nyc. (Something minor like about the booking). When I bring this up she tells me that she might not want to stay with me in the hotel room. I got super hurt by this because I am taking a 5 hour detour from my normal route to school to see her in the city and now she’s saying she didn’t want to stay with me. She said she might feel uncomfortable sharing a room with me. At first I got mad then I realized that I guess it might be a little uncomfortable when we first see each other since we’ve been apart for a while—let alone sleep in the same bed together. Regardless I felt really hurt.

We had a rough conversation about this and during this talk she says that her feelings for me have been starting to fade. This kind of came out of the blue for me and really hurt. My last relationship I was in was very one sided from my end and I was scared it was going to happen again. Emma said that it was natural for feelings to fade  but it didn’t seem like there was anything we could do to stop it and we should just try to revive it when we see each other again. From there I decided that I couldn’t do another one sided thing because my feelings for her were still the same. So I told her that I think that we should talk for a little bit. At least until we are closer to when school starts or her feelings change.

So that’s where I’m at now. Laying in bed sad cause I’m not talking to her and knowing that her feeling for me are fading and there’s nothing I can do about it. Is this no talking thing a bad idea on my part? I feel like I couldn’t talk to her the same way if I knew that she didn’t like me that much anymore and I still like her. I don’t know what to do.


TL;DR: meet girl month before school ends. She tells me her feelings are fading over long distance. I get sad and don’t wanna talk to her anymore because I don’t want to be in a one sided thing.",10Jul2019,1
515,"I'm going to just free - flow what's on my mind right now. I just feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do going forward.

The most pressing issues are two different things that are related to each other. As my title says, I'm employed at a job I like, a job I like doing, but it is low paying, I'm unappreciated, I have no chance of advancement and I'm homeless.. technically. I've adopted what people call ""van life"" now, not really because I saw van life videos and all that stuff, but out of necessity. I have a business degree, and small-ish student loan debt ($35k), auto loan from a bad car deal that I rolled into a new loan for this van, and about $15k in personal loans that are from consolidating stupid credit card debt (part of which was a legal fee, more on that soon maybe). The issue with all of this is that stupid job, it barely pays for all of that, and I want to pay off my debt so I can get an apartment. I don't know why, but I feel bad about leaving this job. I like the job itself for some reason (retail pharmacy work) and I like the people who I work with... except one person (not my boss). It's weird though.. I feel like my boss doesn't appreciate the work I do, and has given up on helping me grow in my role and move up with the company. Even with all that, I still like the work I do and the people I work with, even if they don't feel the same.

My second biggest issue is another multifaceted issue. I've been depressed for a few years, single for many years, overweight most of my life, and doubting myself that any of this will change. I know all of this ties itself together, just fixing one thing will start fixing another and that will make all the other things better and fix itself. I know getting my weight down will help my depression, and help my confidence which itself will help me find someone to be with, but I feel like it's pointless to start doing anything now in light of all the other issues in my life. I feel that I can't get my weight down because I can't cook anything healthy at all. I don't have any refrigeration, and I can't make too many things at a time. I use camping equipment (like propane grill and stuff like that) so I can't really cook things besides ramen, which isn't that healthy.

With all of this, I just don't have a plan to go forward. All my plan consists of is just paying off my debt, but that's it. I just don't know what to do or have anyone to talk to about any of this. I feel like I'm alone and can't figure this out.",10Jul2019,1

518,"I’m 27 and still don’t have my driver’s license. 

The first time I drove (at 15) I totaled the car, and it scared me enough that I was terrified to learn to drive. I tried, mostly out of guilt/fear of being left behind by my peers, but it was hard to motivate myself to get behind the wheel of what I thought of as a death machine. I failed my drivers test several times. Luckily I live in a place with good public transportation, so I was able to get around fine without a car and eventually  stopped trying to learn.

Now that my wife and I are looking into buying a house farther from public transportation and having kids, I’ve prioritized learning to drive and my wife’s been teaching me for the past year. However, she’s truly terrified every time I get behind the wheel, and I can’t blame her. I have an extremely slow reaction time and I struggle focusing on more than one thing at once (like staying in my lane while maintaining my speed/navigating).

I’m struggling with the question of whether I should keep trying or not. On the one hand, I feel awful that my wife’s always the one driving on long car trips, and I want to be able to drive our kids around in a few years. On the other hand, I feel like I could kill myself and my wife just by trying to learn. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming this?",10Jul2019,5
519," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",10Jul2019,0
520,"So me and this girl started talking 2 weeks ago, I met her through my friend which she was originally gonna date, then she left him and started flirting with me on the same day. From that point on she stole my heart with how gorgeous she was, she was funny, had a cute laugh, and is a professional swimmer. I thought it was too good to be true, so I told her about my career, since I haven’t done so good in school, and am unemployed rn. She sounded fine with it, in fact she acknowledged it and said she would help me get through it. But this girl is one of the most confusing girls I’ve ever met in my life. She’s constantly bringing up her ex boyfriend and the bad things he did too her which makes me feel really bad for her, she says it’s been 5 months since she’s dated someone, and she said her longest relationship was 6 months. We’ve been FaceTiming almost every night now, even when I tell her I’m at a friends she still would constantly text and call me, which I was fine with bc/ I love the attention since that could mean she likes spending her time w/ me. Ik it might sound weird but we even fell asleep together on FaceTime which we both were fine with it, and we both actually enjoyed it. It has now been Barley over 2 weeks and technically we’re not really dating yet, but she tells people we are all the time, I’ve still yet to ask her out in person but she’s always *busy* with swim and travels states which I believe her since she’s shown me videos of her competitions and her stacks of rewards. She had asked me to turn location on with Snapchat, she said she would do the same so we could see where we were both at. She lives about 10-15 min away driving distance and I always tell her I could take my bike there which would only take me about 40-50 min which I don’t mind. But she always says no and if I do it she’ll be mad at me, bc/ she doesn’t want anything happening to me. Yesterday we had a chance where we could’ve met each other, I had noticed I jus so happen to be near a public pool area she was at, My mom had been driving me around looking for houses for sale. I quickly txted her and told her I was near and that I could make it too the pool and she replied with No, so then I told my mom that and she turned back around to resume our house shopping. Then she texted me and said come back, my friend took my phone and typed No. On that same day she had been really quiet with me, we usually txted back and forth frequently but then she started leaving me on read, and called me later in the day to tell me some story funny story which didn’t really matter, then told me she would text and call later. I then waited as the next 2-3 hours passed by I then decided to call her only to be instantly declined, and left with no response of why she declined the call. I then checked the snap map to see if she was busy at some swim meet, or not home. Only to find out she had turned her location off on the same day, later that night I asked if she wanted to FaceTime, and she said “maybe ya” I then waited about 2 hours until it was 7-7:30 then i asked her if she wanted to FaceTime or not and she had told me “ I’m already one FaceTime with someone rn”.  Normally I wouldn’t really care since it’s her business, but I’m just surprised that she didn’t try an call me first or anything since she had been isolating me all day. I then started getting anxious and worried if she is a hoe or not, bc/ she has a lot of traits where she seems like such a great hard working dedicated  person. But then she’d also talk to a bunch of random guys all the time who creep on her, she tells me stories all the time of what guys send her and what they say to her. But instead of blocking them she messes around with them and apparently sends them pics of me telling them I’m her bf, even though she has never actually shown me her doing this. I jus would honestly think normally people would jus block the weirdos like this. I’m having a hard time with this girl bc/ she’s told me so many * secrets* and has gained so much trust from me, now all she does is leave me on read and doesn’t want me knowing what she’s doing, even last night I asked her “ where you been?” And she replied “ Idk”. I don’t know what to say anymore and I’m going through hell trying to think of what I can do, so I waited till this morning to simply say Goodmorning, and normally she’d reply but I was just left on read again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Info:**

It all started 2 years ago. It was at the time i left islam, i was really depressed and i hated life. I never told my family and had a lot of problems.

The first brother, lets call him mr17. Mr17 confessed to me and i said yes and we started to go out **SECRETLY** because I was born into a religious family (muslims) and they will never let me date. Then after around 5 months, his younger brother(mr16) asked me out and i again said yes, because idk i was just playing around. I knew it was wrong, i dont like any of them even though i know they are both serious. So i started dating mr16 too.

Those two brothers arent close at all, in fact they dont even talk to each other. Their parents divorced and each of them took 1 of the brother. Mr 17 lives with his father, while mr16 with his mother. Thats why it was so easy to date both of them.

So, around 6 months ago, when i became 16, me and mr 17 had sex. We started having sex sometimes. With condoms of course.

Then 2 weeks ago i had sex with mr16 too. I didnt want it to be honest but he was asking me and hinting that he wanted it for a long time and i just did it having in my mind ''have fun''.

Anyways, they both are happy and they really are in love with me, they even talk about how they BOTH want to move out and dream about living with me in one house, they want to study in the same college as me in the future. They even planning and thinking of our future. They are serious.

Anyways, i kind of want to tell them the truth but idk how or what to do. I am scared of mr17 reaction, he is really the jealous type.

I am still depressed even after 2 years but i am better than before, i guess thats why i want to tell them now.

531,"My boyfriend had been proudly sober for 10 years before he bought a sixpack of beers about a month ago. I wasn't too happy about it, but ultimately recognized he is an adult capable of making his own choices. Since I trust him, and he said it would be a one time thing, it wasn't a big deal. But since then, he has continued to drink. Not every day, but often enough to make alarm bells go off in my head. He isn't being secretive or hiding it, but absolutely downplaying the risk he is taking. He does have it ""under control"" as the saying goes, and his drinking isn't problematic (bottle of wine with a nice dinner, couple of beers at a barbecue, couple of beers at home in the evenings about 3 times a week) -

But his behaviour changes of course when he's drinking, and I'm finding it hard to spend time with him because of this. I don't like him being slightly drunk at all, a) because it worries me and b) because he is so different then. He doesn't get violent or aggressive or any of that stuff, just annoying/exhausting. He talkes a mile a minute, hyperfocuses on every word I say, constantly loses his train of thought and is just overall pretty useless. Conversations with him are almost impossible, he just paces around talking about things that I can't follow (neoliberalism, capitalism, Greek mythology and the odd epiphany in-between yesterday). He also likes to poke fun at me in a gentle, yet hurtful way (""yeah I keep talking because you're not saying anything interesting and I love you, but you're just not on my level"" or ""you wanna go to bed? aww cute. The grownups will stay up though, sorry baby, why do you even come over, am I just a sextoy to you? Just kidding, don't answer that!"" ). He would never talk to me like this when he's sober. 

His family/close friends are not concerned. I was plainly told that I'm not his mummy and need to stop nagging him, that it's perfectly fine when he has a few beers as long as it doesn't become regular/turns to drinking during the day/he doesn't suddenly go back to hard liquor. My reasoning is that it has become regular over the course of the last month even if it's not every day and that I'd much prefer nagging him about it now to nip it in the bud then sending him off to rehab in a few months ... 

How would you progress with this? Everyone tells me it's not interfering with his life and he's not suddenly an alcoholic again, but it's actually interfering with out relationship, day-to-day life (because he will not go to bed before 6 and sleep till noon), and imho his health. He has liver damage from being severely addicted and as far as I understand it, any more alcohol, hard liquor or not, will add to that damage. I want a long life with him ... 

What do I do? Talking about it has not changed his mind. He maintains he's got it under control, doesn't feel compelled to drink and can go just fine without it (which is true), it's just that he says he sees no reason not to drink because he can enjoy it now. Should I make it clear that it's impacting our relationship and me more than he seems to realize, and hope that will make him second guess his actions? Or should I back off and let him handle it however he wants?",10Jul2019,1
532,"I have tried everything I possible can in America.

I have tried: Reese's Pinworm medicine, generic Parantel Pamoate Suspension, IntestinePro, Intestinal Edge, Combantrin (From over seas), apple cider vinegar with water, garlic, papaya seeds, many many natural ways.

Mebendazole use to be in American over the counter medicines but during my researches for a cure to pinworm, they said it can help cure cancer. The drug is now like $600 last time I went to try and get the generic brand prescribed.
I have tried 3 of Reese's medication. 1 bottle recommended usage. After it failed I downed 1 bottle and another one after 2 weeks. It still failed me so I bought a generic bottle with more oz. Overall I didn't get the results I wanted. I clean my butt every night before sleep. Wash regularly.

When the rooms director, FD supervisor, or myself are here; front desk agents and sometimes kitchen staff come into the office to chat.

I was also noticing things in my drawers being moved around, and my brand new office chair (which I sit in for hours a day to work) being adjusted all the time. So, I wrote and laminated a note of sorts and taped it to my monitor when I am not here. It is very direct. Basically clean up after yourself, nothing in my drawers was put there for you, and if you want to sit differently go find a different chair. This was several weeks ago. Since then my chair has been adjusted on occasions when a certain individual (40sM) works. This person is a supervisor for the restaurant. I cannot prove it to be him, but it is him. I thought if I just ignored it, it would stop. At first it would only be low to the ground, or the back would be leaned back.

He is a catty asshole and I know if I bring it up to him he will just deny it, and I have no proof. As for why he would even do it?

I've been living in the same city all of my life, and for the past 2 years since I've graduated HS, I've been at home continously achieving nothing. Nothing has changed. I've no friends. I've no one to love. I crave for affection. I didn't know that this emptiness could be so painful. 

I've studied subjects I'm interested in. I've practiced skills I want to build. But I've availed nothing. I usually write in a journal to reflect and improve on my life, but I can't even think about it anymore without breaking down in tears of disappointment.

I have no money. I want to leave. I'm tired of living like this, and more importantly, I'm scared of what I'll do to myself if I continue without change.

In my mind and I think about the smallest of interactions I’ve had with someone in a critical way. Whenever I try to relax it’s all I can think about but when I try to tell myself it will be okay I just ignore my own thoughts and focus on what’s worrying me. 

Whenever I tell my parents my thoughts they just tell me things like “it’s normal”  or “just don’t think about it” so getting a medical opinion is out of the window.

544,"I accepted a position in late 2018. It is a very technical job, and I was upfront with the manager that I was going to need a lot of training in X area in order to be proficient. He was completely aware of my lack of skill, and assured me I would be trained. 

7 months later, I am drowning. I travel A LOT more than was discussed, and have certainly not been adequately trained for the technical part of the role. My job is customer-facing, so it’s extremely awkward when I’m not capable of solving a problem for them due to my lack of skill. I am a remote employee with a home office. My manager is a 7 hour plane ride away. 

In order to keep afloat, I have been working nights and weekends almost constantly to stay on top of my job and train myself. It’s a terrible quality of life and I’m constantly stressed. I have brought this up to my boss several times with increasing concern each time. He just feigns empathy and says once I’ve gotten more experience, it will be better. 

But I’m finding it unreasonable to continue working this way. I am 25, this is my second professional job, so I’m not sure if this is the norm for high-paying technical roles. However in my previous job, I received training to expert-level competency with products prior to interacting with customers. In this job, I received very minimal training.

546,"My girlfriend (26) and I (24F) have been together for a little over two years. We live together and for the most part things are okay. I enjoy spending time with her and we have our fair share of laughs, but life has been difficult lately. 

My first dog passed away in May because he was left with a neighbor and then escaped and was hit by a car. I’m just now starting to pull myself together. 

I struggle with PTSD, depression, and anxiety related to sexual abuse growing up. I’m currently in therapy and see a psychiatrist occasionally, although I actually tend to be in a better headspace withOUT medication. I like my therapist and she’s pretty helpful, I think. I’ve been seeing her for about 2 years. 

My best friend of several years and I parted ways many months ago because she confessed to having deep feelings for me (that were not romantically reciprocated) and I miss her often. She was one of the few people I felt I could confide in. 

Anyway, I have the ability to work remotely and although I don’t make anything extravagant right now, it’s enough. 

My mom works for the gov. and gets stationed all over the place. I’m always invited. So are my 2 dogs. I’ve missed out on countless countries because I convinced myself it “wasn’t the right time,” “how can I leave my [previous] SO behind - isn’t that selfish?” etc. 

But I’m in a place where I just feel like I need change. The thought of going to Hanoi, Vietnam and being able to explore Singapore, Thailand, and so many more with my mom as she gets older thrills me!....but then I think about my girlfriend. We argue often because I feel like I carry most of the financial weight. She also recently brought home a Pitbull puppy and I wasn’t happy about it. Not because of the breed - I’m a lover of all - but because dogs are expensive, we already have 2, and one just passed and I’m still recovering. Now she wants me to take on the responsibility of paying for everything this puppy needs as long as she “handles” it - whatever that means.

I do love my girlfriend and think she has many great qualities. The thought of her moving forward without me is definitely scary. I have some serious abandonment issues and am constantly thinking to myself that I’ll never find anyone again, nobody will ever love me, etc. But then I think...I’m 24...does love even matter right now? Romantic love, that is. When will I ever get to see the world again with my dogs by my side? I am also a little worried about the flight over to Vietnam since we’d be stopping a few times and I’m pretty sure the flight time alone is around 30 hrs. 

All of that said, I think MAYBE this could be a good thing for me. A way to push myself out of this comfortable, I-want-more-out-of-life bubble I’ve been living in. I’m tired of worrying so much and half tempted to say F it!

Anyway, I’m clearly torn and would love to hear advice from all kinds of people - traveled, untraveled, happy, miserable. What do you think? What would you do with this kind of opportunity? How would your SO come in to play? 

Thank you a ton for reading this and any replies are much appreciated!",10Jul2019,1
547," 

Serious replies only please - Was on the fence on posting this. I've dealt with this most of my life now, but as I get older I hate to admit it's comes to bother me more. My name is Johann, pronounced (yo-hann) my mother was half German hence the name. Other then that, she's half Colombian and my father is full Colombian. I've had many encounters where people call me Juan by accident / I'm assuming for my skin color or because the first letter of my name starts with J. The reason why this conflicts with me is that I usually almost always ignore and just make pretend I didn't hear it. Usually the person either catches them self or just hopes I didn't notice and we move on. I just do so to avoid conflict and I can only imagine would make the person in question feel a lot more uncomfortable then I am. I've had this happen with day to day people to superiors in a office type environment,

I feel people are much more hesitant for example to call someone who is African American a stereotypical name opposed to just calling someone Hispanic Juan? I know comparing apples to oranges, was just a example. I've dealt with this roughly 15/20 times in my life or so, I'd say. This morning actually was one of them with the Director of my company, we just awkwardly made pretend I didn't catch it.

Any one relate? Any advice on how to deal? Or is it best I just continue to ignore it? I will say everyone who has done so has done so without malice. That's why I never call them out on it, cause I know they'd feel much worse and just me confronting them would be awkward overall but as I'm getting older I'm pondering at what price am I paying for this internally if it bothers me so.

548,"There is a very long, complicated and sad story prefacing this but I’m going to keep it at short as possible. Basically, a series of events led me(f)(23) to putting a house in my name for my mother and my three younger siblings. My mother has shitty credit but she has a bit of cash saved up and used some of it to afford the down payment. The house was basically mine in name only since I have fantastic credit. The plan was that my boyfriend and I would move into the house with them to help with bills and also save up money for our own house in a few years.  We were hoping that eventually my mother would be able to either afford the house on her own and take over the mortgage or at least split the house with someone else and take me off of it entirely. It has been one year since the move and my boyfriend and I split the mortgage and my mother pays the utilities. It was basically supposed to be even across the board by our calculations. However, my mother is absolutely terrible with money. She has been spending nonstop on takeout, vacations and very unnecessary items. It has gotten to the point where her savings has essentially depleted and now she is complaining that she pays too many bills and has no money. She even asked me to pay more to help her but I refused because she is only in this situation bu her own fault. She has even gone so far as to accuse my boyfriend and I of ringing up the electricity bill by leaving TVs on and playing our gaming consoles (which do not use that much electricity). We have explained to her time and time again that her high electricity bill is due to the AC running nonstop (we live in a hot state) and her constant use of the washer and dryer. No matter how much we try to reason with her, she doesn’t believe us and continues to blame us for her problems. Last month she even decided it was a good idea to pay $4000 cash for a camping trailer that she herself is unable to pull and now has to spend an additional $50 per month for its storage. I have tried to talk with her and reason with her but she is extremely stubborn and does not respect me or my advise at all because she’s “the mother” and I’m “the child” (her words). My boyfriend and I will not be able to get a house of our own until she can at least take over half of the payment on this one (he has bad credit). And we couldn’t even leave to get our own apartment because she won’t be able to afford the house on her own and I would get stuck paying the mortgage on her house and then rent on the apartment. We’re stuck and she is extremely difficult to live with. I am stressed out 90% of the time from her alone. I have constant depression and anxiety when thinking about the fact that I cannot leave and get away from her. I have depression issues on my own and she is absolutely making it worse.

550,"I have this friend who I'll refer to as MT (maybe toxic) 
MT says he's transgender so I accept him for that despite the only reasoning he has told me is that he doesn't like anything girly. We get along and I help him with playing the Clairent. But all my other friends say that MT is toxic and abusive and telling me that I should stop being friends with him. MT doesn't have alot of friends it's just me, two mutual friends, and his girlfriend. He has stated multiple times that he's a 'shadow' and no one likes him. 
MT has harmed me before, we were going to clean out our lockers and I told him my hand was fake. I don't remember why because it was anout a month ago. He said it wasn't and proceeded to dig his fingernail into my hand and wouldn't stop until I showed that it hurt. When I winced after a few seconds he said
""See it's not fake"" Meanwhile I'm about to cry because my hand hurts and its turning red. 
I had a scar for three days. 
He's also said that people are going to beat me up in high school for various reasons. 
The first time was after Jazz band and I was putting some plush toys I bring with me to help calm me down into my bag. MT asked me if I was going to bring them to high school. I told him yes, but Hopefully I wouldn't need to. He told me that people were going to beat me up and he was making sure that I could avoid that.
The second time was when we were at the very first Marching band rehearsal. I was super excited and rocking on my heels and toes. MT told me to stop because 
""People are going to think you're retarded"" 
I told him he shouldn't say that and then he jumps back into his rant about being a shadow and that you have to stand out.
The third time was actually yesterday. We were doing Marching band sectionals and having a waterbreak. I was talking about how I was cold and wished I brought another jacket despite it being 80°F outside. He then asks me if I planned on wearing skirts in high school. I told him yes and that I was going for a more cutesy appearance in school now. He told me again that I was going to get beat up. I asked why because I'm a girl and he said
""Because girls only wear booty shorts and name brand t-shirts or skinny jeans and jackets""
The 2nd part may be off because I have the memory of a golf ball.
I didn't get to respond because our water break was over. 
I've been telling this to my friends and they all agree that I should stop being friends with MT even saying I'm being an idiot because MT is going to hurt far worse down the road. I really don't want to hurt MT's feelings and it would be awkward because we're in the same section in both Marching and Concert band.

552,"The title is kind of self explanatory but I'll go into further detail here.   


About three and a half/four years ago I realized that I was very depressed. It started at my senior prom when i realized that I just kind of wanted to die. I'll never forgive myself for ruining it for my at the time girlfriend.  


Since then I started to become more and more of a piece of shit. My girlfriend broke up with me because in all honesty I was just a burden on her. If there's one thing that I still care about its her. I still love her deeply and I spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about her and wishing she was still here. She was the only person in my life to care about me without me needing to remind her. My parents are very loving good parents. But unfortunately, when I was 16 my younger brother nearly died when a large tumor burst on his liver and ever since then he has been battling cancer. They don't have the time or the mental energy to be thinking about me. I don't blame them. Rarely I will talk to one of them about my depression and they'll show deep concern and tell me they'll set up an appointment with a counselor but unless I bug them about it they don't end up doing it. They have so much other stuff going on that I feel like a burden having to ask for financial help with counselors appointments. I've been moved out for about a year and a half now and I am trying to be as independent of them financially as possible.  


At this point I find it almost impossible to find happiness without the aid of substances. Unfortunately, I hate smoking weed because it gives me terrible anxiety and I just find it unpleasant in general. So generally I try to find Adderall, Vyvanse, any kind of opiate, benzodiazepines, or cocaine. I also do kratom daily and I smoke about two - three juul pods a day (2-3 packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine a day). I'm not addicted to anything except nicotine and kratom which I can manage because of its legality. But I feel almost like I'm addicted to being under the influence. I hate being sober.  


I want to be happy again but I feel like I can't do that anymore. I feel like depression is how things are supposed to be and the only way to be truly happy is to be stupid. Oblivious to how the world truly is and too stupid to understand what exactly it is you don't understand. The only thing I live for is potentially crossing paths with my ex in life again sometime soon and making it work again but I know that's just something I convince myself is realistic so I have something to live for outside of what drug i'm going to fuck myself up with as soon as I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see how counseling will help me. I did it once and if anything I just solidified the way I feel about life in my mind. I don't see a point anymore outside of her. She was the only thing to ever make me feel like a real person. Ever since I was in first grade I have wanted to kill myself. Are some people just not meant to be happy? I sure as hell can't be happy by myself. All I want is to be with her again. I legitimately do not care about anything else in my life.   


I need very straightforward advice. Is there any way for me to fix myself? I want to be able to feel the way that I did with her but I've never felt that way before and I don't see a way to feel that way now. Its like I got a taste of what it's like to be a normal happy person and now that I know what it tastes like I can't convince myself that dealing with life the way it is without her even makes sense. What I get out of life isn't enough to make it worthwhile anymore. Why keep going? I say this with total indifference. Death seems the exact same as living.  


She's coming to visit town in August. If I can't win her back then that's when Im going to killmyself. Im ready to give life one last hail mary but i'm a realist. Im going to be dead by september.

Before that I was using the I phone 5, and it was pretty messed up so a new phone was great  for the time it lasted. I live in New York, and while walking down the block with my homie, a dude with his hand deeeep in his vest pocket came out his p’s (projects) and ordered us into the stairwell. Now though I could have hit the dash these projects are known crip territory and I could tell he was strapped up. we took a step forward into the building and a brown and black gun was on us within a matter of seconds. He brought us up a few stories where two other locs were chilling. Now the whole process took about an hour and a half before we finally got out so I’m going to try and only describe in detail. After demanding our phones, my friend was very reluctant and was punched in the head very very hard. After he got knocked in the head I tried to run down the stairs but the youngest of the three, a kid in a blue hoodie grabbed me and threw me back into the corner. They took our backpacks off, patted us down and emptied our pockets pretty quickly. My friend was still recovering from that head shot, and quickly unlocked his phone this time. They took all the money I had been saving to my name out of my wallet, and then asked me to unlock mine. I tried to be witty and pretend like I didn’t know my Apple ID, but the dude in the vest started screaming about him being tired of ppl playing with him and took his gun out again. After a few more minutes of searching us, the third and final dude pulled his gun on the first guy who apparently owed him money, and the dude reluctantly gave it all up except one of the phones. They started to yell about it, and I recognize this gun as a glock, being held by a dude who also seemingly “just got out of rikers” The third dude, who was now in control, started asking the first dude if he was dealing with us which scared the shit out of me because I had heard of execution style killings in the stairwells of the area. He said yes, and after the other two went back upstairs, he told us we were free before running down past us and out the building. In physical shock. We sat on a bench outside for a few minutes before returning home to an angry mother.

557,"It was my 23rd birthday two weeks ago. I had a huge night out planned on the Saturday with all of my friends (we are all female fyi). 

&amp;#x200B;

The day prior I received a call off my best friend \[Sarah\]'s mum. She told me how Sarah was quite ill with sun stroke and that I shouldn't pressure her into coming if she isn't up for it. I agreed but also said that she was my best friend and I hope she can make it. I dropped Sarah a text saying I heard she's not well and to have plenty of water and rest as I (obviously) really want her at my birthday. She text me the next day saying she's still really poorly, she's sorry and will make up for it. I was so gutted, of course. Sarah is my BEST friend and i was devastated she wouldn't be there, so I just said alright and that I hope she feels better, as her mum told me not to persist. 

&amp;#x200B;

TANGENT. To put the next bit into perspective I need to flash back to December 2017. 

Sarah had a Christmas party. I told her the week before that I would be late as I was coming from work and she was absolutely livid. She told me it's probably not worth me coming etc. She was really upset about the fact I wouldn't be there for all of it. I really grafted with her that week and called her a lot to get hold of her to make things up. I went to the party (only about an hour or so late) and she told me if I hadn't have grafted her and tried so hard to make things up, she probably wouldn't have spoke to me until January as she was so angry.

I was really upset by this as I felt the ball was in her court as 1. she was the one missing my birthday 2. when i was late to her xmas party i fully grafted to make things up 3. if it was the other way round i knew i'd have been trying to make things up (again, see above). So I decided to reach out to her. The phone call was a little awkward, she asked how my party was etc and that was about all. I kind of expected a ""so sorry I couldn't come i wished i was there"". I know of course her excuse was legitimate, but I know that if I had a legitimate excuse I would still be so sorry and devastated that I couldn't make it!

&amp;#x200B;

Another week has passed and she hasn't breathed a word. I saw she went out for dinner with some of her old school friends and it just really upset me. We usually see each other every week generally anyway after work for dinner, and now she hadn't seen me in 2 weeks since my birthday. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I reached out again. I sent her a text saying I'm quite upset I hadn't heard off her. How I thought she was going to reach out to me like she said she would. I understood if she got busy, but I just wished she'd have made the effort (especially reflecting on how she treated me after her party). 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong to be feeling this way? I'm just so gutted she wasn't there, and I know if I had missed her birthday I would have made so much effort the following week to make it up and special. Any thoughts on where to take this?",10Jul2019,1
558,"I lost around over a thousand dollars that belonged to my dad. I knew it belonged to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year I've been getting into stock trading (with leverage). While I kept losing all the money I put in, I was confident that I was at least making progress and will someday make a living this way. After losing a few thousand dollars in a few months I was all out of money, and I decided that I could probably make it back using my dads money. He won't even notice that it was gone, just take a quick profit and then give it back. As you'd expect, I lost it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't know that it's gone yet. He has already asked me a few times to send it (the money was already on my account but it belongs to him) but I kept stalling. I've been in denial for so long now that I don't think I can trust my own judgement on this. I also want to point out that I'm currently unemployed and a student, and my parents are paying for my education.",10Jul2019,1

560,"It's a rather long story that needs quite a few details to understand but I'll try to keep this post as short as possible.

So back when I was 15, I came out as gay. Usually, when you first come out you get really invested in your identity (well it was at the case at least for me), and there was this website where you could talk online to other lgbt people so i created an account on it. One or two weeks in I got a message from the profile of a ""16 years old"". He seemed nice and all so I chatted with him a bit. Then he gave me the number of one of his friend in his early twenties was interested in meeting me. I know it immediatly seems fishy but I was 15 and didn't realize. So I was supposed to meet him at night in a parking lot.

As I got there he texted me he was waiting in his car. When i hopped in the car I knew it was a mistake, there was no way this dude was in his early twenties. Maybe fifty I would say ? I couldn't clearly see his face, it was too dark. But he didn't look young. I instantly got creeped out but felt pressured to stay, as if I was trapped and couldn't leave. You can probably guessed what happened next. He didn't force me to have sex with him, he didn't have to, i just forgot how I should act. When it was over, I just walked home, feeling quite disgusted with myself. I messaged the 16 years old but he didn't even answer, so i couldn't ask for any explanation. I'm 100% sure now that it was just the old dude catfishing me and not some 16 years old boy.

I tried burying this memory in me, and I think i somewhat managed to do that until two years ago, just before i turned 18. I was partying with 3 of my friends the day before bastille's day (in the city i grew up the fireworks were launched the 13th instead of the 14th). There was this group of about 10 men right besides us. I would say there were in their thirties. All kinds of trashy because even though they were all really drunk, they had a baby with them. So when two of my friends left for a while, the group starts coming towards us. They ask us if they can get a bit of our vodka as we had a quarter of a bottle left. Neither of us really minded as we didn't feel like drinking anymore. Things got a bit more heated after that, they forced my friend to take a few shots of vodka and if either of us disagreed they asked us if we were looking for trouble. So we just went along. Then they asked me if I was a fag (they thought I was a girl from afar as I was letting my hair grow), and if they could take a picture of me with one of their friends posing as if he was fucking me. I wanted to say no but it's not like I had the choice. Me and my friend left as soon as we could. On our way home he described this interaction as a rape. He was quite drunk (he had more than half a liter of vodka in his blood) so he was exagerating a bit. But it hit me how little this was affecting me compared to what happened 2.5 years prior yet he was still reffering to it as a rape. So my first reaction was to say that worse things happened to me. He asked me what, but for some reason i couldn't bring myself to talk about it. 

Fast forward to this year. I started studying in Paris, so I do not live near my family and friends anymore. With 9 hours of college a week, I didn't really manage to make solid friends there so I've been mostly alone  with my thoughts. I was still mostly doing just fine until the year was over as I could go home once every two weekends. It was a bit hard money wise but as a student in France I had quite a lot of help from the government so I wasn't feeling like too much of a leech towards my parents. 

I experienced a lot of hair loss (got bad genetics when it comes to that) that year and seeing it got quite unbearable, especially at the end of the year. So I decided to find a job, so I could get a loan from the bank and get hair implants. I'm on finasteride now, so it's not going to get worse but it still makes me feel down. Thankfully my long hair hides it perfectly but as soon as my hair get wet I can see it again and here I am feeling bad again for the next 24 hours. 

So now that I'm looking for a job, I can't really go home anymore, as it's hard to find a job from 350km away. I've been basically alone for the last month and it just gave me even more time to think about what happened to me when i was 15 and 17. I definitely feel like talking as it's been weighing on me for almost five years now, especially to my mother as she will probably be the most understanding. But I know that if I do they will ask me to come back home, and I'll have to explain why I want to find a job so much if I want to stay in Paris. And I know for a fact that if i do, she'll offer to pay for the hair transplant. And there are two problems with that.

The first is that even though she can technically afford it, it will put her in a hard place money wise. Hair transplants can be expensive if you're not looking for a low quality one. I like my face so I'm not looking forward to ruin it with a funky hairline to save some euros. 

The second reason is that it makes me feel like I'm trying to manipulate her into paying it for me. I know it doesn't sound to you like I'm trying to manipulate her. But that's because i haven't said yet that deep down in kinda wish she payed it for me. It would save me so much struggle. Especially when in september my studies will start again (14h of classes + 35h of work + 7h of public transport + 20h of studies at home, it all adds up quickly and i don't get to have any time for myself, and any time to go back home). I don't think using the sexual abuse I've been through to get something payed for me is right. 

I've thought about going back home and just not tell about my goal to get hair transplants, but the problem is that if I don't find a job before late august, it will be hard to find a cdi (which is the kind of job you want in order to get a loan from the bank where i live) as I won't be able to say that i'm available basically anytime. It's already hard to find a cdi in France when you have no prior professional experience. So let's just say that if you appear picky to your employer when it comes to your schedule (whether it is because of your studies or not), finding a cdi is nearly impossible. Even though i can adjust my college schedule around my job. So I would just have to wait another whole year but seeing how down I can feel, I'd rather not. 

&amp;#x200B;

He seemed to accept and said as long as I wasn't concerned about the late fees there would be no issue, but now I'm a little paranoid about my car getting repossessed.

573,My wife and I got married too young and I understand that not. We have been married 2 years and I just feel like I'm falling out of love with her and I feel we have both changed now that we have entered adulthood. We had the same view on our upcoming life and family ideas but now we differ on too much on life issues. Everything we originally agreed on when we got married has been thrown out the window now. I think I need to be alone for a few more years to figure out what I'm gonna do and who I am. The main problem stems from the fact that I feel dead inside and very unhappy and I'm taking anti depressants to try to feel been with no avail. But she seems happy with the marriage. I do communicate my feelings to her but it feels as though she is in denial. I have even suggested divorce and she just doesn't seem to understand that im unhappy. I just think it will make us both happy in the end even though it seems like she doesn't even see it. I'm sorry this post was me mostly rambling on but I guess my main question is: What should I do? I think divorce is the right option but should I just serve her the papers even when she thinks things are ok? I don't even know how to go about getting a divorce. I don't want to go to court. I just want a clean 50/50. I don't want to try to take too much from her. I still care for her and want her to have a good life but I just don't think I love her anymore.,10Jul2019,0
574,"Background Info:
My Dad is your average (not extremist) judgmental Christian man, raised by Texan parents both born in the 1920's. He is a product of his upbringing and has very strong opinions on what we, collectively as humans, should / should not do with our bodies. Long story short, our bodies are temples of the Lord and we must respect the body we've been given. Part of respecting our bodies is respecting that man and woman were made specifically for one another, and God did not intend for us to submit to internal sexual desires. 

When he does witness something he's uncomfortable with, he can't brush it off. He doesn't say much, but will focus on it, internalize it and will stare judgmentally. He will hold on to his thoughts (sometimes for hours) until we're in the car or home, where he will release his opinions. He's learning to bite his tongue in public, but it's clear it's not going to accept other people's choices. 

Advice needed:
My family was invited to a Family-Friends vacation in Key West June 6-13, 2020. We happily accepted, as these friends are our closes and we go on family friend trips often! The beach is as good a place as any, right? 
Most of this group is open-minded, and an LGBTQ vacation spot is nothing they'd think twice about. However, they know my Dad's perspective, and they've heard plenty of his jokes, rude comments and judgments and didn't mention anything about Key West's pride before the trip was booked. My immediate family doesn't pay much mind to what happening in the LGBTQ community and had no idea that this was known as a ""gay mecca."" 

After we all paid our dues to reserve the house, a friend in the group brought it up one-on-one with my Dad. The conversation was basically ""Here's the reality. Are you going to be comfortable in this situation?"" And Dad's reaction in a conversation with my Mom and I afterward, was a bit defensive and along the lines of, ""They just want to make sure I'm not the asshole."" 

All I am asking is, is Pride Week in Key West a place where someone like him should not go to? 
Or, do we think that ""the best way to learn to swim is to get thrown in the lake without a life vest,"" and that this could be a good old-fashioned 'forced' learning experience? 

(Please, no hate on my Dad. This is about learning if a cartain vacation is a good idea. He is who he is, I understand his way of thinking is unacceptable. Just, please hold in your judgments against him in the same way he is required to hold in his against a new norm.)

TL;DR My Dad is a product of his Texan-Christian upbringing and is very against any ""non-traditional sexuality."" Should I talk him into cancelling the trip we booked to Key West, unknowingly during Pride Week, or allow him to experience it?",10Jul2019,98

579," 

So I work at a shelter and it's a damn mess. People threaten us all the time and management won't back us up until the third, fourth, fifth, sixth time and people who do messed up shit are allowed to come back again and again (with seemingly no behavior plan or anything). I am constantly stressed out, and the ""security"" is on their phones and basically ""helpless"" if we ban them because we have to actually take it to the magistrate (I have never heard that before, but fine). So someone who threatens us and we trespass them the PD on duty can't ""make"" them go. I'm not asking for anyone to catch a charge I just want them to go away since they did say they were gonna kill us, and I don't think that is me being unreasonable. So basically this shelter doesn't give a fuck about us. A lot of the officers who have been coming there says it hasn't changed a bit in over 10 years, one of them told me I might as well quit because it isn't worth my breath to keep asking them to change. On top of all this, I have some really shitty co-workers with some shitty attitudes. One person is extremely manipulative and throws all of us under the bus constantly. They will throw food away before just giving it to a client because ""they had a chance to eat earlier"". So why throw the food to waste then nobody gets to have it. This place is just stupid as fuck. And we got fucking bed bugs out the ass, too. But on the other hand, I feel like I should at least stay until I graduate (in 8 months woot) just to have the ""experience"" and so I won't be bouncing all over the place on my resume. I already got a job at another shelter. I guess I feel like nobody really cares about the resident's livelihood and are just enforcing these stupid ass rules because it's their job and doesn't stop to think that they are becoming part of the problem. But at the same time, I am one person.

585,"I (22m)moved in with friends and have being living as roommates (we’ll call them K (22m) and C (20f).) for a couple months now.

When I first moved in, everything was okay. There were simple rules to follow: everyone takes turns doing dishes, taking out trash, and cleaning. If you didn’t buy the food, don’t eat it without asking, etc. The rules were being followed up until about a month or two in when K decided because he worked “all day” (standard 8 hour shift), he doesn’t have to do dishes or he’d ask C to do it for him. When that happened, I told C and K that it isn’t fair that K doesn’t do dishes, and C tried to defend him but I shut it down quickly. Since then, he’s done dishes half-assed a couple times and leaves the rest for C to do since her day falls after his. 

They’ve also “fallen into hard times” meaning, C was constantly calling out of work, eventually quit after they threatened to fire her, and found another job that pays less with less hours. K has also stopped caring about his job, started calling out, showing up late, etc. pretty much trying to get fired. With all that going on, I’ve been asked help pay their share of bills with the promise of them paying me back, and I’ve had to share my groceries to the point where whenever I cook, C expects me to cook for the rest of the house and tries to give me shit if I don’t. It’s putting a major dent into my finances.

They also have an absolute mutt of a dog who isn’t trained in the slightest. It’s pretty much going to damage the house to the point where we may not get our deposit back. 

All of this isn’t even touching to bottom of my issues with them as roommates.

586,"I posted before about my situation but I think I need to elaborate from the top. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 6 months now. we live together we split bills and have a partnership as well as a relationship. I love her so much, I would swim the long way around the world with a ring in one hand and the priest on my back to marry her. There’s been times she’s showing me videos or memes on her phone and Ive seen guy names pop up sending her snaps. It’s not cool to ask wtf because I guess nowadays In the public eye that makes you a controlling psychopath... so I acted like I didn’t care but deep down it really bothers me. Now fast forward a while I see more guys names pop up here and there over time. At this point I need to know wtf is going on. So I was going through her phone and say every single bra/underwear pic she’s sent me sent to other guys, then them replying that “they’d love to give her some booty attention” and she responded “I could use some of that” I can’t describe the feeling I got when I read these texts/saw these photos sent to a few other guys. My heart just dropped I felt sick to my stomach. We have a very good relationship we have a lot of good sex, I buy her shit, make her dinner all the time all the great things an awesome relationship comes with. I have no idea what she’s doing talking to these guys. Is she just bored? Does she not love me anymore? A couple days go by and it’s obvious something is bugging me she can sense it. She asks me what my issue is. And I kinda pause for a sec and just tell her I’ve been having really bad dreams. Instinctively she asks what their about, I respond “I don’t really wanna talk about it’s just grosses me the fuck out”. Now that just makes her more curious but I don’t budge. Fast forward a day or so she asks me again what my problem is, I’m guessing it’s obvious that I’m uneasy and something in the back of my mind is eating at me. So I tell her again I keep having the same horrible dreams. I thought of telling her in my dreams she was cheating on me/talking to other guys, but I didn’t because I felt like it was too obvious. I’m kinda a pussy in the way that I don’t want to have this conversation that I probably will have to end up having anyway. Later that night she’s passed out and I hear her phone under her pillow with Snapchat notifications. I took her phone and saw that it was one of the guys she’s been talking to sending her a “streak” snap while shirtless. I’m fuming at this point and I just say fuck it I’m going to delete these fucks off her Snapchat. What’s the worst that’s going to happen she stops getting snaps from dudes, she thinks they deleted her. I kinda want her to find out what I did because then she knows I know and maybe we can go from there. Idk what to do guys, idk how to start this conversation, idk the questions to ask her, idk how to keep level headed and have a conversation without emotions speaking for me rather than logic.

And they have specific times too. ""On this GOOD day, if you start your work at exactly 11:45:00AM, you will blahblahblah. But if you start at 01:30:00PM, your would not be as successful"" WTF? This is allllll bullshit. I hate how she forces me to do all my work on 1 specific day and do nothing on the ''BAD'' days. I fucked up life-changing applications(College app, job app etc you name it) because of this shit. We have just got into a big fight AGAIN because of this stupid thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were talking about creating a bank account today. Today was supposed to be one of those GOOD/LUCKY days. I mean i dont give a fuck. I just do whatever the fuck she tells me to do whenever. I have no problem with her beliefs BUT when she starts blaming her shit on me instead of her belief, its just too much. Yesterday, we had a talk and decided to NOT create a bank account today and delayed this thing. Now, this morning, she talks to someone on the phone and changes her mind. I am just in my room, enjoying my book, and she came kicking my room door, and she just starts screaming at me. She said I am rude, and does not obey her. Now, she is blaming me for missing the GOOD/LUCKY day. She said there wont be any other good day for a month. She is about to kill me now.

&amp;#x200B;

 If I try to resist, she calls me ""useless cunt"", ""disgrace,"" ""mistake,"" ""peace of shit,"" ""no one,"" ""bitch,"" ""shit,"" ""uneducated,"" and couple of times, she even said i should be dead instead of living like this. for the past week, everyday, she has been verbally, mentally, and physically abusing me for nothing. she would start a fight outta nowhere and just scream at me whenever i try to explain myself. I cant do anything other than just shutting up, listening to her, and accepting her lies about me. I dont know what to do.",10Jul2019,1

591,"So my mom recently suffered a mental breakdown of some sort and now she’s a completely different person.
She doesn’t trust anyone, her mood changes randomly (very sad, very angry etc) and she often has complete mental breakdowns. She goes crazy and it’s almost like she’s experiencing a psychosis. 

She OD’d 2 weeks ago, she harms herself by punching herself in the face, burning her arms and two days ago she slit her wrists. I tried my best to get her admitted but it’s voluntarily and she’s saying she doesn’t want to go. We have an appointment on Friday but if she refuses to go there’s nothing I can do. 

What the hell do I do at this point? Who do I call? She’s a danger to herself and others and I feel like I’m running of time here. I need help, she needs help, but I don’t know what to do.",10Jul2019,1
592,"Hey, so I'm moving to a new town soon where I don't know anyone.

How can I meet new friends? I feel like it's easier if you already have a friend to help you since you won't have to be alone (it's less weird talking to a group of people with a friend). And they can introduce you to their friends.

Usually I just made one friend in the past and then was introduced into their circle and it was always through work or school.


Now I'm not sure if I will find new friends at work.

Where can I go to find opportunities to meet new friends? 

I have no problems talking to other people, but I don't want to come across as too weird.

I have the feeling like talking to somebody and asking to hang out afterwards comes across as if you were desperately looking for friends.

Thanks in advance!

Btw, I want to try out some new hobbies such as cosplay, or go to concerts, but I don't really have the opportunity.. :/",10Jul2019,0
593,"Say a guy and a girl, both young twenties, have been together for a while, and things are usually good, but sometimes he has problems with handling his anger and it scares her a little, even when it's not directed at her. Which she can handle, except on two occasions when they've been arguing, he did something she found questionable and doesn't know if she should let it go because it was only twice, or if she should be somewhat concerned. On the first occasion when they were arguing, he physically lifted her off the ground, pushed her angrily against the wall and held her there while yelling in her face until he was done. On the second occasion during a different argument some months later, he picked her up, angrily slammed her into the bed and pinned her down while yelling in her face until he was done.

601,"About 2 years ago our niece said her step-dad molested her. She moved out with another family member but eventually went home. My MIL and FIL now act like this never happened so family functions include niece, her mother, and the step-dad. I view it as kids do not lie about these things. For a year, my husband was angry so we did not attend family functions when his sister or the step-dad would be there. MIL would host 2 parties for holidays or birthdays and was very passive-aggressive, saying things like 'I hope I die first so I don't have to plan 2 funerals.' We didn't ask her to plan 2 things, we just told her that we would not be there if they were there.

My husband tired of this and relented so we went to a family birthday and a holiday party his mom hosted that they were at. He was worried the kids would miss out on time with cousins, and I told him I was not comfortable being around or knowingly bringing my child to a function where a child molester would be. I thought it was a slippery slope and would change his mom's expectations because she would think everything was fine. I was so anxious about bringing my toddler to these family functions that I took a separate car with the intention of just walking out the door with them if his sister or the molesting step-dad so much as looked at me or my child. I had panic attacks in the weeks leading up to the holiday, but suffered through and started therapy in the hopes of treating my anxiety. The therapist helped me see that treating anxiety was not the answer because I should listen to my gut.

I talked to my husband (calmly) to let him know that my toddler and I would no longer attend family functions if his sister and the molester were there. That I was not going to ask him to give up his family, but could not have my child around a child molester. He was not very supportive, he said he wouldn't argue because I had my mind made up, but he also said it's not like the BIL would stick his hand down our toddler's diaper in front of the family. I tried to explain that was not the point, but he doesn't see my point of view, though he hasn't asked me to change my stance. Since this conversation he has gone to a couple of family events without our child and I.  I feel both guilt and relief. It has impacted my marriage. My MIL will say 'I never see toddler' about 20 times when we do see them, I grind my teeth.  She definitely doesn't see them as often as she sees her other grandkids and my child is missing out on growing up with cousins. It's not proven that niece was molested, but really why would a 13 YO lie? I'm getting a lot of support but also a lot of crap, my other SIL (not niece's mom) has stopped calling and coming around and so have my husband's other family members.

602,"I was raped back in December, and the incident was brought to the attention of authorities in February. Because the police were involved, it had to be told to my parents which made things really difficult at home.

I think I have a lot of stress caused from that trauma. I’m unable to get therapy, as the issue is contentious with my parents and I’m only 17. The problem is I have a lot of problems (regarding the rape, but also things like family, death, school issues, and other things that most people my age don’t really have to deal with often). It’s causing me a lot of stress. I have to handle a lot of adult situations, and deal with the adult consequences of how I choose to handle them. That’s hard to do when I can’t think clearly because it’s just so much. 

Therapy would be a great option, but that is an issue with my family currently. Our school counsellor is an absolute garbage fire. My friends are too young to be involved in these types of situations. The point is, I need somebody to talk to, who can make mature and relatively unbiased evaluations so I can better handle my situations.

The police officer who interviewed me about the rape was very empathetic and professional. He was even  more empathetic than my family was (which unfortunately doesn’t take much). I understand he’s probably busy, but he’s the only person I can think of that I could talk to, aside from my coaches (which I’m very reluctant to do).

607,"I will summarize on the bottom. Sorry for all the extra details, I am still processing.

We are in the midwest, United States. She is young, maybe 18 or 19. We were never very close, but when I found out she was pregnant, I wanted to help every way I could. Her baby passed at around 3 months old, while I have a 7 month old. This info is only important because I was further along in my pregnancy than she was, so I gave her all the advice I could. When my daughter was a newborn, I gave her a heads up on how caring for a newborn would be. I tried to help her because we were both bew at this, but I had extra support.

I feel privileged that I have more resources and more support in my family. My daughter has everything she could ever need thanks to our family. What my daughter has, I wish every baby had, and the inequality of the world breaks my heart. 

I tried to help my friend by giving her advice when she needed it, by giving her baby clothes and formula and breast pumping equipment, diapers, toys, anything. I was cheering for them, and hoping that they would overcome the odds. I hoped she would have a beautiful life with her baby boy.

But today she texted me that he died. I did not want to ask for details, I dont think I want them. She says she wants to die, but I told her that she needs to live. Her baby loves her so much and she gave him everything. She did everything for him. I want her to live.

It just hurts me so much. I cannot imagine losing my baby and I am still in disbelief that she lost hers. I want to visit her and help her emotionally, but I worry that I might show off my lack of stress. I dont know how to explain it... but I feel like I have it so good compared to her and i feel almost guilty.

Can someone tell me what l can do for her? I told her to let me know what she needs because I am always going to be there for her. I hope she knows I mean it. I also do not know what resources I can give her to live her life. I understand she is hurting and will need time before she can work on herself again.

Alright reddit, I need some petty revenge ideas, and/or advice about how to get myself off of a Facebook page.

Okay, so a little backstory about this, I used to work at a place thats mainly for children to ride things around the mall, while I worked there one of my bosses(who left a couple months before I did) added me as an editor on the Facebook page so I can add posts, edit other posts, etc.

I quit back in April because the new boss was just not the best and also I just wanted a new job. I figured that it would be commonsense to remove an ex-employee from everything to do with the company, apparently, not.

So I didn't really notice until about two weeks ago  because im not on Facebook that often, but I saw that I was still connected and thought it was weird so I went to try and remove myself but I need a password-which I don't have--so I messaged my ex-boss. I was professional and just pointed it out to him and asked him if he could remove me since, yaknow I couldn't.

He. Left. Me. On. Read.

About a week later, nothing fucking happened so I messaged him again, a little more pushy this time, but like a girls gotta do what she's gotta do. I told him to do as I previously asked and remove me from the page because once again, I can't, and i also said it wasn't the most professional to have ex-employees still connected to your businesses page ESPECIALLY if they don't want to be.

He. Sent. Me. A fucking. Thumbs. Up. 👍

AND THEN DID FUCKING NOTHING.

So now it's been about two weeks, getting close to two and a half, since I originally asked him to remove me. And he's done nothing.

So Reddit, if you can be so kind, (and keep in mind that it's my personal fb connected and also a store meant mainly for kids so I won't post porn to the page), please give me some petty revenge advice.",10Jul2019,3

630,"Basically I adopted a puppy to keep me company while I study at University, he is registered as an Emotional Support Animal because I have refractory depression, generalised anxiety disorder, and was still recently coming to terms with a diagnosis of Asperger's.

I had been in high intensity therapy through an outpatients procedure for two years but, three months after adopting my puppy, I had improved enough to no longer need therapy at all.

As my puppy is still only 10 months old, there is still a lot of training that needs to be done. Things such as coming in willingly from the garden, not trying to rush through every open door, and jumping for cuddles.

He has made great strides in most of these while he has been living with just me. Now I'm back at the family home for Summer, he has struggled because my family are unwilling to listen to me when I try to inform them of what needs to be done to make sure he doesn't fall off the tracks in his training.

My parents are now having a chalet built with a chemical toilet for me to stay at the back of the garden instead of the house. My mother harasses me for him playing in the garden but then ignores my requests for her to check behind her before opening the patio doors; to which she then scolds me for it.

In September I will be moving into student halls with my puppy, and there is an option to continue my residency there with no gaps for at least two years which I am strongly considering.

My options it seems are either get rid of my dog because my parents don't like him or me; which could mean I end up back in therapy again or even worse.

Or, when I move into halls I simply stay there with no physical contact home for two years, and then look to find a job and residence there after studies also.

631,"So I'm doing pretty fine as everything goes where I am. 30 years old, I have a decent job, I pay my bills, own a house, all that. Its just lately, I've been feeling bummed out about where I live right now, Louisiana. Its so boring most of the time and the weather is nothing but miserable with the humidity and feeling overall swampy. When it comes to activities, I'm mostly something of a geek (video games, anime, etc), but I do certainly love traveling a lot! I have a big thing for going out on hikes...seeing new sights and the like, and have been working on a rock climbing hobby as well, which I was surprised about having a gym of that kind in my city now.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling bummed out after I went to Denver, Colorado in early May for a few days by myself on vacation and I was just loving it. Having the Rockies as a main backdrop everywhere you went made for incredible views; hiking in the Rockies was such a greater experience; the weather was incredible with a lack of humidity, so it felt like I could actually breathe; the people I talked with were good and friendly; and more. Ever since coming back, I just have the need of moving out of Louisiana now. I'm not saying I have to move to Colorado (it'd be nice though), because it is real expensive there and I don't have that kind of a job as it stands right now.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I like to do now is look around at homes/apartments and what jobs I could apply for in an area just because I'm curious in that way. Its apparent I'm not a big fan of Louisiana considering where it stands on various things. My only drawbacks for moving would be leaving my friends &amp; family behind and the overall difficulty it could bring from that process in general, wherever it would be that I go to. Not to say said friends and family can't visit, but still. I guess my question overall is if based on how I feel now, would it be worth it to move in the future for no other reason than to get away to somewhere more exciting or am I just going through something of a honeymoon phase?",10Jul2019,0

atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls",10Jul2019,0
633,"Hi, I am 21F. I have been chronically ill since I was 16 and I live at home with my parents. I do not work or go to school, as I am unable to do such things with my condition (at this time, at least). Due to my illnesses I am not able to exercise or exert a ton of energy, so I am not very active. Anyways, I really want to make some friends. Since I am not able to go to school or work, I can't meet people that way. I am looking to meet people my age (but can't do a sport or something like that). I am not sure how to go about meeting new people, so I am asking here. I do not have too many main hobbies but I like a ton of different things. I am open to many ideas! I really appreciate any input. Thank you!",10Jul2019,2
634,"I am 19 years old (male) and I want to blow my dad and masturbate with him. It is only us in the house and we are always walking around in our underwear and stuff. He has always had porn and Playboy magazines laying around so he knows that I look at porn. I am only interested in this because I want to see what my body will potentially look like when I get fully mature. I do not think he would be against the idea, but I do not want to freak him out by asking him. What would be some good ways of starting this kind of relationship with my dad?",10Jul2019,0

I've failed 2 math finals total in my years of highschool and I know I should be trying to do something while I have all of this free time. So should I just find a website that teaches algebra from the very beginning and try to learn years worth of math now? And if I do that what would I use??

640,"Ok... so I have been going trough a very bad period in my life, a struggling transitional period where I have no real motivation or will to do better because everyday life just plainly drains me.
But I kind of have enough of this bullshit, but... I have no idea of how to break this dizzy spell... probably also because I don't feel comfortable enough to ask anyone in my life for advice and stuff... so better ask strangers over the internet, right? They don't lie and have for sure my best interest in mind! 
But... joking aside... I believe that this community is very openmindend, caring enough and also straightforward enough to tell it to me straight. 
So, if you guys don't mind too much I would very much like to ask for some advice.
I'm almost 30, and I am not really happy with my life.
Deep down I know I'm not stupid, but for sure I've made some very dumb decisions that have affected both my everyday life and career.
And how did I end up in this situation? It's very simple, and follow me here, I've been depressed for a very long while... and second guessing and stressing over every single detail of my life drew me to a point where I ended up blowing a lot of opportunities because I wasn't sure or because I was not strong enough.
And believe me, I know, this is most probably only a middle life crisis, and I know it's nothing particularly out of the ordinary and that many people are in a similar enough situation... and that's why I think that maybe someone has some insight to offer me.
Ok, so now about the actual advice asking bit, at this moment I am a little bit more financially and life stable, so without having to frantically put out fires I kind of realized how bleak my life is and how plainly not happy I am... 
So, with this newfound stability, which I hardly ever had before, I would like to make some adjustments.
I have a bachelor in advertisement but I work in a mostly unrelated field since I basically acting as a property manager at the moment.
I like my field of study, but I feel like I don't have enough credentials and credibility to find a good place without at least a master's or a certified course. I work as a freelancer whenever I have the chance to, but it does not give much stability and does not sound quite good enough to me. 
But I don't have the time or will to go back into studying.
I could invest more into real estate to broaden my other activity... but I'm not sure that I am willing to make such a purchase, because taking care of what I already am taking care of drives me crazy and I wouldn't want to put down an extra thing that anchors me to where I live right now...
Because... if I have to be honest I am not happy here, and I don't think I could ever be.
But at the same time the prospect of leaving makes me even more anxious and just feel like I'm running away from my problems more than I'm actually acknowledging and resolving them...
The thing is that I earn quite a decent amount and have an easy life, so why throw it all away because of bad feelings.
I could cruise on like this and maybe even pursue an entirely different curriculum, something more aligned with real estate since that was my original plan to begin with, even if that was what had originally prompted my depression to begin with... I initially was pushed towards architecture when out of high school, wasn't too kin on it initially, but since I got in and placed well I tought I would give it a try, but the stress and the expectation were so high that I ended up dropping out.
In the years I've done many jobs whit various degree of success, but always ended up feeling bad, like everything I ever would do was always a second choice something beneath and worse than what I could have done if I didn't fuck up...
And it doesn't help that I am constantly reminded of my failures and put down by my family, who I know means well and only remarks on things like this to try and move me, shake me up if you will...
But sincerely I don't know what to think and do anymore, I know I'm a failure and that whatever is moving me right now is just regret over already spilled milk so there is no reason for me to fret so much and just accept my place in life and stop beating myself up.
It's not like everyone is meant to do great things there's bound to be also useless people like me in the world.
But I've already tried so much to put my mind to rest and stop worrying and to live with what I have... but it doesn't seem to work...

So yeah... sorry for the rant.

TL;DR
OP is having a middle life crisis and doesn't know if:

a. Pursue a master in its field 
b. Expand is current business 
c. Run away
d. Try for a new degree in a different curriculum 
e. Give it a rest, meditate and drink a camomile",10Jul2019,1
641,"I work at a coffee shop that didn't give me any hours over this most recent summer because they are not very busy (they are at a university).
I got a job at another coffee shop over the summer and I love it there- I hope to work there part time in the fall. My manager from the original shop said that they could fire/ not give me any hours because their employees are not allowed to work at other coffee shops at the same time. Is this legal? The two stores are very far apart and are not competing.",10Jul2019,1
642,"So here's a little backstory to my post. You can scroll to the bottom for the TDLR:

I'm a 20 year old college student living at home until I graduate from college within 2 years. My brother who's in the National Guard (military) is also staying at home until the next semester of college begins. He stays in the college dorms during the semester since the military pays covers the cost of his dormitory fee. Since he's not in school, he has resorted to coming home for the summer. Recently a few days ago my brother and I got into a physical fight. The reason for the fight was over something petty, but the true reason was over something I felt was completely disrespectful he said to me in verbal argument that happened a couple of days prior. 

The incident in question was that I was about to commute to work, and my mother had asked my brother to run a few errands for her. He was being lazy at the time, and refused to do so. My mother then asked me to run the errands since my brother refused. I replied to her that I needed to commute to work and that she should force my brother to do it since she asked him first. She asked me again since he refused so I got upset and confronted my brother about it. I told him he needed to stop being a bum (he was doing nothing that day and that hasn't been working at all for the past couple of weeks) and that I shouldn't have to do something that he was told to do. 

He then replied to me that if he was a bum, how is it that he is financially able to pay for most of his responsibilities and that I have to have my father pay for mine (college, car, etc). I found that exchange to be extremely disrespectful because he was flexing his financial status and wealth over me in a situation that he started because he was simply being lazy. Not only that, he thought that he was better than me because he had more money than me and that he was the more independent child between. Which is ironic, because my father was the one who essentially circumnavigated the recruitment process for my brother's military contract during his enlistment so he could receive generous financial benefits and enlistment bonuses in the future. (My father is a 20 year veteran of three military branches so he knew the intricacies and loopholes of military enlistment contracts). So for a sibling to flex their wealth over another sibling over something largely in part they didn't earn/do made me extremely angry. So when the tensions between us reached a tipping point we ended up fighting. 

The real issue I have regarding this situation doesn't concern my brother but my mother. My mother was extremely upset regarding the fight (as any mother would be) and reprimanded us regarding our actions. However she can't hold her water in regards to  sensitive family incidents/situations that happen within the household. So when in-laws, relatives, and close family friends came to our house for a party the following weekend,  she told most of them the fight that happened between my brother and I. I got approached by people during the party either asking me what happened between us or people using lighthearted jokes referencing the event.It's extremely frustrating because when I have moved on from the incident I'm often reminded of it from prying people who shouldn't have been granted an audience to it in the first place.  My mother has a history of replicating this behavior, as this hasn't been a first time this happened. When I brought up the issue to my mother, she essentially said since these incidents happen within the household, and within a household that she pays the bills for, she is justified in her actions of telling sensitive family information to people outside the family. She told me if I don't like it, I can move out and find another place to live if it bothers me. Fellow Redditors young and old, how do you deal with family members/relatives using financial dependency as a bargaining chip against you to mask their wrongdoings? 



TDLR: My mother has a loud mouth and has the tendency to tell sensitive family information/past incidents to relatives, in-laws and close family friends. When I confront her about it, she references the fact that since I'm financially dependent on her, I can move out away from her if it bothers me.",10Jul2019,1
643,"I’ve known my crush for about 4 months. We declared each other best friends last month. We typically lightly flirt and text pretty much everyday. The only reason why I haven’t shot my shot by now is because he was getting out of a long term relationship when we first started talking. 

The catch is, he’s terribly busy and i’m somewhat busy. We always have to bend over backwards just to hang out, and we typically don’t end up doing so unless we are both part of the same club, have sports practice at the same time, or see each other in school. So basically, business comes first, and then we happen to see each other and hang out in the midst of it. Therefore, we’ve only been alone together a few times. It’s very frustrating because I just want to get closer to him, but he seems pretty out of reach most of the time. 

I ran into him at an ice cream parlor the other day. He was with four friends from this religious program thing. Three guys, one girl. We talked for an hour. All extremely friendly. One even asked to keep in touch! I didn’t think much of it though. 

A few days after that, we were walking home together from a meeting for this club, (he lives pretty close to me) and he brought up that one of the guys asked for my socials because he “was trying to chop.”

I just gave a discontent smile and nodded my head. “Okay”. I don’t like his friend. The subject changed quickly. 

“By the way, you’re coming to our next gathering on Wednesday.” He gave a big inviting smile. I’m actually Agnostic and thought I didn’t have plans, so I said yeah. I was pretty stoked that he was inviting me somewhere that meant so much to him, offering to let me in and see this part of his life. Plus, the event isn’t actually church. It has activities and a ton of fun stuff. 

Yeah, I was excited. But things changed quickly. Today he texted me saying he’s running it and he won’t really be able to talk. And shortly after that, I saw that I had a last minute soccer practice.

First off, if he’s not able to talk to me there, then why did he invite me? To go flirt with his friend? This hurts a little. I don’t want him to put me on with anyone except for himself. I do want to get to know his friends better, and I see it as a good opportunity for that, but I don’t want to be desperate and just bend over backwards and skip out on my commitments just to see him. I know that’s not attractive and I would feel kinda pathetic doing that. 

But at the same time, this is my first year playing Soccer. 50 girls signed up for it and like 10 go to the practices. I have gone to 75% of these optional practices already. However, as I said, it’s still my first year and I probably need the extra practice. 

The thing is, if I don’t make the Soccer team, I’m just gonna join cross country. He’s on cross country. It seems like a win win, except for the fact that he would definitely always be ahead of me and therefore i’d literally be “chasing him” every day of the week. Not cute. But I also like running, so maybe it’s not that deep? 

I think the main focus here is my reasoning behind what I do, whatever the choice may be. If I go to the event, it should be because i’m genuinely interested in the event and just don’t care about Soccer that much. If I go to Soccer, it should be for me, not to look more hardworking to him. You know? 

This guy is just really handsome, kind, goofy, confident, wise, a leader, strong-willed, intelligent, etc. He’s really one of a kind. But I see that our text conversations are getting a bit shorter and more spaced out, and the spark in his eyes are kind of dying because I’m pretty sure I friendzoned him. I want to get out of that and make it more clear that I want him, but people are always around and I never have the opportunity to do so. 

I don’t know when my next opportunity to see him will be. And I hate to think that I came so close to seeing him, but then didn’t. I have my whole life to play soccer for fun. But I don’t know if I have much time to cuff him because he’s such a catch.",10Jul2019,0
645,"So basically I have been going to church my whole life and I like it and since my family moved to a new town we had to go to a new church so people from the nearest on came over our house they were chill and they were hella cool.

The next week the adult that came over last time is here but with his family and he has a daughter and she’s my age and I just fell in love with her she was awesome,funny,hilarious and she was super welcoming.

When we went to church with our new group of members I found out she had a boyfriend a year younger and since I respect that I backed off but we talked and had fun with each other.

(Time Passes by and know we know each other for a year at this point of the story And now she is single) Her and the guy broke up and It was during Winter break that we were getting along extremely well and we were always by each other’s sides that Literally everyone from my church said that we would look good for each other EVEN BOTH OUR PARENTS SAID THAT but then when we would look at each other and we would both say something like “Eww no” or “No” and then we would just laugh at each other or smile

Then it was her birthday and I wanted to get something special so I bought a blue heart necklace bc I low-key wanted her to realize that I like her and I felt so good about it at the time cuz we were so close then I gave it to her she said thank you so much then I gave her I huge hug the I left (bc I got so nervous that I gave it to her when my family was leaving the house🤦🏻‍♂️ ik it’s stupid but my anxiety goes threw the roof)anyways

Then school year ends and I try to text her but always leaves me on read when she doesn’t know what to say or would leave me with open ended answers example

Me:How was your day? 
Her:Good

Like are you going to ask how was mine??????
And she has hardly anytime to text bc she’s a really busy person soo we kinda no talk for a while then!!!!!!!!

My Family and 2 other family’s we planned on going to Lake Tahoe for 4 Days and 3 Nights and one of those families was her family so you could have imagined how excited I was so when we were at Tahoe we were having a great time meaning we were laughing laying next to each other and when we were watching a movie under a blanket me and her some how my arm and her arm got rapped around each other and since I was scared that she didn’t like me since SHE NEVER WORE THE NECKLACE THAT I GAVE HER annnd since we having talked in a while I backed off.
 
Later the night I was playing games on her phone and she was playing games on my phone one of her best friends sent her a text and I accidentally clicked on it soo I kinda read it and she texted 

Her: omg were we were so close to holding hands!! 
Her: is he friend-zoning me!
Friend:Nahhh he would he’s too nice try again

So I closed that tap after that the whole group wanted to watch another movie so I was eating dinner and she told me to get my blanket to watch the movie so I did and sat next to her and when we were watching the movie my arm and her arm got rapped around each other again and boom her held my hand and after that we were at this point cuddling and I was stroking her hair she was laying on me it’s was LITERALLY THE BEST MOMENT EVER and when a person would get up me and her would act normal then when that person sat back down we would start to cuddle again lol annnyyyy wayssss

The next night (The last Night) I texted her about what happened that night and I basically told her that I have feeling for her and I told her if she was a relationship that I’m cool with it. She told me that she has feelings for me but that she doesn’t know if she was a relationship. So I give her time (2 weeks pass by) We haven’t texted but when we see each other we laugh as usual and I felt ballzy at the time soo I called her (Super Nervous) and I asked her to dinner and she said surree so we set up the date and at this point our parents are teasing us that we are a thing (cuz I had to ask the dad for permission) 

And when I arrived at her place I gave her flowers and we went to the place were we were going to have dinner and when we were at the dinner “I call it dinner bc idk if she wants to call it a date anyways” were laughing and just plain talking and we had a great time and I’m not going to lie there were so awkward moments but we quickly recovered from them but when we were waiting for my parents to pick us up me and her sat on a bench at night and SHE DECIDEs TO PLAY A GAME ON HER PHONE so I was trying to talk to her and she just wouldn’t let the phone go so we go home.

That same week one of her friends tells me 
___________________________________________

Friend:“Hey you did NOT hear this from me okayy!!!! But I was talking to _____the girl___ and she thought the date was awesome and kind awkward” 

[And I lowkey agreed]

Me: Lmao okay😂 I lowkey think the same

Friend:and I’m just saying but she said something else too

Me: what is it?

Friend: I asked her if she would give u a chance and she said no cause she doesn’t want a boyfriend. I just don’t want you to get hurt

[Shes told me this before at Tahoe] 
Me:Okay I know and the last part was your words right? (I got confused)

Friend: She doesn’t wanna reject u cause she likes u a lot as a friend

Me:okay so if I asked her rn she would reject me

Friend :yea
___________________________________________

Let me give you backstory when she texted me this I was going to ask her if she still has feelings for me THE NEXT DAY WHEN I SAW HER so I pussyed our and didn’t ask but we were laughing and it’s been 1 month and a half since Tahoe and rn I don’t know bc even in person she’s been very distant and It this point i really don’t know what to do.... she’s at camp when I am posting this so please reply a response or text me as soon as possible 

Thanks for reading this is a long story but you have to know it all before you judge

646,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",10Jul2019,0
647,"I go to school in a different part of the country from where I live and so this summer I decided to come home to work and do some online classes to keep up with my degree works. I failed all four of my classes due to working 6 days a week and not having the energy to focus on my school work when I wasn't at my job. 

I don't know how to tell my parents this. They have been on me about my school work all summer but I just told them everything was okay because after working all day I could not find it in me to sit behind my computer and do this work. I straight up lied to them. Not going to sugar coat it. 

My parents would be distraught with me if they knew I had been lying to them the whole time. I have never once in my life been a school person but my parents insist that I get a college education in order to succeed in life. The funny part is, I love my job as a server in a restaurant so much that I look forward to going in and when I'm there I feel no stress or weight of the world. It's ironic that my parents are forcing me to get a higher education so that I can probably work a job that makes me miserable. Money really isn't that important to me, I just want to be happy.

651,"I'm not sure how to start this, as it'll be a long wall of text but I need some advice..

Let's call my boyfriend (M) and his mother (C). I am (J)

Me and my boyfriend (M) met in January of this year and had our first date February 14th. After that things really kicked off. I had a dating history of falling in love and crying seeing the relationship wouldn't work, and some short flames, being cheated on and such. Basically I was tired of crying and stressing over boys and men and *FINALLY* found a boy who was all around mature and considering me and my well being. I always had this fantasy of dating my highschool sweetheart and I like this relationship a lot.

Fast forward to February 26th, I ask him why I can't meet his mom (jokingly) and goes on to tell me his mom actually was very rude and passive aggressive towards him when she found out about his last relationship. Wouldnt talk to him for a week he said. This made me a little hesitant but It was whatever. 

Fast forward again he tells me he can meet me in his state and it wouldn't matter if his mom knew because

1. I'm not going to his house

2. She doesn't own the state

So I meet up with (M) in hopes my bus doesn't fuck up as it's planned to pick me up by 5:15. WELL you can imagine how that goes because the bus gets canceled and I'm stuck in that state. Forced to stay over (M)s house, (C) catches us, horrible first impression. Yadda yadda yadda. (C) tells me and (M) and that she doesn't want him to have a girlfriend right now. Well that morning he tells her he's not breaking up with me. She's pissed, but whatever.

Throughout that whole week after the night we get caught she's surprisingly nice to him and tells him she apologizes for saying all that rude, nasty stuff to me and whatnot. A little while later she invites me over. 

After all that happened I regularly spend the night on the weekends, we all go on trips together and she's just a polite person but here some things that happen inbetween and have led up to now:

• (M) is not allowed to see me in free time, (M) is forced to stay at home doing nothing

• (C) says we see each other too much now and now can only see each other every 2 weeks.

• No (M) isn't allowed to come over my house, ever apparently and NEEDS to watch over us. My mother loves (M) and (C) has *ignored* my mothers texts asking if he can come over FOR ONCE.

• (C) Has sent his godmother to basically spy on him make sure he's not with anyone AKA me

• We can't hug, kiss, hold hands in front of (C)

• doesn't approve of anything I eat apparently I need to eat what she eats, I need to follow her life style and is ALWAYS suggest I do something differently. I can't wear certain things either. Doesn't like my hair out which I love it out. 

I can't shake the feeling she doesn't like me. Recently though she ACCUSED me of lying to her and saying I didn't shower and was actually running sink water. If it was sink water you would've known, WOULD'VE SOUNDED DIFFERENT. 

Also last night she told my boyfriend while doing my laundry about a week ago (no pun intended)  there was dirt in my underwear...I'm assuming she meant shit. Makes absolutley no sense because you wouldve smelled that on me. I WOULD'VE SMELLED THAT ON ME.


And as of right now she's making him give away his puppy. I offered to take the puppy in so he could see it but apparently he can't tell her I'm getting the puppy because she'll say no out of spite

I'm 18 right now, have a job and my boyfriend is turning 18 in 6 months. Apparently I lied to her and he couldn't see me this weekend. That apparently I CONSTANTLY lie to her. I barely talk to her. EVER... so now I'm on the verge of texting her and setting shit straight. But I know nothing good will come out of this. But I'm so angry, every chance he gets. The amount of free time he has he can't spend with me. It's always NO ?

He hasn't been active on any of his social media accounts, his snap score hasn't gone up which is so unlike him I swear he was born with an iPhone in his hand.

After the first two the pay scale goes up an extra 4 an hour. Im worried though that im making the wrong decision in my life to support a family eventually. I have been to school for film and hated it so i’m already in debt about 25K from that school and wondering now if it’s worth it for me to go back to school for IT. Computers and software has always been one of my favorite things and I really should of did this after I graduated high school.

656,"Ok so hi I’m still young and going to high school and I’m really enjoying it. My grades aren’t too of the class but enough to get into a college and stuff and I feel like I can kickstart my life in about 3 years fairly easily. But here’s my problem. My mother has been feeling really ill and can’t really do anything and she REALLY wants to move back to our old home in a different country. To the point where she constantly talks about it and stuff. Probably because she doesn’t have a lot of friends here.

She wants to move in a year or less but the problem is my education. It’s almost like they don’t care. I’m too far in American schooling so a good chance is that public schools in my old country won’t take me and defiantly won’t transfer my credit so I have to restart as a freshman. Another thing is international school but those things are really ducking expensive. I mean my parents can definitely afford it but there is no guarantee of me getting in and such. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m on the verge of tears. Either I show that I love my mom by supporting her decision of wanting to move back and leaving all my dreams, hopes and lives for her. I would lose quite frankly everything but my belongings. When we moved to the US at first I fell into a deep depression and I had serious trouble finding friends and quite frankly I’m 99% sure it’s going to happen again but even worse most likely. 

I want to support her but this is so much pressure to put on me. Do I tell her I’m worried about my schooling and that I don’t want to be a fuck up and start everything again and again because the schools don’t support my credits or do I tell her I support the choice of moving. She has some panic attacks and stuff and those might also get worse if she knows that I don’t want to go. I’m lost for words. This has been going on for about 2 years now",10Jul2019,1

659,"So I was in a long relationship with a very kind caring guy, then things got a bit physical. When I say abusive I don’t mean like being hit every day or being bloodied. And that’s maybe why I downplay this. 

He would put me in choke holds and punch me or grab my arms and twist them and one time held a knife to me which went to court on assault with a deadly weapon, menacing and strangulation but he was found not guilty as he used my depression and history of self harm as reason he pulled out the knife. And not to hurt me. (Strangulation and menacing I guess got thrown out with that) regardless, things were messy and unhealthy. I became severely depressed and suicidal and self harmed a lot and he’d often tell me to kill myself.

Then I had a kid with him. And all the emotional/verbal/physical abuse stopped. 

Fast forward he started up again and so I moved out got a restraining order on him and got a lawyer to write up an agreement that I was moving out of state and taking my kid. He signed and agreed and I left.

Now he’s doing better and I do speak to him, he isn’t exactly better verbally. He points out my scars and then goes on to say how clean his arms are with no marks, he calls me a garbage person and continues to say hurtful things and try to gain control over me.

He’s mad that I left the state with his kid. He said I don’t know how it feels. He said I’m hurtful and cruel and crazy. And I honestly question myself constantly. Maybe the “abuse” the choke holds and the pushing me down and everything wasn’t as bad as I thought? Maybe he didn’t take me to court for custody because he didn’t want to hurt me? 

I’m honestly so lost and confused. I just want what’s best for my kid and I’m doing AMAZING here. No depression (clean from self harm for 4 years now) I see a therapist, or did... but I’ve been stable and great for so long I stopped going and now my kids father is stirring the pot. Wanting me to move states so he can see his kid.... and I’m wondering if I’m out of line saying no? He doesn’t fight me on it, he threatens to bring in a custody battle using my mental health and financial struggle as leverage but I always tell him with the amount he makes he could visit anytime but doesn’t. 


I’m really questioning myself and my choices. I thought I was doing what was best for my kid but I’m wondering if I was just being selfish and doing what I wanted/thought I needed?

663,"I’m a high school student approaching senior year. I have been working at a call center that does insurance/medicare calls for about 6 months now. The only reason I stay is because the pay is insane and I get to choose my hours. In the offices, phones are not allowed out. Even if they are seen you get written up no questions asked. If youre not familiar with research center/call center work, it’s basically sitting down and doing nothing until someone answers the phone. Most of the time I just stare at my computer (cannot surf the web or anything like that) and once in a while i’ll budget, make lists of things to be done, etc. Most of the time I just say dream and think about whatever comes to mind. However the work is getting monotonous, and I have nothing to think about anymore. Some people bring adult coloring books, rubik’s cubes, sudoku, etc but that’s not really my thing. Without any homework, I have no clue what to do to keep me busy. I know this seems like a problem I should be able to solve on my own, but I can’t.

665,"I’m going to keep this to a minimum because I don’t know if any of my coworkers sub to this subreddit. But basically i’m a receptionist at a day spa, along with a few other people. Our manager has been doing this since I started working there. Anytime anyone makes any kind of mistake whether big or small, the whole front desk team gets an email about it. And I’m taking paragraphs long, every little detail of how you fucked up is aired like dirty laundry to the rest of the staff. 

I got 2 emails in the past day about things I did wrong. One being dress code; we aren’t allowed to wear tank tops. Now I will admit, I did mess up and wear one. I usually keep a cardigan in my car for when I go to work, however my car was having transmission issues and I borrowed a family member’s car to go to work that day. On top of all of that, I was sick with a sinus infection and I had found out the day before that my cat had cancer. So, grabbing a cardigan from my car REALLY was not on the top of my list of priorities that I was currently worrying about. I explained it to another manager as well. Still got an email about it. 

Then yesterday, I got another email because I forgot to put a towel on a stool in the locker room when I was closing. Still sick with the sinus infection and overall stress of pretty much everything else going on in my life I must have just forgotten it. It was an honest mistake, and now I’ve been informed that I have had a “point” taken away for this action. Over. A. Towel. We’re only allowed two points a month and then we get spoken to. 

The thing that really gets to me is that the manager will never just pull someone aside and talk to them about what they did wrong. He just blasts it to the whole workplace basically putting a dunce cap on you in front of everyone. It makes me feel worthless and dehumanized every time he does it. I try my hardest to be a good employee and get my work done, and I have expressed to them many times how many times I’ve been mistreated by previous bosses, so I’m already on edge whenever I start at a new place in fear of being treated that way again. 

I want to speak up and tell him how this makes me feel, but I’ve heard from other employees that doing that usually gets people fired because the managers can’t handle confrontation or criticism.

 What should I do?

666,"I need help with a perspective about my estranged sister. We recently reconnected after years of no communication. We grew up in an emotional and physically abusive home. We were triangulated against each other from my narcissistic father. She took a different route in life than I did. She has multiple children from 3 different men. She was (maybe still is) a liar. She was a kleptomaniac for a while and was arrested for it. She was homeless for awhile too. 

I was still deeply trauma bonded with my abusive father and stayed close with my abusive parent until last year, I’m 35 now. The more I heal that from the abuse of our past I do have empathy for what she’s been through and her choices in life. I feel like an asshole for being a flying monkey at times when my dad was involved. We both have CPTSD and mental health issues. She’s also very sick with Crohn’s and would like family support while she tries a new medical infusion. 

I wanted to give some back story so there is some context because I want to know if anyone else thinks this behavior is odd. My sister has maintained contact with all of my major ex-boyfriends. It’s not like we ever did anything together as a group. We were not close siblings. It seems like after the break up she would befriend them and keep talking to them. To me this is weird behavior. One of my ex-boyfriends said that she did try to come onto him. I did ask her about this and she said she absolutely did not. But she has lied to me in the past. She even is still in contact with the boy I lost my virginity too and someone I haven’t spoke to in over 15 years. I understand people are allowed to befriend whoever they want to befriend. I don’t believe she’s talking to any of my old childhood friends or anything like that, just my old lovers. Only the guys I’ve slept with. This makes me extremely uncomfortable and it is clearly a pattern. 

I would like advice on this on how to move forward. Since I do want to be present for her and be a supportive family member while we reconnect. Do not expect us to become super close sisters. There is a lot of history. But I don’t want her to befriend and chat up every guy I date, it makes me very uncomfortable. It’s one of the reasons I didn’t speak to her for so long. I don’t trust her fully because of our past. It’s also don’t want to feel like a hostage in this relationship and I have to hide my boyfriends from her. Any advice would be great.",10Jul2019,1

670,"I'll start from the beginning. Sorry for the poor formatting, I'm on mobile. Btw this is going to be a loooong one so thanks in advance for reading this.

Whenever I am at home or with my family, I feel anxious and all I want to do is just run away. I no longer trust my parents. I am a 15 year old male.

This all began a while back on easter where my dad got extremely drunk. We were over my a relatives house for easter and my dad took his medicine, but he took the medicine with alcohol which was extremely dumb of him. He got very drunk and said some stupid things at the relatives house and started yelling at everyone there. We decided it was time for us to leave so my mom, dad, and I went to the car. Obviously my dad was too drunk to drive so my mom drove instead. It was quiet at first and I could sense there was anger between my parents. Eventually, my parents started arguing and it escalated to the point where they were screaming. My dad was saying some pretty dumb things and I could tell they were hinting at stuff about there marriage and how they weren't happy but didn't want me to realise that they were talking about it. I knew that they weren't happy with each other before because I have never seen them ever happy with each other and I've had talks with my dad where he seems like he is unhappy with the marriage he is in. My parents are immigrants so they really have no one here and all they have is each other so splitting up isn't really much of an option. Also, I remember talking to my mom about divorce and I remember her talking about how she would never divorce because it would produce too much trauma on me and my brother. I disagree with this because I would rather just have them split up rather than see them stay together unhappy. Anyways, in the car I could tell they were hinting about there marriage and how they were unhappy and I said something that I instantly regretted. I said something along the line of ""you guys don't have to pretend around me, I know what's happening"". My dad instantly started crying and my mom stayed quiet. Then the arguing continued and my dad started throwing accusations about my mom sleeping with another man which is not true because my mom is not that type of person. At this point people were yelling and keep in mind we are driving on the highway now. I start yelling at my mom to pull over and she starts freaking out. Eventually I calm her down and we don't crash somehow and we pull over. My mom starts crying and my dad just starts throwing insults. I got really pissed so I told him to ""shut the fuck up"" which probably was not a smart idea but it worked. He stopped but then he continued and started saying how my mom is using him for money which is another lie. I start yelling at him for being irresponsible and he responds with the ""I'm proud of you son"". He then holds my hand and starys crying while I sit there awkwardly. My mom is still crying and I see her reaching for the stick to drive so I grab the stick and keep my hand there so she wouldn't start driving. My dad starts ranting while my mom is crying and I am just sitting there scared shitless with my hand on the stick. My dad throws more dumb accusations and I get fed up and tell him to shut up. He then starts talking about how I'm the strongest person in this family and how I am more stronger than he will ever be. He starts crying. Now both of my parents are crying in front of me as I am trying to calm them down. I held back tears because I felt if I cried, it would only make the situation worse. So I just sat there parenting my parents. Eventually they calmed down and the car ride was completely quiet and I just drowned out the silence by putting in my earbuds and listening to music. When we got home my dad went straight to sleep and everyone is in there rooms. My brother isn't home because he is in college while this happened. So I just stay in my room, text my best friend about everything that happened and quietly cried myself to sleep. 

The next morning I go to school and I was quiet for the whole day. My friends could tell something was up but I never revealed what was up. When I got home, my dad talked to me, and it turns out he remembered nothing which kind of revealed me but that got me thinking that he said all of those things before for a reason. Those things actually bothered him. I just acted like I was okay and I was like its okay. Then, my mom comes home and she acts like nothing happened. She doesn't even try and talk to me about it. I was really pissed at both of my parents because my dad was being a total dick and my mom was acting like a 5 yr old and was just crying and didn't even bother to help me. She played the victim card which she has many times before. I'll give two examples. This example was before this situation occured. Me and my mother got in an argument and would not change her mind even though I was providing evidence and actual facts about why my side is right. She called me stupid and metally disabled so I got mad and I just stayed quiet. Turns out, I was right. She started crying when she realised I was right and then played the victim card where she said ""why don't you love me"" and she started blaming me. That made me feel like total ass so I started to cry. There is another example which is after the whole situation on Easter. We got in another argument about how if I do stuff last minute she gets insane and screams at me but if she does I am not allowed to get mad. I asked a rhetorical question and said ""what would you do if I got ready last minute"". She responded with ""kill myself"". That caught me offguard. It didn't really have anything to do with the argument so I got mad. I could tell that she didn't mean it when she said it because she said it sarcastically and after she said it she said that she didn't mean it. I got mad because she was using that to make me feel bad so I started yelling at her for using that to play the victim. 

I've pretty much lost all trust in my parents and when I tried to talk to my mom about it, she played the victim card and was like ""it's not my fault"" so that conversation went nowhere. The only person I could trust was my brother and two weeks ago I tried to tell him how I was feeling since he was home for the summer. All I got was a ""you're annoying, go away"". That really hurt. I really looked up to my brother and that really fucked me up. Basically I'm alone with this and I can't really talk to anyone in my family about this.

I have told my closest friend about all of this and they have helped me feel better. Just every time I am home I wanna run as far away as possible and I don't anything to do with my parents. What should I do? I have been just feeling under pressure lately and I feel stuck. Please help. Any advice would be seriously appreciated.",10Jul2019,1
671,"My boyfriend and I are stuck in a hard spot right now. We told our apartment complex a couple of months ago we weren’t planning on renewing our lease, and have to be out of the apartment in 7 weeks.

I didn't come forward until there years had passed. If you've been raped you probably understand why. If you've been coerced and sexually abused all your life you will understand even better.

I first went to the police. The investigator, who I feel does not even deserve the label ""investigator"" was laughable. She interviewed me. Then she took a journal entry I had made that documented that I had been raped. Then she took my rapist in for an interview. She told me that she asked him if he raped me. He said no. Case closed.

I went to my university. Went through another torturous interview as usual. I tell them of a few potential witnesses. 6 months later, they sit me down. Now this, this is where it is really funny. He wrote a letter documenting the results of the investigation. He then said that they found no reason to believe that what happened was rape. Then, he just has to add, this following quote (paraphrased) ""is it possible that he just didn't know that you didn't want to have sex?""

What do I do. Am I just supposed to leave it be, let my rapist keep raping people and have absolutely no justice. I don't just have no justice, I have my investigator telling me that I might have just made up the whole thing and was never raped. You have no idea how painful it was to hear that.",10Jul2019,1

I've done art my whole life and I was originally set on that. However, there are a few things wrong with that choice. 1) I'm not confident in my art. I have not drawn a single thing in about 5 months. I am completely uninspired and it has gotten to the point where I can't see myself do it anymore. 2) It's a highly competitive market especially in the video game industry which is where I wanted to take it.

I've considered writing as I think I'm good at grammar, themes, etc., but I don't write too often and I don't know how easy it'll be easy for me to find work with a degree in creative writing.

One thing I am absolutely sure about though is that I want to work in the video game industry. I have had a legitimate passion for video games ever since I was a kid. And not in the way that I think I can make a living off of playing them. I love reading about what goes on behind the scenes, what goes into making one, the hardships and trials of doing so, news about upcoming releases and how successful they are, the effects of crunch time, all of it. It fascinates me to no end. I've considered being a voice actor, but I don't think my voice is as flexible as the pros so I don't know.

She drops him home almost every day because she can drive but the problem is, it always takes 45 minutes for them to get home. She drops another person home who lives quite far out so that's excusable but heres where it gets a little odd.... recently she has been dropping my boyfriends sister home too cause she works there too and now she (my ex friend) is dropping my boyfriend home first. Whereas before, she would drop the other guy home first and my boyfriend second..... so it would be just the two of then in the car together. Am I some kind of psycho? He hates me being paranoid about her because ""shes just a friend"" and he ""needs a lift cause if not he has to fork out tonnes of money for transport each week"" but he gets really annoyed at me so much so that I'm pretty much fighting this all by myself and I have no idea what to do. I'm scared that if she did fancy him and tried it on, he would say no, I'm almost sure he would, I do trust him but I dont think he would stop getting lifts home. I dont think he's cheating on me, but we got into an argument lately and things haven't been right since. It was about a week ago and I dont think hes happy with me at all. He doesnt kiss me much anymore, well he does but he doesnt always initiate it like he used to and he just feels distant. I just need help, please.

One of the little girls (4-5ish) is Filipino and has dark skin. The instructors call her “monkey girl”, because she can make a shrieking sound that kinda sounds like a shrieking monkey.

Fast forward to now, husband and I are still together and he and M are still close friends (they talk at least once a day). My husband and I have been having some struggles and he was unfaithful a few times. About 9months ago we decided to divorce. Six months ago, being the moron that I am I get drunk and start to think think I’m never going to see M again and still have unresolved feelings for him. I message him and tell him that I used to like him. 

M was 100% unaware of our marriage issues (even though we moved hundreds of miles away because of my husband’s affairs) and thought I was trying to cheat on my husband with him. Rightfully, he’s very confused so I explain everything to him. He says he’s sorry for my life and wishes me luck, but also that nothing could ever happen between us and that he won’t tell my husband. I’m fine with that. It was an embarrassing mess. 

About three months ago my husband came to me and said he really wanted to work things out and we got back together and things are great. He’s a better father and husband than ever before. Here’s where my problem comes. For my husband’s birthday he wants to take a trip to visit M and some other friends we have in the area. How the heck am I supposed to play this? Should I tell him what happened?

So, backstory my father and his family pretty much want nothing to do me unless it benefited them. The only time that stupid son of a bitch came around was when he WANTED something from my mom or me, and he would fuck up my life even more then he was gone again! It has always been like that pretty much throughout my whole life.   


When I said I had enough of his bullshit and cut all ties with my father, but didn't stop the little contact I had with his family because I still loved a few of them...  I'm stupid, I know. So he used the few family members I was friends with on Facebook. Removed all of his family from my friend list, which was maybe four or five when I was in 11th grade after that didn't hear one word from that side so didn't give it any thought of blocking.

I ignored the rest of her messages. But of course, my mind is doing 'the what if thing.' Again!

693,"I am almost 28 years old. I had an abortion when I was  17 and it had a terrible impact on my mental health and I still struggle with the guilt. Now, I’m married but not exactly happy. I don’t think I want to spend the rest of my life with my husband. In fact, if I could get a divorce and live on my own I would jump at the opportunity. But I struggle with depression, lack of motivation, and I don’t have a job. My husband has a great job and is very well off financially. He also has a good supportive family, and I don’t.

I just found out yesterday I am pregnant. I am not on birth control because it causes terrible side effects for me (tried almost every brand) like cystic acne and vaginal dryness that would cause bleeding during intercourse. So obviously I had to stop. My skin is perfect now and my body functions normally like it’s supposed to. Those side effects scared me and affected my health so bad that I refuse to use any type of birth control. We were using the rhythm method successfully for more than 5 years until this past month, we accidentally had unprotected sex on my last day of ovulation. We usually always avoid sex during my ovulation period. I asked my husband if I should get plan b and he said it was a waste of money because the chance I would get pregnant was low. I wish I didn’t listen to him.

I went to the doctor today and they said I caught my pregnancy very early. Today is the day I officially missed my period. I’ve taken 5 early response pregnancy tests and they were all positive. I feel pregnant as well, I feel the same as I did when I was pregnant at 17. The thing is, I’m not happy. I don’t want to be pregnant. I feel no connection to whatever is growing inside me. I don’t think I would be a good mother. I feel like my attractive body is the only positive and nice thing I have going for me and pregnancy would ruin it, and then I would be even more depressed, maybe suicidal. But I also don’t want to have another abortion. I feel like a complete and utter failure. I feel like a shitty irresponsible selfish human. I feel miserable.

If you were me would you get an abortion? Have you been in a similar situation? Did you eventually feel a connection to the fetus? What should I do?",10Jul2019,1

When I was 11 I used to play a lot of online games. I didn’t really have any friends and I was home schooled so I just talked to random people online, not the safest thing to do I know. My parents are immigrants and they weren’t at all aware of any of the kinds of things that happen online with youngsters such as myself. I ended up talking to older guys that tried to use me for things I didn’t understand. I’ll give an example: I constantly got asked my age. When I told them I was 11 or 12 they’d say things like oh u have a young girls body can I see it. I was even asked to send nudes. 
A lot of times I remember just blocking them while being scared. 
Other times I’d try to change the subject because I felt it was weird but I didn’t really know any better 
Anyhow 
It just swung over me 
And I’m trying to recollect if there was ever a point in time where I gave in and sent something explicit 
This part of my life was kind of locked away for the longest of time and i can’t believe I was dumb enough to do that stuff in the first place 
If I ever did send anything explicit 
I’m aware that counts as child pornography

697,"I'd like to start by saying I love her family. They've been extremely welcoming and kind to me. But her brother is a walking disaster. He's been in prison for 5 years for a violent felony. He's spent that time wisely by becoming a higher up in the Aryan Brotherhood. He has SS and Swastika tattoos. My girlfriend and I would be happy to never see him again, but her grandparents think the world of him. Her grandma referred to the Aryans as ""his social club"" and they are both convinced he's going to get out of prison and go to school and be successful.

Now that he's close to getting out they're trying to force him on us. They've gone as far as to suggest he should walk down the aisle with her at our wedding (wtf) and the other day they waited till I walked away and asked my girlfriend if we could ""financially support him"" when he's out.

I don't want to seem judgemental either, I know to an extent you can be forced into these gangs. But he's apparently been displaying the iconography before he was imprisoned. And according to people my gf knows at the prison he's gotten to the top of the hierarchy in the gang. He's going to be at our wedding and we have several friends and family who come from different ethnic and religious backgrounds. 

I'm sorry this turned into more of a venting session (I don't have many people to talk to about this) but I guess I just want any advice you guys have to give on how to navigate this? I'm at a loss right now the whole thing seems so surreal.",10Jul2019,1

Basically, if I am not receiving positive feedback at any given point in time, then I feel completely unsure of my relationship with the other person- like they may have stopped loving me in the past five minutes or are too busy mentally criticizing me to interact with me. I am also very uncomfortable being alone and often feel lonely and disliked for no discernible reason.

700,"I was recently diagnosed with a mental illness and became medicated. After which I began to see therapy and went on a treatment plan. I don’t know if it’s because of the medication I’m taking has cleared my head and made me look at things more objectively than emotionally, or if I’m developing a victim complex because of being diagnosed and realizing that yes, I am sick.

I’ve had issues with my relationship with religion and Christianity growing up because my mom is super religious and it seemed like she never had a whole lot of time for us because of her work in bible study. I feel like I resent her and Christianity as a whole because of it, especially since her work is teaching and volunteer based and she isn’t paid, but she still works 30+ hours a week. I’ve grown up with a lot of resentment and bitterness towards her and, given that my dad works long hours and was never home a lot of the time, I’ve begun to resent how she never seemed to notice I didn’t excel socially as well as my siblings. She noticed I wasn’t as academically adept and got on my case quite a bit about it, and a lot of my memories with her are mixed at best. The only way I got diagnosed was telling my dad that I had been suicidal and I needed help. He listened and he got me medicated, and now she says things like “I’m so glad you’re on a plan now, I never realized how sensitive you were and you’ve just done a total 180° on your mood.” Even though I told her several times that I thought I had depression in high school and she never listened, even telling me it was “hogwash that I’d even think that, and that people count tell me something was wrong with me.”

I still feel insanely guilty though because on the days we do get along, we have deep conversations, and she buys me nice things and we have fun. We’re very very different people and I’ve come to respect that, since she’s in her 50’s and it’s hard to change your ideals when you’re a grown adult, and aside from the occasional jab at my political ideals, we aren’t necessarily on bad terms. She’ll take me to the mall on days when I see my therapist, she’ll ask me to go with her to get our nails done, and she will give me a hundred when they visit me in college, though it’s more often my dad, but I digress because they’re usually together when they visit.

But at the same time, when we *don’t* get along, she cries, says all three of her kids hate her so much and make her the villain, calls me lazy and spoiled, yells, and slams the door. When I was little she’d spank us with a rubber spatula, which I guess is normal given how many people I know grew up with spanking, so I can’t really vilify her for that.

I don’t know how to feel. I’m scared that pointing fingers isn’t gonna do anything and it’s gonna take me down that same path where I consider myself a victim of everyone else’s wrongdoings; I know she hasn’t been the best mom, but I still don’t know if I can say she’s a *bad* mom because she does nice things and wants me to be successful and pushes me because she wants me to be successful.

And I just resenting her for something in the past? Or is my feeling of being abandoned and being a victim valid? I honestly don’t know and I feel like a shitty kid for even entertaining the idea.",10Jul2019,1

I don’t enjoy my hobbies anymore despite being very talented at them.

Basically there was a party and my friend got drunk and started spying on my younger brother and sister. And that's not okay obviously. Keep in mind that this friend of mine is over 18, he also started texting a girl that was FAR under 18 and was trying to meet up for sex and was sending explicit photos to this girl. So my other friend and I took charge and resolved the situation the best way we could and we made him leave with his father. I'm not sure of the extent of trouble he could get in, but I'm sure he could go to prison if the police are made aware.


Basically what I need people's opinions on, although I feel like I know the answer is if I should spread the word of the dangers of my friend to other people in the community or if you think I should do something else.

712,"My wife had taken a trip with Azal airlines a couple months ago. After arriving and seeing her baggage had not arrived she had went to the counter submitted a claim and followed all procedures. 

We have been going back and fourth with the airline with no break through and its been over 2 months and we have a 500 dollar phone bill to show for our efforts. 

They claimed they had first given us the baggage, then they said they were looking for it. And after the first month passed they just stopped caring. They wont answer calls or emails for requests for lost baggage claims. 

I am at a loss of what to do. The bag had my wifes (expensive) ivf treatment we had bought out of country in the Hopes it would help us with our dilemma. And some close personal belongings I had bought her that were name brand things. 

Financially I am stuck in a hard place right now and cant afford to consult a lawyer which makes the situation more frustrating because I feel like I'd have better customer service from them if they were dealing with someone aware of the law instead of just trying to sweep me under the rug. 

Can anyone recommend some options?",10Jul2019,1
713,"Well, I guess the title is a little misleading. I think I'm already developing feelings for this girl. She's been a friend, albeit not that close, but recently she became my roommate. She walks around with her fit ass body in linguiere and always has friends coming over. She's way out of my fucking league and 10x more social than I could ever be. However, on the rare days she's at out apartment alone, I go into her room, talk with her, and a bit of flirting goes on. She's already made it clear she not interested in anyone :( obviously insisting that my chances are out the door. Worst part is, I've been studying for my MCAT and I don't have time to think of this, and I know the best way to lose a ""crush"" is to take time away from the person. Yet, this girl's my roommate and I don't think I'd ever have the opportunity to talk/flirt with a girl as good looking as her. So, I guess my question is, how do I not fall in love with this girl?

Sorry if this was incoherent, needed to quickly get this off my chest (don't have any friends I could confide with), and needa go back to studying (fuck she's on my mind again).

716,"So all of this started last year in September, but it is a very long Story. I'm gonna shorten it as much as I can.

I always loved my bigger sister, but she fucked up really bad, as she had some problems with her husband and practically cheated on him. My family was not into that and we hadn't had contact for 3 months or so. In that 3 months she changed into a whole new person. Instead of accepting her fault, she was convinced she did nothing wrong and blamed and accused everyone of our family for not supporting her (including me). She said some other things which really broke my heart, so after that I kinda realized sth was wrong. But she has been so different since. She now hangs with really weird people, party's all the time (she recently turned 32), is irresponsible and acts like a foolish child. 
On her birthday (which annoyed me really much, but too much story) she told me that I am the person she loves the most, that she would die for me, not even her kids are as important as me, etc. 

The problem is, I don't see her in the same way anymore. I just see her as someone who sometimes pays for my lunch money and takes me out to eat fancy dinner. She became so self-centered and egoistic that I don't even want to be around her anymore. 
I just miss the old times with her, when she really cared for the people around her and when we lived as a real family. It breaks my heart and stresses me so much, I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR: My sister turned into to a whole new person, kinda a bad person. I got no emotions left her other than sadness, anger and so on.",10Jul2019,4

Before she left I thought she was growing away from me so really tried and am afraid she now hates me, do I text her so when she gets back she knows I was thinking about her or do I wait for her to text me to see if she actually values me as a friend, or do I text her friend and see if she has said anything about me.",10Jul2019,1

2) We played pool and got drinks. He  and I did get into a minor argument about the past. We kissed. I don't  think he was upset over it because afterwards he dropped me off at the  bus stop, waited for it to come, and when I got on the bus he texts,  ""Comfortable on the bus? Let me know when you get home!"" We chatted for  awhile via text. This was Sunday.

3)I  texted him Wednesday at 12 am what he was doing on Saturday and I would  love to see him. It's 3:22 pm in New York now. I'm gonna be honest I  still love him. I hope he wants to see me and I just need advice on how  to stop over thinking and anxiety.

this woman and I’m trying to figure out what happened with her regarding a relationship she had...

just going entirely off facebook; she posted a status saying she was excited to change her last name to Mrs so-and-so... this was around the time she would turn 18 years old..

then a week or so later a friend wrote on her wall congratulating her for married life..

then sometime either before or after that she posted saying “only God can judge me for what I have done”

...and then a couple weeks later made a post about how much she loves her boyfriend... she didn’t use the word husband...

721,"My very close friend (25F) recently moved from my hometown in Missouri (where she was going to school) back to her hometown in Texas following a bad breakup. She doesn’t have any friends really in Texas so the breakup was really hard on her. Months have passed and her and the guy have patched things up and she has had a trip back to Missouri planned for awhile now. Flights were booked well in advance, she had people picking her up from the airport, even posted on her snapchat story about getting all packed. That was sunday, and the last anyone’s heard from her was Monday morning. Her phone has been off since then, and her flight was supposed to come in this morning and she was not on it.

I’m very concerned there’s been some sort of foul play. The only family she really has in Texas is her dad who is extremely verbally abusive and has some weird obsession with her and her looks, her weight, etc. He’s always come across so creepy and almost like he’s grooming her. I’ve  never met him but her boyfriend has, and the dad absolutely hated the boyfriend.

We’ve both reached out to him with no response. Something just feels so off, I can’t think of a single thing that would willingly keep my friend from coming back, she has been talking every day for a month about how excited she is to come back and finally be with her friends again.

722,"I am a female\[25F\] and I have been sharing my flat with a lady\[30F\] for the past one and a half years. This lady is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and since I am a lesbian I was naturally attracted to her. Towards the beginning of our friendship, I have often found myself on the verge of asking her for a kiss on the mouth, but I was able to restrain myself at the last moment. All day long, I would dream of her well toned physique, her flawless face and her sweet smell.

Gradually, I started repressing these feelings by working more than usual. I was scared that I would end up causing her some discomfort which would ruin our friendship forever. Things went along quite smoothly. In fact, her presence around me impacted me in a positive way. I excelled at work and earned a promotion too.

My roommate played squash in her college days and has the physique of an athlete. She is atleast five inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than me. She habitually mocked me for being ""skinny"" and physically weak. I brushed of these jibes quite sportingly until yesterday.

I had had a difficult day at work yesterday and her taunts got to me. She boasted about how she expected to defeat me easily in a wrestling match. I felt so humiliated that I offered her a bet that she wouldn't. She replied that she was ready to bet me ""anything"".

Surprisingly, I won the wrestling game and my friend was positively exhausted at the end of it. She admitted defeat and was extremely angry with herself for losing but I was intent on claiming my bet. All the physical contact with her might have excited me because I went on to give her a few oil-checks in her bottom as soon as she was lying on her stomach. She pleaded with me to let her go but I went on give her one more of those disgusting anal probes before eventually releasing her. She remarked that she would think twice before challenging me in the future. **I am ashamed of the way I have behaved.** It is true that I did not take of her clothes, but I understand that my actions might be considered sexual harassment or even rape. I apologised to her several times but she merely lauughed it off.She complained of bit of soreness in her bottom. I offered to take her to the doctor and confess immediately but she felt that was unnecessary.She kept on telling me how embarrassing the defeat was.

I know I have behaved like an animal. My roommate might suffer from lifelong trauma. The worst bit is that she hasn't moved out yet. Should I report myself to the police? I am distraught.",10Jul2019,1
724," 

Firstly, I’d like to clarify that I’m writing on behalf of a dear friend of mine. She does know that I am posting here; I did ask her first. However, she asked me to use an alternate name, so we’ll call her Jess. Before I jump into this post I have to say that Jess is genuinely a kind soul. She’s the type of person who tries as hard as she can to stay happy and cheery on the outside in order to light up the faces of those around her. Everywhere she goes she makes friends, and she is loved dearly by many around her, including her teachers, best friends, and their parents. She isn’t what you would call a “rebellious problem child”; she doesn’t drink or do drugs, despite that being the norm for people who have similar histories as her. 

The main issue in this post is that Jess has been accepted to UT but cannot pay for it. Unfortunately, Jess rolled a 1 for family. Her biological father physically abused her as a child and her parents went through a nasty divorce, with her and the other children at the center of the issue. There are so many issues with the parents it’s ridiculous- but I’ll stick with the most important ones. They won’t contribute a penny to her education- not the most outrageous on its own, but considering the fact that the father works a very, very high paying job at a hospital, and the fact that it’s clear the family spends money extremely irresponsibly and in a carefree manner, it’s almost laughable when they tell her “they have better things to spend their money on.” In addition, another reason the father cites for not helping is that “he went to college all on his own, too”. Well, the difference there is that he got everything funded by FAFSA. He didn’t have to take any loans. Jess doesn’t get any money from FAFSA because of the father’s high paying job. 

“But Jess, why don’t you file as an independent so you can get all that FAFSA money too?” Believe me, if she could leave that house, she would’ve, in an instant. Her parents have driven her to this several times- she reached a point where she could not take the emotional abuse, so she left. See, Jess was diagnosed with severe PTSD at age 17, which was induced by the years of trauma induced by her biological father. She was r\*\*\*d 3 times as a child, and once more at age 17, and heavily abused by her father as a child. Anyway, the reason she is stuck is because she is on her father’s insurance plan, which allows her to get the medication, therapy, and treatment she needs to stay alive and mentally grounded for free. The combined cost of this medication, according to Jess, is upwards of 100k a year, so she would be losing money and her health would suffer greatly.

The insurance is the trump card that allows her parents to essentially make her do whatever they want. They’ve threatened to take away the insurance before if she ever left again, so now she has to endure every shitty thing they do to her. I can sit here and rant about all the things they do that would qualify them to be the world's worst parents for ages, but for time’s sake, ill list the important ones. 

They blame her for getting r\*\*\*d

They constantly do things that trigger her PTSD flashbacks despite constant warnings from her therapist and Jess herself

They won’t let her leave the house and sometimes go to school because they need her to take care of THEIR kids(age 2 and 4)

They refuse to take care of their kids and place all the burden on Jess

They always yell at them for little reason, or overreact to small things

She has a suspicion they won't help her with anything so she has to stay at home and take care of the kids, since it’s convenient for them

They never allowed her to get a job K-12 because they told her she needed to take care of the kids

They disregard and belittle her problems and concerns and medical needs, sometimes withholding medicine or refusing to take her to the doctor

They frequently go partying or doing things for fun while Jess is stuck at home

She can’t leave and yet she has to- she says she can’t take another year and she’s well past the breaking point. Her parents won’t pay for her schooling. She can’t leave Austin, because that’s where all her therapists and doctors are. She desperately wants to go to UT- it’s been her dream since forever- so she wants to get a loan for her tuition and room and board(she is only receiving 2,750 dollar per semester through unsubsidized and subsidized federal loans). But, her parents just dropped it on her that they don’t want to cosign a loan either, even though it wouldn’t exactly be financially dangerous for them. They reason that “they could lose their house” they co-signed.

She hasn't been sitting idly. Jess also works a job now since she is 18. She recently applied for and got a credit card too, and is in the process of building credit. She's applied to 17 scholarships and counting.

So what now, reddit? It’s tricky, because leaving that house is turning into an absolute necessity in order to preserve her health. UT really seems like the way out right now- education is the path to self sustenance. It’s been her dream since she was a child, and I’m positive she can excel with the resources and support that UT has to offer. She spent a year at a community college to save money, and did well in all her classes. She was also accepted to UT in the first wave of one of the most competitive majors at UT. Whatever way you look at it, she is a fantastic student, and I know that if she was at a place where she felt safe, in a non-hostile living arrangement, she would do even better.

It really pains me to see this happen to truly, one of the best, most positive, resilient people I know. It’s just unfair that someone like her could do so many good things and make so many people happy and yet still continue to be let down time after time, so I’m reaching out in the hope that even something little might help. She doesn’t know what to do and we’re struggling to keep hope that a light might finally shine in this dark situation. Any advice on what to do? And if not, a few kind words would make her day.

We are aware that if we had seen this coming, she would have acted much quicker. We aren't really looking for comments on what she could've or should've done earlier, but rather, what her options are now. 

Thank you for reading, reddit! Please help, it would go really far for her to see even a little bit of support or advice, or just to know that someone cares.

726,"I’ve lived with my dad under full custody for 5 years now. It’s been nothing but stress since then. 

I’m the only female in a house of four (my dad and my two older brothers)  I’m the youngest (16 and my two brothers are 18&amp;19) and smallest (5’6” while the males are above 6 foot). I don’t have a problem with my oldest brother but it’s the youngest I do have it with as well as my dad. 

My brother (H) used to hit me. Since he’s turned 18 though he hasn’t yet. But the thing is he bullies me. I have mental health problems (body dysmorphia, depression and anxiety) and a few times in the past my brother has told me to kill myself or that I’m a waste of space. I attempted 3 times before (my dad hasn’t taken me to hospital cause it would danger his reputation as a good father to the court) and he holds this against me and had said before that he wishes that I didn’t fail. He’s so two faced aswell , he says that he wants to get along with me and he acts like he cares to my dad but when it comes to being downstairs alone with him he treats me like a bully would in a schoolyard. 

Another problem is that I can’t eat in the house without getting shouted at. My brothers have things for their packed lunches for work but if I grab a biscuit that was meant to be theirs it’s as if I’ve stolen the Crown Jewels. 

I’m sick and tired of arguments aswell as my Dad’s controlling behaviour. I can’t go anywhere without my dad tracking where I go. When I’ve confronted him on this, he’s said that he was only checking up on me (I’ve been to school or out with friends and turned find friends off just so I could see if he was constantly checking and he was). 

I’m tired of living in this house which is full of arguments and so much stress. I’ve tried to see if I could stay with my grandma but I would only be interfering with her life and I don’t want that. I want to see if I can get emergency placement from the council (at 16 I think you can be in the UK) or put into the care system. I only have two more years left at home until I’m moving away and not coming back because of all the stress that has happened.

It’s been 4 months and she’s managed to get a part time job, but it’s not enough to even rent a room for herself in the city. Never expected her to be here for this long, but also didn’t set boundaries prior to her move. Was under the impression that she had a sizable amount in savings (over $10k) and would be able to afford to supplement her income with a portion of that savings until she secured a decent paying job. Just recently found out that she’s blown through all of the savings and has nothing left. 

Husband will be out of town for most of August and first part of September, so he and I agreed that she could stay until he gets back. After that she will need to move out. We have a 700sq ft house and it’s just not big enough for 3 people, and she’s currently using his office as a bedroom. He works from home, so this has been a major disruption for him. He’s been very accommodating though, hasn’t gotten upset about it and just finds other places to do his work most of the time. 

I don’t want her to have to move back home for a couple reasons; it’s a small town, not very welcoming to people who are different and we’d feel like this was all a waste. But I also can’t continue to let her live for free in my home while also not contributing in any way. I have to set the boundary, she has to move out, but I also want to know how I can help her besides encouraging her to get a second job or a more permanent one altogether. And maybe helping her setup a budget.  I also have a hard time with expressing myself in a more polite manner - I’ve been told my whole life I don’t have a filter and exactly what I’m thinking in my head is what comes out of my mouth most times.

I know how the title sounds, but just hear me out.

I struggle with mental illness, and I was raised by a chronic pessimist. I've spent my short life surrounded by people who radiate worry, grief, and overall bad juju. A lot of it isn't/wasn't their fault but that's just how it was. And now that's how I am: I worry constantly. I am always seeking reassurance and searching for solutions to problems that are either unimportant or unrealistic. As one would put it, I bitch a lot. It's put a strain on my relationships and it makes me feel terrible, which only continues the cycle. A little problem to someone else is a huge problem to me, and yet, I struggle to understand other people's problems and have to try hard to comfort or help others without somehow making it about me or otherwise making them feel unheard. I will admit that I often make everything about myself, and I feel I have a hovering cloud of negativity above me like a balloon I can't let go of and I often accidentally let it stray away above others' heads. I've often had people ask me ""why can't you just be happy?"" and tell me I seem to be finding things to be upset about when that's the very last thing I'm doing and I would so much rather be happy, too. I am often happy, or at least content, but I still manage to complain. Instead of their being a silver lining on a dark cloud, there is always a bit of rain in my soft, white, happy clouds. 

I don't want to know how to be happy. I know it's impossible to explain to someone else how to be happy. I don't need recommendations on seeing a therapist, going to church, or exercising. I don't need you to tell me I'm fine and I can't help it and to just be myself. I need to know, from other people who suffer from mental illness or general pessimistic thoughts, etc: how do you find balance between negative and positive? How do I help myself refrain from seeing everything so black and white, and attempting to force everyone else to? How do I learn to radiate positivity, comfort, and calm even when I feel everything is falling apart? How do I stop pouring my emotions onto other people and causing them more emotional labor than they should have to perform for me, and how do I healthily (without selfish, or apathetic behavior) be supportive to others? 

In general, how do you ""be happy"" even when you're not? And how do you make others ""happy"" when they're not, and you maybe are or aren't?",10Jul2019,3

750,"I posted about how my daughter is being made to take a swimming unit in middle and high school gym. I found a good article that sums up why this is bad

&amp;#x200B;

""First, swimming in the middle of the day poses many obstacles and is a major issue for some students. Having to jump into a cold pool, potentially get their hair wet, and then shower during the school day throws students out of their routine. Furthermore, changing into a swimming suit in a crowded open space like locker rooms can be incredibly uncomfortable for many teens. The swimming locker rooms are much smaller than the gym locker rooms, and they force students to crowd closer together. Changing in this environment is damp, uncomfortable and generally quite dirty. Dirt is tracked in through shoes and leaves brown pools on the floor. This is unhygienic.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, coed gym classes pose problems because many students feel uncomfortable to swim in front of their opposite gendered peers. In today’s society, there is a heavy emphasis on the perfect body, which leads to inevitable body comparisons. Conant should encourage positive body images rather than putting kids in a situation where there would be criticism and judgment. Swimming requires little clothing, and it exposes insecurities for both males and females. It makes students reevaluate their self worth based on their physical features, and many students make excuses to avoid swimming for these very reasons. Schools should not encourage these kinds of lessons, especially when there are better uses for the allotted gym period.

751,"I'm 18 years old and I used to work at McDonald's for a few months, long story short I saved what I could and quit that job cause I hated it, it was taking a toll on my mental health.

It's been a few months since I quit and I blew my savings up being stupid.
I've been trying to get a job ever since, I've tried everything that I can that won't fuck with me mental health (no fast food) from gamestop, Hollister,American eagle, to even local stores around my area. I've tried so much but it never goes well, I never get a call back even when I call them for a follow up after a few weeks from the application to show interest and that I want to work there. Even when they write down my name to call they never do. 

My resume only shows my one job which was McDonald's but it's something at least.


At this point I only have 0.50¢ in my bank account and I'm over the edge and don't know what to do, I have anxiety because I feel like I'll never get another job and I never wanna go back to McDonald's cause it really was awful for my mental health.

 My phone service went down so it's harder to even have hope for a call back, I have to use wifi call now.

I need advice on what jobs to apply for, how to seem more suitable for the job, just anything that can help.

760,"I currently am a receptionist at a salon in New York. The job was great for a little bit because I was making good money. There are a lot of downsides to this job though. There are 13 employees here and I am the only one who does not receive ANY benefits. Everyone else gets paid sick days, vacation days, and holidays. Not me! It’s always 80 degrees in the salon. Also, I can work a 12 hour day with no break. I almost fainted a couple weeks ago from staring at the computer so long. I really hate this job now especially because there’s no room to grow.

I am a licensed esthetician and makeup artist and I recently began doing SFX makeup on indie films. I took off 2 days from the salon to do it and it was an amazing experience. The producer hired me for a week long film in August and I just told my boss I need off for then. She immediately ran to my other boss (her husband) and told him, and the face he made when he heard made me so uncomfortable. He acted like he was so surprised that they hired me again. 

Anyway, as you can tell, I hate my job at the salon. The only benefit is consistent money. I can’t keep taking off from this job when I come across films to work on. Getting a different job scares me as well because I ultimately want to do film/tv/commercial makeup for the rest of my life and I would have to take off a lot if I get jobs.

761,"I lost my job the week of 4th of July, and I started applying to everything immediately afterwards. The kinds of jobs didn't matter, I have bills to pay. I wasn't hearing anything back from anyone (it being a holiday week) so I just kept applying to everything, even jobs I had no qualifications for. 

Fast forward to this week, I've had 5 interviews, all went very well. They all put offers on the table, and I have some good opportunities. However, there are a few things going on with each job.

Right now I guess the smartest decision is to go with a machining company that wants to hire me starting monday, the only catch is that it's second shift and I DO NOT like the idea of getting out of work at 12AM. I interviewed at a warehouse position yesterday, and I absolutely loved the climate there, the hours are fantastic and its a huge company that gives amazing benefits. They aren't getting back to me until friday about the beginning processes, and I would like to start work immediately. 

My dream company I've wanted to work for going on a few years now finally took my resume and set up an interview for monday, and that's just an interview so I don't want to decline every other offer right now to wait for them. The job that would net me the most hours is trugreen. I told them I'd let them know by friday if I would take the job. I've seen some pretty awful things about working there however. I never like to form an opinion about anything until I experience it first hand, however all signs are saying run.

So to consolidate all of what I have just said and make my point here about why I need advice; What do I do? Do I take the miserable 2nd shift since it's immediate, wait for the phone call friday for the place that I loved the employees and enviroment at (also incredible hours, 5am-2pm mon-fri), or wait for this other company I've waited years for?",10Jul2019,1

775,"The story I'm about to tell is probably the most bizarre thing that's ever happened to me. I fully understand why someone looking in may think that I'm lying, but for the sake of this thread lets just assume I'm not. I have tons of proof that exonerates myself from any legal trouble but I'm not sharing that on reddit. 

The person involved here is an ex gf from 7 years ago. Up until this point we were on good terms, and even considered talking again, so as far as I know there is nothing wrong between us. 

About 4 months ago I got a ton of random phone calls from my brother and friends, as well as texts asking me why I'm harassing her. I was very confused. My cell phones speaker was broken at the time so I had to drive home and borrow a friends phone to call her. After talking with her for 3 hours, confused and shocked, she explained that someone using random spoofed (later found to be reported scam numbers) had been making threatening phone calls and texts to her. I explained that I had no idea who it was. The person also got into her insta and I think Facebook so I instructed her to change her passwords to something nobody knows, we left the call on good terms and had agreed to FaceTime later in the month to catch up. 

2 weeks later I texted her and asked if she wanted to FaceTime with me, no reply and green text. This was weird because I know she has an iPhone. I figured that maybe she just changed her mind about catching up and I forgot about it.

2 weeks after that I got a random text message from a phone number I don't know that had a screenshot of my GPS location in snap maps. I was confused but ignored it because I live in a transient town where a lot of the people I talk to aren't added into my phone, figured it was just a friend or something. Later on in the day, I got curious and asked the texter why they sent me the messages. The person accused me of harassing the gf, stated that the caller ID was from my area, and said she can ""prove it"" using my GPS. I was confused, and at this point linked it to the previous month. I spoke with the person quite a bit and explained that I don't know what's going on. I told her that the next day I will get the phone records pulled from my place of work (the caller ID origin) and show her. The next day, I did, and showed her. She was skeptical. Later that night I received a phone call from a number that I didn't recognize. Like usual, I answered. The voice on the phone was female and yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY WON'T YOU LEAVE HER ALONE"", to which I replied, ""I don't know what you're talking about, everyone is calling me accusing me of things and I'm doing nothing"". The person then hangs up.

The next day, I get a text from yet another random number stating that they have ""proof"" that it's me. I get nervous because I don't understand what kind of proof they can have, seeing as I haven't done anything. After some back and forth the girl sends me a very suspicious 7 second voice clip of me talking on the phone - its the same sentence I uttered earlier in the day when I got the random yelling phone call. This is fucking weird. The person who is doing this is recording me and playing it back to make it seem like I'm the person doing all this shit. I called the RCMP to file a police report, because I was scared that it would continue. 

Later that night at about 11 pm I received a phone call from a random number. I figured I have nothing to lose and that the person might slip up, so I answered but didn't say anything. Turns out it is the police department from the town my ex gf lives in. They're calling me to ask what is going on. I explain what happened earlier in the day and hang up the phone with the explicit instructions that they won't contact me and I won't contact them. 

The next day (or a few days later, I can't remember) I get more texts from my ex gfs friends stating that I need to leave her alone and stop harassing her. I have not made contact with her, and or her friends since I was told not to, and before that I had never talked to her friends, and only talked to her earlier in the month - previous to that I hadn't made contact with her in months. At this point I just think it's annoying, someone clearly is mad at her and is trying to get to her through me. But things get way worse. 

Over the course of the next 2 months I get phone calls, text messages, and emails both from random accounts and from her (although I don't know if it's actually her). This is when a 3rd person get's involved, lets call her Emily. Emily is supposedly my ex gfs new partner. I have known for 10 years that my ex was bisexual, but to my knowledge had never had a gf. Emily was very vocal about me not ever talking to my ex again. Emily is also the person in the video who RECEIVED the fake phone call from me, using the recording of my voice. I have the video and I know it's her I've confirmed her identity on an active facebook account.

Fast forward another 1 month and I'm getting emails from my ex begging ""me"" to stop harassing her. I still have not talked to her in months except for when she has reached out to me. During that month I went travelling with a friend down into the US where I had no cell reception for most of the trip, including long 8 hour drives where no phone was being used. During this time she was getting harassed. She emailed me once again asking me why I'm doing this, to which I replied that I'm in the US on a road trip and that the various other people I'm with can confirm that I haven't used my phone in over 8 hours. She didn't care and didn't want to hear it. 

During this time she also sent me an email stating that her new gf Emily overheard me during a phone call to the police, a call in which I admitted that I'm the one harassing them and in return for them dropping investigating me I would stop. I have never called the police in that city, and even if I had there would be no situation where the gf would conveniently be able to listen in. I thought I had them here, because I all I had to do was call the police and get them to confirm that the phone call never happened, because the only possibilities are that either a: Emily didn't hear anything and is lying, or b: Emily heard someone she thought was me and was mistaken. When I called the police to confirm with them, they told me there is no situation where Emily would have been able to hear the conversation, so that only leaves possibility a, they also confirmed that nobody using my name had ever called, and that there were no active cases against me which contradicts what Emily had been saying earlier. 

I am still almost certain it's her (Emily) doing this to me, from what I can gather my theory is that: My ex gf may have confided in Emily that she still has feelings for me, or that she was hurt from our past relationship, and so Emily is trying her best to make sure the ex never talks to me again. Most of the harassment is homophobic in nature. The only time that anyone has EVER heard my voice involved, and the voice is the main ""evidence"" against me, is when Emily is the only person who has heard it. 

Recently, the ex gf has emailed me stating that if ""I"" don't stop harassing her she is going to publish all the homophobic screenshots, emails, etc. Most of these things I haven't even seen so I don't know what the person is saying. I replied to this email CCing my mother, father, brother, and stated that everyone in my family knows because the police have been to my house twice and we don't know what is going on. I got no response.

I don't know what to do, since this so so convoluted and hard to prove there is no way that I can see to prove I'm not doing anything, I am nervous that I will be framed as a homophobic stalker psycho. 

On top of this, I feel as though because I am male and there have been lots of instances where crazy males have harassed their exes that nobody believes me, it's such a weird fucking story.",10Jul2019,2

During her attacks she altered the captions for hundreds of Pinterest pins (images relating to my life/job) to include keywords relating to my personal details (full name, location, home country, workplace etc.) as well has hugely defamatory keywords like ‘Rapist’ and ‘Pedofile’. This means that when you Google my name plus anything related to my life the only thing that really pops up is these pins and the search results are terrible.

I’m 24 and I got genital herpes about 2 years ago. I have had 1 initial outbreak that was incredibly minor and haven’t had anything happen since (and most likely won’t have another outbreak), because HSV1 prefers the mouth region. I recently disclosed to a guy I had gone on 4 dates over the course of a month (we never did anything that put him at risk). He decided that my HSV1 was a dealbreaker. I completely understand, but I’ve been pretty devastated this past week, I had to take off work on Tuesday. This was the first guy who has ever showed a real interest in me: before I disclosed he said it was the first time in a long time that he had developed a physical and emotional attraction to someone.

Our first time having sex, we ""both"" lost our virginity to each other, after dating for a year. We've now been married for almost three years. (Including our marriage, we've been together for five years). 

A week ago, my husband's old friend found him on Facebook and wrote him a long paragraph. 

She told him that she found out she was pregnant, almost ten years ago. She had the baby, and didn't want to tell him because she didn't want to disrupt his life over one night that shouldn't have happened, But the child has been questioning who his father is. She said that if he wanted nothing to do with their child, she would understand, but if he did, she's willing to get a paternity test if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

He came to me, crying, telling me that he was so sorry, he had lied to me, but that he didn't remember it. He said that he woke up beside her after a party one night, and neither of them could remember a thing from how much they had drank. 

Instantly, I felt disgusted. I felt gross. For five years, I was under the impression that I was the first person he had sex with. I know, he can't help that he was too drunk to remember, but if he thought he had sex with someone else, he should have told me. I've had unprotected sex with him, I've sucked his dick, and I can't get the idea of his dick inside of another woman- out of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I've never felt more confused in my life. For the last week, I've stayed at my parents house. I'm not mad, I'm hurt. He's been texting me, sometimes I don't text back. I feel absolutely disgusting in my own body right now. At first, the texts would be him apologizing, now it's him trying to act as if nothing has happened, ""How are you? How was work? I miss you. I love you. I can't wait to see you again."" 

I don't know what to think. I'm not upset that he had sex- but that he told me I was the first person he's had sex with- which is why I would comfortably have unprotected sex with him(I'm on birth control until we're ready to have a child). 

&amp;#x200B;

I love him so much, but it's all I think about. My heart hurts for the child that's been without a father for ten years. 

I really need advice right now, guys. I don't know what to do. Am I being dramatic?",10Jul2019,1
788,I'm a student at a university in Germany. Currently I'm in the sixth semester and still haven't made any friends. People that experienced something similar: How did you dealt with that situation? Does life get better after university?,10Jul2019,2
789,"I currently have a decent paying entry level IT position, I plan to move out this year at some point, and i'm taking in all of my options. Currently i'm enrolled in a college that's not too far from home and right next to work, but I have 2 friends that live an hours away that are looking for a new roommate, and of course i'm next in line. I'd love to move in with them, and I already know their habits as roommates as i'm there quite alot, and I hear alot of stories, complaints, etc, so that's not really an issue, they've been living there for a year already. Pretty much i'm debating on keeping where i'm at right now, and finding a place to live near my current employment, or moving in with them an hour away, transferring both colleges (or commute an hour) and to a different store, which has it's own whole process aswell, it's not just a ""i'd like to transfer."" If I move in, i'd likely live there for a year-year and a half. I'd love to move in with them, but i'd have to jump through so many hoops to actually make that viable.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue with this is, if I go through they whole application process of transferring and hoping they'll actually let me, after we all split from the current location, do I ""attempt"" to go back to the previous location, or try to find a place to live near my new place of employment. Cost of living in this area is a bit more expensive than where i'm currently located. I also feel somewhat guilty ""ditching"" those I work with currently. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to do this, but it's a huge leap of faith.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Move in with friends, gain the benefits of this, but transfer job locations and 1 hour commute to school (or look at transferring), or stay at the same job and school and attempt to find a place to live alone.",10Jul2019,1
790,"I’m 25, had ambitions to be a famous musician and had a lot of talent/traction in my early 20s/late teens.

Fast forward to a few days, I ask her what her parents told her, no response, i figured she must have been busy but I texted her again and she left me on seen. What does this mean? I mean i know for a fact I won’t be able to crash with her and that’s perfectly fine, however, why would she feel the need to not tell me anything at all?

793,"Hello, I need some advice because I feel extremely confused and I don’t know what to do. 

Okay so, this night I was on my mom’s phone because I had to thank someone real quick and I didn’t have her number. She was okay with this and watched me do it. 

When I sent the text, I accidentally clicked out of the chat and into another chat (her most recent one, don’t ask me how, my hands are spastic sometimes.)

It was a conversation with a man I’ve never heard of before, and I know all my parents’ friends. I had a quick glimpse of the chat and there were so many kissy emojis. 
My mom saw I was in a different chat and she FREAKED OUT. She grabbed the phone outta my hands as fast as she could and turned the screen away from me really quick. 

This really confused me and my brain didn’t really process what just happened. A few minutes later she’s on her phone and I catch a quick glimpse of her recent chats. The man, who was her most recent chat, was not there anymore. 
SHE DELETED THE CHAT. 

I got really scared and went upstairs to investigate. I googled his name and it turned out he’s her boss. I found his LinkedIn profile. 

Why would they be sending hearts and kisses to eachother?? And if it was innocent, why would she freak out so badly about this?

I’m so confused, idk what to do. Should I warn my dad? Ask my mom? If I ask my mom, she’ll definitely just say it’s nothing and then go on with her day.

Please help, my mom and dad were/are so happily married, where did this come from, I’m scared.",10Jul2019,2
794,"Hello!

I am someone that has always enjoyed creative things like writing, art and fashion but never pursued education or careers in any of these fields. I was told growing up that art/creative fields were not appropriate to pursue and 'not everyone can be JK Rowling' when I was in highschool. I now have a degree in social sciences and recently left my job in the mental health field because I realized it made me unhappy and isolated. 

Now, I'm pushing 30 and feel like I should pursue the things that made me happy all along, but where I'm conflicted is about my age and relative lack of skill and experience in creative things. Does anyone that made a later in life, drastic career change have any advice about how I can pursue what I love? I've never really cared about being a famous artist or anything, I'd just like to be able to support myself. I don't glamourize the 'starving artist' trope, but after having worked a number of years in a stressful field that made me depressed, anxious, and hate myself, I'm willing to live a lot more bare bones if it means I feel creatively fulfilled. I feel inspired by so many things but feel like I don't necessarily have the skill to fully realize them (for example, I think about clothes or comics I'd love to design and create, but I don't even know how to sew and haven't made comics since I was a kid). Sorry if this is rambly or unclear in any way! Any advice or insight is appreciated!

tl;dr: Is it too late for me to pursue a creative career with no degree in a creative field and few accomplishments?",10Jul2019,2
795,"I don’t know if I’m bi or gay. I have a boyfriend who I love so much. He makes me burst with joy and he’s all I think about. I love cuddling and holding hands and stuff, but I am way more turned on by women. I can see myself marrying this guy, it’s honestly like we are soulmates. Im just so confused. I have always fantasised about being with a guy romantically, and the odd time sexually, but with women its different. I get really nervous and giddy which I didn’t get with my boyfriend, and I think I would enjoy sex with them more. But this man is everything to me.

797,"I am 21 years old and I need serious help.
During my early years in school I found it very difficult to focus and used to leave my homework to the last minute, and I found my organisation skills really poor. I was concerned that I had ADHD but this was dismissed when I spoke to my siblings about it and basically said it was an excuse for me being ‘lazy’.
However all my problems started when I went to university 3 years ago. During my time at university, I was really struggling with my course and having issues concentrating and focusing. I went to seek help with my university and I was referred to a psychiatrist, in which I was diagnosed with ADHD. I ended up failing my course 3 times and withdrew from uni, however I really loved the social aspect and being away from my strict parents, in which I still lived away at uni and worked part time and lied to my parents about my progress and only told them I disliked the course last year, which was 1 year until I was meant to finish my course. 
They were obviously upset with my decision and kept advising me to finish off my degree but I didn’t let them know the amount of times I failed so this wasn’t possible. I know this is a terrible thing I did and something I really regret, but with them being so strict and not listening to me about my ADHD diagnosis made me really depressed and I closed them off with sharing my feelings.

We then agreed for me to find full time work through an apprenticeship but even then I am procrastinating a lot when doing my applications and sending them off, and up until now from last year I haven’t received any offers. ADHD is having such a terrible impact on my life. I can't do anything without being distracted or even forgetting to do it It is so severe that I have technically procrastinated for the past 2 years and have achieved nothing, and I feel that I am becoming a huge burden to my parents. 

Every time my parents speak to me either advising me or laying down how disappointed they are with me for some reason I can’t take it in. I do listen to them but I honestly can’t take it in, I don’t know why but I honestly just stare at them whilst they speak to me and my mind just wanders in a different place, not taking in anything and I am desperate to just understand where they are coming from. I don’t know what is wrong with me, I just feel really confused and unmotivated with anything, even to listen to anybody’s advice, even though I need to turn my life around but I don’t see it happening soon. I just feel myself feeling worse as the days go on and I am very lost.

Can anybody help me please, I really don’t know what to do.",10Jul2019,1
798,"So I'm a recent college graduate and I feel like I'm stuck, or that I'm wasting my time.  I absolutely LOVED college, I did really well and met a lot of amazing people, and if I could snap my fingers and go back to being an undergraduate student, I would.  But I can't, so here I am.

I know I want to go to grad school, but I decided to take a year off, mostly because I figured I'd be able to put together a much better application that way.  However, that means I had to find something to do during that year off, on top of applying to grad schools.  This is where the problem is: I am a pretty lazy person.  Like I said, I did a great job in school and I worked really hard there, but when it comes to actual jobs, I tend to hate them.  I'd rather sit at home all day and write or read my books or go exploring.  I'm sure everyone feels this way for the most part, but it's become a hurdle for me, to the point where I'm starting to wonder if it's indicative of some kind of deeper problem.  I'm privileged and lucky enough to be able to live at home rent free, so my life is pretty easy right now, relatively speaking, but I still need money, especially since the plan is to save up for my time in grad school (god willing).

Anyway, I got a job about a month ago at a dog daycare place.  I'm working part time (about 25 hours a week), and making pretty decent money for what I'm doing.  I didn't want to get a full-time job that would turn into a career, because I know myself and wanted to avoid settling and never going to grad school, so I figured a part time job wouldn't be a bad idea (especially since I'm not paying rent right now).

The thing is, I hate having a job, as I said above.  The feeling that I'm selling my time to someone else is really disheartening, and it's taking its toll on me.  I'm really starting to question my own value and my own life choices, and I especially miss college life now.  

The job itself isn't too bad, but after a month of working there, I'm not sure it's for me.  I know I need a job (and I definitely *should* have a job, as a member of society and all that), but I don't know what I'd do otherwise.  And on top of that, I'm worried that my dislike for my current work is only a result of laziness and a dislike for work in general, not anything particular to the job itself.  I don't want to quit and start somewhere else if I'm just gonna run into the same problems, and I *certainly* shouldn't quit just to sit around and do nothing (even if deep down, that's what I feel I want to do).

I guess the advice I need is this: how do I know if my current struggles are just a result of laziness that I have to get over, or if I really should be looking for something else for the next year or so?  I'm starting to feel more open to the idea of a full-time job, but again, I don't want to just move somewhere else where I'll also feel disheartened.  If I decide to quit and move on, I want to be sure it's because I'm not into my current job, not just out of laziness (which I definitely need to work on, but that's another beast).

Anything you can offer is greatly appreciated.  Thank you",10Jul2019,2

801,"Hey guys,

My grandpa passed away in February, I am not his granddaughter by blood, but he raised my Mom, and he's the only grandpa I ever knew. We were very close, and one thing that really brought us even closer was our love for the Culinary life. He was a Chef for many, many years, and a damn good one. I'm an aspiring Chef, inspired by the women in my family cooking home cooked meals for many years, and my Grandpa's career and love for cooking. He always discussed leaving all his recipes to me when he passed on, I used to ask for a recipe every now and then, but he always said ""A Chef never shares his recipes. When I pass away, they will be all yours."" 
Right after he passed his biological son came in, and hauled away A BUNCH of his property, including my Grandpa's recipe book. He's always been cold, money hungry and resented us, for being loved so much and not being ""ACTUAL BLOOD"". My Grandpa never filled out a will, he always thought he had more time. So it was not ever written and authorized who got what parts of his estate, however Grandpa always discussed these matters with family on who would get what. So I know his son knows I was supposed to get those recipes, and how much it meant to both of us, that I got them. 
My Grandpa and I shared many things, but I always wanted to have all his great recipes to carry on his legacy, now more than anything, I want his recipes to feel close to him again. We are the only two in our family in this line of work. His death has really broke me. 

So I ask for advice, how do I lightly tread on and go about asking his son for the recipe book, without seeming greedy, pushy, or pissing him off?

803,"Hey guys, i’ve been going around this problem for about a year: My calling has always been creating tech tools to improve human life, so my dream job is to work as a designer/creator, i want to bring my ideas to life.

To narrow down this question i’ll also say that my área of interest is technology applied to humans.

I’ll ilustrate with some examples:
1. If you ever played crysis i’m fascinated with the potential an exosuit like that one could bring to human capabilities
2. The development of tools that help in space exploration/colonization
3. The modification of human characteristics to make us more adaptable to different and extreme enviroments (whatever this will be by tech implants/replacement, tools or biological modifications)

This led me to the path of engineering which is my current career but i’m still bit sure. This are the careers that are still floating around my mind:

- Electronic engineering (current career)
- Mechanical engineering
- Physics
- Chemestry
- Bioengineering
- Biology

Note that i do not expect to gain the full knowledge through any studies (i believe that’s something you start to become better when you go beyond your degree and study for your goal specifically) but i want it to give me the tools and foundation to have the required knowledge to go deep into more specific and practical stuff

I’d love to hear some insight from people that have gone through this,  people who have studied the above degrees about if it could be a viable pursuit and people who studied other things and believe that fits the criteria for what i want to do",10Jul2019,1

805,"First, I need to say that this isn’t about money or anything material. It’s so much more than that. Here is some backstory to understand family dynamics. My grandma had 4 biological children (my mom from a teen pregnancy, and her 3 half siblings from a separate marriage). My Mom had a very rough life when she was young and didn’t actually know she wasn’t a full sibling until she found out at 18 that the man who was constantly abusing her wasn’t her real father. My Grandma knew about the abuse and was being abused herself but never tried to leave him. I can’t attest to her siblings because I only know of the experience she told me of herself, personally. My Mom moved out at 18 and so then when the abuse went solely to my Grandma she decided to leave him. My Mom was engaged to my Dad but my Grandma requested my Mom’s help in moving everyone east where she inherited land from her Dad so my Mom agreed to and planned to come back. My Grandma hated my Dad and called him every name possible and so he felt worried she would try to manipulate my Mom into staying East out of guilt to care for her siblings. The farm is roughly 82 acres. Well, she was one of two children and so she had to eventually buy her sister out but she and her new husband (that is where two step son’s come in totaling 6 children) started farming and it became very profitable. Well, long story short, she expected my Mom to stay but my Dad went up and they were married there because my Grandma demanded it.  Things turned terrible when my Mom hemmoraged blood on their honeymoon and so she had to be treated for cancer. She beat it and they started a life in Texas together and raise me, and my two brothers together. My Grandma would send money for birthdays but even during family summers she wasn’t exactly warm and fuzzy with us. My Mom constantly sought out my Grandma’s love and approval. She was a hardened woman so it wasn’t exactly easy to know how she truly felt about us. I loved her. I still do but it’s such a mess now. My Mom passed of Cancer in 2016. It was the hardest thing my family has ever experienced. My Grandma came down with my Mom’s two sisters throughout the time she was sick and they would help care for her. I also love my aunts very very much. They have always been such a big part of my life growing up and they truly helped make my childhood summers the best. There is no doubt in my mind they love me.  My Grandma didn’t visit after and said it was due to health problems. I had my shower for my first baby the month after and had no one from my Mom’s side come be with me. My Grandma never even called me. I called her and asked her to even be in the room with me when I had my baby but she didn’t make it down or plan to honestly. It could have been her health but I really don’t know for sure. When my grandma passed she divided her will up to provide for everyone except for my Mom’s portion which would have naturally passed to us but instead gave that to one of my aunt’s daughters who lived with her. My Mom wasn’t even mentioned as a child of hers in the will and it was dated as changed two months after my Mom passed. I was shocked and hurt. I didn’t want her money. Most of my family didn’t have anything to leave so it’s not an expectation but she didn’t even write me and my brothers a letter or anything to explain. I have two small babies and made trips East twice so she could spend time with my daughter so it isn’t like I didn’t make an effort on my part to still have a relationship and encourage a bond between them. My Dad visited 4-5 times and even helped rebuild her living room floor because it was caving in. He also spoke with her multiple times a week to check in on her because he loved her too and wanted to honor my Mom and what she would have wanted but he was very upset at finding out my Grandma didn’t mention my mom or us kids. He spoke to my aunts after talking with us. My cousin who inherited my Mom’s share was also made Executor of the Estate. She was clear in keeping things in her favor. Everyone wanted to just do what my Grandma said and it didn’t matter right or wrong. My Dad actually found a copy of the Will while looking with one of my aunts through my grandma’s things and so it wasn’t exactly planned. They kept him out of everything in meeting with the Lawyer so it made sense when he saw the Will it was because he or his family wasn’t included. It’s a big mess but they stand by what my Grandma said and nothing was changed. My aunts are actually not speaking to my Dad anymore and say it’s because he (1) read the Will when he wasn’t suppose to and (2) had the discussion with them about it too soon after my Grandma passed but since we didn’t live there that was the only time in person possible being we live 1,000 miles apart. I’ve connected with my aunts but it kills me they don’t speak to my Dad. He loves them too like his own kids (my mom was a teenager when the younger two were born). What do I do? My Aunt says she heard my Grandma provided a check to my Mom when she was sick (her inherentence?) but that can’t be true because my Dad wouldn’t look for a reason to make up being upset if we really weren’t left out and he actually had to borrow from her life insurance to be home with her. I just don’t even know what to do. He wants to write them a letter and ask for proof for the check stub just to prove his innocence but I’m not sure. I want everyone back together again. I don’t want money. I just want them to stand with my Dad in saying she was wrong. They don’t want to see what my Grandma did as wrong though and what she was used as a means to shame us (for what I’m not even sure, not living there and calling everyday?) but it’s a mess and I need advice.",10Jul2019,1

I’ve thought about quitting my job, because the stress of going in and dealing with the kinds of rushes we get always makes me panic the entire day that I have to work until I go in.

811,"I’d like to start this post out by saying how greatful I am for my boyfriends parents letting me live at their house for free. In no way is this post me trying to be rude towards them. I’m confused about what they want from my boyfriend and I because they’re making things very unclear.

So a year ago we’ll call my boyfriends parents Abby and Rick. Abby and Rick decided to let me live at their house completely free as long as I had a job. They knew my home life wasn’t the greatest at all and they see me as their own child. At first they were super nice and happy, we would have weekly hang out sessions with Abby and Rick, we’d all drink and listen to music and talk about life. Around last October Rick started to get really bad anxiety and he started to get upset with every little thing. Like if I light was left on he would stand there for a few seconds and look at us and flick the light off. We got the memo, turn lights off. Well Rick is an alcoholic, every night when he gets home he likes to go outside and get drunk I don’t have a huge problem with it because it’s his life BUT do I like it? No I’ve seen my boyfriend bawl over him being upset with how much his parents drink because he knows it’s going to kill them. 

His anxiety is causing him to drink more, he started doing less house work, he started getting black out drunk every night. And then for like months we’d have our friends over every weekend to hang out and watch movies or play video games. We didn’t do any damage to the house, we weren’t loud. Rick started to get upset every time they’d come over so we just decided to not have our friends over for a month. This caused us to basically lose touch with our friends ever since. We hadn’t seen one friend in over 3 months and one other friend could only come over at 12am because we’d have to sneak him in the house. Every time they come over Rick gets paranoid that his friends are going to wreck the house but they never have. And they’ve known his friends since they were 6 years old so it’s not like they don’t know them. 

And then there’s money, so they offer to pay for every single thing I say I have to pay for. If I tell them I have to get dental work done they tell me they’ll pay for it, they’ll pay for groceries, my phone bill, anything if we’re out in the city with them. They’ve never complained about it they always seem to want to, but when they’re in private we can hear them because walls are thin. My boyfriend and I hear Abby and Rick talking about how we’re irresponsible because we don’t pay for anything of ours. This really confuses us because they always talk about how they want us to save our money and they don’t want us to pay for anything and then when they’re alone they act like it’s our fault for not paying for anything. When we do pay for our stuff they get furious at us saying we don’t need to be spending our money on anything. It’s confusing my boyfriend and I and last night they didn’t even talk to us because they were so upset because we took a nap. 

They also got upset with us because we bought dinner which sent Rick over the edge of being upset. We also according to him can’t leave the house without him questioning and getting upset (he gets mad a lot) with wherever we’re going. Going bowling? Mad. Going to the grocery store? Mad. Going to the gas station? Furious. And then we hear them complain more about how we never go out and do anything with our life’s... I’m really trying to understand where they’re coming from but I just can’t. When we were 15 they treated us like we were 20 year olds but now that we’re 20 they’re treating us like we’re 15. I also clean the house multiple times a week but it never seems to be enough. It’s not like I don’t help out around the house at all because I do every single week. They don’t do anything though, and when my boyfriend and I try to help clean up something because it’s disorganized or they haven’t used it in years and the item isn’t usable they try to clean but leave it a mess and the house is just piling up with clutter. And then again...more complaining about how we need to start taking more responsibility and organizing and cleaning the house but everything we touch we can’t throw or give away. 

I’m at total loss, nothing seems to be enough for them, I’m trying so hard to be the best I can for them. I don’t complain to them if they ask for anything, I don’t bat an eye if they ask me to do the dishes even though I’ve done them 6 times the same week. I’ve even had a really nice talk with Rick about how much I appreciate everything they do for us and i try to make up for everything by cleaning the house. When I did talk to him he’s like yes thank you but I think you could clean a little bit more... Honestly I think I’ve cleaned all I can, I try to get them to tell me where things need to go if I’m cleaning but they always tell me no don’t touch that, or I don’t know just leave it there. So I’m not sure what else he’s wanting me to clean? I’m not sure why they’re getting upset over us spending money on things we need or when we say we have to spend money for things we need they offer but get upset about it behind closed doors. What should I do guys? How do my boyfriend and I bring up our confusion with them because we’re both scared that it’ll end up messy even though we haven’t done anything wrong. Do you guys know why he’s acting this way? 

TL;DR: My boyfriends parents are utterly upset with us because they feel like we’re being lazy around the house when we clean the house more times a week than they do. We’re not messy, we’re not loud, we’re not disrespectful. We do everything they ask us to. When we pay for our own things they get upset with us because they think we should be saving our money. So they pay for our things, and behind close doors they complain about how we’re irresponsible since we don’t pay for anything. When they 100% say they’re happy and glad to pay for all of our stuff. Why do they do this? Why are they getting mad at us for things we don’t even do or things we do?",10Jul2019,1

814,"During college admission I moved and my small group of school friends split up. When I first moved I got depressed and was overwhelmed by everything. I didn't want to talk to anyone so I cut myself off. One of my friends reached out to me and I spoke to her occasionally. At the time I wanted to contact my other friends and apologize but I felt incredibly awkward and so I didn't. Then I was traveling and wanted to share the experience with my old friends ( quite selfish now that I think back) and contact the one I was closest with. She was so upset with me saying she felt I forgot about her and neglected her.  Again I got afraid of this entire confrontation so I cut myself off again. Summer holiday and I thought to myself I should really contact them AGAIN! and try to apologize.  I did and we spoke for a bit I think few days. The rest of my friends (excluding my closest who I ran from, who after ghosting a second time is more than furious, rightfully so) were very sweet and accepting. Sent me messages updating me on how they were doing. And I just out of the blue didn't reply again. For no reason this time. I guess I was scared I honestly have no excuse. Later on they invited me to a group gathering but I was too scared to even open the message. Now a full year later in my second summer break I'm really struggling. How can I contact them, am I even allowed to. The thought of rejection terrifies me.  I'm so selflsih it's beyond embarrassing, complete lack of consideration and I can't even defend myself with a proper reason. I feel so scared hesitant. And I have no idea how to remedy the pain I've cause my closest friend. I think I've broke her trust too much for her to accept me.  
I'm sorry for this long post but it's just always at the back of my mind and I have no idea to act. Please if you can give me some advice on how to contact them, why do I repeatedly escape even though I really cherish them. I'd be so very grateful.",10Jul2019,2

I'm in my early 30's, have one child and one on the way. I've always been pretty reliant on credit (catalogues and credit cards, and loans here and there) but have always been able to pay them back. Now, I find myself in a situation where our monthly income has reduced, plus I am also needing to get stuff for our new arrival. I'm definitely going to get a lot second hand to save money, but I'm really worried about the fact I have several thousand owing, plus soon to be 2 kids AND my car is old and just about to die a death and I definitely cannot afford a new one - even fixing this one is going to be a scrape. Public transport here is absolutely dire, otherwise I would just rely on that. I also live 6 miles from work in one direction, and my daughters school is 2 miles in the other direction, so walking is also not n option. I feel so embarassed that I'm in this situation, but the drop in income is because I have had to drop my hours at work for the foreseeable future. I also know I will struggle picking up a second job as I'm obviously pregnant. 

Please help me with tips on how to save money for the here and now and ways to get out of debt for good (with barely any spare income). I'm so sick of being so poor and if I didn't owe so much I'd free up a good couple of hundred every month!! I just can't see how we are going to scrape through the next few months.

My husbands work van has gotten stolen twice and has had theft without the whole car being stolen twice (4 in total of stealing his work equipment). His work company had added an alarm and my husband takes most of his tools out now but just last weekend they stole 2 things from his van but we didnt hear the alarm. When the alarm was first installed neighbors complained that it was too sensitive and that they couldnt sleep at night with it going off with just rain droplets or squirrels passing by. We turned the sensitivity down and now we didnt even hear it. The problem is people keep telling us to move but this apartment complex is the apartment with the most affordable rent that we have found, and I am sure if we moved somewhere else the same thing would happen( a couple of my husbands coworkers had the same thing happen, as well as my brother in law who had tools stolen from his work van  in a gated house).

822,"(On mobile) some background - all my life I have struggled with anxiety, depression, relationships, confidence, codependency, and living for myself and not others. The biggest decisions I've made for myself were:
- To not play basketball in college despite people telling me I would regret it (they were partially right),
- Go to college out of state to get away from family problems (I went to therapy, but didn't take it seriously)
- Leave an extremely toxic 6 year relationship (huge, best decision ever)
Every other decision has been based on what other people think or what I think other people want from me, or to help others. At this point in my life I'm in a super codependent relationship. I don't know how it happened or how I let it get like this, but I literally can't make any of my decisions without thinking about how it will affect my SO [27M]. I haven't really talked to him about this, but I've talked about it in therapy (which I do take seriously now). I feel like I've lost all control, but yet I'm also gaining some control back as I progress and do tiny things for myself (when he's at work because of course when he's off I can't be without him ugh). I'm anxious and in love and miserable and confused, more so now than ever. In no way am I blaming him for any of this, but I do think some of our interactions exacerbate this.

I have a degree in Biomedical engineering, graduated in 2015, and have struggled finding a job in my field ever since. I snagged a job as a manufacturing tech and now have the opportunity to move to another lab in another city 7 hours away and move up to a possible lab lead/lab manager (at least that's what they say) with a very good salary raise - which is a HUGE jump in roles, it would take at least 4 years at another company. However, my boyfriend needs to move to another state to be with his daughter, and I want to go with him. And my family lives here and I want to be close to them. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. 

I feel like I can't miss such an opportunity, but at the same time I worry myself with thoughts like what if I fail and can't do it and I'm stuck out there alone, or what if they screw me over. I also have to remember that I never really wanted to be an engineer I just wanted to prove to other people that I could, but now I feel like I want to be. My company is also pressuring me and like if I don't do this they'll be in a tough spot and how important I am.

I feel like I'd be letting my brother down if I leave here since I've only just come back from college about a year ago. I'd be leaving my cushion. 

I want to go with my boyfriend but our entire relationship has been rocky. Both of us have problems with our mental health and we both have trust issues and just kind of clash sometimes. I'm hoping that if we go there he will be happier when he can see his daughter because I know that takes a huge toll on him, but there isn't a guarantee. I also worry that I'm having wavering thoughts about the new position because I'm so attached to him which is causing me to want to doubt myself. We can do a long distance relationship if I take the new position, and I'd be making more so I can help pay for a nice apartment there, but I'm worried my paranoia will act up and I'll constantly be worrying if he's cheating or falling in love with someone else.

Every decision feels right but every decision feels wrong and I can't tell if I'm making any of them for me. 
Obviously this post is all over the place which is a reflection of my brain and how indecisive and confused I am. How do I know what the right decision is and if I'm making it for me or to please others?

Tldr; I have a huge opportunity to move to a new position with a large raise, but I also want to stay where I am, and I also want to move with my boyfriend to another state. I don't know which one to do, which one is the right decision, and which decision I'm basing on my needs and not the needs of those around me.",10Jul2019,1

825,"To be True to the my very own self I am living for the simple nature of success. Success is a broad term isn't it? We as in living-breathing-human-beings all have different responses to success rather that be from a financial point-of-view or just having strong family to grow old with. My definition of success starts with beating the simple nature of pornography. Yes I am a conservative young man or boy give or take on what your opinion of 19 is. I truly wish to find the love of my life with in these next few years. I don't drink never liked the idea of being intoxicated. I also don't smoke cigarettes, cigars, or any other drug such as the common one around us known as Weed or Marijuana. I'll admit It; I smoked once due to peer pressure and I felt very sick to my stomach never again I vowed to myself I would never partake in smoking again, and yes I have been successful in it. I just wish pornography was the same way. Back to the main narrative... I wish for my love of my life to be with me here, right now... to just hold. It might sound weird, but even though I'm 19 I am not looking to just have sex with a girl, but rather form a relationship and maybe even start a family. Knowing this it has made countless opportunities go out the window. Possible relationships, even friendships that could have been long-term or even to the end of my life. I look to be financially successful with going to college this coming year. A long 4 years ahead of me. I look to join the navy at the end of those 4 years to become a naval aviator. Lets be real right now; I truly wish Taylor Alesia would dm me back all I want is to get to know her better. I understand that she has millions of followers and I probably get lost within the mix but she seems so real and true to herself. Many girls out here in Montana are drinkers and smokers (such as vapes) know and its hard to find girls I guess these days that don't do it. I don't mind if you drink, but when you hear most high school kids say to you that you're P\*\*\*y and you don't want to have fun really hits home to you. It goes to show that most people in my age group use alcohol to ""have fun"" which scares me. Also a big thing that affects me is being conservative in this day an age. I get the countless arguments between both sides have effects on people, but why can't people accept others views and move on. It truly has made it hard for me to find a girl who has the same political leaning as me because most young women are liberal just due to the media that is presented on today's sites like you tube, Google, Facebook, etc.  So this me being true to myself. Yes it may sound sad; however, it more hopeful for what there is to come.",10Jul2019,0

827,"I am the youngest of 6 siblings, and the only sibling to have a college education and career. I have a very stable and comfortable life because I teach and my boyfriend is an architect. My entire family is made up of very low class, lazy, reaps government benefits and they are very financially irresponsible. My two step sisters never kept a car for longer than 2 months because they often got repoed. They never could pay bills, so my dad always helped by paying the bills for both my step sisters, my step brother, while also trying to keep our bills afloat. No one ever really had to work hard for a living. I was seen as the “golden child” because I was just always independent. I contribute my independence to the help of my boyfriend who influenced me to become better. My success causes a slight rift with my family and I, but they always end up coming to me for advice. 
Well, my dad (their ATM and source for living) died. This is my biological dad, their stepdad. I lost my daddy. Even just hours before he died, to the funeral, 1 of my step sisters started saying what she wanted. Even before dad got sick, she often declared that she wants the house. Dad made her move out because she had 3 kids and there was no room for her at home anymore. 
So, losing my dad meant everyone fell apart. Step sisters both lost their houses and cars. Both step sisters moved into my dad and step mom’s house. One sister had 2 kids, one sister has 3. My step mom received all my dads money. She bought my two sisters new cars, vacations, and they lived well. Until the money ran out. 
The step sister I’d like to address is the one who wanted things. Money is gone. She doesn’t work. My step sister is currently living in the garage of my parents house with 3 kids (11,5, and 3). She began doing drugs. Quit her job. Her husband makes 1,500 every 2 weeks. They don’t contribute to bills. My step sister is threating to take the house from my step mom. 
Ive heard how hateful she is recently. My step mom actually cried because she has given up. My other step sister got in an actual fight with her leaving each other severely cut and bruised. My garage living step sister’s son began showing odd behaviors such as being sexual to his sister, trying to kiss his own sister who is 3, and he is 11. My sister refuses to believe her son is capable of that, doesn’t believe it, and doesn’t acknowledge that is a massive problem that needs to be addressed. This is where I started getting worried. 
Since my dad’s death, I am not involved with them. I’ve been just trying to work hard and maintain my life. This is disheartening that my family has come to this. I would like to talk to her and make her realize she needs a change. I don’t want to provoke her, but Idk if I should get involved. Is it my place to do so?",10Jul2019,0

832,"Hi guys and gals, this is a pretty involved post.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until I was around 8 or 9 I was a normal energetic physically well rounded kid living in the states. I started gaining weight around age 10 due to the poor eating habits I had with my mother feeding me and as a family not doing a lot of physical activity. I gained a lot of weight progressing more than 200lbs by age 15, then me and my family moved out to Turkey where I stayed with them for 2 years. During that time I had lost a decent amount, but still obese. Then I left by myself to come live with my aunt and uncle for some time while I finished up school at 17. Now I'm 21, senior year at my college, interning at a big company, and feeling good about my career.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when I had started to gain weight at my younger age, my father took notice(he is a very stubborn guy that essentially picks the ideal of ""Do it and don't stop, push through"" but in the way of not being motivational but more demanding) and told me to start doing something about it. I didn't know what to exactly do, I was never taught nor given the motivation to help me in the process, but just told to do it. He put me in little league baseball, and I hate sports, never liked gym class, never liked exercising, kids bullied me constantly up until my senior year of high school. I soon left that, and he started forcing me to jog around the neighborhood during the summer, 90-96 degree weather just in fucking circles.. I hated these days, I still feel the feelings I had those times just out there running around constantly tired, never felt good, and no one ever stuck by me or tried to help me when I couldn't do it. My father during all this time was eyeing me like a bat left and right, anyway I'd eat he'd watch me, when I walk or sit or stand or play or watch TV or just fucking breathe he'd stare at me up and down, mostly in disgust what it seemed like to me. In actuality, my mother would tell me he's sad that I'm like this, or upset but he still loves and cares about me and wants to see me change, but I was never given the fucking guidance in the first place to wanna do that, or at least enjoy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting upset as of now, but anyways, I've gone to the gym at some points in my life, with people that are like drill instructors(which by the way does not work for me at all) and with a friend which was actually fun. I've always found the issue of me just absolutely hating every minute when I knew I was working out or losing weight or running or whatever god damn activity I'd do, I just flat hated it. I'm still like that, but worse, I had a surgery recently that cause a pretty bad illness afterwards and I believe it caused me to be more tired and lazier than before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sick of me constantly having the same feelings back when I was sent outside in fucking horrid weather trying to do something I had no idea about, and it left emotional scars on me. My parents used to argue and fight because of me and how my father treated me, my dad would look at the stretch marks on my belly and arms and would be in shock and disgust because of it, it breaks my heart when I think about these things man and it hurts a lot to know this.. I wish I could dump these feelings down the drain and start new, but I've never been able to, I've never been able to enjoy losing weight or be consistent in working out. 

&amp;#x200B;

People of reddit, I need some advice here, I'm not sure who to talk to, I'm not comfortable talking about it with my parents, my girlfriend wants to go to the gym and I do too but I can't find it in myself to have a positive attitude about it, please help me out.

833,"Met her nearly two years ago and developed a strong bond with her, she quickly became my best friend. She ended her previous relationship because she was needy as fuck and her boyfriend wouldn't give her attention, not even think about her at all when she wasn't around.

Sufice to say I tried fufilling all her needs when we were together but in the end she would only treat me coldly and distant and ended feeling like an idiot.

834,"I'll start from the beginning. Sorry for the poor formatting, I'm on mobile. Btw this is going to be a loooong one so thanks in advance for reading this.

Whenever I am at home or with my family, I feel anxious and all I want to do is just run away. I no longer trust my parents. I am a 15 year old male.

This all began a while back on easter where my dad got extremely drunk. We were over my a relatives house for easter and my dad took his medicine, but he took the medicine with alcohol which was extremely dumb of him. He got very drunk and said some stupid things at the relatives house and started yelling at everyone there. We decided it was time for us to leave so my mom, dad, and I went to the car. Obviously my dad was too drunk to drive so my mom drove instead. It was quiet at first and I could sense there was anger between my parents. Eventually, my parents started arguing and it escalated to the point where they were screaming. My dad was saying some pretty dumb things and I could tell they were hinting at stuff about there marriage and how they weren't happy but didn't want me to realise that they were talking about it. I knew that they weren't happy with each other before because I have never seen them ever happy with each other and I've had talks with my dad where he seems like he is unhappy with the marriage he is in. My parents are immigrants so they really have no one here and all they have is each other so splitting up isn't really much of an option. Also, I remember talking to my mom about divorce and I remember her talking about how she would never divorce because it would produce too much trauma on me and my brother. I disagree with this because I would rather just have them split up rather than see them stay together unhappy. Anyways, in the car I could tell they were hinting about there marriage and how they were unhappy and I said something that I instantly regretted. I said something along the line of ""you guys don't have to pretend around me, I know what's happening"". My dad instantly started crying and my mom stayed quiet. Then the arguing continued and my dad started throwing accusations about my mom sleeping with another man which is not true because my mom is not that type of person. At this point people were yelling and keep in mind we are driving on the highway now. I start yelling at my mom to pull over and she starts freaking out. Eventually I calm her down and we don't crash somehow and we pull over. My mom starts crying and my dad just starts throwing insults. I got really pissed so I told him to ""shut the fuck up"" which probably was not a smart idea but it worked. He stopped but then he continued and started saying how my mom is using him for money which is another lie. I start yelling at him for being irresponsible and he responds with the ""I'm proud of you son"". He then holds my hand and starys crying while I sit there awkwardly. My mom is still crying and I see her reaching for the stick to drive so I grab the stick and keep my hand there so she wouldn't start driving. My dad starts ranting while my mom is crying and I am just sitting there scared shitless with my hand on the stick. My dad throws more dumb accusations and I get fed up and tell him to shut up. He then starts talking about how I'm the strongest person in this family and how I am more stronger than he will ever be. He starts crying. Now both of my parents are crying in front of me as I am trying to calm them down. I held back tears because I felt if I cried, it would only make the situation worse. So I just sat there parenting my parents. Eventually they calmed down and the car ride was completely quiet and I just drowned out the silence by putting in my earbuds and listening to music. When we got home my dad went straight to sleep and everyone is in there rooms. My brother isn't home because he is in college while this happened. So I just stay in my room, text my best friend about everything that happened and quietly cried myself to sleep. 

The next morning I go to school and I was quiet for the whole day. My friends could tell something was up but I never revealed what was up. When I got home, my dad talked to me, and it turns out he remembered nothing which kind of revealed me but that got me thinking that he said all of those things before for a reason. Those things actually bothered him. I just acted like I was okay and I was like its okay. Then, my mom comes home and she acts like nothing happened. She doesn't even try and talk to me about it. I was really pissed at both of my parents because my dad was being a total dick and my mom was acting like a 5 yr old and was just crying and didn't even bother to help me. She played the victim card which she has many times before. I'll give two examples. This example was before this situation occured. Me and my mother got in an argument and would not change her mind even though I was providing evidence and actual facts about why my side is right. She called me stupid and metally disabled so I got mad and I just stayed quiet. Turns out, I was right. She started crying when she realised I was right and then played the victim card where she said ""why don't you love me"" and she started blaming me. That made me feel like total ass so I started to cry. There is another example which is after the whole situation on Easter. We got in another argument about how if I do stuff last minute she gets insane and screams at me but if she does I am not allowed to get mad. I asked a rhetorical question and said ""what would you do if I got ready last minute"". She responded with ""kill myself"". That caught me offguard. It didn't really have anything to do with the argument so I got mad. I could tell that she didn't mean it when she said it because she said it sarcastically and after she said it she said that she didn't mean it. I got mad because she was using that to make me feel bad so I started yelling at her for using that to play the victim. 

I've pretty much lost all trust in my parents and when I tried to talk to my mom about it, she played the victim card and was like ""it's not my fault"" so that conversation went nowhere. The only person I could trust was my brother and two weeks ago I tried to tell him how I was feeling since he was home for the summer. All I got was a ""you're annoying, go away"". That really hurt. I really looked up to my brother and that really fucked me up. Basically I'm alone with this and I can't really talk to anyone in my family about this.

I have told my closest friend about all of this and they have helped me feel better. Just every time I am home I wanna run as far away as possible and I don't anything to do with my parents. What should I do? I have been just feeling under pressure lately and I feel stuck. Please help. Any advice would be seriously appreciated.",10Jul2019,1
835,"The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly.

The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see?

837,"For the past four months I've been paying $800ish/mth for half of a walk-in closet. I am inside one of the room's closet because my financial situation at the beginning of the year was shaky and I couldn't afford a full room. I live with 3 other roommates, two of them are in my band and one of them is our manager. This was my first time moving away from home and I made an agreement (though not on paper or signed on the lease) to live here for a full 12 months.

Although I made an agreement, I have found myself at a breaking point. It reeeeeeeeaally blows living in such a small space. It's smaller than the smallest college dorm room you can even imagine. I have a little Tv, and then boxes holding all of my clothes/shoes/electronics above me on these shelves. I have enough room to stand up, and walk out of the room. I sleep on folded up memory foam and I get really crammed up in there. I have to take naps on the couch sometimes during the day to catch up on sleep lost because getting comfortable in the closet space is not an easy task.

I recently learned the apartment building next to ours is around the same what I pay currently. I'm seriously considering breaking my agreement with my friends and getting my own room there because it has become a bitch living in the closet. I don't want to be a dick and make their rent go up all of a sudden, but I feel like I'm kind of allowed to make this call here, right? We're in a band that just got signed and potentially might have a tour in the Fall and I don't want to piss everybody off before we move onto bigger things. But, I feel like anybody who knew my situation would understand and make it work. 

Should I wait it out for 8 months and then move out, or can I pull the plug on my closet situation without being a dick to my friends? Thanks guys.",10Jul2019,1
838,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",10Jul2019,0

841,"My fiancee Tara and I have been together for 2 years (both women in our late 20s). I’ve not met Tara’s parents because they are homophobic.

Tara’s brother is getting married at their parents house out of state in a few weeks. We were invited with 2 weeks notice. After a lot of discussion between us, I bought Tara a ticket to go without me (I cant get time off to drive, cant afford 2 plane tickets, and honestly am worried her mom will cause a scene).

The whole thing sucks. I’m more hurt by the bride/groom and Tara’s other siblings.They didn’t really make an effort to invite us with any reasonable notice and act as though the homophobia isn’t a problem for Tara and I.

846,"So I like a girl in my grade (going in 11th, also at my school) but I'm a solid 90% sure she just doesn't like me. I got her snap from a friend, but she didn't add me back; I DMed her on ig and she didn't respond, and when I try to talk to her it's usually dry or she just gives me a weird look. She's doing a thing over the summer (college in the highschool) that me and a few other ppl are doing, and it's every Wednesday from noon to three. *BUT* today she got cut off while trying to say somn and I looked over at her like haha (you know the look) and she looked back at me kinda the same way; I also made a joke and she laughed at it. There's 5 more classes over the summer and I'm not sure what to do. Should I keep trying to talk to her or should I let it go?

Some more info(if you want it?): 

we live in the same neighborhood, and I mean like really close. 

I think she was/is friends with my ex, and that didn't end well. After 4 months of her (my ex) becoming progressively more and more needy and rude, my grandma fell and broke her hip so she went to a hospital. My grandma is old so I was worried about her (she's fine now, **this happened almost exactly 1 year ago**). So I was not texting my ex as much and she just started yelling (thru text) and complaining, and since I ain't no pussy bitch I just said something to the effect of ""my grandma is in the hospital, stop being so self centered and let me focus on her"". She got mad and I just left her on read. She then wanted a 'break' and y'all'ready know those never work so I just said yea aight and left her. SHE THEN CONTINUED TO BOTHER ME FOR **FOUR MONTHS** and ruin my summer. I obviously didn't get back together and eventually said fuck it and blocked her, blocked her friends and that was the end of it. She then made me out like a piece of shit (saying I was only it it for nudes, etc. blah blah blah. In the 4 months we dated, I never askedSince and I tried to be as nice as I could, 24/7). I never said anything bad about her but I warned the *2 of my friends she dated in less than 2 months* that it's not advisable, and I was right. Other than that I ignored her and now I act like she doesn't exist. So if the girl I like is friends with my ex then I'm kinda screwed. 

Another thing- she's like maybe right around 5 feet tall, and likes veiny guys. I on the other hand, am 6'3 and pretty big at 210 lbs and not veiny. I'm working on losing weight this summer,  and it's going aight.

Later on we reconnected and from time to time we would chat a little. A few months ago sexting happened a few times til one day, when he told me he was seeing someone new, so I backed off and we agreed, in order to respect his new gf, to cut it off and stop talking albeit not deleting each other from social media.
The thing is that a few days ago he contacted me and told me in advanced that he was drunk. He said a couple of sexual things that he wanted to do and that, although I didnt’t precisely disliked then, I do know he shouln’t have said cause he’s apparently still with that other woman. So I didn’t lead him on and I was planning on making it appear as it hadn’t happened. Two days later he contacted me and apologised but he still implied that he wants to do them.

I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring with nowhere to put my car. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Don't want to be inside buildings or live in a structure anymore. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.

However, my parents tend to talk about others’ mental issues often. My brother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year and, though I really don’t want to know, they have thoroughly explained to me everything he thinks, says, and does. I often hear them have loud conversations about him. The entire family—all of my many siblings, aunts, and uncles—know the details of my brother’s condition and his actions. 

I’m also one of my only siblings without mental issues—ranging from autism to addiction—and because of this, I am able to enjoy a lot of freedom and unobtrusiveness from my parents. I am worried that if I told them, they would begin to restrict what I am able to do and where I am able to go. I prefer my business to be my own, and I really would not like them in it.

I’m sorry if what I said hurt you. Most girls usually have really long nails”.

864,"Sometimes I think I'm insane. I'm have a girlfriend for a month and a half. She loves me to the moon and back, but I just don't have the same feelings to her like she has to me. Recently I got in touch with my ex girlfriend. We talked a lot. We broke up because I was a piece of shit. She is a good girl but I don't know how long would our relationship last. 




My current girlfriend is really nice to me. She would do anything I ask, but she's a little bit emotionally unstable. Sometimes she can get on my nerves but I hide my displeasure because I don't want to her like others did. But sometimes I just can't cope with her life because it's creating problems for my life as well. She's really anxious and she doesn't like to meet new people. I get mad because she won't ever even say hi to my friends. But she has a really good heart and I don't want to hurt her. Her birthday is tomorrow so I can't end our relationship soon enough. I love her but I don't feel what she feels unfortunately. What should I do?

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

A friend who owns a 3D printer said he’d be happy to print out a pretty big part of costume armor for me. The print alone would take about 100 hours. Finishing the print will most likely take even more time than that. The deadline is a few months away, but it still makes me a bit nervous I won’t have it done in time. 

I want to ask so badly if he’s started yet or if he could start it, but I’ve been on the opposite end of this before and i cant stand being pushed to do a favor. 

Ive offered to pay him a solid amount of money for his help, and to pay for all the materials needed. The last thing i want to do is irritate him and ruin any future help he might offer, but i also would love for him to start the 3D print for me so i can get ahead of schedule.

I know nothing about their culture or stuff like that. For example I never watched Bollywood movies. It just I find them pretty.

Generally other girls don't really attract me I mean whites, east asians, arabs or mixed race girls but that doesn't mean I reject them! I can see beauty everywhere : I'm 21 and my only one girlfriend was mixed (white-black). Of course now I'm single.
Because I'm really attracted to black and south asian girls I could tend to generally try to date these girls in particular.

885,"Bare with me, I'm on mobile. I'm not even sure this is the right place to post, so if it's not, please point me in the right direction. (This account is relatively new, not even going to lie, purposely deleted my old one so my cake day was on my birthday.) My BF(28M) and I(27F) have been together for about 2.5 years now. (We dated for 3 years in high school as well.) He has 2(F6/S7) kids from a previous relationship, I have 1(F6). He and his ex went through a nast divorce and custody battle(I put a lot of money and time and effort into it myself) after she magically reappeared after being gone out of his and the kids lives for a year. While the custody stuff was going on, his ex bounced his kids to 3 different schools in a 6 month period. They finally ended up at one school, and completed a full year at this school. During all this, I consistently kept my daughter at the same school(prek&amp;K), even though we were out of district for BOTH schools. Now we are getting ready to start school, and I don't want to change my daughter's school. (I've always had every intention of moving back within the district, as I do not like the district/city/county we current live in, which I explicitly explained to him. It was just kind of ""we need a place, first thing we can get"" situation due to the custody battle.) She knows the staff, the school, her friends. He wants to put them all in the same school, obviously the one we are zoned for. I HATE the school area we are zoned for. I went there as a child, and it doesn't appear to have changed much. He refuses to put his kids in the same school my daughter has been going to( I'M FULLY AWARE WE AREN'T ZONED FOR IT. I realize that. But, I work in the city and pay the city/county taxes directly out of my check, so.), simple because he hates the county. Hates the city. I won't go into why he hates it, just know he has no solid reason to hate it. It's one of the top public schools in our state, and he doesn't care. He would rather them be in the school that is most convenient, meaning they can ride the school bus. At the same time, I understand his kids are 100% innocent in the whole situation, but my daughter's parents didn't go through a nasty divorce/custody battle, and I have fought tooth and nail to keep her from having to bounce schools like I did(I did it once I left the school I mentioned above). He sees it as, they have to change, why not her? I see it as I have done everything in my power as a single mom to give her the stability and consistency she deserves, so why does she have to? We agree 100% we want them all at the same school, because driving to two different schools for pick up and drop off was not good for us(when we won custody, we decided not to change their school in the middle of the year, they were having to adjust to too much already). I just don't know how to get him to have a rational conversation about pros vs cons of school A and school B. All he cares about is that he doesn't wanna be in that district. What about me not wanting to be in the other district? Does that matter at all? Does he not care about the best education we can get for them public school wise? I compared the school supplies lists, and the school supplies list would be far cheaper for the school I want, so I've thought about using that as an angle for the conversation? He's one of those ""my mind is made up, we aren't discussing this anymore"" people, and I'm a ""let's talk through it and find a middle ground"" person. Am I wrong feeling the way I do, wanting to do what I'm wanting to do? Do I suck it up, and break my daughter's heart by making her change schools to appease him? The kids going to the school he wants, puts me working 45ish minutes from their school. The one I want, I'm 10 minutes from. Seeing as I'm the one the school calls, the one that does all school activities and such, I think it makes more sense for them to be closer to my work. I'm not really sure why I'm writing this out. Maybe some outside perspective? His mom agrees with me on the school being better, and that they should go there. She's tried talking to him. I've shown him home listings so we could actually move within the district, which also puts us closer to his mom. I don't want him to feel like I made him, but if I change my daughter's school, I'll feel the same way. I guess if anyone has any helpful insight, words, guidence, I'm open to it. School's getting closer and a decision has to be made. Thanks in advance for any advice on what to do/how to approach the conversation.",10Jul2019,1

When I say part-time, I am doing work alongside ""full-time"" employees doing equal work, the only difference is that my hours are cut at 30 per week instead of 37.5 a week. My pay is less than half of the full-timers, and I get none of the benefits that they have (vacation, health insurance, etc) . Anyways, I have now been at this job for 3 years. I was always told by higher ups that they would love to have me as full-time employee they just don't currently have the ability to open up a new full-time slot.  I never let that bother me, I was just there to give it my all and hope that maybe one day something would free up.

Recently, 3 full-time positions became available. I thought wow, maybe I will finally have a chance at getting one of the positions. I was thrilled.  I put in my application, kept grinding day by day. My boss, and all of his superiors knew that I applied and would frequently mention it.  I figured hey, I'll AT LEAST get called in for an interview or something.

As time went on, I come to find out that not only was I never even called in for an interview, they hired 3 new people that have never worked at the company before. I just feel so helpless that after 3 years of busting my ass off at a job and constantly being told that ""once something opens up, We'll get you in full-time"" that they cannot even give me an interview or an opportunity to prove myself. Now here I am as a part-time employee having to show these recently hired full-timers how to do things. I keep a smile on my face and try to be as helpful to them as possible but man I have never been so humiliated in my entire life. I want to just say fuck this job and start looking for something new because none of my hard work here seems to have any return.

892,"I've been putting in extra hours after work in order to learn Python to automate some of my work. I have a more consistent method to deal with the monotonous task of updating data into our system. So far it has been going very well and feel I have really started to add value with some of my scripts. 

Part of the issue now is that some of them are getting pretty complex and I'm not so sure my boss trusts what I have created. There is already one script that I told him about and despite the fact that it has worked flawlessly (added lots of validation output, summary, and did a ton of QA) , he wants to, well, basically recreate the script himself in an, older, programming language he is familiar with.

If my script was a dud or if I had a reputation for doing substandard quality work in my job, then I would understand his approach here. However, I feel as though he likes the idea of my automated solution, yet wants to program it himself....despite the fact I already spent hours upon hours creating and refining it. 

I gave him a high-level summary of what it does but he had concerns of potential error in my script, unfamiliarity of the language, and  how thorough the QA should be. Something all scripts should go through obviously, hence why I did it myself. 

The fact that my script won't be used isn't what ultimately bothers me, it is that he seems to have a mistrust of my coding skills in a new language. As a result, all my current scripts, and future scripts might be a waste. I love using Python for my work and my scripts usually require just a bit of user input through a file dialog box. I have grand visions of automating more tedious stuff, and our department runs thin, so we do need it. Him not taking the time for me to show him evidence that my code does work is baffling and insulting. I have had exemplary performance reviews and thought he would be pleased with my initiative. Instead he thinks it will be a rather easy script for him to write (it probably won't be since he tends to always underestimate things and I know first hand the complexity of this). Furthermore, I'm worried he is going to have me, and my coworkers use a tool that lacks the thoroughness I put into my script, mainly because he is the head of the department and doesn't have time to add these bells and whistles.

2. I am extremely petty. If I got into a confrontation with another person, I would wait for them to contact me and basically close myself out to anyone and not reach out.
3. I am too competitive in games. We played a few games a few days ago and I would get under everyone's skin with winning and teasing. I need this to stop. I think it stems from my house, where we are 4 brothers and my second brother being competitive all the time when we play.
