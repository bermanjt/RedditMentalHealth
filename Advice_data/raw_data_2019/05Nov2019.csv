Anyone have a good distraction...music suggestion?",05Nov2019,1

3,"My mom’s brother (my uncle) is married to my dad’s  cousin. So I’m related to my cousin on both sides of my family: he’s my first cousin on my mom’s side, and second cousin on my dad’s side. My parents are divorced and my mom is remarried. So despite them being divorced, my dad is still related to my cousin because my dad and his mom are cousins.

My brother and I got invites to my cousin’s wedding and my dad didn’t get one. I don’t know the motive behind it, I asked my cousin about it and he gave me a very vague response. I’m not sure if it’s because of my parents divorce or old family drama, but I think the situation is super shitty. Especially because the rest of my dad’s family is invited except him.

This puts me in a super awkward position. I feel hurt that my dad isn’t invited but he’s still my cousin and I’m related to him on my mom’s side as well. However I don’t want to make the situation worse by not going, so I’m not sure what to do. Also, my cousin invited my boyfriend as well, so if I do go, should I bring him? It’d be nice to have him for support but it still feels awkward. My dad keeps telling me to “do what I want” but I know he’s secretly hoping I don’t go.

4,"So I was dating this girl for a few months and got her pregnant. She told me she was infertile due to ovarian cysts. She had unprotected sex with many people before me, any of them could've gotten her pregnant, but I guess I got lucky. I'm 25 and didn't want kids until like 30-32 and she knew this. It was a casual relationship, I knew she wasn't wife material or parent material. She wants to keep it, and I don't. She is saying she'll let me go, basically be a deadbeat, no child support nothing. It feels wrong doing that but she says she doesn't want me to be there if I won't love it. I really don't want to have a kid right now, I enjoy a responsibility free life, and I have issues I need to deal with in myself before I'm ready to be a father. I could keep a kid alive now but I haven't lived enough to actually give it anything, no wisdom or guidance. She isn't in a good place either, shitty job, mentally struggling, never really thought about being a parent. So neither of us are ready to be parents but she wants to go ahead with it, so am I wrong for letting her ruin her life and me leaving? I just don't see myself being happy with a kid, so why not let her take care of it sense she wants it and I don't? Is it right for her to force me into fatherhood? I know I helped create it, but I was willing to destroy it, so which is worse. Killing a fetus or letting someone else raise a kid they want? Also I don't see a relationship with her working out.",05Nov2019,2
5,"##**TL;DR:**

##I'm a 19yo guy starting my Sophomore year in Community college. I'm interested in pursuing artistic subjects but my original (and more stable) plan was to pursue STEM for a successful career after I graduate. What the hell do I do?

--------------------------------


#**Prologue**

-

It's pretty frustrating. 

I'm a sophomore enrolled in Community College in CA. Prior to the start of this academic year, I had been enrolled in prerequisite classes to eventually transfer to a UC and begin my education with an Environmental Science major. Chemistry, Math, you name it. However, I've encountered a bit of a personal problem. Just recently, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking prescribed medication. Prior to that, I would struggle immensely in classes that I had no interest in. 

It's not as if I wouldn't try; I've worked my ass off taking notes in lectures, but because I struggle so much with paying attention I would often not understand the material I was writing down. It would be common for my classes to end and I would walk out wondering what the hell my professor had even talked about even though I had just written several pages of notes down. Not only that, I'm a terrible procrastinator. I'd skip out on homework, forget to read the textbook until it was way too late to catch up, etc. 

Just before the start of the fall quarter this year (my community college is on a quarter system), I had reached what I thought was the base of my problem with my academics, and I believe that I'm mostly correct. I was sure that my ADHD has prevented me from being successful in my classes. However, the classes that I've struggled in the most are ones that I'm purely not interested in, those being almost entirely STEM classes. With classes I've taken in Psychology, English, and Photography, I've succeeded with little effort because I'm genuinely interested in the subjects. This realization brings me to my main problem: I don't know if Environmental Science is the right major for me.

--------------------------------


#**Balancing my Interests and my Work Ethic**

-

Yes, people have told me to follow my heart; do what makes me happy rather than what makes me money. However, I'm unsure if following my heart is truly the right move to make in this situation. The ugly truth is that pursuing art is not an economically stable decision. My greatest fear is not being able to support myself financially because my education was not sufficient enough to land a job that I could be financially independent from. I don't want to be the physical manifestation of someone that graduates with a degree in art and as a result spends most of their life slaving over a fryer in a McDonald's.

What's really frustrating about my thought process when choosing a major is that I'm more interested in pursuing artistic subjects; Writing, Cinematography, Music, Photography, you name it. I practiced the cello for 7 years, being privately taught and participating in advanced orchestras up until I graduated high school. I was really proud of how far I had gone with my musical skill, and I still feel a lot of regret that I quit. I've been an amateur photographer for years now, starting at 12 years old when I begged my dad to let me post photos I had taken with his old phone online, and now shooting in film and with DSLR cameras. Writing and cinematography? Well, I haven't attempted to pursue creative writing in my own time, at least not since high school, but I had always attempted to convince my friends to make videos with me; be they skits, documentaries, you name it. On top of that, I constantly fantasize about working with others in cinematography; drafting camera positions, editing the shots in post, writing, you name it. I have friends that are going to film school, and I couldn't feel more envious. I feel that my skill in photography and ideas for cinematography comes way too easily for me to ignore it.

And yeah, these are all *possible* career options, but I feel like the chances of me gaining an opportunity of working in these fields again is so low that I don't think moving in that direction is a viable option. Being a starving artist is my dream and my nightmare.

--------------------------------

#**What the hell do I do?**

-

You probably get the gist now. I'm a 19 year old guy that's frustrated with his interests in non-STEM subjects because he understands how risky it is to pursue them as a career. This is really where my path of thought hits a wall. I would give anything to like learning Chemistry and working in the lab, and enjoy advancing my knowledge in Mathematics, but it's not who I am. Getting through those classes is my personal hell, and I feel like if I continue trying to raise my terrible GPA by retaking STEM classes and trying to advance on them I'm going to lose my mind. And if that's how I'll feel if I decide to pursue environmental science as a career, then is it worth it? Should I try again now that my ADHD is being treated with medication? Is there a compromise to my predicament? I feel like I'm torn between two paths and I don't know which one I should walk down.",05Nov2019,1

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2 years, and now live together. We moved to another city to study here, and I find out that this university might not have the same options to study abroad as they have marketed (according to rumors, basically none). It has been a dream and huge goal of mine to study abroad since I was 13, I am now 20. But in order to switch to a university with better exchange programs I would probably have to break up with my boyfriend, who I love so so much. What would you do in this situation? I am afraid that I will hate myself and feel regret if I don't follow my dreams, but I also feel that I will never find someone as amazing as him again and that I will break into pieces if I ever have to leave him.",05Nov2019,1

10,"It's a bit of a unique situation. I (20s F) lost my virginity to a long time friend (20s M) early this summer. I have like really bad anxiety and I'm very insecure, so it was really amazing to be able to be comfortable with the person I lost my virginity to. We hooked up a few times before we both had to go back to separate schools. He made it sound like he wasn't gonna be dating much, if at all, and that we'd keep our arrangement going when we got back for breaks. I was really banking on this and frankly wasn't looking elsewhere. He wasn't either, until he unexpectedly fell for someone else about a month ago. He told me via text while asking to go for a walk so we could talk and hang out (as friends only), which I agreed to despite the heartbreak. He was talking about his new partner and how he thinks he's in love. This really crushed me. I've been crying for days because I feel like I'll never find another person who'll be willing to put up with my anxiety and lack of experience with the same kindness that he did. I'm a little surprised by how hurt I am and I'm having an immensely hard time accepting it, hoping that they'll break up and he'll come back to me. I know that's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. We're gonna remain friends, and that's not debatable for me, so I'm really not sure what to do here. Any advice is appreciated.",05Nov2019,0
11,"I dated a girl for several months a few years ago. It was a relationship filled with ups and downs but i loved her. She would get cold and distant sometimes and i would get heartbroken. Finally she decided to settle down but I was no longer interested. I moved on.

5 years later my new GF and i broke up. It was amicable, she left the country. I adore her then and i adore her now. When we broke up i was devastated, and i had a rebound relationship the previous GF. it lasted a few weeks. Long story short, we got pregnant. It was unplanned and unintended.

It was devastating to me. I did not want kids and had planned out my life. Now i was stuck as an abortion was not open for discussion. She wanted a baby, she wanted a family. She wanted us to be together. 

I did not want any of those things. 

Her family and my family all believe we should be together. she's loving and caring, so am I. We would be great parents. But i have no desire to be in a relationship with her. We are very different from each other.  Everything from our personalities, to our interests, to our habits. I do not want to work that hard in a relationship. I'm not compatible with her way of living and her desires. I don't want her to change and i don't want to change either. I just want someone like me. I am fully content with being alone if i don't find another person that fits with who i am. I will never compromise my own way of being for anyone again.

So with that said. My baby is now here. An advice with how we navigate me helping mom with the newborn. How much time i should spend there. What to do if she's bitter and annoyed with me. 

She's breastfeeding so i can't do anything when he cries for the next several weeks until she can start pumping. 

I just don't feel comfortable being at her place when she may not want me there but needs me there. I'm willing to help out and do anything. but it's awkward. Any body else been in this situation?

PS. I know that i've got it better than many people. She's not crazy or careless. I just don't know what to do with myself or how to help sometimes.

12,"So For about three years now I have been on citalopram for Depression I have also had a disinterest in sex and have only been in one relationship wile I have been in high school I always thought it was just me , Maybe I’m just asexual or maybe there’s a problem with my personality etc until recently when I did some research into my medications and found the pill I am on is a sex drive suppressant, when I voiced this concern to my mother she told me “who cares you don’t need to have sex anyway” “some day when your married if it’s still a problem then you can deal with it”

16,"Looking for a bit of advice. Anonymous account just for personal reasons.

I finally received my acceptance into what I thought was my dream job, although now that I’m actually working the job, it isn’t what I thought it was. 

I am seemingly upset/depressed going into work every single day, and the pay really isn’t amazing. They are overworking the employees, having 5 people do the work of what should be 10 or more. 

This is a government position, the benefits and pay are decent however in my location i can get better benefits and similar pay at a call center or something with low stress and brainless work. 

The only difference I can foresee is the retirement. If I choose to go to a different place, they won’t have government retirement like what I would get now. But I don’t know if I’ll survive a lasting career with this position I’m currently in.

20,"This has only recently started, about 6 months ago. I’m not sure if social media or bad influences is the cause, but I desperately want to change my mindset.

Lately I’ve been too obsessed with how I and others look. Whenever I see someone the first thing to come to mind is how good looking they are and how they look compared to me.

I don’t think I’m bad looking, I’m a 19 year old male and I’ve had 5 girlfriends and have had plenty of other girls interests. But I’ve had people tell me I’m bad looking and people tell me I’m good looking. I hate basing my opinions of people off of how they look though.

I used to never even think about other people’s physical appearance until recently. Ever since this has started I’ve also had some bad bipolar insecurities about myself and anxiety. Is there anything I can practice or do to get rid of this shallow mindset?

24,"I'm 35 and drank through most of my 20s and early 30s. I didn't do much other than party and drink. I'm paying for it now.

I quit drinking 8 months ago. Best decision I ever made. Every detail about my life had changed for the better.

However. I'm still someone financially dependent on my father, who is also an alcoholic. I work for him. He has been living with his girlfriend and they recently broke up, so now he's staying with me a few days a week. We don't get along at all. He is still abusive and its starting to take its toll on my mental health. Living with him even a few days a week is exhausting and it's making me severely depressed, bringing up incredibly painful memories of my childhood and such.

I didn't really know why I drank until I got sober - my family. They are horrible. I grew up in a broken home and they are what drove me to drink.

I have been trying my best to move forward and become completely independent from my father. I've decided that in order for me to be happy, I need to cut him and the rest of my family out of my life , but it's so hard because I still rely on him for things, and now I have to see him a few days a week. . I didn't realize how far behind in life I really was. My work history is spotty with employment gaps. I never did anything big. Just jobs here and there until I saved some money to live in for a while or got bored

My girlfriend who I met during my first week of sobriety is the best thing to happen to me in years. She is what keeps me moving forward. We love each other and are planning a future together. We've discussed kids and everything. She is incredible.

But lately she's noticed that whenever I'm around my father or anyone else in my family that I shut down emotionally, in her words, they suck the life out of me. - which is true. I can't stand being around them. Again, when I got sober I realized they are the reason I drink.

At this point I don't know what to do or what to focus on. When I am around my father all I want to do is drink. But I won't. I can't go back to that. I don't make enough money to live on my own, again as I am somewhat financially dependent on my father. My car is in his name, insurance, house, everything.

I'm trying to find work but again my work history isn't they great. It's hard.

I dug myself into a pit and am trying my absolute fucking hardest to dig myself out but at this point in my life it seems utterly impossible, especially when I now have to be around my abusive father.

I don't know what to do. I am becoming depressed. My gf is seeing it. I don't like this. I know I should keep focusing on the future but at times it seems impossible. Please give me any sort of advice",05Nov2019,2
25,"Preschool was hell and my parents told me I was actively afraid of going. As far as I know nothing especially traumatic took place, the only trouble was that I had attachment issues and the couple teachers at the preschool were very cold. They'd be fine as high school teachers maybe, but from what I remember they definitely weren't one for children. I had meltdowns daily at the school and felt very alone around the adults. 

First day of kindergarten rolls around and I'm freaking out as per usual. My teacher, a super kind woman who was always in a muumuu, helped me calm down and was very patient with me. It took a while before I began to enjoy school again, but that teacher really helped me. I stayed in that elementary school until 5th grade, and even then i'd visit that teacher whenever possible and she was always happy to see me. She never was cold or anything, and she's a great teacher in my eyes. I truly do believe that I still would've hated school if it weren't for her.

I'm 20 now and in college in another state (I live in Idaho now and used to live in Hawaii), but I check the news sometimes from the island I used to live on and that school was mentioned. That reminded me of that teacher and also reminded me I never really told her how much she helped me. But I was a lot younger then and it's been years.

29,"Recently, I was asked out for the first time ever (at least by a compatible person). She was lovely, but I politely (despite my clumsy efforts) declined, as I was extremely physically and emotionally stressed from work, life, and automotive/financial matters. I have since realized that I am not currently interested in a relationship, but rather want to focus on myself, personally and professionally. I'm not saying *never,* and I've had my share of daydreams about romance and sex stuff, but I don't see myself dating anyone anytime soon, if at all.

More recently, I met up with an old acquaintance, and she asked if I wanted to see a movie sometime. I was initially concerned that she was asking me out too, but we cleared that up. I apologized for jumping to conclusions and explained what had happened.

However, she has since been in frequent contact via Facebook Messenger (which I have trouble navigating to begin with, as an introvert looking for rest and peace when I go home), and some of the topics concern me. She sent me a music video with a romantic storyline (which I initially didn't think too much about, since it was basically a cute Pixar short). More recently, she's asked what I would be looking for if I do start looking for relationships. She had (through conversation) mentioned some exes earlier, including a more recent one who had been harassing her at work, so I'm hoping this was just to help her through some stuff there, but I can't be sure.

I think she may be interested in a relationship that I can't provide. I can't be completely sure, given my lack of experience (I'm 25, and have never dated or attempted to do so. I also had more close male friends than female.); I could be misreading normal conversation as other social cues. I could just be acting reclusive from stress; I haven't seen my best friend in around a year, and have hardly gone out for exercise or other activities on my own in months.

I'm not sure how to navigate this situation. I didn't ask for this, but I want to be a good friend if I can. Just not something ""more"" than that.",05Nov2019,1
30,"I'll try to be as brief as possible.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We have been living together for 9 months. The last 2 months have been very difficult. With his work and my work, my school and many other things that have been going on, we have had many arguments and discussions about various things, but the main thing that has been a constant is that he ends up telling me I am too emotional and last night, after I came back from a 2-day family trip, he told me I was too fragile and that he didn't want a woman like that. That I needed to stop being overdramatic and that he is tired of trying to be understanding with me.

Now, for some background, I was in an emotional abusive relationship before him. I have a lot of trauma from this relationship since the guy I was with would mock me for crying, yelling at my face, yell at me in front of people, call me stupid/crazy/fat and all kinds of things. He would also sexually abuse me since I didn't want to have sex sometimes and he would tell me, and I quote"" shut the fuck up and just open your fucking legs"" while I was crying without being able to get him off me. So I have been dealing with all these emotional issues for about 3 years now, it never goes away I just have to learn to deal with it, which I have been getting better, but there are a lot of emotional triggers that make me upset, cry and feel attacked or back to the moments I lived.

My current boyfriend, yells and curses. He is aware that he does this and says he doesn't mean to, but I make him mad because of how I act and that's why he yells, which he insists it's not an excuse, but he brings it up every time I tell him about the yelling and how it affects me. Besides that, when I am very emotional during an argument, he says mean things and I react in an emotional way and he proceeds to mock me or imitate me and telling me that I am acting like a kid or that I'm being immature. I have explained to him that it's not that I am acting like a kid, it's that I have emotional triggers that are fired when he does certain things and talks to me a certain way. He insists that I am just making him pay for something my ex did and that I can just let the past in the past and be stronger and know that when he says those things, the nice things he has said in the past shouldn't be ignored.

I feel like he expects that I shouldn't take things a wrong way because he doesn't mean what he says and that when he says something bad, it's because he is already tired of arguing and he says those things because he is mad already, but he doesn't mean them. I have told him that if he doesn't mean them he shouldn't say them at all, and he says that he cannot control it because I'm making him so mad at that moment from how I'm acting and that's why he lashes out like that. I have told him I am not responsible for what words come out of his mouth, the only responsible one is him. And then he tells me that then I am responsible for feeling upset about what he says and that I decide to cry.

He thinks the only bad thing he does is yelling and that he is already working on it. And I told him yesterday that yelling is not the only bad thing, it's also that he keeps disregarding my feelings and how things make me upset, and call me overdramatic just because he doesn't understand that I do not have the same emotional strength as he does.  The only thing I wished he did was to be more empathetic with what I've lived through, but he insists he IS empathetic and he understands what I've gone through, but I cannot be this fragile and dramatic because that is just being weak and that I should let the past be in the past.

He also says that he is already going through too many things and he is too busy, for me to be getting upset for what he says, and that I should understand that he is stressed and that that's why he is tired of being understanding with me. He is going through a lot of stuff right now, but I told him that just because he is stressed in other things, I shouldn't be accepting what he does or how he acts, thinking that I shouldn't be ""bothering"" him with my feelings just because he is stressed with other stuff. I am stressed too, I have a lot of responsibilities and things to do, not just him. But I cannot be too emotional, because then that just stresses him and doesn't help him as he said.

He insists he loves me and he wants a life with me, but that I am just too fragile and I should change that about me. He says that I am unfair because I want him to change his yelling and his other stuff I mention that aren't even supposed to be a problem, but I cannot change my fragileness because it's a ""trauma"". He insists that I haven't tried to change or fix that about me, and I told him many times how this is something I have to work on my whole life because it's not just a habit, it's an emotional scar I have. This part was a heated spot during the argument, picture me already getting all my stuff to leave because I felt so hurt by his words of calling me fragile and him still underestimating the damage of the things he does. He at that moment yelled, ""fuck your trauma, you're just making drama, it's not the trauma, its just drama.  You're never going to be a strong-minded person if you keep going with this bullshit.""

Now, this was the worst thing for me. He knows details nobody else does from my previous relationship. But he insists that this is not an excuse to be as fragile as I am. He just sees me as a weak fragile person and has called me immature plenty of times because of how I get emotional about him having these bad behaviors.

Many things happened after this. It was very late at night so I decided I would sleep there and just leave the next day to my parents. I was sobbing very loudly since I was extremely sad from all the things said and how the relationship had just ended. He just sat there next to the bed and started talking about how he is tired of all the stress of life. I told him that he could just go back to his country (he is from Turkey) and he said that he has been thinking about it for a while now. the thought of him leaving to the other side of the world makes me even sadder and made me think about how I was going to miss the good things. I asked him if he could hug me and it was a very emotional moment. He hugged me and told me that he loved me and he wanted to be with me and he had imagined a beautiful life with me. But he didn't know what was going to happen. I told him that I have been trying to be stronger for a long time, but some days are harder than others and I just needed him to not be mean. That was all I needed.

I told him he should go back if he is so miserable here. Then we started talking about how that would work in this relationship and we kind of realized that it wouldn't work since I still have to finish school and that's another 4 years. He went around that topic for a while but, on my side, I realized it wouldn't work. And him being all this stressed for 4 more years, this relationship wouldn't last any longer.

I didn't say that, until this morning. I am still very sad about the whole thing all everything that was said and the realization that maybe he will never be okay with me being broken like this. I am working towards being better but he is sure I am not because I am still too emotional for him, and he says that I am being unfair for trying to change him from yelling and expecting him to be perfect, and I cannot fix my emotional self.

I texted him I was not sure that being together is the best for both of us's happiness. And I was confused about whether or not it was a good idea to stay together. Then I asked him what he thought about all this. He just said,"" I think you're right"". Then I asked him if he also was confused or he thought that we shouldn't stay together. he started saying he was too busy and lost into work bullshit and that he had already said what he said and he is not sure like me""

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should stay, and maybe after all that stress from work goes away, he will be like he was before. Or if this is the real him, and my emotions are not going to be valid because they are too much. Or that maybe my emotions ARE too much and I'm supposed to just be stronger and get over it. or maybe we just have different emotional needs, and with work we can make it?

I will talk with her and try and start conversations and shit and she will just be super brief with her answers and just sorta seem standoffish. So after a couple days of this happening is i will stop initiating conversation, and then she will try and talk to me and shit and be super chatty. And then i do the same thing, and she act super standoffish again. Like wth. Also with snapchat, i will snap her and it might take like hours to respond but i usually respond within a minute. However, if i only snap her maybe once ever couple hours she responds almost immediately every time. So i guess my question is, why is she doing this, and would she be into me if she acts this way?

I am not germaphobic. I won't refuse to do an activity like to go a movie theater or a restaurant, and I know they are germ-filled. But in my mind, I don't see them as disgusting. Planes and airports, on the other hand, I always have to use alcohol swabs or disinfecting wipes on my phone, camera, and everything else in my carry on bag after being in. Ironically, I absolutely love flying and look forward to it very much. I just dislike germs very much and feel uncomfortable in more germ-filled settings. I don't know how this started. But everybody else I know never has any problem in these settings. I just want to go on a plane and not have to use 10 alcohol wipes to clean my laptop afterwards. I don't worry that germs are going to give me some disease or something, I just... don't like them and I don't know why. Any advice to help fix this is greatly appreciated.

Our other bank account solely exist because it's the one we got our mortgage through. The only reason we ever use it is to pay said mortgage. We'll call this Bank B. 

Every month we get a cashier check to pay the mortgage but I had been calling to pay it while away on vacation. That vacation was months ago and we resumed paying via cashiers check. All of the sudden out of absolutely no where Bank B withdrew our mortgage automatically on the 1st of November. At the same time, without knowing this had happened we went and paid them via cashiers check. 

So now we have a hefty minus value in our checking account. 

I called bank B to ask them what happened. Bank B said they never saw a cashiers check but we literally walked in there to pay it. They said we are current and don't have to worry about anything. Like hell we're missing a whole months rent!

I called bank A to see what they can do, they say the only thing we can do is file some paperwork to withdraw the automatic payment from bank B. But if we do that then we didn't pay our mortgage and we will be delinquent.

42,"Some background- my brother just turned 22 on Halloween and I am 23 (will be turning 24 next month) Two years ago my brother was in a bad car accident that caused a torn rotator cuff and a herniated disk. This has caused him to be in constant pain but the past couple of months he’s had unrelated pain. He’s had abdomen pain, liver issues, and he just passed a kidney stone last week. The kidney stone was the fucking worst. He was in agony and when he went to the hospital they even gave him morphine and it took him almost a full week to pass it on his own and when he finally did, we all were so relieved. He does not have insurance and it’s been a big financial burden on my family. We have applied for the state insurance but we were denied and we can’t afford private insurance so its all fucked up. We’ve been going to our town’s clinic but they can only do so much with limited resources. My fam consists of me, my mom, and my brother. 
Flash forward to today- I was at work all day but from what my mom told me was that he received a call from the clinic and they gave him bloodwork results and it was not good news. He went to his room and was upset all afternoon. He has not opened up to my mom or me about the results but all he told my mom was that it was expensive to treat and that his life was “over”
I am very paranoid and anxious about loved ones getting sick and then dying. My big brother died when I was 16 from an aggressive form of brain cancer and my dad died in July after fighting cancer for almost two whole years.  My brother is all I have and he is my very best friend in this whole wide world. He is also a person that is very reserved and often hides his emotions and does not like to open up. I want to find out what the doctor told him but I don’t want him to shut down and ignore me as soon as I bring up  the subject. I have a suspicion that it is something related to his liver but I am not 100% sure. Does anyone have any advice on how I should approach this?

Boyfriend: 17 Male Senior 
Hi! My boyfriend is turning 18 in two months and is a senior. He’s extremely stressed about going to collage and being an adult and I don’t know how to help him. He has sever ADHD and even though he’s on medication, I think he needs a higher dosage. While it does work, he still can’t focus. He physically can’t get himself to work on school work because of it and it’s causing him low self esteem and stress. Although it’s not like his mom would get him more medication. While I’m obviously not a medical professional, I have reason to believe she’s emotionally abusive. She’s externally manipulative and constantly insults him. She once said (in front of me) to him. “Name one thing I should be proud of you for?!” Because she’s said so many times he won’t be able to hold up a job because he’s to lazy, he’s to scared to try and get one. So far he works for his dad, but is struggling just to afford gas. I keep trying to help him but no matter what I do or say it never seems to make any improvements. 

TLDR;
My boyfriend has sever ADHD causing him not to complete school work. 
I don’t think his mom will give him a higher dosage because I have reason to believe she’s emotionally abusive.

I feel like this will be a long explanation.

I  am graduating this fall with an B.S. in Info Technology. I currently  live with my parents while I go to the local state college. No student  dept because the college is super affordable. I live in FL and have  wanted to move for a long time. I also live in a bad area to find IT  work.

I have great friends where I  live. I am also in a band that is going to soon be playing a lot of  gigs. My brother lives out of state In an area I would love to live in,  but I dont know anyone there. I personally would be fine having a fresh  start like that, but It would be hard saying goodbye. I've applied to  jobs where my brothers lives and have actually been getting phone  interviews, while I have not heard from anything local. No confirmed  offers yet, but all interviews have so far been out of state.

The  band Im in consist of some of my best friends. They all think I should  stay and have pressured me to make a decision. I have told them I need  to find work in my field. Honestly, again, Id like to move out of state -  I'm not a fan of Florida. They think I am crazy to move somewhere where  I dont know anyone and leave the band behind. They have this idea that  the band will blow up and that I would regret leaving.

I  work with one of them and he told me I had a choice to make. He said If  I really wanted to stay I would wait it out for a local job. Basically  told me I needed to make a choice and that I was leaving the band  hanging. I've been upfront with them that I may relocate, but the  uncertainly is killing them. They are putting a ton of pressure on me  and its pissing me off.  I've been told by career counselors and other  IT professionals that I would be holding myself back if I was not  willing to relocate.

The truth is  I'd probably take a job locally if I could get it, but since I've  dreamed to move up north and it seems like the right time I just have  reasons to apply out of state. Isnt is common for people to relocate for  work where they may not know anyone??

My brother is telling me I should drop the band and move away. He may be right, but Im just conflicted.

If  I got a job locally I could stay home and save more money and still  enjoy being apart of the band. But I could be sitting on my butt for  months to even a year before I land something If I stay.

I  could be open to relocating and move and leave everything behind. My  brother lives in CO and there are tons of IT jobs there. I'd love to  live near the mountains.

Without  explaining the story of how I got to the point of graduating at age 27,  I'll just say I feel like I've put a lot into this degree and hopefully  good career. I am not wanting to through it out, because I am not  willing to relocate.

My friends  think I am crazy and that I need to make a decision, but I'm not sure I  can give them that until I have a job offer to accept. Im currently  working and interning somewhere else, playing for this band, playing for  my church, applying to jobs, interviewing, trying to get a  certification, and dealing with a divorce within the family (sibling is  getting divorced). Im tempted to just drop the band and plan to move. I  am just overwhelmed.

I have been getting so many opinions on what I should do I dont know what I want anymore.

Am  I really crazy for wanted to leave my hometown?? All my friends  disapprove of my choices to apply out of town. I wish people would give  me space and support my choice. Overall I just want to do what I think  is best for me and not what someone else things is best for me, but im  conflicted on what is best for me. lol",05Nov2019,1

So I’m really stressed out at the moment...I’m an 18 year old girl about to graduate from High School and have already been accepted into the college I love.I have money in a college tuition account that LITERALLY will pay for everything (anything else I have scholarships for) and I want to move into the dorms.My parents however don’t want me to go saying I can just move out after college (as well as getting extremely angry and refusing to listen to me when I explain it’s for logical reasons)but I REALLY want the full college experience and it’s a full two hour commute .Since I’m already an adult I figured I can just take the money and go but I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that considering they are the account owners...is there anyway they can cut me off from the tuition money??because they have already said they will take the money away if I try anything.or should I just grin and bear it and stay home??or take out a loan???

I noticed that a lot of the feelings and emotions I felt thus far have been so intense and stuck with me for extended periods of time. I have lost so many people this year and couldn't understand it. I feel so lonely that it physically is hurting more and more. It's like a huge weight I carry. I find it so hard to have deep conversations even though I crave them so much.

I found her online when I was searching for dogs to adopt, the adoption agency said she had no health problems. I knew that when I was looking for a dog to adopt I needed a healthy dog with no pre-existing or on going medical expenses because I just graduated college in May and I have a lot of debt and other life expenses because I'm just starting out. I made it clear in my adoption application that I would feel comfortable spending about 2k a year on vet expenses including routine care, vet visits, emergencies, and medications. Since I've adopted this dog I have spent WELL over that 2k budget in the three months I've had her due to her having an on going skin condition and eye condition that require continuous medication and frequent vet visits to manage. After doing some snooping I found the vet the dog went to with her previous owners and this vet said there's records of these skin and eye issues going back until at least 2014 and the adoption agency was made aware. This past vet visit the vet told me she now also has an infected tooth which needs pulled which would be another $985. I called the place I adopted her from and they were sweet and offered to pay for the surgery and continuous testing until I told them what the estimate was for just the tooth surgery. Now the adoption place is back-peddling saying they might not pay. I'm at a total loss because I love my dog and I can't imagine giving her up but I would have never agreed to adopt a dog with all these on going medical expenses in the first place if I knew the full situation.

So basically about a month ago one of my friends who is a girl invited a friend from her country to stay with her for a few weeks. Before this I had only been introduced to her once a couple months ago over a video call. When she arrived she immediately got really close with a guy and they hooked up numerous times (I mention this to explain what kind of girl she is). Then something happened with that and she started liking me within the last few days before she left. Nothing happened between us other than cuddling.

Within a day or two after she left, we both said we liked each other and started video calling for a few hours every day. In less than two weeks after her leaving, I asked her if she wanted to try a long distance relationship (this wasn't completely out of the blue, we had discussed it before and I knew her feelings) and she said yes. Soon after, the friend I mentioned (who invited my now-girlfriend to stay with her at the beginning of the story) asked me if I wanted to come with her to their country since she was going back for winter break anyway, and now I have plans to go there for a week.

The other night, someone who had known a bit about me and the girl asked if it was ""official"" and I said yes, and he was surprised that it happened so fast. Then tonight my girlfriend told me that he had said he thought I was joking. Then later, after our call, she sent me ""I luv u."" The reason I mention these things is because they made me realize that I have no fucking idea what I'm doing. Is this too fast? I mean I feel like we know each other well and I know she really likes me, but is this too fast to make such a commitment, and on top of that a long-distance one, to a girl who immediately started hooking up with the first guy she met here? And that after such a short time I already have plans to travel thousands of miles to see her? I just don't know what to think.",05Nov2019,1

I got caught obviously, however I'm not sure which time he caught me but I'm guessing hes checking the back logs now to see if I've done it before.

Some context:
I've been working there for 4 months and my boss is my moms best friend, which is how I know all this. My boss didnt want my mom to tell me but she did cause shes my mom and couldnt not tell me. I'm also a fantastic worker and have really high numbers for only being a part timer.

I personally think I'll get to keep my job but I'm being told this is a bigger offence then I'm thinking.

Any thoughts?",05Nov2019,0
61,"I was going to use a throw away but I’m not even going to bother.

I started a new job on the 18th of October, to stay vague, it’s a traveling construction job. The rotation, I was told before starting was 10 days on the road and 4-5 days home. My first rotation was 11 days on, 4 off. Which I was ok with, not a big deal.

I’m supposed to leave tomorrow for our next rotation that is going to be 21 days. Nobody in our crew was asked, we were just told. Most of these guys don’t care because they don’t have anyone at home. I do, 3 kids and a wife.

The only reason I took this job was because of the pay, and i can do 10 days at a time, but 21 days of 11 hour work days is a long time.

I suffer from bipolar disorder, which even when I’m ok, I’m still a sensitive person, so I can’t even talk to my wife about it without the fear of crying.

My backup plan was to find a new job on the off days but my discreet looking yielded nothing. I’ve considered the Google IT support certification on Coursera, but that’s not an overnight thing.

I just don’t know what to do at this point.

62,"I asked yesterday and nobody answered. Please, any help will do.

Re-pasting:

 I'm 21, jobless, and about to be homeless in the coming months. I live in Rhode Island, and don't have a vehicle. I could feasibly get a Greyhound ticket to just about anywhere in the US, but don't know much about many states. For someone with a GED and a few MOS Certifications, what would be the best place to both find a job (ideally an office related one) and live a relatively comfortable life? I don't have much interest in money beyond keeping myself afloat (i.e paying for rent, food, and internet), if that helps as a metric for relative comfort.

Alternatively, is taking the dive into college for networking and potential career advancement worth the student loan debt? I figure living on campus would at least take some pressure off needing to find somewhere to live for a few years, but I guess I could just as easily end up in the same position then as I am now.

Any real advice would be much appreciated. Apologies for the tone, I am at wit's end.",05Nov2019,1

73,"I’m F15, totally lost. My friend is M17.

Alright, so I moved high schools this summer. I went from china to Canada, and it was a pretty big deal. 

I knew someone from my old school, and our mothers were close friends. However, I wasn’t close to him - he was in the popular group while I just had a small group of close friends.

He also moved from our old school to the same new school in Canada as me. Because our parents were close, and because we lived close together, and because we were the only people we knew at first, we hung out.

He asked me to eat lunch with him, to go to the beach, and I asked him to walk my dog with me. It was nice. However, we were in different grades, so he began making his friends and I began making mine. We drifted apart.

I’ve had a crush on him at one point, but it’s faded/still fading. A few days ago, he asked me to watch a movie with him. So I did.

It was great, but on the bus ride back from the theatre, he showed me texts from his girl in his class. She was basically asking over and over “why are you mad at me,” “why are you leaving me.” 

He explained that she kept asking him to do streaks, but he didn’t do streaks with anyone so he kept declining. Then, she likely thought he was mad at her, so she began texting him about that.

I was so confused about why he was showing me. I also felt jealous, even though I didn’t want to date him. I asked, “is she sliding?” 

He replied, “She was, but I ain’t talking to her any more.”

I honestly don’t know what to make of the situation. He’s a really nice person, friendly, outgoing, considerate, also kinda cute. When we left the theatre, it was 11:00 pm and I was cold, so he gave me his jacket.

I really really don’t know what to think. It’s just complete confusion at this point. Please let me know your thoughts on this! Also, how do I not be jealous/threatened of that girl?",05Nov2019,1

77,"Hey guys,

If your hours are being cut or you aren't being scheduled often does that mean I'm doing something wrong or that they want me to quit, or I am just quick to jumping to conclusions?

I feel I'm a good worker. I'm constantly staying productive, and I usually cover for people when they need it or when the store needs it. I smile a lot towards coworkers and customers - because I genuinely believe in the power of smiling.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. At my old job I was told that I was a hard worker, was always cheery, and I've sort of been told this too at my current job. I'm not working just to work to spend money, I'm working to help pay for the bills at home, and to help pay for small things as I get through college.

I'm just scared that me asking for more hours or me approaching the store about this shows that I'm needy for hours (which I am) but I don't want to look vulnerable or dumb. This other coworker started a few months ago and is getting a significantly huge amount of hours more than me.

We went to see a show that meant a lot to me and I thought we would celebrate after with an early dinner. Well nothing really went to plan. They were late to the show with no apology and I was alone in the middle of 6 empty seats for fifteen minutes. They planned to go to a restaurant that was really ill suited for my diet and typically I’d just settle but I thought they’d at least suggest a place that would offer more that I could eat after hearing my news a few days before. There was a long wait so we tried a burger place and then somehow I lost them on the street after we left that restaurant due to a long wait. I was walking in front and they just didn’t bother keeping up or even letting me know they weren’t behind me. To me, it seems like they just let me walk further and further ahead until I had no idea where anyone was. 

Anyways, I’m trying to find a way to reconcile but I feel so hurt that no one seemed to care on that day and no one seems to know why I’m angry and sad. And I feel like explaining it all to them is putting the work of reconciliation on me when I don’t think I did anything wrong. 

They’re acting like everything is okay and normal but I just find myself crying behind sunglasses when walking down the street and crying in bed and thinking about what happened.

I recently started working as a school photographer. I touch 100s of kids hair in a week. And I just started checking my head because I’m so worried about getting lice. 
I’ll look and there will be just a little bit of white specks. They move super easy. There gone after I shower. It’s usually if I check right before a shower that I see the white specks. But if I check right after I dry my hair and everything there’s nothing. I’ve never seen any lice in my hair. 
I tired doing a coconut oil and tee tree oil mask and using a lice comb on myself and no nits or lice came out of it.

107,I’ve been working at a Dialysis Clinic for about half a year now. The job is one where someone can definitely make a career out of. It just doesn’t make me %100 happy though.

I just recently got offered a job at a medical marijuana dispensary. Pays a little less but I’d get more hours and maybe overtime. I would be a lot happier working there. If I’m being honest I don’t know if this is a place where someone can make a career for themselves. After I told my boss I was thinking about leaving they offered a pay raise and more days to work.

112,"Hi r/advice

Long time, first time and all that. 

I’m not entirely sure what sort of advice I’m after here. Hopefully some success stories or similar. Also, apologies. This might be slightly long. 

A bit of background. 

Around 6 years ago I started having severe anxiety problems. Couldn’t leave the house for a while and had to take a few months of work to work on the problem. After finding some medication that worked for me and some therapy I started to be able to overcome my anxiety problems. Returned to work. Ran a marathon. Recorded an album. All sorts of stuff. It took a few years to really feel like I was overcoming things and being able to go out. Eat. Drink. Relax etc but after a while I could control it enough to be calm (or be perceived as being calm) out and about. 

Since then it’s flared up a little (but never to the same extent) and I’ve been able to keep myself calm through therapy or meditation (exercise. Healthy living are a bit part of my life too so these also help a lot). Because of some of the long term anxiety problems I’ve often not gone into too much detail on it with women when dating and kept things pretty casual without wanting to label things or get too emotionally attached. I wouldn’t hide my anxiety history. It was something I’d always tend to mention, but some elements of anxiety possibly stopped me from getting into longer relationships (they all pretty much had a 6 month shelf life at best and in that time either I’d get bored. They’d get bored or we’d both get bored of each other. Or the usual things - important point is that I was never completely broken up and devastated when things ended. Just the normal amount of sadness before moving on.)

This all changed around 6 months ago when I started dating a lady and we seemed to click almost immediately. We’d hang out a few time’s a week and I explained about the anxiety stuff. We both weirdly had the sole sort of commitment phobia but I’d always maintained the mindset that I wanted to work on myself and change myself for the better if the situation arose. 

We’d been dating a couple of months and though we’d not officially put a label on things we could both tell that this was something different. I shared more of myself than I had done in a long time. As did she, to the point where I felt I could tell her if I was feeling a bit anxious or having a bad anxiety day etc. We’d confide in each other, and though she’d not had any anxiety problems herself, she understood what I was going through and was always a positive person to be around. Which always calmed me down. 

Unfortunately around a month ago, due to a multitude of factors. My impending 30th birthday. Work stresses etc. I was starting to feel more anxious than usual. I saw the signs and booked back in with my therapist which was a big help, and was toying with the idea of going back on medication (this isn’t something I’d take lightly because of the side effects that come with antidepressants). 

The main anxiety related problem I’ve always had is eating in public. If I’m anxious I really struggle to eat when I’m out. Nausea takes control and I just want to throw up, have diarrhoea, black out, die, have organ failure, or all of the above. So I’d chew gum or something to help with the anxiety stuff while eating what I could. I told my girlfriend this. And explained that I was struggling at the moment. It would just be a temporary thing until I was feeling better. But could we maybe take it easy on dinner dates for a bit. She had no issues with this. We were basically past the dinner date stage anyway, just casually spending a few nights a week at one another’s homes. 

So the night before my 30th arrives. We’d organised a to go for dinner in town. Have some drinks and head back to her place. She’s booked the day after off so we could spend most of my birthday together before I had to go off for family stuff. 

I woke up that day feeling massively anxious. It was basically a mixture of lack of sleep. Maybe a bit too much of a heavy weekend and just generally being quite anxious. But fought through it and had a quiet day before going to meet her in town. Dinner was horrific. I just wasn’t feeling great. I ate some food and kept up a jokey banter but really didn’t want to eat a lot of food. I ate what I could and chewed some gum when food became a bit too much for me. 

She knew something wasn’t right but we finished our meal. Paid and left. As we were walking through town she turned to me and asked ‘are you anorexic?’ ‘No’ I replied. I’m just a bit anxious today. 

At this point she became a bit upset and told me about her brother, who had had serious anorexia issues in the past. And she had noticed some similarities. Not eating much. Chewing gum a lot. Rarely having a big appetite. I explained again that the anxiety stuff plays with my appetite a little but mostly sometimes I just struggle eating when I’m in an anxious state. She seemed to be getting more upset but believed me. 

For the record. I’m honestly not anorexic. I’ve got a weird relationship with food sometimes but it’s just an anxiety thing. I challenge you to eat a 3 course meal while you feel like you’re going to die. 

We shared a taxi back to her flat in silence, and after arriving home we had a long conversation about her brother and ultimately her feelings that though she loved me. She couldn’t cope with my anxiety problems. My argument was that her brothers issues were very severe and very different to mine. But she was adamant that she had seen a loved one in hospital due to mental health and couldn’t go through it with someone else. 

After we circled this subject for a while, she came to the conclusion that she didn’t want to see me anymore. Even though I was just going through a mild patch of anxiety and it would pass (because I was working on it and taking the appropriate steps), she didn’t want anxiety hanging over our relationship. 

During this talk she gave me a birthday present. A really thoughtful personal gift that someone who was planning on ending a relationship wouldn’t give. So this ending wasn’t something either of us saw coming. 

This is where I feel like I might need some advice. I’m now 30 (best birthday ever by the way). And after sharing what’s honestly the truest version of myself, I’ve effectively been rejected. And I don’t really know what to do now. It’s taken years to build up the confidence to open myself up to someone (I struggle to talk feelings and such with friends and family) and the end result is that something I can’t control is the reason I’ve been rejected, and I’m completely devastated for the first time in over a decade. I’m not really sure if I could open myself up again ever after this. And I’m really worried that this could make the anxiety come back tenfold. My job involves a lot of public speaking which I’m now worried is going to become very difficult in this situation. 

TL;DR My gf broke up with me the night before my 30th birthday because she didn’t want to deal with my anxiety because it brought up memories of her family members battle with severe mental health and I am now sad.",05Nov2019,1

114,"I went to college and earned a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. in Science Education. I now teach high school Chemistry. Surprisingly, the students aren't an issue once you get the hang of how to control them. Below is a list of my grievances with teaching: 

1. Shit pay....I can't even afford a one bedroom apartment in my city unless I choose to live in a neighborhood where I am likely to be assaulted or robbed. I currently live in a home with a bunch of strangers and we share a bathroom and kitchen. (If you've ever had roommates.....enough said!)
2. Teachers are evaluated using a system that is completely subjective which then affects their pay as well as whether or not they will have a job next year. How I score on my evaluation is completely dependent upon my relationship with my administrator(the person who conducts the evaluation) and whether or not he/she is having a good day. 
3. We're given a 50 minute planning period wherein we're supposed to grade papers, plan lessons, make copies, complete forms for students with exceptionalities, send emails and make phone calls. Obviously 50 minutes is not sufficient but the kicker is that this 50 minutes is frequently taken away so that we can attend bullshit professional development meetings instead. Not one of said meetings has taught me a single thing that I didn't already learn during the 4 years I spent earning an education degree.  
4. Students are frequently put in my class who don't speak a word of English (and I don't speak their language). Naturally, they don't do well in my class and I'm expected to grade them based on ""effort"" (whatever that means). 
5. I teach chemistry(heavily math based course), yet 90% of my students scored poorly on their math final exams in the previous year indicating that they had not mastered the content. After speaking to my students, I learned that the math teachers also give them massive extra credit projects to make sure that they end up with a ""C"" at the end of the year. Then I'm expected to somehow work a miracle when they get to chemistry. 
6. Principals/administrators find passive aggressive ways to make you do what they want. For example, I have a meeting with my principal in a few days to discuss the amount of students who currently have a ""D"" or an ""F"" in my class. This meeting is without a doubt some sort of scare tactic to get teachers to just pass students by any means necessary without explicitly telling them to do so. Sn: a coworker of mine had her meeting with the principal today and came back crying. 
7. Teaching contracts are only a year long these days so you pretty much have to do what administration says (even if your union tells you that you don't ""have"" to) because if you don't, you simply won't be asked back to that particular school for the next school year. They will make sure you don't return by giving you poor marks on those subjective evaluations. 
8. I wouldn't be able to afford a home for......many many many years.....unless I get married.  

Anyways... I wan't out ......but I don't know what I can do with my college degrees and work experience. I had dreams of becoming a Dentist in the past but I gave up on it because I didn't think I was smart enough. Any suggestions??",05Nov2019,0
115,I had a fallout with a girl at school and she made it clear she didn't want to talk to me after I tried being nice. So I distanced myself to avoid drama.

Its getting obvious she is spreading more rumors about me that Im some type of bad person and people are turning against me for no reason. Its really hurting my self esteem. What should I do? I want to confront her before this gets out of hand.  I think that maybe we just have a misunderstanding. Im scared of her but I don't think I have a choice.

117,"So I'm late 20's, I've been seeing a councilor and a psychiatrist for the past 2 years and unemployed for 6 years. I'm on disability for severe anxiety (specifically agoraphobia) and depression, but there's no guarantee that it'll continue since I don't meet the requirements for social security disability as a permanent solution.

Currently I'm fortunate enough to be living with roommates who understand and help, but that's likely to change soon as one is moving and the other is engaged. There is zero chance of me being able to survive on my own financially or mentally, but I've lost both my parents and was never really close with my family. It all adds up to be a massive shitstorm of problems that I cant seem to get out from under. I cant drive without having panic attacks, I barely manage just riding in a car, and outside of my weekly appointments I dont go outside. I've got no friends in the area, or hell hardly at all, and I'm at a loss for what I can even do to avoid being homeless. I've been suicidal in the past with two failed attempts, but have thankfully not felt that urge in a while, but I'm afraid if I do end up homeless that I'll end up right back in that dark hell.

Any advice on options would be greatly appreciated, because honestly I've got no ideas left. Public housing is a long waiting list that I'll likely never make it to the front of in my state, and with no friends or family to rely on I'm honestly scared. In a perfect world I'd find a solution to dealing with the mental health problems and become a functioning human again, but in reality I've had 2 psychiatrists basically give up already so I dont really see an end in sight.",05Nov2019,1

          Ok so for starters this guy had been my best friends for 3 years. I’ve always known he’s meant more to me then I’ve meant to him but I’ve always let it slide as he’s more popular than me. He’s a chill guy but I also hang out with him because he’s better friends with some of our mutual friends and usually I get invited to more stuff when I’m with him. So our mutual friends always go to one friends house every weekend and have a small get together and I’m hardly ever invited but I try to go to become better friends with them. Last Saturday I got invited and things got a little rowdy. Everyone was loud and me and BestF were singing really loud which apparently pissed a few people off. Other than that though I thought everybody had a good time. Well today at the gym I asked him if he had fun at our friends house for small y’all and he said “Yeah but dude you were really annoying.” I asked how so and he said “You were singing too loud and making everyone mad.” I mentioned that he was also singing loud with me and he rolled his eyes and put his headphones in. Later I texted him about it and he said “Well I’ve been talking around and everyone agrees with me that you were annoying.” I honestly didn’t know how to react so I asked why he was talking about me behind my back and he left me on read. Honestly I don’t know if I should drop him or not or if this is a personal issue I need to work out. Any advice is helpful and have a good night!",05Nov2019,1
119,"In May I finish my bachelors degree and have been going back and forth on whether I want to go to law school for years now.

127,"Such a long story, so I'll give the quick and dirty recap of what's going on. I'm American. My partner/husband was British. We didn't have a shared residence, it fit our lifestyles just fine to have some time in Seattle, some time in London and some time apart. He was with me in Seattle for the summer and was hospitalized. He recovered, things were fine. Went home to London and 10 days later he woke up in intensive care and never did figure out how he got there. Things were looking up, I flew over for what was to be 2 weeks to help with recovery, etc. That turned into 30 days hospitalized, finally released, got him home and TWENTY MINUTES later he died right in front of me. 

Well shit, that isn't how this was supposed to go. The grieving and support on that is for another sub.

I don't really understand how it all works here, I know I need to go through a probate process. Fortunately there is no other family at all, we're talking very small amount of money in the bank, no major pensions or trusts. Actually slightly more debt that cash available. There is artwork, not super high end stuff, but still some decent stuff. Furniture is nothing fancy at all. Thrift shops would probably love it, but it's not antique or worth much. Thousands of books. Piles of stamps, highly unlikely to be anything rare or expensive, but there might be some value to a casual collector. Same with foreign currency, an amateur collection, but some cool bills and coins from the past 50 years, various countries. Pretty sizable inventory of professional art supplies, most of them not opened or barely touched. No car. House isn't owned.

Is anyone here in London, or maybe has experience with the auction scene here? I am next of kin but also executor, so I do have permission to have this stuff appraised and sold. We're not talking Bonham's and Sotheby's level of stuff. I'm looking for any advice or recommendations for an auction house that can handle a decent amount of pretty average stuff. The type of place that can haul it, store it if needed, work with probate, I know there will be fees and profit sharing, that's fine... and I don't even know what else I might need them to do. But surely this type of thing happens. I don't care about absolute top dollar (or pound), it's important that i raise some funds, but it doesn't have to be paid immediately. I just want a fair shake with a reputable auction house that is also able to manage a lot of these things for me since I'm not local and I can't stay in London too much longer.

129,"Just as a disclaimer: this is some ex-flame relationship type thing and it’s really not crazy serious I just am seeking advice from objective parties.

Here’s the whole context of the story:

(Past, 2 years ago): I’m 17 years old and a year into a situationship with a girl we’ll call Samantha. We weren’t dating, but would do all the stuff couples would. We’d go out and do things together, and consistently every weekend she would come over, stay at my house, sleep in my bed, we’d make out and all that. Then, out of nowhere Samantha says she doesn’t wanna do it anymore and I’m confused but then about a month later she starts dating a guy we’ll call Alan (It should be stated here that Samantha is 2 years younger than me). This really hurt me because I really had feelings for Samantha and she obviously didn’t feel the same.

I never really got closure on the situation as to why she so abruptly ended whatever we had going so I spent a lot of time dwelling on it and the best I could come up with is that she wanted to be with someone her own age and experience the whole high school relationship thing (I ended up going to college an hour and a half away from my hometown).

(Present day):
This last Saturday I had a party in my hometown for Halloween and invited old friends and all that, we’re well into the night and she ended up showing up at my house. The last time I talked to her was the night before I left for university I told her that some of my favorite memories of high school were with her. That was last year and now she was in my house, no invitation no announcement of coming. A few of my boys told me she was there so I was mentally preparing myself to talk to her and she came to me and asked if it was okay she was there and I said no. She didn’t think I was serious until she saw I wasn’t laughing and her face turned to a very sad expression and I was like sh*t I can’t take seeing her like that so I said yeah I was joking (weak move I know). The night goes on and she reveals she broke up with Alan and said it’s mainly because they aren’t going to the same university after they graduate, I ask where she’s going and it’s the neighboring university to mine, 15 minutes away. At this point my minds racing, why is this girl popping into my life when I never though I’d have to deal with this again, things of that nature. All the while we’re talking about this, Alan is blowing up her phone saying things like “Please don’t f him, come talk to me, etc” and she keeps ignoring him. Nothing ended up happening we didn’t kiss or anything, 2 of her friends ended up crashing in my room while me and her slept in my bed together and she was kinda laying up on me and we laughed and carried on all night.

I told her what I believed to be the truth, that she would get to university and meet some guy within the first week and be chasing after him probably, and that it’s probably better she breaks it off now rather than later.

My boys are very happy this happened because they know how much I liked her, I tried dating a girl last year and she was really sweet but I just didn’t feel the same way for her the way i did for Samantha, and all it took was for one night for all of the old feelings to come back. My older sister doesn’t like her though because she knows how much she hurt me when she left me for Alan. 

I don’t know what it is about us humans but it seems that the ones that hurt us and don’t want us are the ones we long for.

The advice I’m asking for though is if you think I should go after her, or do you think she had some kind of motive to come to my party (like make Alan jealous)?

134,"I’ve had my shitzu pug for 6 years now. She is basically my Emotional support animal. Problem is, my dog cannot be alone. Her breeder was not licensed and she was not probably taken care of when I got her. She has bad separation anxiety. Whenever I leave for work I leave her with my mother. I don’t like leaving my dog with her but I don’t have anyone to watch her. My mother expects me to finically take care of her for the rest of her life. She has verbally said that was the reason she had kids. And out of the 3, I’m the only boy, so naturally, my sisters found men to take care of them and left. She has become toxic and our relationship is stressing me out and I cannot handle it anymore. I cannot afford to take care of everyone. I’m 20, and I feel like I’m in a forced marriage with someone I have to support. I’m stressed enough as it is. I have been dealing with her because I don’t have anyone else to watch my dog. I can’t leave her in a crate for 9 hours a day, 5 days a week. She whines, cries and barks when she’s alone so I cannot leave her alone in my apartment alone. I cannot afford to pay someone to watch her everyday. The only way I can keep my dog in my everyday life is if I stay connected with my mother. So basically the only way to keep my best friend is to continue torturing myself by staying in contact with my mother. Help plz and sorry if this isn’t structured well, I’m not sober.

He at first tried to defend his gf by saying stuff like “oh she probably didn’t know what she was doing” and “it’s not that big of a deal” but we ended up convincing him to talk to his gf about the situation. 

As his friend I’m at a loss as to what to do, ive never met his gf but I honestly hate her now. And her image in my and my other friends minds is forever tainted.

142,"Okay, so I had my grandmother come over and was dropped off by my grandfather, she was with us for a couple of hours until my grandmother and mom decided to leave to get something from the store. So my grandfather comes to the driveway and honked 3 times.

I see him and call his phone to tell him that grandmother and mom went to the store and they'll be right back, so he says ""Oh okay, I'll come back then"", so 10 minutes later, my mom and grandmother return back and we wait for 10 minutes as my grandfather pulls up to our driveway and waits.

So my grandmother comes out and as she's about approaching the car, my weirdo obese neighbor comes out of his house and appeared to either stare at us or stare at my grandmother as she was about to enter my grandfather's car.

My mother and I stared at him, while I thought he was coming out to get something from his car or dumping out trash. NOPE, he literally stood there until my grandmother was about to enter the car then went inside.

I am so pissed off because I don't know if he was trying to be intimating to us or my grandmother, yet I don't like this. As my grandmother was entering the car, she even looked at him and was confused about it. 

He's always been this weird and unfriendly bastard, we've lived here for 4 years and he still does this crap with stopping to give quick nosy stares then turning his back, yet now he became too comfortable with coming outside to look at my grandmother entering a car, like she was a criminal or something.

When he had those speakers in his SUV and would blast that heavy metal music coming down the street and into his driveway at night, I didn't come out to stare at him. Thankfully that piece of shit car is dead, since he never took care of it.

I feel angry and think I should've said something to him, that was crossing the line. He could've done that to me and I wouldn't care but my grandmother? Yeah, I need some advice please. My mom just wants me to ignore it but that was a bit too much to just ignore.",05Nov2019,1
143,"I have been wandering my whole life without any real sense of direction. My parents didn't really teach me anything that applies to life, nor did school. I decided to get a girlfriend for my senior year of high school because I saw other guys with girls and I felt lonely. This was a huge mistake, because I was blindsided by her manipulation when she forced me to go to the same college as her or she would break up with me. Before I met her, I didn't have any motivation to go to college. Since she was pushing me to get higher education, my parents praised her for this, and my parents also began to push me to go to college. My parents are generously paying for my college expenses, but this too is another reason why I don't want to be here. I hate having to depend on my parents for financial needs. I want to have my own financial independence. I just wanted to get by on a simple job, live somewhere with relatively low cost of living, and just be content with life.

Now that I am in college, I haven't found any motivation to continue on for another semester. Let me just get it out now that I do not like schoolwork. I do not like doing assignments that do not interest me at all. College is this amplified version of high school, with more and more work. I just lack the motivation to keep doing these uninteresting assignments without any real feeling of reward at all. I want to live life by experiencing it and I feel like going to college is just going to make my life go too fast. I'm always having to stress about completing assignments, and doing all of these complicated homework assignments that just hurt my brain and it all just mentally exhausts me so much. I

144,"A little more info. I've been smoking a pack a day since I was 16. Also started smoking weed daily around that time as well. Just so y'all know the length of time. 

I haven't had a cigarette in just over 4 months. Definitely noticed improved breathing, much less coughing and shortness of breath. 

About 2 months after quitting cigs, I started coughing up a very thick and very dark mucus. It's obviously a lot of tar. Like when you sneeze and a big glob of mucus flies out of your throat, it used to be what I considered regular and now that it's black it also feels much thicker, much more viscous. 

I find myself constantly clearing my throat as this junk is always caught around my vocal cords. Like 20x per day or more. It's incredibly annoying and I feel like I annoy those around me with all my ahems. 

Is there anything I can do to help make this better? I've tried like cough drops and hard candies to see if my throat was just dry but didn't really help.

I feel so alone, scared and confused. I come from a very religious and conservative family. I managed to keep the secret about my homosexuality from them throughout middle school, although I told my aunt once while having a breakdown and contemplating suicide. I tried to ignore these feelings throughout high school but now, for some reason, it is becoming more and more difficult. I find myself being attracted to the same gender, having inappropriate thoughts, and indulging in homosexual videos. I am 19 and I live with parents, who I love very much. I would never want to go against what they believe, or to disappoint them. I really hope that I do not offend anyone but our Christian beliefs also say that homosexuality is not okay so I am afraid about that.😥 And I do not intend to let my parents (or anyone for that matter) know about me. I love my parents so much, they are wonderful parents and I just wonder what they would say and think if they knew the truth about me.:( I feel so guilty and ashamed, and trapped in my own thoughts and mind. I feel very sad and like I am going crazy. I have nothing against people on the basis of sexuality of course, but I just wish that I personally was not this way and that there was something that I could do.

155,"Okay, clearly this isn’t my main account as some coworkers know my main. And I will apologize if this comes out as rambling or disorganized. I’m still trying to figure out if I’m overreacting or what. 

If it matters here’s a little backstory:
I’m a  34F manger for a major retailer. Been with the company for about 14 years and in this particular store for 3 years. There’s never been any issues...until recently. 

My general manager has gotten increasingly “touchy” and I didn’t even realize how far it’s gotten until today. He’s maybe 20 years older and an overall cheery nice person. But over the past few months I’ve noticed small things he does that might come off as inappropriate. For instance, while making a joke he’ll lean in too closely and always touch my back where my bra strap will be. At first I didn’t pay attention to it. But now the hand lingers longer than necessary and his thumb will kind of “strum” the strap. (If that makes sense)
Then there’s the comments...a shirt was ordered for me in a size too small and he asked me “what t shirt contest do you plan on entering with that?” 
I was completely taken aback and just left the room. But what did it for me was something was said about me being in a bad mood and he reached and grabbed my side while I was sitting at my desk as if to try to tickle me. But it felt more like just being felt up honestly. When I didn’t laugh he commented with “what? Not ticklish?” To which I replied “I am but that was weird”  and that was that. I left shortly after and as soon as I got in my car I felt gross and cried. There was someone else in the room and after I bolted out of there I texted them to see if I was overreacting. They said absolutely not and apologized for not seeing the action being done and suggested I call hr. 
And now here I am asking the internet their take on it. 
I am sorry if this sounds rushed and not well put together....my mind is in 1000 places.",05Nov2019,1

Where I live this testing would be free, but I cant go do it because my parents wont let me. I don't wanna sound annoying but some people on here have told me that I'm probably just faking and want attention. But that's not the case. I just wanna graduate tbh.

I used to be pretty confident in my 5.5"" dong but lately I've been feeling self conscious. I've been hearing a bunch of stories how women want a member 8"" or over for the longest time. That is until i was browsing Reddit out of general boredom (something i haven't done in a long time) and heard from one Redditor that even 7.5"" was too big.

So now I am asking, does size matter? And if so, is 5.5"" too smal?

179,"Looking for a bit of advice. Anonymous account just for personal reasons.

I finally received my acceptance into what I thought was my dream job, although now that I’m actually working the job, it isn’t what I thought it was. 

I am seemingly upset/depressed going into work every single day, and the pay really isn’t amazing. They are overworking the employees, having 5 people do the work of what should be 10 or more. 

This is a government position, the benefits and pay are decent however in my location i can get better benefits and similar pay at a call center or something with low stress and brainless work. 

The only difference I can foresee is the retirement. If I choose to go to a different place, they won’t have government retirement like what I would get now. But I don’t know if I’ll survive a lasting career with this position I’m currently in.

Looking for advice from people that have more experience in this type of situation. Thanks",05Nov2019,1
180,"This is my first time posting, so sorry if I'm in the wrong spot. I am at a loss of what to do right now and would appreciate any help I can get. 

I am pregnant with my first child who is due in February. My mom insisted that I moved back in with her to save money/have extra help with babysitting when the baby is born since my fiance and I both work crazy hours. Me, not seeing it as a horrible idea, took her up on her offer.

My mom and I have always had a wishy-washy relationship (I'm 27 years old and she likes to treat me as if I'm still her child she can control, even with my own baby on the way). I thought things would be better moving in since I am pregnant and need to be stress free, but I think I may have been wrong. 

I have two pets that I love dearly, a 9 year old Shih Tzu mix that she adores, and then there's my cat. She is a sweet, well-behaved cat that keeps mostly to herself, doesn't get in to anything, knock anything over, etc. She sleeps on the couch and plays with me at night time. 

My mom has 2 medium sized dogs that just cannot get used to my cat being in the house. They growl, bark, and try to attack her any chance they see her. When they do see her, she is usually trying to get up to my bedroom or down to the basement where her food and litter box is. 

Today, the basement door was closed and when my cat tried to escape, she was cornered and had both of my mom's dogs on top of her trying to kill her. My mom yelled and punished her dogs, but later told me that she ""wouldn't be punishing her dogs over my STUPID cat."" 

I love my pets more than anything, and being pregnant, they are sometimes all I feel that I have. How should I go about this situation? My mom INSISTED I move in with her, I am made to respect her things at all costs, yet she is okay with letting her dogs try to kill my cat and says she shouldn't punish them for doing so.

My best friend (lets call her B) has been friends with a boy (lets call him A) for about 7 years now (since second grade) and B has recently realized all the mental damage A has caused for her. B has also begun a cycle: she stops being friends with A after remembering how bad A was to her then about a week later she becomes friends with him again, because B and her friends pressure her into wanting to be friends with her again. This has been going on for about 4 months now and she recently became so confused with her own decisions and thoughts that she doesn't know if she wants to be friends with him or not.  The best way that I could describe it is that: **B is not sure if she wants to be friends with A or not but when she leans to the side of not being friends with him, B and her peers (Mostly B) both pressure her into wanting to be friends with A again.**

So me and Rose have had problems in the past, mostly due to the fact that she treats me like an absolute pile of shit, she has too much power in her head and at the same time doesn’t know much about being a manager, o my reason she is there is because she’s worked there for 3 years and is dating Dan. One night we were short on servers and I was scheduled to leave at 9 (but usually if we have all our stuff done and it’s not busy we can leave earlier, some days i leave at 7 or 8 pm) So i asked Roger who the closing server was and he said that Rose would be doing the closing server duties so i’m like okay so I’m the next to leave right and he agrees.

As I don't have any way to find a partner with common set of mind with me, and nothing else really interests me (I don't even know what should I spend my money on) I decided that the most optimal way to reach happiness is to quit my job and lose weights without exiting my apartment.

189,"Okay so I met this guy from a mutual friend and then we clicked became really close friends, he’s introduced me to his family I’ve slept over his house a few times and we’ve been on a vacation twice just us two. He goes to my school so we often see each other the days where we both have school. During our first vacation I found out that he was gay but not out. I waited until after our vacation to tell him I knew about his secret and he was completely shocked. I didn’t tell him that I was gay until weeks after when he heard a Grindr (gay app) notification sound from my phone. From that point we became even more close, now sharing our gay experiences with each other. He’s been on and off (2.5/3 years) in this toxic relationship with this guy who’s extremely abusive and manipulative and has threatened his life multiple times. Being a good friend i of course let him know that this isn’t worth the trouble regardless of how amazing the sex is. He agrees but somehow always finds himself back over there. Anyways, during our second vacation we ended up getting super drunk one night and hooked up. The next day we acted as if nothing happened and continued on enjoying the rest of our vacation. Till this day we’ve never spoken about it, which is no issue for me at all. So here’s my problem, I being the dumbass that I am developed a strong liking towards this guy and I’ve tried to ignore it in hopes that it’s fade but I just can’t seem to shake this feeling. He calls/texts me basically everyday, we know each other inside and out. He tells me EVERYTHING about his on and off again situationship and stresses that he despises the guy. 

So basically my question is, should I pursue him which might ultimately damage our friendship? Or should I just let it go and not say how I truly feel? Or should I express how I feel and leave things in his hand?

Sidebar: We both get extremely horny when we smoke weed, which is why when we do it together it’s never just the two of us there’s always someone else.

(I’m a bisexual 18yo female, dating a straight 20yo male.)

I cheated. I kissed a girl. It was very brief. Me and this girl have always been calling each other pretty in class, and making jokes about how we would smash and stuff like that, just stupid stuff that didn’t mean anything at all to me. Is she beautiful and smart? 

Yes. Am I attracted to her? Yes. Was I worried about if I were to cheat? Of course not! I love my boyfriend. But recently, the playfulness has escalated. Before it was just words, maybe a little hair play, but nothing crazy.

She started touching me, my face, hands, thighs and butt. Nothing suuuuper crazy, just a subtle hand placement. And I can’t lie, I enjoyed it. I liked it. I felt guilty. I wasn’t doing anything, but I wasn’t saying stop either. I would fantasize about kissing her, or *ahem* other things. I would have my arm around her waist, or run my hands along her backside, and I knew it was wrong. I am very attracted towards her.

Eventually, we kissed. It didn’t even last a second; a quick peck because she started laughing and squealing with joy, haha. I’ve talked to my boyfriend before about me being playful with other girls, he said he doesn’t care as long as he knows about it. I didn’t tell him this time because I think I want more than to mess around for a day. I want her. But at the same time, I don’t know if we would work together, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a female due to every female i’m interested in being straight. 

I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend knows about it, says he doesn’t care. But I feel so guilty. I feel like he should break up with me. I feel like I’ve disappointed him as a partner.  I told him if he feels I betrayed him, or if he’s uncomfortable with something like this happening, then he shouldn’t be with me.

Yet, I love him and do not want him to leave me... I am very young, so me being confused and figuring out relationships is normal, but I have no idea what I’m doing. I’ve thought about polyamory, but I don’t like the idea of it. Maybe this is the beginning of commitment issues ?

Hey guys so I (21F) am recently going through a breakup with a guy (21) that I had been dating for like a year and a half. I just want to hear your thoughts and opinions on this. So a bit of context: I go to a university an hour away from our hometown and for the last school year he would visit me every weekend and he was so in love with me and honestly we were great together. He decided he wanted to come to my university this fall semester and he got his own apartment because we both agreed we didn’t want to rush into living together. We would sleep together every night though, either at his apartment or mine. He would call me all the time after he got off work and would always be so excited to come home and cuddle me. Everything was going fine until one day he had 3 days off so he went to his hometown to visit his family. While he was there he didn’t text or call me much which I thought was odd since he always communicates with me. I was a little upset with him because of that so when he came back i went to his apartment and I was going to ask him why was he being so dry. Anyway I get to his apartment and we hug but he can tell I’m a little upset and so we start talking and I don’t know how we got the point where I asked him “so do you want to break up” and he just looks at me and said yea. At that point I started crying. He tells me that he smoked weed with his friends and that he just had this epiphany of life. He started saying that there’s this girl he dated before that he can’t get out of his head. He started saying that he needs to be alone to achieve all the things he needs to achieve. That he has great things and has to unlock the secrets of the world and make tons of money for his people. He said that he knows things people don’t and that he is about to go on a scary path and once he starts there’s no turning back. I tried to tell him how come I couldn’t be a part of his life while his friends could (this was just me being emotional and trying to make it work). He just said he couldn’t do it because he needs to be alone. Point is I did end up leaving eventually even after he said he did love me and that I was the best thing that had happened to him. Basically he messaged me yesterday again if we could meet to talk. I thought he had realized he fucked up and that he loved me but when we meet he just kneels and told me that he wanted to ask for my forgiveness. He starts saying that he was just there to ask for my forgiveness because he’s trying to be good with everything in his life. Again, my hope was crushed. He said that he was so sorry he hurt me and that he didn’t expect me to forgive him but that he needed to ask for it so he could be at peace. I was pissed because I was honestly doing pretty good and now I feel like shit again. I asked him again why the sudden change. He started telling me that he was in a rabbit hole and that he needed to help everyone out of it. He said that he sees all the patterns of the world and knows how fucked everything is. He started saying that he is going to be a big dog with money and that on the way he might get murdered because of everything he knows but that he’s okay with that because at least he’s living his truth. He was saying he’s scared but that this is what he needs to do. I know this is all so long lol I tried to make it as short as possible but there’s a lot of little things that are important. The thing is, I believe every bit of the things he told me. I believe he will do great things. I almost even feel bad exposing this here. Idk I just want to see what he sees. I feel blind for not being able to see what he sees. I want to talk to people that see it too. I want to be on that level.",05Nov2019,1
203,"Hello Reddit, on mobile, sorry for typos etc. For some backstory, my aunt and uncle have repeatedly invited me to move up to Colorado with them and try and start a life up here, I have lived in Texas my whole life to this point. 
I moved from Texas to Colorado in July of this year, and when I did, I was working with my uncle at his company for work. After a couple months, I felt that the job wasn’t something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and since that’s what he was looking for (a career employee), I decided to quit his company and start looking for a new job. The morning I decided that the job wasn’t for me, I speak to both of them at breakfast and I am told that I have a year from the day I moved up here to live rent free.  The next day, I get a job offer as a caretaker, where they’re promising 40+ hours a week and a solid paycheck. I work there for 2 months, and never see close to 40 hours, I’m having my schedule shifted around the day of, overall horrible management and experience. I communicate these frustrations with my aunt and uncle, and when I start thinking about quitting, they support me and say they would do the same if they were in my position. I quit and it has since been 2 (going on 3) weeks, where I’ve had several interviews with different employers, and been actively searching for a job. I have a acquired part time job at FedEx, and interviews schedule both in person and on the phone for this week with a high likely hood of working of me working another job by the end of the week if not next. Last night, my uncle pulls me aside after dinner and tells me he wants a check for 1000 USD by the 12th, so it will “motivate me to get over 40 hours a week and reacclimate me to paying bills”. I was confused, as the deal was (from both my aunt and uncle) that I lived for a year rent free from my move in date (June 15, 2019- June 15, 2020). I spoke with him about that and he says he wants the money still, but I have also looked at places that cost 750 USD a month and only the same as deposit, however, that would take a while to get approved and the move in date isn’t until later December. I have to pay taxes at the end of the year, my aunt helped me figure them out how much it’ll cost me to do that, and I don’t know if I’ll have enough to pay taxes and pay 2400 or so out of pocket until the end of the year. I don’t want to pay the 1000 dollars because I feel like my aunt and uncle broke their word about me living rent free, so I was debating on what I should do. I’ve considered living in my car for a couple months until I have enough for sure for an apartment, and I have a friend who said I could crash at his place for a week (which I want to do as a last resort, I don’t know him too well). Anyways, what’re your thoughts reddit? Do I live in my car until I can move into my own place or do I spend 2k and live with family who may switch up on my again? 

TLDR: Aunt and Uncle break their word about my living situation, ask for over priced rent. Do I move out and live in my car to save up for my own place?",05Nov2019,1
204,"Let me start off by saying I'm a 25 year old Male. Long story short my mother, when I was around 9, chose drugs over my little brother and I. Pawned everything in the house, brought us to drug deals, after losing us went to foster care and 3 years later we were back across country with our family. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, she came back in my life. Tried reaching out to my little brother and I for a relationship. I was hesitant at first for obvious reasons but went along with it. 3 months in, I found myself totally forgiving her for her past and even considered her my mother again. After about 4 months of her being back up north with us, she decided to move back down to Louisiana where it all happened. It broke my heart that I put everything I had into rebuilding our relationship and she just up and left. Once again fast forward to present day (3 months ago). I recieved word she drank herself to death and passed in her sleep. I felt nothing at all. No sorrow, no guilt, not grief one bit. Everytime I told someone this, and expressed I'm worried I'm just stone cold hearted, they all say she was my mom regardless and I'll grieve eventually. Well I figured ok when I recieved her ashes I'll just have a old fashioned break down and cry it out. Nope. Nothing changed at all. And to this day when I think about her, i still feel nothing at all. I guess what I'm wondering is why am I like this. I mean I cry way more often than I'd like to admit in sappy movies and consider my self very empathetic. Am I just cold hearted? A narcissist? What the hell is wrong with me? Or is this normal.

(Literally just paused writing this to pick them) 

Also ever since I was little, I’ve had a lot of skin peeling around my finger nails which I also tend to bite and pick at a lot. Added to that I find I tend to bite off small chunks of the skin right next to my finger nails. 

Honestly I have no idea what to do about it. I don’t like having my hands look all gross all the time but I can’t help but do it. I’m also sorry if this all sounds disgusting, I just want some advice on what to do about it.

Thanks!!",05Nov2019,1
207,"I am a 19 year old male virgin who had an opportunity to lose it around 7 months ago. There was this girl who was attracted to me and I knew she only really liked me for my looks. The only issue is I tried to convince myself otherwise, thinking we could have a good relationship or what have you. When the time comes to do stuff with her, all I could do was make out with her, and feel her up, nothing else, despite the fact she was blatantly hinting at doing more. I was very emotionally stunted at this time as I was confused and she was the first girl I dated, so I didn't know what to do. I feel a sense of shame for not doing more with this girl as she was very cute and I'm angry that I didn't. Not to mention all those stupid, overly dramatic, damn near bipolar texts I sent her. As I said, this happened 7 months ago, and I can't let this go, I can't stop blaming myself for not going further. She saw me as nothing more than an attractive guy to have sex with, I saw her as a potential love interest. I'm sure most of you guys here have had a similar experience where you fall for a girl that you really shouldn't have fell for and have similar cases of regret. Not a single day goes by where I don't think about how wrong things went. For those of you who have experienced something similar, what can I do to get this girl out of my head? I try to cope by comparing myself to others who have less experience than me, but that doesn't help tame the shame and regret I feel.",05Nov2019,1

211,"Alt

To sum up my family life. I had two lesbian moms, one of whom (I’ll call her Ki) artificially impregnated herself and got pregnant with me. I got adopted by the one (I’ll call her Gr), then they divorced. I spend every other weekend with Gr and the rest with Ki.

I absolutely despise Gr, to the point where I break down and cry when I have to go to her house for the weekend. She is and controlling, manipulative b*tch, and I’m at the point where I could say that straight to her face and care less about the consequences. I’m done with her. She lives 45 minutes away, and when I’m trying to maintain a job and social life, it’s hard not to dislike having to go to Gr’s house as it is. Pile that on to the above statements and I’m dead set on getting her out of my life permanently. As a 15 yo living in Missouri, United States, is there anything I can do to emancipate her, or at least to see her less? I would do anything it takes and save and spend as much money as it takes to get this done.

To be clear,I am perfectly fine living with Ki and her new wife. They are saints compared to Gr, and I wouldn’t have a problem continuing to live with them. If I could prove that Gr treats me poorly and that Ki + wife and financially stable enough to maintain and stay steady without Gr’s child support, could that help? I’m open to anything, and please dm me if it’s anything personal or if more context is needed.",05Nov2019,1
212,"Hello all. So, I recently started coaching a local travel swim team as a part time job and I absolutely love it! Most of the kids are very well behaved and work very hard. The swimmer I am concerned about absolutely falls into this category. He does everything we ask to the tee, and, despite not being the fastest, always puts in a solid effort. I'll call him ""Antonio"" here. He is about 12-13 y/o, fairly tall and VERY skinny. My guess would be 5'8 110-115 soaking wet (pun intended). 

After an intense practice today, another coach and I were joking around with the kids and telling them to have a good meal tonight to help recover. Antonio was last out of the water and when we told him about having a meal he said something along the lines of ""I'm too tired for food"". I said that he should eat anyway as it will give him energy and make him less tired. He froze a second and said that he doesn't want more energy and just wants to go home and sleep. Fair enough. But then he adds that he doesn't eat after practice pretty regularly. This kind of struck me, because as a former swimmer, my teammates and I were always starving after practice. 

I'm pretty concerned that Antonio might be at risk for/may already be developing an eating disorder. This is about the age where it would start and he has a very detail-focused and driven personality which is often associated with such a disorder. I don't have anymore possible evidence than this, and I'm still fairly new, so I'm not sure if its out of place to say something. The other coach is new as well and I haven't said anything to him about it yet. 

So Reddit, any other signs to watch out for/general advice about what to do?

TL;DR I am a new club level swim coach and I suspect that one of the young guys might be on track or may already be developing an eating disorder due to some of his comments about food and his detail-oriented personality.",05Nov2019,1
213,"So this girl I like likes me back, we're very good friends and have close for a while. We hang out after school but never at my house alone,we always friends over, or we don't just regular hang out. Our highschool offers a homework club and we go there then down the street to get snacks sometimes before she drops me off. The other day I woke up late in the night to her saying she likes me. I was surprised because she said she never wants to date anyone because her sisters have been in unhealthy relationships before and is scared of one because of it so she never wants to date anyone, but she said she'll think about if she wants to go out or not. Do you think I should ask if she wants to hang out alone sometime and watch movies together? Or should I just leave her to decide? I'm really confused because I really like this girl and I don't want her feelings to fade so I don't want to go at a pace that makes her uncomfortable because I want her to be happy and feel like she's not in a bad position.

214,"I usually try to get my friends to come online, and usually they're cool with it and say they'll be on in about an hour or two, however, as one could probably assume this usually ends up not happening, as in they say they'll be on just to tell me later that they can't come online. Tonight was one of these nights. I asked them if they were free tonight, and if they'd be down to come online tonight, and they all said yes. We scheduled to call at around 7PM, and when it does roll around no one is responding to any texts, calls, etc. 30 minutes go by, no responses. an hour, 1 1/2 hour, until finally, 2 hours after they said they can come online they tell me that they couldn't come online tonight.

I am usually used to this, as they are usually busy doing other stuff while I've got nothing better to do then play video games, since I usually do everything I need to do earlier in the day. Today was an exception however, as I skipped going to the movies with my parents and siblings because I knew that we were going to have a call. I was pretty pissed when they finally texted me, so I sent them the whole part about missing out on the movies and how I was pretty disappointed with them, etc. to which they fire back at me, calling me the bad guy, saying that I had no life outside of a computer, all that jazz.

After a slightly long argument I decided to apologize to them, and admit that I was being an a-hole (even though I really wasn't) and stopped arguing with them right there on the spot.

TL;DR - My buddies said they could play online with me tonight, I waited for them for a long time, missing going to the movies with my family, they finally responded 2 hours after scheduled time telling me that they were busy, I was pissed and told them about the whole movie thing, they ended up calling me the asshole and told me I was being inconsiderate  and rude about the whole thing (even though I wasn't) and I finally just agreed with them to stop the argument.

217,"I'm working as a sole employee of an entrepreneur. It sounded like a decent-ish opportunity, he seemed eccentric but very good at the skills that define our industry. I thought I'd learn a lot from him.

There were red flags from the beginning but I ignored them. The first telephone interview was nearly 90 minutes long. My first in person interview with him was also a 90+ minute session, just the two of us in his office. It took over a month of talking everything out over the phone because he kept alternating between moving forward and pulling back. I could tell he was very neurotic but wrote it off to his protectiveness of his business.

Well, it's kind of just continued like that. It's just the two of us in a small office and my day is pretty much defined by his eccentricities, which have nothing to do with what I thought I was signing up for. Much like those early interviews, he will abruptly decide we need to spend an hour or more on some random thing, like writing an e-mail, that really doesn't warrant that attention. It's not an uncommon thing for him to drag me into his conspiracy theory views on the world or his fight with someone over the dangers of BPA. He sometimes just stands behind my head and goes on a monologue.

After less than 2 weeks, he sat me down on one of his hour long monologues about how he doesn't like my phone voice (I have a speech problem) even though I'm rarely on the phone and I told him bluntly that I already had my 2 weeks typed up. He turned around for a while, probably realizing that it didn't really make sense to make issues out of what's virtually nothing.

But the boulder's rolled back down the hill and he's at it again. Hours and hours of sitting with me talking about minutia that has little objective content. It's hard to get into it while maintaining privacy but he is obsessive about a lot of things that most people would not consider reasonably important part of my job. 

I feel like he's getting more erratic and I regret not just walking the first time I thought about it. The problem is now I feel royally fucked. I'm 2, almost 3 months into the job and I don't know how I'm going to explain why I need to bail to prospective employers. I also feel like as long as I'm there, I have zero breathing room because he has literally nothing else to put his attention on 90% of the time.

So, here's my problem. I play a lovely video game and do challenging content with a group of guild mates. My brother is also part of this guild, but we don't usually run together. Learning and getting through new content takes time, and like everyone else in the group, I make mistakes once in a while. I usually apologize, and do my best to avoid making the same mistake again. Sometimes, I'll apologize for things that aren't my fault or I'll apologize for messing up despite the fact that none of us saw a certain mechanic coming. When this happens, I apologize for apologizing. You know, like an idiot.

My brother has called it ""fucking annoying"" multiple times, and thinks I'm insufferable. He's even blown up at me for it, and yelled at me to ""stop apologizing and just learn to not do it again."" My though process to that is: why not both? Why can't I apologize and learn?

Anyways, I think I'm apologizing so much because I really like my teammates. I think they're super cool and I want to be friends with them, but I find them intimidating because of said coolness.

222,"I feel I need to provide backstory about myself first so others will understand why I’m feeling so conflicted with comments made by other co-workers.

Backstory:
5ish years ago my sister completed suicide. She had suffered many traumas in her life and had so many setbacks. Even when she mentioned to me thoughts of suicide a couple years earlier I never thought she would actually complete suicide. I had not been personally affected by the loss of a loved one from suicide prior to my sister. I thought only selfish, ignorant people could behave actually kill themselves leaving behind their family and friends who loved them so much. One early morning I learned exactly how wrong I was when I woke up to the news that my sister had completed suicide during the night. She had four beautiful children that meant the world to her, a large loving family and so many friends...sadly we all ignored the signs or didn’t realize the warnings. I question everything I said and every interaction between us once she passed. To this day I still personally struggle with that loss, it is grief and it comes in waves. I can go days without it hurting when I think of her laugh or how she would react to a choice or joke I made, but there are times the loss is so hard that I break down in tears at a song or memory. 

Current situation:
A co-worker of mine completed suicide over the weekend. I only found out last night through another co-worker. Due to the time of year and proximity to the 5 year anniversary of my sister’s passing it has dredged up a lot of emotions. I am so terribly sad for my co-worker’s family and friends. This is a loss they will grieve the rest of their lives. But as it is with life and work things have to continue on, while taking a break with some other co-workers two guys I have built a genuine friendship with expressed how they couldn’t believe of the passing of this co-worker and how “selfish” he was and that he had basically said a big final “fuck you!” To all of those who loved and cared for him. 

It shocked me to a point that I simply excused myself and walked away. I wanted to tell them they (and I) should be grateful that we have never been so far in the dark or felt so alone that we felt suicide was the only way to stop the pain but of course I couldn’t. I walked away and kept to myself the remainder of the day. And I don’t know if it would even be appropriate to broach a conversation and let them know how hurtful their comments were to me personally. Maybe due to how close we are to the anniversary of my sister I am just hyper-sensitive, I’m sure I am. And since we’re only co-workers I don’t know that it’s worth causing an issue or “stirring” the pot. 

Any ideas, should I keep this to myself? Should I address these people I have built friendships with? I’m just so unsure of myself in this scenario",05Nov2019,2

So everything was going fine until one day he had 3 days off so he went to his hometown to visit his family. While he was there he didn’t text or call me much which I thought was odd since he always communicates with me. Anyway, I get to his apartment and we hug but he can tell I’m a little upset and so we start talking and I don’t know how we got the point where I asked him “so do you want to break up” and he just looks at me and said yea. At that point I started crying. He tells me that he smoked weed with his friends and that he just had this epiphany of life. He started saying that there’s this girl he dated before that he can’t get out of his head. He started saying that he needs to be alone to achieve all the things he needs to achieve. That he has great things and has to unlock the secrets of the world and make tons of money for his people. He said that he knows things people don’t and that he is about to go on a scary path and once he starts there’s no turning back. I tried to tell him how come I couldn’t be a part of his life while his friends could (this was just me being emotional and trying to make it work). He just said he couldn’t do it because he needs to be alone. Point is I did end up leaving eventually even after he said he did love me and that I was the best thing that had happened to him. Basically he messaged me yesterday again if we could meet to talk. I thought he had realized he fucked up and that he loved me but when we meet he just kneels and told me that he wanted to ask for my forgiveness. He starts saying that he was just there to ask for my forgiveness because he’s trying to be good with everything in his life. Again, my hope was crushed. He said that he was so sorry he hurt me and that he didn’t expect me to forgive him but that he needed to ask for it so he could be at peace. I was pissed because I was honestly doing pretty good and now I feel like shit again. I asked him again why the sudden change. He started telling me that he was in a rabbit hole and that he needed to help everyone out of it. He said that he sees all the patterns of the world and knows how fucked everything is. He started saying that he is going to be a big dog with money and that on the way he might get offed because of everything he knows but that he’s okay with that because at least he’s living his truth. He was saying he’s scared but that this is what he needs to do. I know this is all so long lol I tried to make it as short as possible but there’s a lot of little things that are important.

Tonight, sister brought my niece to my mom’s to stay the night and she had obviously been drinking. Mom asked her several times if she had and, of course, she lied. When sister left, I mentioned something had to be done and this conversation ensued:

Mom: Sister sent a text and said it was her anti-anxiety medication. 

Me: No, I just saw her on Friday. She took it that day too and didn’t act like that. She acted like she acts when she’s been drinking. And decided it was a good idea to put her kid in the car. So she lied.

Because of the accident I am unable to swim which was my outlet for stress and other negative emotions. Anyway, I did everything I could for the team as a “team manager”- I handled fundraisers, uniforms, practice schedules, and sent reminders out to the team, as well as spent hours at the pool as an assistant coach. I told my coach from the beginning that i want to go to regionals as it’s a really fun trip and i had already paid to go before the season started-$175 out of my own pocket and earning minimum wage that’s a ton of money for me. Regionals is this weekend and i was just told today that “there’s not room for me in the van to go”. Unless i drove the 2.5 hours to the pool the meet is at myself-along with paying for the gas there and back, i’d be sad as the car ride up is always the best part of the trip and also go broke trying to afford this trip. I feel extremely unappreciated and my feelings are very hurt as i told my coach from the beginning that i wanted to go, paid for the trip myself, and that i’m unable to go due to circumstances out of my control. I guess what i’m trying to figure out is whether or not i’m over reacting or if i should or shouldn’t say something to the coach",05Nov2019,1
246,I seriously am so unbelievably embarrassed and I want to cry and die inside. I’m afraid to go outside because of what happened. So I got extremely drunk and went home with this guy that I actually really was into. Well I slept over as his place and the next day I woke up and the bed was wet? And I was like okay wtf did he spill water or something or like what happened? So I was really confused and just laying there. I ended up leaving pretty quick because I had to work and I didn’t say goodbye which is probably really bad :/ then I got home and went back to sleep and woke up and realized I might have peed his bed?! Holy crap. Honestly I don’t know if it was me or him because we were both super wasted and I don’t even remember falling asleep. I am so embarrassed and worried that he’s going to tell a bunch of people that it was me. I don’t know if I should text him and apologize or just leave it and not say anything. I know I’m going to see him around campus tomorrow and I’m so scared. He probably hates me. Ugh what do I do,05Nov2019,5
247,"I have a friend who I’ve only known for a relatively short time but we’re very close, let’s call him Jay. Jay is INCREDIBLY unreliable, to the point where he was an hour late for a movie we were seeing because he was with another friend and $30 worth of tickets went to waste. Once or twice I’ve had to ship something to his house instead of mine and without fail he just won’t go to get it, leaving it at the depot until the literal last minute instead of just setting an alarm so he doesn’t sleep through its delivery at two pm(!). Just recently I mailed a gift and when I asked if it had arrived or not, he said “idk” because he couldn’t be bothered to actually get up and check his mailbox. 

I do freelance art and Jay once mentioned to me that selling enamel pins and stickers would be a good investment. I agreed and brought up I could do everything short of actual distribution as I can’t mail to my current address for a bunch of reasons. I was stupid and mentioned him acting as an extra store runner and distributor and he grew excited and agreed. Then the aforementioned mailbox situation happened and I realized this wouldn’t be a good idea but I’m not sure how to mention it without hurting his feelings and losing a partner since I don’t really know anyone else willing to act as a distributor either.

251,"TL;DR at bottom


It's like every single person I know nowadays has depression, and uses it as an excuse for every little thing. I've had depression, I've gone through a plethora of struggles, but goddamn I was never so annoying or rude about it. Seriously, I'm so drained from everyone being a dick ""because I'm depressed"" that it's draining my capability to have sympathy for others. I absolutely don't feel sorry for anyone now when they say they're depressed, 10 million other people have told me the same thing and complained about the same things for years. 

I've met all the types, those who get angsty and rude when they're depressed, those who get quiet, those who start making jokes, and those who are a blend of all of the above. It's just getting to a point where I feel like everyone is using their depression to get away with complaining about every little thing. 

Like seriously, someone I know who is old enough to drive made an Instagram post complaining about ""getting attacked"" because they were trolled in a competitive online game. Jesus Christ, welcome to the internet. They literally called her a ""black fat dyke"", she's skinny, white, and bisexual. How the absolute fuck is that an attack on your character when it is so Comedically the polar opposite of you? Or the people who get super bitchy, short, and rude, because they have ""things going on in their life."" Everyone has shit going on in their life, you're not special. Depression is not an excuse to treat others like shit. 

TL;DR, After putting up with years of listening to others complain and blame it on mental illness, I feel completely and utterly incapable of having even the slightest sympathy for them.

255,"Hello my fellow reddit users, i'd like to share my story with you all in the hopes that maybe someone out there in the world going through what i'm experiencing will know that you're not alone. It gives me comfort in my own battle against my own inner demons to know that there's someone out there like me..

Found out a few months ago that i was adopted. Obviously somebody in the family spilled the beans thinking i already knew the truth. It was an ""in-family adoption."" Which in my case; my biological father is my adopted father's older brother. The man i always thought was my uncle is my biological father and my cousins are my actual siblings. I am the 3rd youngest out of 11 siblings. 6 girls, 5 boys. They all live on the east coast while i lived on the west coast (california) so we never got to really know each other. My uncle/father came to CA whenever there was a family event such as a funeral ect. so i only really got to know him the few times i saw him.

To learn about my true identity when i'm nearing my mid twenties has torn me down to my core. Everything i thought i knew about myself.. was a lie. My entire childhood, teenage and young adult life was me living a fake identity. All that time is something i can never get back. I just feel; lost, disconnected and so angry at everyone involved who lied to me and kept my stolen identity a secret. Like really? Not 1 person in my family thought i deserved to know the truth? Not my adopted parents, biological parents, biological siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandpas and grandmas? Even if they did think so, their actions spoke louder because no one told me anything.

What hurts me a lot was denying me the opportunity to know my siblings when I've always wanted siblings. And I just feel like it’s this decision that was made for me without my consent and now I am the one who has to live it and to just ""suck it up."" No, it's wrong and it's cruel. One of my real brothers died and so did my grandparents from my biological mother's side. Didn't even go to their funeral because i never knew and now I can never get closure. This is not loving and protecting an adopted child by hiding who they are. This is beyond that when you lie to them for decades. It's trauma and manipulation. By lying to an adopted person; you're controlling how they feel and telling them who they can and cant love, who they can or cant know. We adoptees have a right to know the truth. We are human beings, not a robot. Why make us a victim of your own selfishness or misguided beliefs?

Throughout my childhood and teenage years i've always wanted siblings. So i always hung out with my cousins. But i always felt like an outsider. Someone who never fit in and they even told me to stop coming over to their house. They were sick and tired of me just wanting to hangout with them. Whenever issues happened, i was always ganged up on. They did birthdays, celebrations, went out to eat and watch movies ect and never cared to include me. But i guess it's just not the same as having your own siblings. Even if i did go and bond with my siblings now in life; it's just not the same anymore. We're all adults now with our own lives.

If I look at my life altogether, things are good and positive. Compared to many others in life, of course i'm doing better than some others in life. There's always someone worse off than us. But that doesn't make our suffering any less valid. The anger and all the other emotions are just too much. I feel so angry because in the grand scheme of things it’s not a big deal like many others say, but yet.. it really is at the same time. This is a topic that is tossed around as a joke or never really talked about. Sometimes my cousins joke about adoption which triggers me or if i see or hear something related to adoption i just get angry and sad. It’s not a great feeling and i doubt many can imagine feeling this way unless they were in the same exact position. It's a toxic never ending cycle. I'm grieving over my loss of identity, loss of time, loss of bonding with my biological siblings, loss of trust and i don't think i will ever be able to get CLOSURE. My biological mother for whatever reason; doesn't want to tell me my story for like another 20 years which is ridiculous. I've yet to talk to my bio father if he's willing to tell me my story. My adopted parents told me their ""version"" of my story but it's not the whole truth and lots of pieces are missing. They won't show me my adoption records and even my local city court denied me access to my own file! Supposedly i was almost aborted; a couple days away from the procedure and was the unwanted child. But i dont know this for a fact.. yet.

You know what really gets me? Is that everyone in my immediate family tells me im not allowed to be angry or sad because it's like i'm throwing the efforts of my adoptive parents and everyone else in the trash. It makes me feel so TRAPPED. It's such an outrageous backward logic. Everyone expects me to just see how ""privileged"" i am even though i never asked for any of this (and in turn imply that i'm ungrateful if i express differently.) You know what my adopted parents tell me? ""You don't need to know your siblings or your grandparents that died."" ""You wouldn't have been able to love them anyways."" ""Knowing them will mess up your life."" ""If you go visit them, don't come back."" "" I am the one who fed you and raised you so you have no right to say anything to me."" "" If you're so mad, go be with them for a couple years and see if that makes a difference.""

When you ignore someone's story, you ignore the person. My beginning and my truth will set me free and fill the void i have in my soul. I'm on a self discovery and self healing journey.

I am set to graduate in December and this was meant to be an easier, filler course. I have so far submitted all of the assignments on time, expect for one. We have a 375 point presentation due at the end of the semester that is essentially worth our entire grade. This past weekend we were supposed to submit our choice of music artist to research for this assignment. The assignment page itself only included a list of artists to choose from. It included no details regarding the assignment and no type of submission box or instructions in regards to how to make your submission. I assumed that this meant it was more a tentative “have your artist you’d like to research in mind by this date” rather than a hard deadline..

This morning I woke up with an email from the professor of the course telling me that he had not received an email submission of the artist I planned on researching, and that I was going to be automatically failed for the assignment. I am a busy full-time student with two full-time jobs and don’t regularly check my college email. My emails are oftentimes blanket announcements from professors in regards to what’s happening this week or emails from other students that don’t pertain to me. Apparently he has sent emails regarding this submission process, (i.e. submit your choice or get a zero for the assignment). These messages were always at the end of the emails and I subsequently missed them. I am owning up to the fact that I messed up here. I am just wondering if anyone has any idea what I might be able to do to convince my professor to give me a second chance and let me complete this assignment for credit?

264,"Throwaway because people I know, know my main reddit account

So I am a high school sophmore with ADHD and pretty bad time management skills and I have never really had much desire to work during my high school years. I would rather dedicate this time to playing competitive sports, making memories with friends, getting good grades, etc. However, a family member has recently opened up a new fast food restuarant in my community and my family is making me work there. The restuarant was supposed to open 4 months from now.

This makes me extremely unhappy, even if I will only be working 2 6 hour shifts a week because I will have 0 free time due to 2 sports practices a week, weekends for travel games, + a manditory ""fam day"" once a week which I am not allowed to go out and stay home with my family only. On top of this, I have a best friend (we have also been dating for almost a year but he is my best friend too, we have been best friends for a long time) I am extremely close to that I love spending time with. Every time I have to decline hanging out I feel like a terrible person because I'm letting us both down, because I really want to hangout but my family makes me say no. When I'm really busy sometimes NOWADAYS we only get 2 days a week together, on the slow weeks sometimes we can hang out like 3-4. If I get the new job we will be able to hang out maybe like twice every two weeks.

I tried to talk to my family a couple times about how I don't want to work but they assumed I meant I was nervous about my coworkers and I couldn't get the nerve to correct them. Tonight I was really upset because the opening of the restuarant has been moved two months earlier (now within 2 months from now) and I broke down crying to my parents saying I didn't want to work because I want time for sports, school, and also my boyfriend. My parents yelled at me and called me ungrateful because any kid would be happy to have this opportunity to work and I'm being selfish and now my family member opening the diner will be extremely disappointed and upset with me.

So, I'm just wondering what I should do. I don't think I'm in a mature enough place emotionally or mentally to take on the responsibility of a job + grades + boyfriend + sports. I want to focus on everything that's important to me now instead of a minimum wage job making 60$ a week that I am unenthusiastic and extremely anxious about.

throughout the month, i would describe myself as generally anxious but nothing too unmanageable. i have an amazing relationship with my SO and we are pretty much always having fun, making each other smile, just generally having a good time. 

but the few days before my period are unbearable. even though i know exactly when it will happen, i am never prepared. i completely lose control over my emotions, so much so that it physically hurts. it goes from paranoia to blinding rage to suicidal ideations to crippling depression and hopelessness in any order, any span of time. i don’t know what to do. i’ve had this issue for years and nothing has worked—antipsychotics, antidepressants, antianxieties, a number of therapists. my wallet has run dry trying to fix this and i can’t afford to take any more medical steps but i definitely can’t afford to be hospitalized again. the only thing i have is a brand of birth control which takes the edge off. 

i am not asking for medical advice here, i’m just giving background first. but if there is anyone who has this issue, or any input, i need help. i know exactly when i will have a breakdown and it never gets any easier and if i am left alone i self-mutilate before i realize i am doing it, but my SO has his own life. i hate that i go on a self-destructive rampage and don’t know how to stop it even when i know it’s coming.

and please. do NOT tell me to go to ER. i have done that so many times, it is worthless and i can’t afford to lose $3k to be told i’m crazy, or $20k to be hospitalized.",05Nov2019,3
273,"I just got off the phone with my sister. I'm stunned, even though I endured mental abuse from him for years.

For a little background: Growing up was really difficult for me because my dad would belittle me all the time. He would chalk it up to being ""just a joke"" but I would frequently cry and self-harmed because of it. We always butted heads politically, and would frequently get into heated debates. It really messed with my self-confidence growing up, but as soon as I went off to college, my confidence shot up and I really grew into myself. 

My parents separated in September last year (2018). It was a really trying time for our family, as my dad had been unemployed for two years and we were drowning in hospital bills from my mother's cancer treatment. She had recently gone into remission, and everything fell apart. My dad woke up and decided he no longer wanted to be with her. I was temporarily living at home, and I can remember the day he said good-bye and left for Arizona because his parents had found him a job down there.

Before he left, I vividly remember him getting upset with me (because I called him out for defending Brett Kavanaugh or something along those lines) and screaming in my face that I was ""not as smart as I thought I was"" and ""just a silly 22 year old girl."" Not the worst thing he's ever said to me, but it was the first time he had ever gotten in my face like that. All because I tricked him into contradicting himself. He's never apologized for it.

Fast-forward, my parents get divorced and my dad screws my mom over during the proceedings, leaving her with very little alimony. I was there for my mom, of course, but at this point I was living in a different state. She made her way to the other side, and got a job that she loves. 

Slowly, my dad and I managed to mend our relationship. During our conversations, I caught on to some red flags, and warned him that if he didn't start focusing, he was going to lose his job. He would always talk about how he was so much smarter than his boss (a trend over the years) and was doing an amazing job bringing in clients, yet somehow his boss hated him (another trend). Sure enough, he lost his job again (only to find a new one immediately, yay). 

And then, a week later, he was diagnosed with cancer. This would be the second time he's been diagnosed, the first being when I was about nine or ten. He starts chemo tomorrow.

I got a call from my sister today, and we were commiserating about it, when she asked me if he ever did anything to me. I mentioned the verbal abuse, which she had frequently been witness to, but then she asked again in a more leading tone. I asked her what she meant, and she told me that he had hit her a few times in middle and high school. She also said that she always feels really uncomfortable around him because she feels like he's checking her out and sometimes he'll make weird comments about her body. I tried to press for more information, but she shut down and said she had to go.

I have no idea what to do. We also think my dad is lying about his new job (he asks my sister for money a lot). It's so fucked and so strange that things had turned out this way. My sister thinks he's bipolar, which makes sense (he often goes through periods where he thinks he's king of the world, and then the next week he's a fucking mess). We're supposed to spend Thanksgiving with him, but I want to punch him in the fucking face.

Please help me on where I should go from here. I don't want to turn him in (we're all out of the house now and he lives in across the country), and I have no way to evaluate my sister's statements. I believe her, and I trust her, but I feel so lost.",05Nov2019,2

I receive a stipend of a approximately $900 a month, without any benefits, for working approximately 25 hours a week.

I'll start with this. She has been my best friend of 9ish years. We met in highschool. She pulled me out of a dark place. She was always there for me. And I for her. (k) 26 was my ride or die. She was with me through 3 horrible relationships susiside thoughts horrible depression. 
(b) 26is my guy best friend I met him 8 years ago. (x)26 is his best friend and my ex
He will come in, in a min
I'm 24

So it all started about 6 months ago when (b) (k) and I went on a trip. (b) and I were seeing a consert, (k) came along to see a guy in that town and had to take care of something legal wise. The short version is she didn't want to do anything with us didn't go to dinner with us just slept. Didn't want to go along with our schedule and told me I was making the trip not fun. 

I'm just saying the biggest things there have been little things she has done. 

(b) and I started dating after a long time of should we and people telling us we should and being like you 2 are perfect for eatch other. Our relationship is healthy (a thrpist has said so) 
He treats me like a queen we never fight. 
This is important 

Next that Hapend, my dog died. I called her that night she came over for 20mins and ""talked"" mostly all about her dead pets. OK I'm cool. 
She said to come over the next day to watch my fav movies. I get there and (k) is in the shower, no big. I eat my lunch and wait. She comes downstairs in a swimsuit and tells me she she is going to go tanning at the pool. But she will leave the TV on for me. I'm a little hurt and pissed. Got her to stay to watch a movie. 

Next 
I called her one night, I hadn't been able to sleep for weeks. Trying so meny difrent meds. Was so tired I started hulsinating at one point. I called her and was talking and I was like ""I just want to take sevral sleep pills so I can just sleep"" all I wanted was to sleep. Not to die just sleep well (k) said something along the lines ""if u do that I'll bring u back and nag you"" then 2 mins latter (k) said ""well I gota go my screen is a little cracked and it hurts my ear"" 

Next very recent
I was talking with her about how she was sick and something health related. Well I said something and she was mostly like that's wrong and I would know I have nurses in my family and you were home schooled..... (7th grad and up thank you) I about lost my shit on her. Called my bf and vented. Aprently that pissed him off. 

So I will call her and vent about how oh he hasn't texted me today or oh he put off playing videogames with me till another day. Little stuff. Stuff that I talk to him about once and it's done with we move on. We'll (x) made a comment while I was on the phone with (b). It was on the lines of hang up so we can play video games. That pissed me off. So I called (k) and told her about it. 
Her advice was for me to brake up with (b) and for (b) to date someone els so (x) can treat her the way (x) treats me and he can see how horrible (x) is. I told her no and why would I want to brake up with the love of my life someone who treats me like a queen. I havnt talked to her since. And it keeps bothering me. Part of me wonders if she is jealous cause she hasn't had a bf since highschool but i don't know. 

What honestly should I do about this. Iv asked her multiple times if anything is going on or is she OK she won't answer me about it. She says she's fine. 
 For got to say she threated to text (x) and bitch at him. 
She thinks he is scared of her. He is like 260 /5'11 
She is 115/ 5'2

284,"I take everything literal. I think because of that and being autistic, I live a more lonely and confusing life because of the small things I don’t get when it comes to human communication,social norms, and simple concepts. 

Overall I fear there are many “right in front of me” concepts I don’t get, but today will focus on one Ive been questioning.-Sex while on alcohol

The internet on social media seems to not like people who sleep with people while under the influence of alcohol (depending on the situation).  For this situation, we are in bars and at an american college.

Im a deeply sexual person. Like sex every day in a relationship if possible kind of person. Ive had it in several relationships, but since I haven’t had much luck meeting people in college, I don’t go out much and meet new people, and my major is relatively small.

Tinder has failed me in finding sex, like i just found out that “netflix and chill” means sex when at this point of desperation I was just hoping someone would come watch TV and be my friend. 

So when it comes to bars and parties in college, a lot of people like to hook up. But this is usually on some amount of alcohol or drugs. Though our society still hooks up while tipsy, drunk, blacked out, and then wake up after having sex with a stranger and don’t care. So is it ok to hook up with people who are drunk, and if you yourself hook up with someone who is as drunk as you, is it ok? If so then why is there a negative stigma around hooking up while drunk?",05Nov2019,2

I have just made this account to take a sort of survey for an idea I'd like to bring to life. I am hoping to create and publish a daily planner (I am obsessed with planners and figure - why not?) and I'd love to hear what people want and would find useful in a daily planner. 

Many people have created amazing planners with unique features such as motivational quotes for every month, stickers to customize your weekly plans, built-in folders, and more. 

I am aiming to create a minimalistic design, while also incorporating unique features that people would find useful. 

Some examples of the usual features include:

* A page in the front dedicated to general notes
* A phone number/email log (contacts page)
* Weekly goals, monthly goals, etc. 

I'd greatly appreciate any feedback! Even if it's to emphasize how much you appreciate a common feature in planners, I'd love to hear anything really.

287,"Before I say the response my mom knew I liked this girl. They saw me talking to her at school.

So after the movies I texted her “Hey I had a fun time today, we should do that again sometime” she replied by saying “I had a fun time too, maybe we could get a group of people to come along.” She also said “ sorry I was studying for Spanish” she said that because it took a little while for her to reply. I said “yeah it’s fine, who would we all invite?” She replied by saying “idk, some of the band kids.” I said “hey I gotta question” she said “what is it?” I said “I’m sorry if this is a weird question but I need clarification, was that a date or did we go as friends? “ she said “ friends, I’m sorry if you thought otherwise” I said “ Ok that’s what I thought too, I’m just really confused.” After a little while I said “ I’m sorry, did I make it weird I just didn’t know. “ she said “No you didn’t” I said “ok good, when do you wanna make the group” she said “idk yet” I said “ok” I have no idea what this means.

290,"I'm 22. In August I moved to a new state for grad school. It was all new and exciting then, but now I've settled into a routine and I don't like it. All I do is go to school, work, run errands, or sit in my room.

I've been using okcupid and bumble to try and meet people, and I've met up with one person to hang out twice now. Talking to them has been great, but lately they've seemed distant/uninterested when we text, so that may fall apart. I talk to classmates and I've gone to a small party with some and am hanging out with a friend this week. These things are fun, but I'm still not really close with these friends, and it hits me when I go back home and I end up feeling sad and lonely.

I keep comparing these new friendships with my friends from undergrad, who I lived with and saw all the time. We were super close, we would always spend hours together after class watching tv and just hanging out, would run errands together, do things on the weekends together. I miss having friends like that. I still talk to them, but one friend is living abroad so the time difference is hard, one I feel like I annoy if I text them too often, and the others I hardly text directly, but we all regularly talk in the group snapchat and groupme. 

I can hardly even find the motivation to do anything fun by myself. I have a hard time watching tv shows or movies because nothing holds my attention. Same with reading and playing video games. Most of my craft hobbies feel like chores if I try to do them. The only hobbies I have the motivation for are listening to audiobooks (while I'm at work), sometimes making a perler bead craft before I go to bed (one of few crafts I enjoy and find rewarding that is quick and easy), and watching YouTube videos. I also like shopping, but it also stresses me out because I spend too much money, even if I usually do limit myself to buying things I do need, like clothes. 

Everything feels dull, and I don't see an ""end"" to it, so it feels pointless too. I feel like the rest of my life is going to be a cycle of working, trying to fit in time to do social stuff and being unsatisfied with grabbing coffee or whatever once a week, and not having the energy to do anything fun. How can I get past this and actually enjoy life? I just feel stuck and I don't know how to make anything better.

291,"So just tonight (11/04-5/2019) I found out that while at a Halloween party that my friend was raped. I never thought that I would have this kind of thing come up in my life, especially not to a male friend of mine.

He was blackout drunk at a party and a woman at some point between 3 AM and 6:30 AM got him to get into his car and they had sex. My friend doesn't remember past 3 AM or how he got home that night, so never thought anything of it until he was told something could've happened. 

He is currently in a relationship and doesn't know what to say to her, and while on a phone call with the woman whom he had sex with almost sounded like bragging (I didn't hear all of it, but some of it sounded braggy) or at least somewhat narcissistic. I don't know all the details about how consent can go, but I'm pretty sure someone that doesn't remember the night can't consciously consent to sex.

I have no idea how to help him out with this, I don't know the law too well, and the fact that he is a bigger (muscular) guy, people might think that it couldn't have actually happened to him, on top of the fact that he has repeatedly stated his dislike of this woman.

I am very lost and really have no idea how to support him, I've never had something like this happen before and I can tell he is crushed and scared of what happened and I really want to support him but I don't know how I can other than with words and making sure he's alright. I also feel personally responsible because had I not left the party earlier, I could've potentially prevented this from happening.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated

I went to this hospital recently and they wanted to do some blood work when I was there. I think a few hours after the blood work I noticed little numbness around my penis and later that night at home I noticed my left foot slowly go down. I’m pretty sure they gave me nerve damage on purpose because of they want me to solve the “Simulation Theory”. It sounds crazy but this is really the truth. I’m an autistic genius, and I heard something like that it takes 2 years for an autistic genius to solve the simulation theory. I don’t know if I heard this accurately, but that’s all I was able to remember from when I first heard it. I had a bully who would hit me on my left chest for some time, I don’t know how long but I just realized that he was forcing me to use my left arm and copy him. 2 years ago before this started I used to have interest in music and other arts. Now I think about philosophy and solving the simulation theory. I didn’t know what the bully was doing until it was too late. I’m just trying to see if this can be fixed because I can’t walk straight anymore and I’m kinda losing my balance, and my voice too. It’s kinda raspy and having trouble speaking and it’s making it really hard for me when I’m at work. I didn’t have this problem in the past. My facial features are also changing and I’m losing hair from the top but not from the sides or around the head I think.


Edit: before I got the blood work at the hospital, I went to my primary doctor few days before and they said I had a pinched nerve and gave me these stretches and they were helping. I would feel something at my fingertips when I do them. It doesn’t seem like I feel anything when I stretch with the arm they drew the blood from. They took the blood from right arm and the left foot went down.


Edit 2: I’ve been taken to a second hospital against my will by parents and they tried to cover up what happened. My left foot is not down anymore, my hands look a limp when rested, the muscles on the forearm look uneven from the hand, it wasn’t like that before. I don’t know what they’re called but if you make a fist you’ll see them. The doctors in the second hospital put me on medication too and they were calling me crazy and my family believed them. My family has been acting weird too. This is  the truth, please believe what I’m saying if I can prove this I will. Can I fix this and go back to being “normal” or is it too late. I can’t work like this it makes it really hard to get anything done at work because I work with customers and I’m always walking and talking to them and it looks rude. Please help!",05Nov2019,3
294,"Hello all. This is very long but PLEASE PLEASE hear me out. I need some help on something that will not let me sleep and has ever since fucked with my head and my day to day life. It sounds extreme... I know, but hear me out. I have little siblings as well and I could never ever ever let them be in the situation my best friends little sister is in.

On Thursday (Halloween) I was driving to work with my friend. On some ocasiones she comes with me to work and stays in the car while I get off since I only work 4 hours anyway. It sounds stupid... I know, but that’s besides the point. We brought up the subject about our little siblings and our dads. Out of the blue she says “my stepdad HATES my little sister”. I looked at her so confused and asked her why. I kind of regret asking her this because the response was horrifying.

She explained that ever since her little sister was an infant, her (my friend) stepfather would lock himself in her sister’s room and she would hear some desperate cries from her sister. She even went on to imitate her cries. I felt so shocked and just... sad. She continued to explain that she would record videos to show her mom so her mom could believe her, but according to my friend she never did believe her. She then told me that she would find bruises all over her body and my friend even started laughing when she said that. I instantly felt so sick to my stomach. I mean... how could you laugh about that? It’s disgusting.

She told me that her stepdad would buy her other little sister (2nd youngest) toys all the time and that her little sister wouldn’t get anything. Every single day her sister goes to school she has bruises on her body and it’s getting to the point where her mother tried to hide her bruises so she can prevent CPS from coming to her house. I only know this because my friend mentioned something about her mom having a meeting with CPS to discuss her daughters bruises.

If the physical abuse isn’t enough to explain this messed up situation, her little sister has some SERIOUS behavioral issues. She constantly acts out in school, talks back to teachers, gets very violent, and she repeats the verbal abuse she gets to herself. Like she will literally whisper “You’re so stupid, (her name)” over and over again. I was just on the phone with my friend and she told me that her little sister is “hiding” in her room and whispers to herself. What really pissed me off is that my friend said “ Haha I don’t know what’s wrong with her. She’s hiding and saying things to herself. I locked my door because she’s so creepy, she has such a dark vibe. Maybe she’s playing hide and seek haha”. How fucking stupid and naive do you have to be to say that? I explained to her that it’s not funny and she’s really messed up in the head and she quickly changed the conversation. I felt disgusted and hung up on her. 

How can I help? I want to help this little girl so much because I can imagine it being my little sister 😔 it tears me limb to limb to hear these things. I don’t know her mother’s name or where she lives. I see her mother on some occasions like my friends birthday parties which is coming REALLY soon in December. This won’t let me be at peace with my mind and I feel like I’m letting a child down. What if it’s too late one day and I will feel guilty for the rest of my life? It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to be friends with my “best friend” this whole situation is messed up. What would you do if you were in my shoes? 

TL;DR: My friends little sister (5) is being emotionally, mentally, and physically abused. What can I do to help?",05Nov2019,2

So, my problem is that I can't stay asleep. Every day I seem to wake up at ~4am, and I can't get back to sleep. I have no idea why I started waking up this early, as I've never needed to, it just randomly started last week. I really just want to get more sleep. 

I've looked online and all of the advice seems to assume you can stay asleep, and you ought to gradually adjust your sleep cycle.

What complicates matters further is, as soon as I wake up, I'm wide awake. I've never been able to doze, sleep in, or anything really. Imediently after waking up, I'm good to go.

As for my ""bed time ritual, ""  I reliably go to bed at 11pm, no caffeine within 4 hours of bed, no bright lights or noises in my room, I only sleep in my bed, so no association issues. And as for falling asleep at night, I can usually fall asleep within a few minutes of laying down. So I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong. 


As for things I've tried: ambient sounds (ie rain, streams, static), reading a book, staring at my ceiling, warm milk",05Nov2019,1

Before I start, I know as you're reading you may feel like your brain is melting out of your ear, and I'm kind of ashamed I thought this way for so long.

Background:
My relationship was mainly long distance, we lasted for about 9 months, and we've only had about one month of total visiting time. Despite all that, we were both emotionally dependent on each other a little bit. 

We both have social media accounts and our followers have a lot of overlap. 

I broke up with her over a month ago and the last time I spoke to her I told her I really needed my space. On social media I said I had a break up but wouldn't go into detail because I didn't want to trash her or be that ex, but today I saw a new video on her account shitting on me a little bit. 

While we were together, my ex and I kind of believe(d) we have DID or disassociate identity disorder (multiple personality disorder). I've come to the conclusion that I don't,  and even if I do I'd rather have a licensed professional tell me; not my best friend who minors in psych. 

That being said, for the sake of simplicity, I will still refer to the characters I've made up as fake alters as my alters during this post.

We would stay up until well past midnight talking about what our alters were doing, or having them swap out. Sometimes there was some drama between the alter egos which did lead to arguments. We would be on skype for literally days on end (fell asleep on call because I sometimes had to wake her up from night terrors or nightmares in the early months), and from 10 pm-3 am (worked part time during most of the relationship) we'd let our alters interact over call. 

Main story:
As I said, I came across a video referencing me, but one of her alters was the one who posted it.

I'm not a doctor, and I can't diagnose her with or without it, but I can say that there's some really odd and suspicious things about these ""alters"" of hers. Her alters would ""visit"" mine inside my mind to be with. Mine would ""visit"" her headspace as well. 

Once again, I'm pretty certain I don't have DID, and even if I do, I don't think alter egos can visit other people's minds. Regardless, during this time her alters would recount stories they've had with mine, and mine would tell stories that hers wouldn't deny. 

Perhaps her alters are real, but that would make them liars.

Another suspicious thing that happened that I can remember is once while one of her alters were swapped out and having sex and he called his own name while being pleasured.

Conclusion:
With all that being said, I don't know if I should tell her the truth about the fact my alters aren't real and the stories they made up weren't either. I kind of feel like I owe it to her to tell her the truth, and plus I would like to know her response to the horrible things her ""alters"" did to me while we were together.",05Nov2019,1

He takes my money, my headphones, my clothes (even though I’m a girl), my pens, my art supplies, my school stuff, my books, everything. The worst part is that he is obviously the favourite sibling (my parents are kinda sexist and treat him like royalty), so I can’t tell my parents, they won’t do anything. I rarely get art supplies and pens and stuff because when I do my dad complains about how I’m spending all his money (I don’t, I buy the cheapest things I can find) and how I’m being “girly and bratty”, which I’m not either because I’m rarely allowed to buy things.

He wasnt happy. Told me I was crossing boundaries.... 

I left and cried all the way home. I felt like a creepy stalker. I felt horrible about crossing boundaries. Felt like scum... it really wasnt my intention.

It's happened to a few friends and an old gf and I really dont know how to make it stop, just cutting ties that never needed to be cut.

302,"Context: My ex and I are both girls. And the person I am currently ‘getting to know’ now is also a girl. 
 
I’ve been on no contact with an ex for a few weeks. She technically dumped me, but she kept reaching out from time to time during my NC with her, saying she misses me. I ignored most of it as I was trying to move past her. I deleted her contacts, removed her on socials, and erased our photos together. I sort of just vanished in her life. 

I was doing well already, or so I thought. I started seeing new people from dating apps and I realized that other people could treat me so much better. I am currently consistently talking to a girl, and we’re getting along really well. We’re both testing the waters still—getting to know each other.

However, just a few days ago, as I was casually swiping on tinder, I saw my ex. Out of sheer curiosity, I swiped right and instantly matched with her. Since then, we’ve been talking from time to time, but only on the app itself and neither of us is talking about the breakup.

The thing is, I thought I’ve moved on, but I honestly don’t know what I want out of our conversation. A friendship? Or perhaps, for us to give it a second try? I’m really torn what to do.  I guess I sort of feel this way because our breakup was a in-the-heat-of-the-moment kind of thing, thus making me feel like we have unfinished business that could be easily resolved by communicating properly, but we’ve always had issues with communication.

That said, the girl I am currently seeing is super nice and I enjoy her company. She makes me feel warm, and I feel that I could be serious with her, but my  ‘lingering’ what if I stayed, what if we did things differently with my ex, is hindering me from truly moving forward. How should I handle these feelings? 

What should I do? Can anyone give a sound advice? I would very much appreciate it. I’m so torn between moving past it and letting go, or maybe we could try again, and see where it goes, but by doing so, I will end up ruining what I have with the current girl I am seeing now. Would it be better to unmatch my ex on the app, and cut all contact with her again? 

Other factors why I find it hard to just move past it:
- Previous relationship with the 'ex' had issues, as all relationships, and as someone who is a fixer and a bit of perfectionist, it's hard for me to leave things or issues as it is. My need to fix things is off the roof. 
- She is the first girl I've been with and have been intimate with. In a way, I got attached. Not only that, but I genuinely wanted things to work between the two of us.",05Nov2019,1
303,"I have a friend who suffers from very terrible anxiety. They are getting help, but sometimes their anxiety gets the best of them. I understand that and I do my best to empathize, but sometimes it's really hard when they lash out at me or at our mutual friends. They've said pretty horrible things to me and our friends to our faces and behind our backs. I've been unable to really set boundaries in my life to protect my energy because when I've had they would lash out and tell me how I don't understand them or care about them and that I should be more sympathetic. These are for things like how I can't be on call for them all the time because I'm at work or I can't be at certain events because I needed to sleep. I've always tried to compromise and make time for them. They would also say things like how their friends don't do enough for them and when I try to defend our friends they would be very dismissive.

It makes me feel guilty and terrible when I feel like they are acting incredibly entitled or when I feel like I can finally breathe a bit when they are not talking to me, because it makes me think ""wow am I a horrible friend for not being more forgiving?"" I've tried to talk to my friend about this and I only ever get them telling me that I don't understand them. 

I've been friends with this person for so long, so I've been trying my best to handle this for the past few years.

313,"Hi Reddit,

I’m not sure if I’m in the right place but I was wanting some advice on a matter.

Long story short from what I can gather through tersimonals and articles my mother may be considered a “toxic” parent. I am a 20M going to school, my parents have agreed to pay for half of my schooling as long as I do well.

It’s many small things, they don’t hit me anymore for things. They used to for not eating my lunch or going out with friends or not finishing my dinner. But they realize I’m too old to hit. Recently I realize that any situion that goes on, my mother seems to play the victim card. She brings something up, I correct her, she say “oh I guess I’ll never bring anything up like that every again” very passive aggressively

She gets my blood boiling when she does this. She talks to me about my fathers flaws and really aggressively tells him to correct his flaws. I find that she has never apologized for anything in my life, she is filled with this sense of entitlement in private and in public. She always creates a scene in public and doesn’t care what people think, even though I may be with my friends or strangers. 

She only makes it seems like she cares when we go out for dinner with her friend and she brags about me. She doesn’t allow any of my friends to come over, sometime we want to have a couple drinks and she says that they need to get out if they are drinking, right in front of them. Understandable, you don’t want people drinking. Cool I get it. 

They ask about my friends and I tell them we usually go out for drinks or go to another persons house since we’re all busy, but my mom thinks I’m still a child.

She asks that I’m still a young kid and she’s the parent who has control over everything in my life.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t move out due to school. 

Any advice is valued GREATLY

314,"I’m sorry about the length, it’s just a really long story. I might also have mistyped stuff, I’m writing this on my phone.

This all started on my first day of school in a different state. I made friends with someone, let’s call him John. John lived with his mom and grandparents. He told me that his mom didn’t have any money, as she was crippled and couldn’t work, so they moved in with his grandparents. I also found out that he lived maybe 3 or 4 doors down and we started walking to school together. I was really happy to be making friends, so I didn’t really notice some red flags. As I got to know John better over a few weeks, I noticed that he was extremely negative and his negativity radiated around him. He would always put himself down, and point out the bad things in everything. I don’t have much of a problem with people who are negative, as the world isn’t perfect, but I ended up feeling unhappy and really bummed out whenever I hung out with him. Also, he seemed to be obsessed with me. He would always say things like, “I love school because I get to hang out with you.” At first I just thought he was happy to be making friends, as I was too. The more he said things like this the stranger it felt.

I decided that it would be best to distance myself from him, so I stared hanging out more with other friends and started walking alone. When I invited my friend Matt (not his real name) to sit with us, John was incredibly cold to him and would spew insults at him all the time. He would also tell me he didn’t like him, and he would say he wanted me to be his only friend and he wanted to be my only friend as well. I told him that I wanted to meet more friends and hang out with more people and Matt and I moved to a different table at lunch. He really didn’t take this well, but I was also bothered. He really creeped me out, and I thought he might have some sort of mental illness. Then one night he called me, and said his mom couldn’t move her legs, and they called an ambulance.

I continue feel horrible about this, but I don’t think he was being truthful. We live maybe 3 or 4 houses down from each other, and I did not hear any sirens. I didn’t hear any commotion over the phone, or even anyone talking. He said that there was an ambulance outside of his house, and that they were carrying his mom outside the front door on a stretcher. He was sitting maybe 10 feet from the door, and I couldn’t hear anything. He asked to play video games, and although I was doubtful of what he was saying, I did what any good friend what do and played with him. The next day, he told me that he felt “weird” after his mom left and he said that he started watching hentai. I told him that it bothered me when he said that, and asked him to not say stuff like that in the future. He then proceeded to threaten me, and say that if I told someone what he said he would leave the school and it would all be because of me. I didn’t really take what he said seriously, but I get very defensive when people threaten me. I was livid with him. Yes, I know I was overreacting.

After school that day, he followed me home. He called me as we were walking, and said to look back. He tried to play it off as a joke, but it made me feel uncomfortable. The next day I told him that he had upset me and made me feel uncomfortable, and that he was hard to be around because of his constant negativity. I suggested that we stay away from each other for a while, as we didn’t seem to be getting along. The next morning, he followed me to school. He waited outside my house for me to walk outside, and he followed me as soon as I left for school. I walked up to him, and asked him about it. As soon as I said it, he immediately got very upset and started screaming at me. He said that he didn’t follow me, and never would. I had an insanely strong feeling he was lying, as he had no reason to be upset. He could have just said he wasn’t following me and I wouldn’t have given it a second thought.  It creeped me out, so I talked to one of my teachers and she notified the school counselor. 

The counselor basically told me she couldn’t do anything without mentioning my name to John, and she sent me back to class. I have gotten no response from her. Not very long after that, I saw John with his mom at conferences and his mom was walking just fine. He also said she was in the hospital and that his grandparents wouldn’t let him visit her. I’ve tried just to ignore this issue, but I don’t even feel safe walking to school anymore. I genuinely feel that he will try to hurt me. This isn’t an irrational fear, it is something that he has a high enough chance of doing where I feel it is probable, and has a good chance of happening. Every day after that, John has followed me to school. It has been about 1 month now. I addressed it with him one more time, but he got very angry again, and denied it. I am positive that he is following me. I have asked for advice from my parents, and some friends and they told me to basically acknowledge him and give him attention. If I do that, then he will walk with me. I don’t want this, as I feel unsafe around him, and would feel even more unsafe if he was in an arms reach of me, as he would easily be able to hit me.  This issue has really been bothering me, and I would love to have even some sense of closure.",05Nov2019,1
315,"There's a good chance he's reading this and that's fine.  


So, to make a 7 year long story short, I met a guy on the internet and I liked him immediately. Sadly, I couldn't express those feelings because I was already in a real life relationship. I buried those feelings since he lived in Europe and I live in the United States. I even stopped contact with him when my boyfriend didn't like that we were chatting a bit too often. He and I were part of a online-based music project. He considers me a co-founder of the band and ""the closest member.""   


As I fell out of love with my boyfriend who I had been with for about 10 years at the time, I felt closer to my internet friend. It really could have been anyone, not just my internet friend. My real life relationship was failing regardless of who was in my crosshairs at the time. So, I tried to do the right thing. I acknowledged this feeling and broke up with my long term boyfriend.   


I had decided I should meet my internet friend so I did. I just spent two weeks and $2700 (also 2 weeks of unpaid leave from my job and $0 earned during my stay in Europe) to find out he's not that into me. Sure, that's a risk I took. However, I'm concerned that I've been exploited.  


He chatted with me every single day since April of 2018 until today, give or take maybe a handful of days. That's kind of a big grievance for me because I don't talk to anyone every single day. Since I had feelings for him I didn't mind him being so eager to have my attention. That lead me to suspect that he might have had feelings for me as well.  


Many other things lead me to suspect he felt something for me. We had the same goals in life. We both believed in the music we created together. Neither of us want children. Same religious beliefs. Same everything, almost.   


But then I met him. I have never found him to be exactly my type physically but his appearance grew on me. I felt that taking a risk like I did would have a good chance of panning out into a relationship but it didn't. When I got home to the United States I told him that I felt like I left my heart with him when I left. He said he didn't feel the same and just wants to be friends.   


I don't understand why it didn't work out but it just didn't. Despite him parading my image around the internet saying ""look at my band and look at this girl and listen to her beautiful voice"" and despite his flirting and despite his admitted deep caring for me, he's just not into me. I'm left shocked and confused. I can't really believe he never felt anything for me. I suppose that when we met, the chemistry just wasn't right for him for whatever reason. I know I'm not the most attractive person on earth but it was just the way he put me up on a pedestal that got me fooled.   


Now I just feel stupid and ashamed for even thinking he wanted me. I guess all his incessant posting of my photos on social media and making a huge deal out of my visit to see him was just for the band. That's complicated because I wrote music with him out of love that I thought was being reciprocated and now it all just hurts to think about. Each song we crafted together felt like a little child being born in some small way. He still wants the band to thrive but now I can't even look at his photo without feeling betrayed. Have I been exploited? No one can answer that for certain but him, but maybe your opinion might help me make sense out of all of this.",05Nov2019,1

320,"First, sorry if this is the wrong place to post, if so please let me know, also I am on mobile. Also I apologize for the length of this, I tried to shorten in but I'm bad at excluding non important details. But I tried to this time. 
 So i understand at first this might seem like a weird conclusion to have come to, but when I break everything down it's honestly the most logical explanation. 
 Today after work, my bf (kyle) and I wanted to stop and get some soup, come to my house and eat and then run to the store for some theraflu before he went home, he lives about 40mins from me and since it was already getting dark and was about 6, he was wanting to get home at the latest around 8. So we were somewhat rushing. So we stop at the restaurant (I'm not sure if saying the name is alright, so I'll hold off on that for the time being.) He orders our food to go, while I run to the bathroom. When i come out, hes still waiting and we stand right in front of where the food would be handed to us, but because there was a higher counter we couldnt actually see them making my food, which was broccoli and cheddar soup, in a bread bowl which came separate when you get it to go. We wait for about 5 more minutes, and then get our food and go to my house. 
 This entire time I felt normal, other than feeling a bit sick and unwell like I had been feeling all day, but that I believe is just the beginning of catching a cold/strep throat. It's nothing I couldn't work all day through, and this is why we were going to get medicine after we ate. It's pretty important to make it super clear that neither him or myself had done any drugs or taken any ,medication before this all happened, that's why I came to the conclusion that the soup had to have had something in it. 
 We get to my house, go to my room and start to eat, when I start to feel very weird and the feeling was pretty recognizable almost instantly, it felt like I had either just smoked some marijuana or someone around me did, I felt high. A little bit (more) background is that in my early teenage years, I was able to smoke just fine without any troubles, that was before the synthetic stuff came out, and after smoking (much more than is intended, as in if memory serves me right, I believe 2 bags of the mr.nice guy that was big at the time) some with a friend of mine, I was never able to handle any type of 'normal' marijuana again. 
 its been years and even still, someone else could see it as being terrible dirt weed and taking one hit of it for me would still affect me exactly the same as the best stuff out there, just taking one or two hits will be the same to me as an entire joint/blunt to someone else, and its overwhelming, scary&amp;just overall not fun to me anymore. I have no issues with those who do smoke, some or most people can handle it, but for me I stopped years ago, in high school. Since then, all together I've maybe smoked a handful of times and regretted it each time so eventually I stopped all together cause it was pointless. 
 My point is I know how it feels very well, nothing else makes me feel that way and I knew almost instantly it's what I was feeling. 
 But I hadn't smoked. Nobody around me had. And I sat there for a good moment trying to calm myself down, explaining to ,myself it was maybe just a severe anxiety attack and I just needed to calm down and breathe, after 15 minutes passed and it hadn't stopped I started to panic, which caused Kyle to ask what was wrong, after explaining it to him he explains he felt the same. He got something else to eat, but we always share our food so he had eaten some of mine, but not nearly as much. So, at least I knew I wasn't losing my mind because he felt it, too. Both of our hearts were pounding, both of us were experiencing severe anxiety, both have the same reaction to marijuana, etc. 
 So we start wondering if we should go to the hospital, because what if someone poisoned us or what if it's not THC oil/ marijuana what if it's something we could overdose from?? It just kept getting worse and worse.. 
 The thing is, if I had smoked, or known I was ingesting something or what I had ingested in general, I could have calmed myself down easier. But it was making sense and it wasn't adding up, him and I both felt fine all day, other than like I said feeling a cold coming on, but once we got home and we ate, after maybe 5 minutes of eating is when I started to notice something wasn't right, I don't know a lot about weed, or oils or anything but I've always heard that edibles take a longer amount of time to kick in than normal, so I'm wondering if THC oil kicks in quicker. I've seen videos of people putting it under their tongue (I think) and that's what made me think it's more likely to have been oil? I'm not sure how that all works? 
 We had to lay down and get ourselves to basically sleep it off for close to about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Woke up feeling back to normal, heart beating normal and a big headache and jaw ache from clenching my jaw. We were getting ready to go to the hospital before laying down, but I didn't even know what I'd say if I went to the ER, and if I was right and it was just weed, it would pass but I kept thinking what if I was wrong? What if it's a more serious drug, and my hearts just going to pop? Kyle has had a heart attack before, so I was even more concerned for him. But since he hadn't ate nearly as much soup as me, he wasnt experiencing it as badly as I was. 
 I figure I can go buy a cheap drug test tomorrow, and see if THC pops up, but then what should I do? I kept what the soup was in, I ate all of it tho, halfway through even though I felt how I did, I was convincing myself that it was impossible to be high and to calm down and maybe I just needed some food in my stomach, I hadn't ate since 830am, and it was around 6pm, working all day putting in hardwood floor can be a lot on my body, so I just finished my food hoping it would help. But I do still have the container and there's still a bit of soup in it, I'm just not sure how I would even go about testing the soup itself, if I do take a pee test myself, and it come back positive then what? I've never seen somewhere to buy like a test to test for drugs in something like a drink/food in this case soup? If I figured that out, would I go to cops or?.. 
I've never experienced this I've heard of people doing it around where I live, so it wouldn't actually surprise me, it's just idk what my next step should be. 
 If someone had done this, then I'd want them to be caught. I dont have am issue if you want to smoke weed, or take the oil or whatever, I dont really see marijuana as a drug, it's just not for me. But to give to a person, and them taking it unknowingly is just wrong. Especially for someone like me who literally just can not handle it, at all. Or what if a child got it? It's just not okay to do, bottom line. 
 For clarity: we had eaten nothing else all day. Other than breakfast, like I said at 8am ish, and he hadn't even eaten in the morning. We hadn't drank anything that wasnt sealed, we bought a 2liter of mtn dew for my house that I drank, and a 20oz of dr. Pepper for him, that he drank, we got those through the drive through. We fell asleep and woke up at 15 after 10pm, went and got our cold medicine after waking up. I'm just now taking it now, at midnight. We hadn't been intoxicated in anyway, and from our point of view there is just nothing else it could have been other than the soup. 
 I dont know what steps to take and advice would be really appreciated. Apologies for the length of this, I'm still a bit panicky atm and comfused. Thanks in advance for any help/advice and to those who took the time to read this.",05Nov2019,1

326,"I need a different perspective on my life and I don't have anyone I can really talk to.
I'm a 30 year old programmer from a transition country. One by one I lost my friends to foreign jobs and I basically got down to one friend who I don't even get to see very often as we live in different towns. I have my brother where I am atm, but I need a friend closer to my age and interests.
I love my job, but I travel a total of 3 hours from/to its location. When I come home I'm usually tired and because I have no friends in my hometown, I just sit and watch Netflix and do stuff for work.
I got tired of having no one to do anything with in my hometown and decided to move to the town my friend and my job are. But my friend just told me she's moving to a job somewhere else.
So now I'm stuck. I wanted to move just so I would not be alone, but it seems that is what I'm going to get if I move or don't.
So what would you do? Any of you conquer their fear of being alone?",05Nov2019,1
327,"Not sure if this is the SubReddit to ask, but I figured I should give this a shot. (I also need to get my thoughts down on paper as its making me more stress by the day).

Let me begin this about 2 years ago, I was getting out of the Military and wanted to stay in the area I was at since there is a lot more jobs here compared to my home town. Not only that but it was a beautiful city/state with lots of outdoors stuff. Plus I figured this would be a great way to stay with the girl I was dating who was also in the military.  Asked her to marry me a few months prior but she said no but she kept saying how she still loved me at the time so I stuck around. 

Unfortunately she ended up breaking up with me as I was in the process of getting out of the military. This made my situation a little difficult but ended up finding a place to stay at with a friend. After a bit I found a job about 2 hours away that payed decently well, but since it was a constant 4 hour drive each day I ended up simply moving there after a few months. At the time the new apartment was affordable, it wasn't until a year later I had to renew my lease, so I did but at a 10% increase. I also found some new friends during that year at a game store playing DnD or Mtg. Well since the rent increase I could use a roommate, asked around and a friend of mine suggested (lets call him Jim). He helped with the rent, and he made a good impression despite being very overweight. 

Well on the very week he moved in he broke the knob on the dryer, kept pissing on the toilet seat, crushed the plastic cushion underneath the toilet seat, broke the toilet paper roll dispenser since there wasn't enough room for him and used up all my soap. Keep in mind that was the first week. Every now and then he won't shower for a day and dear god he smells. I would have to bug him until he showered. One time I smelled him smoking marijuana in his and asked him not to since the apartment does not allow smoking inside and marijuana is strong. He gives me a bullshit lie and said it was simply a strong smelling weed that stuck around him after he smoked it outside. The next day I visited the main office ( I go there so my dog can visit people after her walks) and they told me how there was a complaint about someone smoking marijuana in the apartment. Had to control him on this since if he got caught one more time we both would be kicked out. Ever since he stoped smoking indoors, but that still doesn't stop his constant laziness or douchbaggery. (Also forgot to add because of him my couch is now ruined, it smells and the cushions are folding over)

Well now the lease is up soon and raised another 10%. I can't just live there alone anymore because of the price and I will not have the roommate stay with me any longer than I have to. So I go asking around about what if me and my dog moved in with someone until I can get a few things sorted. I realized something during this, everyone is already content with not having a roommate. And I cant find someone willing to let me move in.  At this point I'm not sure if I would have to put my dog in the shelter, or if I can even find a place to stay at all since I'm so new to the city still and a lot of people have there own families.

 I feel as if I made a mistake in not moving back to my hometown with family. I feel somewhat alone in a way, as if I pushed everyone away without even realizing it. I used to be depressed before I joined the military (a lot of things were happening that I dont want to get into) and during the military that depression went away as I learned how to handle social situations more. Now I feel as if it's coming back. I still haven't found someone romantically because I really needed that time to myself to sort of heal from a relationship that lasted years for it only to break apart (I blame myself for that one). And I now am close to having no where to go, and my family that I do have live on the other side of the U.S. not to mention my dad is not willing for me to move back in. His motto after high school was for me to find a job and move out or go to college. 

I need advice about something but I have no idea how to ask or even know what I want. Like there is a lot of things that I need to fix and I'm trying to fix it one problem at a time but 2 more problems spring up.  Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before?",05Nov2019,2

- I’ve cried due to the manager yelling at me in a stressful situation.
- My long time pet died and a coworker asked how she was doing and I cried as she had died that morning. 
- Then I was trying to get an issue with my contract solved and after being told for weeks it was going to be accepted the head manager told me no. 
I was fine with his answer but I was frustrated that it went on for so long and I cried. I wasn’t overly upset but when he started yelling I couldn’t help the tears.
- I came in for my next shift and had to have a meeting as to why I was crying, then started crying again. I was sitting and they were standing just berating me and I understand why.

I should be able to have a conversation without crying and being seen as over emotional, I don’t know how to cope in stressful situations.

332,"I started my YouTube channel less than a year ago. With barely 30 uploads, I am nearing 500k subscribers, I earn above the average wage (have the potential to make more than double that through sponsors and other sources of income), from uploading videos of myself playing a video game. I did all this while still focusing on school, had I invested more time into this, I could've gone a lot further, but because of school, family commitments etc. I have this to work with.

No, the point of this isn't to brag, it's to let you know how much potential I have on YouTube. 

Here's the thing, I'm 14 years old, and I am still in school, I am going to be a senior next year, and I've been told these next few years of my life are crucial for my future. But this whole YouTube thing, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity that a tiny percentage of people get, especially at the rate my channel is growing in, many people in the same position I'm in have dropped out or are taking homeschooling programs to focus on their gaming career. Since I live in a different country from those who made such decisions, I am unsure if I can do the same as our systems are different. 

I can always learn what I am learning right now later, but I can't use this opportunity ""later"". However, it's a gamble, I may be doing really well on YouTube right now, but that doesn't mean I will do just as well ten years later, my channel can die (barely get any views), and I could be left with a low income from YouTube. 

What do I do? 

Options I've thought of are:

* Balancing both 
* Prioritise YouTube and do the minimum for school 

If I balance both, I would be wasting quite a lot of potential on YouTube, considering how time entailing school is.

If I prioritise YouTube and do the minimum for school, I would be doing a lot better on YouTube and make A LOT more money, but my grades would start going down. I don't have the full picture with this one as I'm still young. If I could do school later, I would, to make the most of this precious opportunity I have, but I don't know if that's possible, in my country at least.

I am so torn on what to do with my time during these years if my YouTube channel continues to excel, which it most likely will, considering the popularity of the game I play for content.

Any advice would mean so much to me, I've been thinking about this for months and have had no one to talk to this about.

342,"I’m 20 years old, a second year in university, swimming high level NCAA, and in position to graduate after next year, assuming I’m satisfied with my classes and whatnot. However, I’m realizing that I’ve lost motivation to do anything but play FIFA. 

I’ve always been told I’m smart, even though I don’t think I am. I make horrible decisions, I have an awful case of ADHD, I miss doing homework way too much, and I always find myself doing what I shouldn’t, and knowing this, I actively continue the cycle. I always go to class but I never go above and beyond afterward. A little backstory, my ADHD was undiagnosed up through my sophomore year of high school. At that point my GPA was a 1.3(!) However, if you were to look at me, I 1000% look like the nerd of the class with glasses and the whole deal. When I was medicated before my junior year, everything changed. I dropped 18 seconds off my 500 time to a 4:45. My GPA was a 4.6. And everything was excellent. I wanted to keep swimming so I decided to do it with the NCAA.

I’m a Division I swimmer and I’m in an excellent social situation. I’m very well liked on the team. I have many coaches, parents, and teammates that care about me. However, I’ve stalled athletically and I’ve lost much of my hunger that I used to have. The motivation to get out of bed at 5:30 is gone, it’s non existent. I find myself getting sick or hurting myself far more than I ever have and I’m starting to think it’s a mental thing. I don’t want to go to practice anymore but I still enjoy competing. I’ve lost faith and love in the process, but the process is 20 hours a week in the pool alone (not including competition) and being in a state of constant pain and tiredness, that undoubtedly affects my motivation to do schoolwork. The struggle and grind is real, and while I used to love it, I now hate every second of it. I didn’t swim in college for the money, I swim because I loved the sport.

However, I don’t want to just give it up. I have great relationships with teammates and coaches and that is pretty much my only social circle. I don’t really have any friends or relationships outside of the sport that could fill the gap if I stopped. I’m not an overly social person so that would be very difficult to fill, especially because the people I have those relationships go through the same thing I do on a daily basis, and they are easy to relate to. 

Buy and large, I feel like I’m squandering everything. My Dad has the post 9/11 GI bill he’s using on me that allows me to go to college for practically nothing, and I’m extremely grateful for that, but when I get home from practice I find myself turning on the Xbox or waisting an hour on reddit and the books come second. As mentioned earlier, I have a worse than average case of ADHD and ADD (50 mg vyvanse and 20 adderall) that cause me to lose hours at a time staring at a wall or doing something else useless. I’m told I’m smart by everyone in my life but I don’t see it. I don’t do anything beyond the bare minimum to get a B, and I see a big problem with that, but I’m not willing to do anything to fix it in the moment. I feel like I’m bidding time until I can move to the next phase of my life but I might get there so easily doing what I’m doing, but I see doing what I’m doing as useless.

I’m not a drinker, I don’t do any drugs of any sort, but I still think I’m making all the wrong decisions in life, and I don’t know how to fix it one bit by not tipping over everything else. I’m lost and I have no clue where to go.

**About our relationship**

I will try to be short in this part. We were long distance. We met by chance and she's the one who made the first move. I wasn't interested at first, because I was very busy and working on many projects at once, but she seemed to want to stick around and messaged me often. I realized she was sort of lonely and she suffered from some pretty bad anxiety, so I decided to stick around too and keep her company. Anyway, things slowly evolved from there and we eventually got into a LDR. After a while, I realized I was making a huge impact in her life, she learned to have self-confidence, her spurs of depression stopped and she started to control her anxiety really well. She would often tell me how lucky she was for meeting me, and she would thank me for what I've done for her and tell me how much I improved her life and how I helped her become better person. We never argued, we had much in common and we'd always come to an agreement when we had to. Eventually, things got dull like most LDR, especially because I was too busy to visit her, so she ended things. We kept talking and we were okay as friends. Recently, I had the chance to transfer my studies to a much better university, which is much, much closer to where she lives. Of course there was a little spark of hope of making things work again, but I was more excited about the idea of transferring rather than having her back. She also liked the idea of having me around and we planned on going out and give it a shot, but a few days ago she started dating someone and we dropped that idea. Still, I have already planned things, spent money and I will be transferring soon.

**About the situation**

In November 1, my ex had her personal Snapchat username leaked on 4chan (/b/) and, as a consequence, her first and last name too. She told me about this in November 3 and I immediately advised her to change her username everywhere to prevent more stuff from leaking. She didn't tell me immediately what was going on and I didn't ask too many details about the leak because she seemed uncomfortable and like she didn't want to be open (maybe she already suspected me? By the way, I never used Snapchat but I did know she used it). But I decided to lookup her name/username in some 4chan archives, only to find out the post was very specific about certain details of her life (I did know some of them, but not all that were posted).

Basically, the post was about a guy who was planning to go out with her and wanted to test her limits by asking people on /b/ to try to get nudes from her, and he offered to buy a game on Steam to whoever succeeded, then he posted a link to a Steam profile so others could add him and send nudes there. I told her that I saw it and I offered to help her find out more about this and see if they leaked anything else. The thing is I could help a lot, my area of study is Digital Media Systems (more specifically, the study of social media data through collection and analysis, and yes it sounds stalky) and I have access to many tools in the university's lab, including DMI-Tool4CAT, which is basically a tool that allows you to query 4chan posts very effectively.

At first, still November 3, I started to lookup the guy's Steam username on other websites and found that he was probably from the same state she lives, which alarmed me a lot and I immediately told her to report this to the police, or at least tell her parents (she lives with them). She thanked me at first, and meanwhile I came with more and more information about the Steam guy. The more I found the more I advised her to tell it to her parents and/or the police. But she'd always say that she just wanted to forget it. I was getting very worried.

The next day, I made a through investigation of this in the university's lab and found people talking about that same Steam profile on 4chan in a 2 year old thread. I told her that and many other things I've found in other websites (which was enough info to rule out who it could be), and that since she didn't want to report it to the police or tell her parents, she could at least be more careful around certain people. The thing is she knew who the owner of that Steam profile was all along, but she never told me, and she said she trusts this person completely. When she told me that, I was really confused and didn't know what to think but it made me feel like I was accusing someone she trusts, so I started to suggest someone was impersonating this person on 4chan and left the Steam profile as a false trail, and that at least she didn't have to worry it was someone she knew well.

After a few minutes, she asked me pictures of the past stuff I've found on 4chan about that person's Steam profile. I sent them. Then she said this on Discord:

*""You know what, I haven't ruled you out as a suspect. Because this stuff has only happened when I've told you that I like someone else. And you could easily change the dates and fake things, you obviously know a lot about this stuff. For my sanity. I think it's best if we don't have anything to do with each other anymore. I'm sorry,* \[my name\]*. I wish you the best in life but I can't do this anymore. Please don't come to* \[her state\] *either. Goodbye""*

Then she immediately blocked me in every social media, except Discord (she probably just deleted the app). That made me realize that's probably the Steam account of the guy she's dating. Now I am completely confused and it hurts me that she'd think of me this way, after all we had, and how much we learned with each other. I don't even know who this guy is, she never posted pictures of her daily life and she never told me his name, she just said there was a guy. It's like she felt that she needed to choose between me and him, and she chose to trust him. The problem is that I have links of everything that I've found, but she never asked, she just talked as if I had manipulated the images or even the data in the servers as if I'm some super hacker. Maybe it's not him, but it's definitely someone and she needs to be careful.

I wouldn't have looked up so much about this person if she told me she knew them. It's like, by not telling me that, she led me into a trap that made me look like a stalker. And how she doesn't want to tell the police or her parents is like she's afraid that it's really him who made that post? It's like she doesn't want to know? Sure, someone could have impersonated him to defraud him, but why not report it then since that's 2 charges?

**What do I do?**

I am worried that she could be dealing with some freak who could do something dangerous to her, whether it's the guy she's dating or a stalker who impersonated him. She is very stubborn and I don't think she will report it or anything, I feel like she will just settle with me being the villain, even though we never had a bad chapter. Right now I just feel like waiting for her to contact me again and just hope that nothing bad happens to her. I couldn't convince her to file a report and trying to reach out to her with other social media accounts would probably just make me look bad.

What's the best way of coping with this? Do I wait? Do I try to forget her for having poor judgement? Do I try to understand that she just wants peace of mind no matter the cost and risk? I feel kind of lost right now... and I feel like, if we never talk again, I will always wonder what happened to her. I care a lot about her and I can't stand the thought of someone harming her.

**TL;DR**

Ex had info leaked on 4chan, person who did it posted a link to a Steam profile. I told her to report the post to the police many times so they can catch the IP, she doesn't want to. The Steam profile is probably of the guy she's dating. Apparently she thinks I set it up to make him look bad. Gave me no chance of defending myself, blocked me everywhere, except Discord where she disappeared. I'm not sure how to deal with it. I'm worried about her but I also feel like crap. We weren't in a relationship when this happened, but our relationship was good (LDR) and we never had creepy moments like this.",05Nov2019,1

I started my study 3 months ago and I  absolutely love it but there's one problem; I don't need a diploma to  get the job I want (Military job). My study is 80% military themed and  if I get to the end I get a shitty security diploma. The reason I want  to quit this study and start another one is because I don't like the  risk I'm taking. I'd have absolutely NOTHING if something bad happens  physically. I'm still underaged so I'm living costless and I kinda want  to do a study where I have a decent diploma at the end of the road as  backup IF something happenend.

So that's a short intro into the story (excuse me if its hard to understand, feel free to ask anything)

Now  here's where it gets tricky; I want to tell the news to my mentor first  and hear his thoughts about it, but some day or another I have to tell  my dad. My dad can get rather 'explosive' and I'm scared that he'll get  extremely mad if I told him I wanted to switch. I don't like walking  away from my problems so I have to talk to him soon but I can get a bit  awkward when tensions get high.

So  my question to the ones still reading; How do I start the convo and  what points are necessary to begin about when I'm starting about it.

TLDR; I'm doing an unnecessary study, want to switch. Scared dad will get mad, how to approach him.",05Nov2019,1
349,"So I guess I really started to notice something when Sayori’s... incident happened, and that was a weird sick feeling I’ve never felt before.  K, a little weird, I’ve heard about this feeling before, but my strong stomach for gore and crazy death shit usually prevents this feeling. Call me insensitive, whatever. I think it was viewing death in a personal, sudden context. Whatever it is, it creeps me out that a video game easily flaunts around stuff that not even the scariest, darkest shit YouTube has to offer could achieve. Then came Yuri, and the feeling was mixed in with the feeling I got after those eyes in the closet... there’s more to that scene in horror than the entirety of the Dead Space Trilogy, at least to me. Then her death scene actually made me a bit queasy for the time I’ve thought about ddlc (a couple days so far) which has an unfortunate side effect of reduced eating. After some weird 4th wall shit, that’s when I got to the part where my brain started acting like a CPU in an integrated circuit running an RTX real time Doom Eternal! Wtf is this?!

I like to play video games... A lot... and as a 17 year old, I enjoy gaming alone in my free time, and tend to get pretty invested in them. More recently, however, I've began to notice how much I talk to myself in these periods. Not like, encouraging communication to yourself in your head while you battle against the other team, kind of talk, but actual, full on monologues into the empty room I play in. Sometimes, if stuff gets intense, my neighbors can swear that I'm having an argument with someone on the other end of my mic, when really, I'm just a bloke who is passionately chattering like a loner while getting his ass whooped by the enemy.  


However, I have done this to the point where I am seriously worried about my mental health. I don't hear voices, reply to myself, or have any serious mental conditions. Although (while I have not been formally diagnosed), I have showed prominent sings of social anxiety, depression, and even ADHD in recent years. I don't know what could cause me to lash out on a game to no one in particular, but I'm genuinely worried that people might see me as crazy if it gets too hot!

Over the summer she didn't live with her mom (whom is a single mother) because her mother didn't think to accommodate for her the new apartment her mom just got so she had to find a family friends to live with over the summer. Her mom was always difficult to give her help and was always hard on her as a kid and even to this day telling her she needed to get a job and making her do everything on her own such as applying to school and scholarships and setting up financial aid in order to make her a more independent person. My girlfriend is quite the trooper and has been working hard to make ends meet on her own, but if she asks her mom for help her mom gets super upset and calls her extremely selfish and disrespectful and what-not bs until she just decides its not worth it to keep asking her for her need. Its not like her mom can't provide for her because she is constantly going out on weekdays and going on spontaneous vacations traveling the world while her daughter studies all day and drowns in debt. She is out of state which means that the tuition is higher and even though Purdue has good rates for paying tuition, she has to pay most of it by herself which is no easy task and her mom is very hard to deal with when it comes to even getting the tiniest bit of help and/or money to pay for either books, tuition, housing, etc. Overall, her Mom is the one that she stays in contact with to get most of everything she needs and despite my girlfriends working a job, 18 credit hour semesters to graduate early to not pay as much overall, and maintain a social life, her mom is just not helping with anything she needs to survive at college and overall in life. I hate to see my girlfriend struggle so hard with balancing studies and the emotional struggle of dealing with her mom that doesn't seem to care for her own child. Just recently her mom just crossed the line by insulting her own child and is basically not supporting her own daughter anymore. My gf feels that her mother truly doesn't care for her and that shes an inconvenience to them. She is truly the nicest person I have ever met and am amazed that such a nice person could come from the result of such nasty parenting. Everyone she has met loves her and I do too.

361,"So I've been on an antidepressant and neuroleptic (antipsychotic) for about four years due to suicidal ideation and anxiety and while it has helped, it really gave me horrible side effects. I gained some weight, developed male breasts, I feel not like myself emotionally, and my sex drive is almost nonexistent.

So in May of 2019 I spoke to a physician assistant about this and she said that she noticed that I was feeling very depersonalized (feeling and acting like a zombie) and wanted to taper me off both medications. I agreed because I realized my best shot at getting back to normal would be to stop both medications and wait for a while. I am in November now and I am finally off the ziprasidone, the antipsychotic. As long as I manage well with withdrawals from that medication, my PA can discontinue the antidepressant in December. I have also spoken to an endocrinologist who performed a testicular ultrasound, bloodwork, and physical examination. She told me that the best thing I can do is to get the brest reduction surgery, taper off the medications, and as long as I do not have a relapse, she would do another bloodwork test to see if things are improving. 

I should get my procedure in late November or early December and I should be off the antidepressant in December. I asked my primary care physician what he thought and he said that ""everything should return to normal within two to three months after you are finished with both medications"".

I want to have hope that things can get better for my body but I am not sure because the future remains so uncertain. The hormonal problems and sexual side effects are the most troubling.

She had recently asked me one night if I liked it, and I explained to her why I do and just ended with a simple yes, I do. Soon after a relative in her family passed away, and she told me she'd be away for some time and didn't know how long. I just let her know that no matter what I will always be there for you.

364,"For background, my roommate is an international student who I've gotten mildly close with and who prior to this was good friends with me. We have a couple rules in place about guest policy, number one being that we can have guests stay over if the other guest okays it, number two that we have to provide at least two hours in advance notice to bring over a guest (if they're staying over or hanging out), and that the guest has to not be intrusive of the other roommate's space. I adhered to all these rules when I brought around a girl I'm currently seeing and very close with, and the first time she came over, we watched a movie and then I walked her home. The second night was the night of halloween, and when I informed my roommate earlier in the night that she'd be coming over he told me that he'd prefer to not have her stay the night, and I said that was fine with me, but me and the girl both fell asleep drunkenly and woke up in the morning to a very angry roommate. He's apparently not comfortable sleeping when a girl is in the same room as him (something not expressed to me previously) and was not able to sleep until 5 in the morning. I tried explaining that it was a mistake made when we were drunk but he went on to say that he feels as if I constantly disrespect him and then proceeded to ban any guests at all from coming over to our room. I accepted the change in policy because I did make the mistake of letting her sleep over. Since then, I apologized to him and asked him if we could have a conversation as I try very hard to be a good roommate and accommodating, and I want to be on better terms. In the time we've lived together, I've never been loud while he's home, tolerated his playing league well into the late hours into the night and occasionally waking me up, and I even make my monitor dimmer or turn it off entirely when I have to work late at night because he can't sleep due to the screen's brightness. But it's been complete radio silence, and except for responding to the occasional room-related problem (needing to take out the trash etc.) he's been cold as hell.

369,"I am currently not in this situation but a close family friend is and we are at a loss at what our next steps should be.

Long story short my friend (24) parents are going through a divorce since 2016. Since then a lot of family drama has happened and has made this divorce the absolute worst I can imagine.

Her mother (53) still lives in their family home with a deadlock on the master bedroom and she will not move out. She has been in a relationship with a 22 year old wannabe who has verbally and emotionally harassed my friend's younger sisters (16,19) since they first started dating. Without enough financial support the father (50) and two sisters are unable to move out and have a safe home and are stuck in their childhood home with their once Girl Scout mother turned sour. The verbal abuse is insane between the mother and father, wannabe boyfriend and father, and wannabe boyfriend and sisters. The threats include selling some of the fathers cherished items online, letting out the 19 year olds cat so he can die, calling the police and lie that the father hit the mother with video evidence of her saying that.

The emotional threats top the chart with the boyfriend yelling directly at the father to ""drink another beer and buy that bitch some proactive"" ""that bitch"" being the 16 year old sister and calling the father numerous racial slurs are just to name a few. My friend has tried to reach out with authorities for a restraining order since he is always at the house but the restraining order could not be granted. Since then, it has only gotten progressively worse and the sisters are terrified everyday what will happen when they get home. The sisters call my friend every night in tears, trembling on what event occurred that night. We don't know what to do anymore as this situation gets worse every night. The sisters don't feel safe in their childhood home anymore and hate going home every night. The financial stress on the father leaves him unable to save his children from this once happy home to toxic environment.

The divorce is still in papers and the mother is being absolutely relentless that this was her childhood home and will not move out and has dragged on a simple divorce to almost four years now. Everything they have is in both of their names and with her criminal record and low income she cannot support to buy out the house from the father yet still drags out everything claiming it is all hers. She also wants joint custody of the youngest even though she could careless about her family as she states often on her online blogs. To her, everyone else is wrong and you can't get a word in edgewise.

I sent her a follow up email requesting that she not communicate via email to me any longer and in the email, in response to the post she sent, I sent her all of the screenshots of the facebook messenger posts, (all of them, or the few messages were saying that she owed me money and she didn't pay me back), and said what was unprofessional was not only to not pay off your debts, but to falsely accuse someone via email.

I later got correspondence via my roommates that she kept calling/texting them asking for *my* info asking where I was. To make things worse, (because I blocked all of her contacts at this point), I got a message from my roommates where she sent a long text saying that she wanted to ""apologize"" because ""I was hurt"" (as if) and ""I helped her when I was stressed out."" I purposely stayed later on campus to avoid coming home to this freak show when she came to me and even when I told her to stop talking, now was not a good time. She kept going on and on about how it was her first time in America and that she has no family here. (First of all, there are other international students in the apartment who don't have any of these issues), second of all, rather than take responsibility, she deflected the blame at every circumstance. I.e. she said she couldn't communicate via facebook messenger, (although she was until it came time to discuss the matter of money....) because she's a TA and I'm an undergrad student. 

I almost ended up pulling my hair out at that segment because *I have another apartment mate who is actually one of the TAs in my current class*, but we were able to establish the proper boundary that anything school related would be through school email and anything apartment-related would be through Facebook Messenger. She also started going to the other people in the apartment and complained that I wouldn't hear her out, (when all of them were clearly annoyed as well and said that now was obviously not a good time). My favorite part was when I confronted her about the email she sent, she said she sent it because she was upset!!! I had to tell an *adult* who is a little less than twice my age that just because you are upset with someone doesn't mean you can send lies via email!!!!!! 

She owed me half the money of a bunkbed and then not only wasted so much of my time trying to entertain her claims that she'd pay me back, (when I had to find out from another roommate that she had problems paying her debts i.e. she gave rent a month late too). She went behind my back and made herself out to be the ""victim."" The atmosphere in the apartment is now super tense and I hate that my other roommates have to also get involved in something that was never their fault!

I'm honestly at a loss. I like my other roommates, I just don't know what to do. I get stressed out easily and none of this cortisol is good for my health let alone education. Keep in mind that I came back later today because I wanted to avoid her.",05Nov2019,1
376,"# Hello guys. I need serious help finding a series of music from a dvd that we used to watch as a kid my my parents. My mom particularly loved it since it contained different kinds of songs and I need help finding out the dvd or band. Please

We watched this when we were KIDS and after mom passed we kinda forgot about it until my dad started finding the dvd without success. So here goes and thank so very much to the people who would help.

One of the scenes in the dvd were shot in Dunguaire Castle in Ireland. The music was Traditional and so was the dance which was performed by a group of girls.

Another scene is the band plays near a (I think Roman) fountain with first a spoon until a long-haired guy playing an electric guitar.

One more scene is the main star playing a piano while a lady in a red dress dancing Flamenco which made me presume that they were somewhere in Spain.

One last scene that I remember is the band playing on TOP of a mountain in the desert(I think they're mountains, I don't know the English word for that) with NATIVE AMERICANS dancing.

And at the end of the show was like they all combined the performances into one single performance.

All of this and more in that dvd, I have 2 more days to find that dvd to give to my dad for their anniversary and I appreciate any help any of you would give. A thousand blessing to all of you!",05Nov2019,3
377,"Hi,

I am starting a business with people I've met online. We're going to need a bank account to put the money into from the online business (Website). How do I protect that account from them taking the money and running?",05Nov2019,1
378,"Sorry for the juvenile sounding post. I don't really talk about my feelings or emotional issues with anyone; because I'm not at all comfortable with it. That said, I figured the anonymity of the internet could help me be a little bit vulnerable.

So this is not at all my ""first love"" or ""first crush"" experience or whatever. I'm a college student, and I would like to think I'm a bit more mature and less naive as to what I truly feel; being realistic as possible with myself. The person I ended up having feelings for, I did not at all intend to like them at all.

I'm an overanalytical person, and due to my nature I don't trust easy and have low self esteem. A lot of people compliment me on my looks or ""smarts"", but I can never take that at face value. I always feel like I'm not good enough, and this is one of the reasons why I have refused to let my feelings for this person to come to light 

Here's the gist: this girl has been a long time family friend. As for our relationship between each other however, we were more or less aquaintences. I talked to and got along with her family more than I did with her. I also didn't really see her as a girl until recently. It didn't help that people have every so often thrown the idea of me dating her out there, and I used to just ignore that. Yet now... because of stuff that's happened and the fact that we got to know each other... I've actually begun to really like her. Which sucks. It has nothing to do with her as an individual. She's smart, attractive, kind, talented and compassionate. The issue for me... is that I feel like I have no chance with her whatsoever.

Trust me; I've studied a bit of psychology and I'm normally really good at empathy and social cues. There have been times where she seemed like she had some kind of interest in me. But I second guess everything, and I feel like it's safer to assume that she just doesn't. I know some people would say ""just shoot your shot"", but there's so much at stake. Our families are so close and I don't want to ruin that dynamic. Plus I see her way too often enough to try to deal with the awkwardness stemming from rejection.  I've already been cheated on before, so my trust issues are at an all time low, and I don't want to deal with the pain of not being accepted. I have her on such a high pedestal. I know I shouldn't, but I just can't help but think I'm just so far below the kind of guy she wants/needs.

What can I do to get over this person? I don't want to hurt more than I need to. When she does find the one for her, I want to not be affected by that at all. I know this sounds pathetic... but I just can't seem to control my feelings. I hope this all makes sense, and I can't really go into anymore detail as to how I really got to like her without being extremely specific. After all, I'm trying to maintain the anonymity. I just want to get over her so I don't have to be kept up late at night about something so stupid. I feel like it's childish to obsess this much over simple ""crushing"" or whatnot.",05Nov2019,1

The Tumor probably has spread to her spine so that could explain the neck pains.

Well, when I was 16 I got into an abusive relationship and everything kind of went downhill from there. I had no emotional maturity and my grades fell ALOT (so obviously I wasn't able to get into the program). 

Now I'm a lot more mature emotionally. I went through some real tough shit and realized that I need to live for myself, and do what I want.

The problem is; I'm currently in school for a law degree. I enjoy law a lot, but I still have always had this nagging feeling inside me to go achieve what I wanted. 

I just don't have the money or time for this. 

What do I do?

I'm 21, 6'3'' and 400. I want to change that but there's a lot that's holding me back. 

To begin with I suffer from a disease called Toxoplasmosis contracted from a parasite. Usually it finds its way in you, you'll experience symptoms on a basic flue and not much pas that. 
In my case said parasite found its way to my eye tearing through my retina and destroying the vision of my right eye. I'm not a doctor but I guess because the disease decided to hibernate in my eye it's cause me a host of problems from general mild headaches to the feeling of a large needle going from my eye through my skull

385,"At the same time, one person can only do one thing. If you can't read a movie, you can't sleep. One needs to make the best choice between two choices or multiple choices. In personal behavior, some behaviors can be replaced by people as long as they have money, such as cleaning, shopping, driving, seeing doctors for pets, etc. Some behaviors can only be personally experienced, you can not find someone to replace you and your family. Reunion, can not find someone to replace your role as a husband or father, no one can replace your love for your family.

Even if making money itself is not irreplaceable, people can make money, money can make money, and personal time and personal money are capital and can be used for output. If a person can survive by making money with money, he can take his time to do more valuable things. The only life in the world is irreplaceable, and the quality of life of a person can only be grasped by oneself. The quality of life is equal to the unit time value multiplied by the length of life. A person cannot grasp the length of life, but can increase the value of unit time.

386,"This is a long rant I apologise. 

My friend and I have been best friends since kindergarten. We each have one child, about 6 months apart but our parenting and lifestyles are completely different and it's getting hard for me to sympathize and connect with her. 

As soon as I finished highschool I had a job. I have always worked, up until a few months ago. My husband is allowing me to stay at home with our toddler while I go to college. 

My friend has had two jobs, kept one for about a month and got fired. Got another fast food job and quit soon after. She hasn't had a job in six years. Her and her boyfriend are constantly struggling and barely make ends meet. He has asked her multiple times to get a job but she can't. She has her toddler and doesn't want to put him in preschool yet, she'll have to stop smoking pot to get a job, she doesn't drive and it's too much of a hassle, ect. She messaged me about how her and her boyfriend were fighting. They couldn't afford toilet paper and he told her to get a job. I agreed with her boyfriend and she got really irritated with me. 

Her son is also an absolute monster. He gets into everything, breaks everything, he hits, throws fits, and refuses to eat anything other than junk food.(Which is all my friend eats so she just keeps  buying it.) She does not believe in spanking or saying ""no."". So when he does something wrong he goes in his crib... For two minutes... Because he's two...

 (I do not beat my child, or scream but she knows if I tell her no that means no, she listens very well for a baby)

Anyways, my friend does this all day long. We walked to the store and he let go of her hand and ran into the street. So. We walked all the way back to her house to put him in his crib for two minutes. 

It's just getting to the point that it's ridiculous. She goes outside constantly to either get stoned or smoke a cigarette and then complains that her son got into this, broke that, ect. He gets bored being left all by himself, and he doesn't have any form of real structure. Not even a bed time. 

I love my friend. I really do but she isn't getting anywhere in life. She won't even finish high school, or take college classes, or get a job to help her family and just wants to complain about how life is just so hard.  I don't want to cut her off, but she refuses advice, and I am really losing my patience with her.

388,"So some background. Myself and four friends are currently studying abroad, and we all decided around the beginning of the year that we would go on a trip at the end of the year before heading home. All of us are 19-21 years old, all in uni, with three women and two men in the group. One of the people in the group is someone I know from my home university and he was a pretty chill guy with a slightly fucked up sense of humor before we got here, but nothing too bad. He never crossed any lines before. But now, and I have no idea what happened, he's just become an absolute asshole. He makes incredibly offensive ""jokes"" and he refuses to stop even when we ask him to. Jokes that directly affect/relate to myself and another girl on the trip (e.g. offensive Nazi and Jewish jokes when around her, AIDS and gay jokes around me). We have both been visibly uncomfortable when he does this with another guy on our trip, and he never notices or just chooses to ignore it. I've known him for at least two years before this, and have been out to him for at least a year now, and this is completely new to me.

Here's the issue: we are all going to be stuck in close proximity for at least a month before getting home.

We made these plans weeks ago, and its only recently that he's gotten really bad. It started small, him getting annoyed when I kept asking him to pay me back the US$300+ he owed me, getting annoyed at us asking for any input on what he would want to do on the trip, etc. And now he thinks he's the one who's going to be driving the entire trip as if I'm not the one who rented all the cars and have them under my own name. I told him that and he got angry and said ""Well I hope you are planning on driving the entire trip then"" as if he was trying to get me to back down. Side note: where we are going only people 21 and older can rent/drive rental cars. He and I are the only 21 year olds on the trip, so you can see where this is going.

What should I do in this situation? People have told me I need to sit him down and talk it out, but every time I try it he pulls the ""irrational woman"" card and dismisses me. And he does it in a way that makes me doubt myself. All of the tickets at this point are non-refundable, so it's not like we can cancel this trip. Besides, I've wanted to do this forever, and I don't want something like this to get in the way of it.",05Nov2019,1

392,"I've broken up almost 2 months ago now. I've been in a relationship for 3 years and really kind of grew up with this girl. So much of who I am, is because of her. I'm 21 now. She is 20. It came as a surprise, she told me she was just not in love any more and had that feeling for months. Then we tried for two weeks, but she was just not interested at all. I made an ultimatum. Really trying, doing fun stuff, or breaking up. She didn't decide. So I decided for us. If she didn't want to try, I thought breaking up would be the only thing that would remain. I honestly think that at that moment I expected some push back, or she would say she'd miss me after a while, but it seems like she's happier than ever. She hardly cried during it all.

I'm feeling so depressed. I get panic attacks sometimes at work, have literally not studied a word last month, failed two courses because of it. I just don't want to wake up, I feel I'm in so much pain. A huge weight pushing me down. I don't enjoy doing anything, but drinking. Which then of course makes me feel worse the days after, so I stopped drinking now. I feel like shit. Even though the last half year I lost 15kg of weight. I should feeling myself good now, I'm more healthy and better looking than I was a long time... But still I feel like absolute garbage.

I miss her terribly, but I'm a little angry with her as well. I feel she has not been honest with me. There was this 'friend' during the relationship who she saw often, who I knew by name but had never met. She had a snapstreak with him of a month during our relationship and I found out see reacted heart-emoji's underneath his pictures. She said it was nothing when we spoke one week after the break-up. Now I saw her little brother post a picture of the three of them getting a coffee... Can't I just conclude she's seeing him? She really was the guy-friends type even before I knew her though... My sister does think she's seeing him. I tried to go get my stuff at her place last night, but she wasn't home she said. On a monday night. I can't help but wonder if she's with him. I don't understand if she lied, when I asked her so directly if any of this had anything to do with him. She always was so very honest in everything... Feels like that person I love so much just doesn't exist anymore.

I'm doing really bad. I will go see a therapist to talk about the depression and panic attacks. Still, if any of you guys went through this, or have an opinion on this guy for example, would love to know. Either way it felt kind of good writing this post.

2 months ago, I matched on Tinder with a guy from campus. Neither of us messaged eachother, so I didn't really think about it (except for when I'd have to ninja my way out of running into him on campus). He was cute and we seemed to have a lot if things in common, but I wasn't over my ex enough at the time to want to date seriously. 

Then about 3 weeks ago, I started dating a guy from a class. It's been going really well. The relationship's still developing, though, so we haven't had the bf/gf talk yet. I'm trying to take things relatively slow anyways, because I have a lot of stuff going on, and I don't want to get too caught up in anything.  

Anyway, I found a flyer for a comedy club on campus a few days ago, and decided to check it out today. I was insanely excited, too, because comedy is something I've been interested in for a while. But then Tinder Guy walked throygh the doors, and things got weird. I tried to interact with him as little as possible, but I couldn't get away with flat out ignoring him without making things even weirder.

398," Okay, so I had my grandmother come over and was dropped off by my grandfather, she was with us for a couple of hours until my grandmother and mom decided to leave to get something from the store. So my grandfather comes to the driveway and honked 3 times.

I see him and call his phone to tell him that grandmother and mom went to the store and they'll be right back, so he says ""Oh okay, I'll come back then"", so 10 minutes later, my mom and grandmother return back and we wait for 10 minutes as my grandfather pulls up to our driveway and waits.

So my grandmother comes out and as she's about approaching the car, my weirdo obese neighbor comes out of his house and appeared to either stare at us or stare at my grandmother as she was about to enter my grandfather's car.

My mother and I stared at him, while I thought he was coming out to get something from his car or dumping out trash. NOPE, he literally stood there until my grandmother was about to enter the car then went inside.

I am so pissed off because I don't know if he was trying to be intimating to us or my grandmother, yet I don't like this. As my grandmother was entering the car, she even looked at him and was confused about it.

He's always been this weird and unfriendly bastard, we've lived here for 4 years and he still does this crap with stopping to give quick nosy stares then turning his back, yet now he became too comfortable with coming outside to look at my grandmother entering a car, like she was a criminal or something.

When he had those speakers in his SUV and would blast that heavy metal music coming down the street and into his driveway at night, I didn't come out to stare at him. Thankfully that piece of shit car is dead, since he never took care of it.

I feel angry and think I should've said something to him, that was crossing the line. He could've done that to me and I wouldn't care but my grandmother? Yeah, I need some advice please. My mom just wants me to ignore it but that was a bit too much to just ignore.",05Nov2019,1
400,"I posted this to trueoffmychest the other night just so I could stop ruminating. Hope it’s okay if I post here as well, I could use some advice. Here’s the situation-

After my dad died, I hit rock bottom and stayed there for about two years. Severe mental illness, alcoholism, and living well below the poverty line. I’d go days without getting out of bed. I could barely wake up for work and regularly overslept, rolling out of bed and running straight out the door most days. I could barely afford to feed myself and was living off corner store junk food and bum wine. All of this combined meant I wasn’t taking care of my personal hygiene at all. I wasn’t flossing or brushing my teeth more than once every other day. 

I’m getting better now and my situation has improved drastically, but I think I’ve done permanent damage to my teeth. I constantly have the sensation of having something stuck in my teeth and can see that I have a cavity in one of my front bottom teeth, and my gums don’t feel right on the bottom. 

I’m so scared I’ll have to have teeth pulled. As a kid, I had eight of my adult teeth removed (I’ve got big teeth and a small mouth, would’ve had crooked crowded teeth) and had a traumatic experience when the dentist didn’t realize I wasn’t numb. I’m afraid of the judgment I’ll face going to the dentist. I doubt I can afford to have them fixed anyways. I don’t think Medicare will cover it.

I’m so ashamed and disgusted that I did this to myself. I had perfect, straight teeth after years of braces and orthodontic work. And I ruined all of that, first by not wearing my retainer and then by letting my teeth rot because I wanted to be a lazy piece of shit and drink and sleep my life away for two years. I don’t know what to do. I think about this everyday. I’m too ashamed to talk to anyone about it. Hell, I’ll probably delete this post later but I’ve been obsessing over my teeth all night and making myself sick with anxiety.",05Nov2019,1

This is a sensitive topic and I know how this may sound stupid and all but it's legit ruining my life I don't remember when this all started but  I often have dark and scary thoughts and that too to an extreme degree.

Suppose I was sitting in a chair I think about what would happen if the chair toppled backward and I hit my head on the floor and then I would get this vivid vision of shattering my head and reaching out to feel the sensation of warm blood and brain matter on my fingers and my mom finding my body.
Or how when I'm traveling getting crushed under a truck and falling on sharp objects or my loved ones dying horribly(I feel horrible) I have these recurring dreams where I kill myself.This scared me too much and I started to hide any sharp objects before I go to sleep in case I do something in my sleep these are some examples I can think of.

The sensation and the feeling of utter horror is very real I could see and feel the images vividly.
It scares me too much and this made me paranoid I don't want to have these thoughts and I try not to think too much about it but they just come randomly as if I was watching a movie clip.

I later got correspondence via my roommates that she kept calling/texting them asking for *my* info asking where I was. To make things worse, (because I blocked all of her contacts at this point), I got a message from my roommates where she sent a long text saying that she wanted to ""apologize"" because ""I was hurt"" (as if) and ""I helped her when I was stressed out."" I purposely stayed later on campus to avoid coming home to this freak show when she came to me and even when I told her to stop talking, now was not a good time. She kept going on and on about how it was her first time in America and that she has no family here. (First of all, there are other international students in the apartment who don't have any of these issues), second of all, rather than take responsibility, she deflected the blame at every circumstance. I.e. she said she couldn't communicate via facebook messenger, (although she was until it came time to discuss the matter of money....) because she's a TA and I'm an undergrad student.

I almost ended up pulling my hair out at that segment because *I have another apartment mate who is actually one of the TAs in my current class*, but we were able to establish the proper boundaries by saying that anything school related would be through school email and anything apartment-related would be through Facebook Messenger. (Keep in mind this is okay with our school policy and I'm not in this apartment mate's section.) She also started going to the other people in the apartment and complained that I wouldn't hear her out, (when all of them were clearly annoyed as well and said that now was obviously not a good time). My favorite part was when I confronted her about the email she sent, she said *she sent it because she was upset*!!! I had to tell an *adult* who is a little less than twice my age that just because you are upset with someone doesn't mean you can send false accusations via email!!!!!!

She owed me half the money of a bunkbed and then not only wasted so much of my time trying to entertain her claims that she'd pay me back, (when I had to find out from another roommate that she had problems paying her debts i.e. she gave rent and the security deposit half a month late too). She went behind my back and made herself out to be the ""victim."" The atmosphere in the apartment is now super tense and I hate that my other roommates have to also get involved in something that was never their fault! Another favorite part of this entire thing was when after I put my headphones in, (I didn't put music on), she loudly said I should be respecting her because she's older. As if! You earn respect. This is beyond a cultural issue.

I'm honestly at a loss. I like my other roommates, I just don't know what to do. Keep in mind that I came back later today because I wanted to avoid her. I get bad roommates are a common thing. But she's being ridiculous. She's also my current roommate, (the bunk above me), to make things worse.",05Nov2019,1
404,"Let’s call them A and B. We were all friends until a few months ago, when A and B had a massive falling out. I remained friends with both of them (separately of course) and listened to both of them rant about each other. Eventually the anger died down for both of them and they both moved on, but basically stayed away from each other. Both were aware that I remained friends with the other, and luckily for me neither asked me to pick sides. 

Recently, an external party showed B a conversation where A had been talking shit about B (both A and B would complain about each other to external parties too) and B is understandably pissed off, while A has no idea that B found out. 

I am extremely conflicted. Do I tell A that B knows about this? Do I even get myself involved in this?",05Nov2019,1

I love him platonically, but I know for certain that I don’t want to be with him the way he wants to be with me. He knows this and has known for years, but has still wanted to be friends. I’m increasingly concerned because I am (as far as I know) the only female friend he’s had and the only person he’s ever had feelings for. I fear he has me on a sort of pedestal. It’s been this way for about 9 years and we’re both in our mid-20’s now. I feel like staying in his life is selfish and smothering his chances of meeting somebody else. He spends all this time and energy on me that he could be spending on someone who might be able to love him romantically. My own dating life has been rather stifled for about 4 years now due to some serious health issues, but when I do think about falling in love/ getting into a serious relationship, I feel a lot of guilt over the pain it could bring him. Should I lessen the blow by creating distance now? It would be very painful for both of us, but I wonder if it would be better in the long term.

However I made some things very clear before I would accept this job. This is because the job is a 1.5 to 2 hour drive from my home. So I told my manager from the secondment company that I was willing to accept the job on 2 conditions. 1 was that I could work from home for a day. 2 was that i had a 4x9 day contract. 

However the following happend. I went to the job on Friday which seemed odd but okay. My manager from the job was not there he had an off day. There were a lot of things wrong with my account. So I left at 5pm that day feeling like shit. So I send an email to the job manager that I wanted to talk about the job profile and working from home.

We met on Monday and as soon as i asked about the working from home he got mad at me for asking.
Also 4x9 was not discussed with him. 
So I called my manager from secondment and said i wanted to quit since the travel time is unbearable.
She then said if I could come to the office where we would have a meeting about it.

Long story short they thought i did not give it a chance and were pretty upset that i wanted to quit this job. Since it was at a customer that they have for a long time. We ended up saying that I could quit there and that I would still go to the job until they had spoken with the job manager about it. 

So what do you think I was in the right or wrong with this one?

Tldr: quit a job from secondment because agreements were not met. Manager not happy with me.",05Nov2019,1
415,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been in a rut for quite a while now and would like to hear some opinions on reddit before I seek a therapist for help...

I’m currently a year 1 student in law school, a few weeks away from finishing my first semester. The workload is heavy for sure, but for some reason I just can’t seem to find the motivation to work hard and do well. I’m a naturally curious person, and I came to law school partly because of my curiosity for the law and also to possibly help others through legal service. 

But with all the exams and deadlines going on, I feel like I’m forced to spend less time learning and instead more time to just study in preparation for finals (which is probably what most students do). This really takes away the joy of learning for me, and what I’m thinking most of the time currently is that I’m just forced to read dry stuff that doesn’t satiate my curiosity at all. It’s honestly making me quite miserable, and not only am I sick of just studying purely for exams, it has made me question my choice of being in law school (or in university at all) significantly.

Thoughts of dropping out have been popping into my head fairly frequently, but the only problem is that I don’t have ANY clue on what i’ll do at all if I actually quit. I know that I can do well if I actually put my head down and work for it, but I’m having a huge difficulty doing so. People around me are all studying really hard, albeit for different reasons, most of them are motivated to either get a good GPA or become a lawyer with status in the future.

To me, those aren’t really meaningful goals to have, and I’m not even sure what goal I need to have in order to motivate me to work hard... here I am questioning why I’m in law school, why am I even working hard or why I should even work hard. My thoughts are everywhere, and I have been trying hard to get a grip on myself but it has been futile so far.

Am a fairly new reddit user so not sure what to expect, but I do hope to hear some of your thoughts on what I should do to get myself out of this situation. Thanks!! 

P.S. I’m an INTJ, so not sure whether that will help...",05Nov2019,2

418,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons.

For context, I'm a 20+ year-old girl.

For the last few years, I have been sporadically meeting with a certain therapist on my college campus.  To keep it simple, I'll call her Jane.  Jane was recommended to me when someone at the counseling center noticed that I wasn't making a lot of progress with my then therapist (who was awesome and compassionate, but not really equipped to help me through the specific trauma I was working through).  The lady who led me to Jane's office for the first time smiled and told me that Jane was 'very special', and very hard to reach.

The lady was right.  Jane was absolutely special - she had that special ingredient that was missing in all the other therapists I had met with before.  Over the last few months, visiting her has started to feel more like seeing a family friend.  Of course, there were some things she was not perfect in, but she offered perspectives and insights that helped me move on in a way that no one else quite had before.

But something recently happened that made me feel a little gross.

As time went on, I noticed that Jane started to relax around me.  She went from meticulously honing in on her notepad to casually sipping her tea and jotting notes only every so often.  She seems much less stiff (although she never really was) and lounges in her chair more easily.  This makes sense, I figured - I am much more physically relaxed, too.

She started sharing a little bit more about her personal life.  I thought, this is okay - shes using her own circumstances to make me reconsider where Im at.  At some point, though, she also started the habit of rubbing her neck while speaking to me - and then her collar bones.  At first, it wasn't very noticeable - I figured it was just a mindless habit.  I tend to hold my jaw and rub it at random; maybe this was her own random, similar tic.  But over time, it started to last a little longer, and it became slower.  It began to look vaguely sensual, but I told myself that i was just being gross and misconstruing a simple habit.

And then there was our last visit.  Jane and I sat down normally, sipping on our drinks and talking.  We spent some time catching up, and she spent an unusual amount of time talking about her personal life.  Ordinarily, Im not opposed to those moments where she drops off a random detail (e.g. Jane saying something like *Sorry I had to reschedule last week, I went to my home country with my husband to see our daughter - it was nice* ), but this moment felt especially long, and I found myself wondering how much time would be left to actually talk about  the thing I came in for.  

While we were talking, she had a pen in her hand.  She began to rub it around her neck, and I tried not to pay too much attention to it while it was my turn to talk.

And then, at some point, she slid it down her collar bones and began to place it *between her breasts*.  At the risk of being vulgar, Ill have to mention that Jane is very, very well-endowed, so it was a pretty surprising and obvious thing.  All of this happened while she maintained unwavering eye contact with me as I was speaking.  I felt my gut turn sour, and I tried my hardest to pretend that my instincts weren't screaming at me to look away.  

At some point, Jane sort of woke up and stopped it completely.  Our talk wound up going the normal route and ended as pleasant as usual.  But I left her office feeling incredibly, utterly gross, like something was viscerally wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so confused.  A part of me does not feel comfortable meeting with her again, and Im not sure who to speak to about this.  What makes it worse is that she is known by some of my friends (and even my church) for being a competent, kind therapist.  Am I just blowing this out of proportion.

I don't know if its relevant *at* ***all***, but over the last few visits, I've started to clarify my sexuality a bit more on the forms they make us do every so often before our visits.  On paper, I basically went from *Confused and possibly asexual* to *Bisexual, but not doing anything remotely* *sexual* and rated myself as being slightly concerned over my sexuality.  Jane has yet to mention the change, which is weird, because she is usually super perceptive/quick to point out change.  Another alarming thing was that what Jane didnt even trigger my usual boob-loving instincts - it just made me feel scared.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**   Therapist I really like has started to rub herself during our talks, and recently stuck a pen between her breasts at my last visit.  It made me feel super weird.  I cant tell if I am just blowing this out of proportion.",05Nov2019,7

421,"I live in a dorm with 5 other people. There are 4 bedrooms, two house two while the other two are singles. I pay for a single because I enjoy privacy and am financially blessed to be able to afford it. I work full-time and am a student full-time. I also work night-shift and my hours are unconventional to say the least. I wake up at 5pm at the earliest.

I made all of this abundantly clear the first time I met everyone and everyone was extremely kind and considerate. For the first two weeks.

One of my roommates, for privacy sake we can call him Ryan, was the RA for our floor. So I thought sweet, he will be perfect to help keep the peace if there's an issue. Nope. This dude got fired from being an RA a month in for drinking and smoking with underage kids, my other roommates. I'm of consenting age but was away during the time he got caught. 

Before he was caught and stripped of his RA status he had been the sole perpetratorn of waking me up and I brought it up constantly, including the signed roommate agreement by everyone that I needed some extra quiet hours during the day. He always apologized but kept at it the next day.

Well, he gets caught and forced to move out due to the underage shenanigans. Now, he lives ELSEWHERE but still comes by every day and is even more obnoxiously loud. He pays no rent now and I am at my wits end. I want to report this but he is extremely close with all of the other RAs and faculty. It's gotten so bad I want to give an ultimatum but I know the other roommates wouldnt take my side. A side effect of my hours are I never became close with the other guys, though we still say hello and are kind enough when we do cross paths. If I ask him not to visit they would almost definitely veto it. 

Do I have any recourse here? I don't leave for a minimum of two months and they are so loud it bleeds through the wall, ear plugs, and a heavy pillow I hold over my head while I try to sleep.

We were surprised when they said that we have to submit a medical certificate every consultation and every semester. 

After that, we have the consultation last Saturday. The doctor still didn't let me give certificate but instead gave a medical clearance. The start of classes was yesterday, but the late enrollment is still ongoing until November 16. The doctors from the school still didn't let me enroll because they need the certificate and the psychiatrist saying that 'The patient is clear to go back to school' or something.

I've tried to apply as like a waiter or something but they take one look at me and never call me back despite my best effort because tbfh no one wants me to represent their business to the customers even if I'm doing my best to be cheerful and I can't really blame them. 

I need to be able to contribute more than I can on disability but I literally qualify for nothing (hence disability I guess) and I don't know what to do now when we can't afford rent and bills and groceries.

429,"TL;DR at the bottom

Background: So lately at my work when we close at night the expected amounts are not matching up with what we actually count. I suspect that this is actually a system error since we use an app that frequently crashes as well as our inability to give debit refunds forcing us to give them in cash. Whenever I have noticed we are short on the register it is a day that we have done one of these strange debit/cash refunds and it the shortage is almost always the same amount as the earlier refund. It is always the cash that is short upon counting as well. I always tell my boss when I find a discrepancy and often try to find some other kind of justification for the short amount but I always seem to circle back to our faulty refund system. Two days ago this really became a problem as we were short around 85$ two days in a row (I was only working for one of these days) and both days we had one of these odd refunds. This time my boss posted a long paragraph in our work group chat saying that this needs to stop, which obviously it does, but he seems to refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it could be a system error. More or less he said that people are either giving back too much change or stealing from the register. So apparently in his mind the only option is that we’re idiots who can’t count or thieves. 

Finally on to the actual question: I am concerned that I am going to field the blame for this as I have a fair amount of shifts and definitely close the most. Each time I inform my boss of a shortage he has become increasingly more accusatory towards me. I guess since I am the bearer of the bad news he has been taking his (understandable) frustration out on me.  I am just wondering how I can protect myself from getting the blame for something I did not do?

TL;DR When closing the register at work there have frequently been discrepancies between expected amounts and what is counted. I close the register the most and therefore I am worried I’m going to take the blame for this problem (whether it be someone stealing or a system error). How can I protect myself from this happening?",05Nov2019,1

The second time we met, it felt like we are good friends and it wasn't awkward.

But the thing is, lately he seems to be uninterested in me. He rarely messages me, unlike before. He also leaves me on delivered and he always fall asleep while we are on the midst of our conversation. Honestly, this makes me upset. Maybe because i'm already invested, but i'm still denying it??

He also jokes about how he wants me to take care of him and such, but later sends me a photo of him with a girl leaning on his shoulders. I wasn't sure what that meant, and I don't know how to react--given that we don't have any label or such. I even told him that I can't continue talking to him because I feel like we aren't on the same page, but he told me that he enjoy talking to me. And that he was just busy with all his personal stuff and he's that kind of person. But I thought, if he really likes me, then maybe he would show it.

It is also worth noting that I've never felt stressed before over someone ignoring me. I didn't feel this way in my past partner because he was the possessive one. So it really upsets me that I experience such confusing situation.

What would be the best thing to do about this? Because I seriously feel stressed about it and it's not helping me. Help?",05Nov2019,3
432,"okay so let me explain the situation here. 

&amp;#x200B;

my sister has been self-harming for the past 2 years, constantly cutting her arm (not the wrist) although the cuts aren't deep or anything it still caught my parents attention and they are obviously worried for her. She refuses to see a psychatrist saying that, "" I am not crazy why would i see a doctor""

&amp;#x200B;

she blames her self-harming on stress instead due to her currently having O-levels A (an asian exam to get a certificate for admission to the next stage of schooling, iirc this is the asian highschool). Though this is not the case as she started self-harming even before her exams started. She also attempted suicide last year , by over-dosing of sleeping pills. She never told us why and the reason was unclear.

&amp;#x200B;

early this year, we had a trip to Osaka planned (My aunt, my 12 year-old cousin(F), my sister and I). But after this O-levels incident my parents decided to review their decision to let her go. Upon hearing the news, my sister threaten them, ""if you guys dont let me go, ill kill myself"" and even called my mother crazy. But my parents weren't angry they confirmed with me if i wanted to go Osaka as they wanted me to look after her.

&amp;#x200B;

my aunt definitely can't handle her, my 12 year old cousin is the very defination of a boomer.

&amp;#x200B;

so here is the dilemma im facing. 

&amp;#x200B;

if I dont go, my sister can't go as well my parents made this really clear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

but if i go i definitely can't and won't enjoy myself. Not mentioning im the only male in this trip, the dangers of going overseas with a unstable sister and there is probably more implications i have not thought of.

&amp;#x200B;

soo do i go or not ?

436,"Sorry this ended up longer than expected, I'm rambling. tldr at bottom. Also apologies for any formatting as I'm using mobile.

Okay so, It sounds pathetic but I guess that's because it kind of is... like a lot of people I've had a lot of social media accounts throughout my teens/20's (am now 23f) including a personal Twitter and Instagram page, a separate page on each for my art and then a personal Facebook, YouTube, Reddit etc.

The biggest thing for me to delete was my art accounts. I did this about a week ago after years of consistent posting because I really felt like it was hindering my enjoyment and ability when it came to creating, mostly because I would log on, see no increase in likes or followers and be bombarded with jealousy over other people's work and just start to feel worthless. Whilst I was at it I went ahead and deleted my personal pages too, again, because of how much I started to hate that I relied on strangers validation of my vanity. 

I don't know if it's just because I grew up a bit or because I find myself in a more fulfilling lifestyle now; But either way, I just had a sudden realisation of how unhealthy my social media use was and how much it dictated my mood. On one hand it feels like a good decision for mental health but on the other hand I'm like.. well what now?

Especially with my love for art and fashion. I was always sharing my work, outfits, makeup, photographs etc. I'm now in a place where it feels like if I'm not going to be sharing my work.. what's the point in doing it at all? I really can't get it out of my head that there's no point drawing, no point picking out a nice outfit or spending an hour doing a cool makeup look if I'm not gonna post it anywhere for people to see. and I really hate that about myself. I miss 5-7 years ago when I would do all these things just for my own enjoyment and that was enough. So I'm really looking for advice on how to just start enjoying the things I enjoyed again? How can I get over this dependence on social media and likes and validation? I feel like I just need reassurance that this was a good decision.

tldr; deleted my personal and art social media accounts, now not sure what the point of doing art or taking photos in general is. plz help.",05Nov2019,1

441,"I'm asexual and likely aromantic as well. For those who don't know, asexual means I'm not sexually attracted to anyone and aromantic means I'm not romantically attracted to anyone. Normally, this doesn't bother me at all. I go through life without dating or feeling attracted to people, and I just content myself with friendships. But I've been struggling a little. 

You see, my sister is getting married. Her fiancee is like her best friend and romantic partner all rolled into one. And while I'm so happy for her, I'm also really envious. I want what she has. I want the excitement and joy of planning a wedding, and getting together with loved ones and celebrating a union. I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who's weirdness matches my weirdness. I want a friend who will never leave, who will come with me to events and laugh with me at bad movies and hug me when I'm feeling sad. Basically, I've discovered that I love the concept of romantic attraction, but I've never felt it, and there's a good chance I never will.

Sure, I might realize somewhere down the line that I'm grey-ace/aro (ace and aro most of the time but with the occasional exception), but it isn't likely to happen. I want to feel romantic attraction to someone. I want to fall in love, to propose or get proposed to, to have a wedding where my friends and family come to celebrate, to not worry about dying alone one day. But that isn't me.

Ever since about a year or so I have been getting extremely irritated whenever I am around my mother. This is due to the fact that she literally sits in a chair all day (well actually not sitting, more like laying down in an extremely terrible posture), smoking every half an hour and drinking about 7 bottles of beer every day (2 in afternoon, 5 between dinner and bed).

I am approx. 18 years old and trying to live a healthy lifestyle. I eat healthy, work my ass off for school and my own business and hit the gym often. But whenever I come home and I see her laying in her chair scrolling Facebook with a beer on her side table it literally demotivates me for everything and I get so annoyed. The only thing she literally eats/drinks all day is barely anything but a family dinner, coffee, beer and some processed snacks before bed.

I really want to tell her that she is destroying her whole life and that it's really hurting me too mentally, but I don't want to as she will just get angry. She is always complaining about how her back hurts so much, but she is literally laying in a chair with a rounded back the whole damn day, no shit that will happen. 

If I want I could literally move out and rent an appartment within a week, but I don't want to yet. I am trying to solve this situation but I have no idea what to do, it's literally making me more sad every day. Whenever I ask her to watch a movie or anything she just says ""Watch what you want, I am busy doing other stuff"". The other stuff is literally scrolling on her tablet which she has already done for over 8 hours that day.

What should I do? Should I just be straight up and tell her that I can't take this anymore? Should I keep quiet and move out?

448,"Dear Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I’m Ben. I’m 25 and I import shoes from around the world and sell them to brick and mortar retailers throughout the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

With the growth of Amazon and online retail, my business has been steadily declining. (For those who may not know, Amazon is mainly comprised of sellers who list their products on its marketplace and Amazon takes a commission on the sale. For example, I list my shoes on Amazon.com, someone buys the shoes from my Amazon store and Amazon keeps a percentage of the sale.)

&amp;#x200B;

My closest competitor, Vito, whom I dislike very much, saw the same decline in his sales four years ago and decided to move the majority of his business from brick and mortar retail to selling directly on Amazon. Selling on Amazon is a bit tricky so Vito hired a data scientist ,Steve, at 200K a year and a bonus of 5% on all profit earned, to analyze which shoes sell best and how to list and price the shoes to maximize profit on Amazon. Steve knocked it out of the park. With an initial investment from Vito of 500k, he grew the business to 15 Million dollars in total sales and five million dollars in total profit in less than 4 years. Over that 4 year period, Vito got a bit greedy and while keeping to the 200k a year salary, he decided to not pay Steve his bonus of 250k. Yeah I know Vito is a dumb ass but hey money makes people do dumb shit. Needless to say Steve was pissed and started looking around for another opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Now meet Asher. I know Asher through a friend. Asher knows a ton of people in various industries and loves connecting them and making money off the intros. Asher is very good at what he does but has one Issue. He doesn’t specify his required commission before making an intro. He simply makes them, expects to be paid if they work out and then gets very aggressive when negotiating his commission. Asher once introduced me to a big shoe buyer named Joe. Joe and I did some business and I made over half a million dollars in profit from that one intro. I was young and dumb and had terrible negotiating skills and was convinced by Asher to give over 15% of all profit earned on any business done with Joe, for life. The deal only lasted 5 months, but I paid Asher out almost 100k for simply introducing me to one shoe buyer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Back to our story….

&amp;#x200B;

Steve is pissed at his former boss Vito for not paying him his 250K bonus. He bumps into Asher at a trade show and tells him about what a dick his boss is and that he’s looking for new gig. Sensing an opportunity to make another good intro, Asher immediately phones me… “Ben, what’s up its Asher… You know your competitor, Vito”? Well The guy who built his Amazon business from zero to 25 million is looking for a new gig. Do you want to meet him”? “Hell yes!!” I reply, “Send me his number and I’ll set something up.”

&amp;#x200B;

I meet Steve a week later. We immediately hit it off and decide to partner together. The structure would be as follows. I would open an Amazon store and give Steve access to all my shoe suppliers. Steve would be responsible for predicting what to buy, and ensuring the shoes would sell well on Amazon. (Don’t forget Steve has a proven track record. He did the same thing for Vito and made a ton of money) I’d be responsible for funding the inventory and maintaining the supplier relationships. He’d get 30% of the business and I’d keep 70%.

&amp;#x200B;

Steve and I are both Happy. His sales are at 700k in the last 4 months and we are on track to do another million this holiday season. So far so good…

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to our good friend Asher. He sees the partnership between Steve and I is working out well and now wants his share of the Pie. Keep in mind that:

&amp;#x200B;

He never mentioned a specific amount he wanted to be paid.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not put up any money nor will he in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

What should Asher be paid for his involvement in the deal? Should I pay him a one-time fee? Should I pay him a commission?

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know where to start and I don’t want to give away 15% like last time. If there is anyone with expertise in deal structuring or anyone with any interesting ideas or thoughts, I’d love to hear from you as I’d like to finalize with Asher this by Friday.",05Nov2019,1

I (21F) just realized I give so much importance to appearance. Not in a way that I only care about looks (mine or others), but I just notice other people’s face and bodies so much that I end up putting myself down, because I always see myself as uglier than others. 
In my rational mind, I know this is stupid and there are so many more important traits than the superficial ones, but I just don’t know how I stop looking at other (women especially) and thinking “wow, she’s so pretty. I’ll never look like her.” And then, things get even more deep, and I start to have thoughts like “Why is my BF with me? He would much rather be with that lady. She’s his type”, etc.
My bf makes it very clear to me that he is attracted to me and thinks I’m gorgeous. And he also emphasizes that he isn’t with me (only) because of my looks, but because he likes who I am. 
I just can’t handle anymore looking at every women around me and comparing myself. I know that I’m insecure and that I need therapy, but unfortunately, in my country therapy is a “luxury” and I can’t afford it right now. 
If you guys could give me advices on how to stop focusing on appearance and comparing myself, I would really appreciate it!

455,"Throwaway account here. Please bear with me! 

I wasn't ready for college upon graduating high school. I didn't want my family to spend $$$ (they are paying for me) when I had no idea what the hell I wanted to do. I really wanted to take a gap year to explore several different jobs and experiment with classes at the local community college, but my parents were quick to whisk me off. The summer before college I found that I had a great knack for flipping stuff on Ebay, and made some solid money (4k profit a month) dropshipping. I was reading business books left and right and soaked everything up like a sponge. Come college time, I found myself extremely stressed balancing out time spent on my business and schoolwork, but it gave me the chance to directly compare the two side by side. I honestly found college to be like highschool 2.0 and quit after my first year (parents were real thrilled!) and my parents threatened me saying that they are willing to pay for school, but should I choose otherwise, I'm on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Under my parents' pressure I changed to a more specialized business school (no gen eds and stuff like that) but I still felt the same way I did at my old school. That so much time and money is being wasted in this rat race for grades with things that I could most definitely, being a business major, learn for free online. I was much happier working on my laptop for hours on end. Work was work, and that was it. No papers, studying for tests, fucking drunk frat parties next door, etc, and on top of that, I was getting loads of practical experience and earning money. I've had a few bumps in the road in my business, but they were excellent learning opportunities that I could reapply in real time. In school I constantly feel like I'm just reading, memorizing, only to spit it out on a piece of paper to get the highest score possible, only to forget the content you studied a week later, and never truly putting the principles into practice. I know that a career in business and running my own is what I want to do, but is the degree really the best way to go about it?  After some time to reflect, this is the story I have going on in my mind: I know that the reason I didn't turn down school and go full out on my biz is that I'm scared. I'm scared my parents will reject me and should my business fail, one month later or ten years later, and then I'm out on the streets. If a degree makes my parents happy and gives me that financial security net, that's what makes me feel safe. I have always had the sinking suspicion that college may not be it for me, even if my parents are willing to pay for it. And at the same time, I feel fucking guilty and awful that my parents are spending their hard earned money on my education, only for me to quit. Should I just get my head straight and plow through? Or would it be best to man up and go my own way? Thank you all so much in advance.",05Nov2019,2

I am a college student in the US away from my family and everyone.

I been feeling down for a long time and always kept it deep down until last year when it went too extreme that I went to get a professional help at my school where I went to a school psychologist and was excused that semester.

I didn't go home because the idea of going back to my controlling family would make feel sick and in a worst shape. Everything was ok at the begining of the treatment it was like 5 sessions, but I noticed all they were just say hi and never talked about real problems and lost money. 

Now I am back again feeling worst than ever and trying my best not to rely on drugs and alcohol at all. I feel as if I am getting more and more comfortable on the idea to end it all or to run away from everything.

I am mostly writing this because this is my 2nd night that I can't sleep or keep waking up and I don't have anyone here I can talk to and psychologists are expensive. The only thing that keeps me ok are my cats, but this semester is close to end and I am not doing well.

465,"   I don’t know if any of you will read this. But if you take your time to do so thank you.
  I have been in a relationship for about a year and 8 months. my boyfriend went to collage this year a month ago. He started his first year of collage. Which is about 5 hours away from me.
 Our relationship had ups and downs. Times where he was struggling cause of addiction. But thankfully he overcame it. Other then those simple arguments we had our relationship was happy and I’d say healthy. No one was abusive or a cheater. But 2 days ago he came back to his hometown to see me and his family/friends.  I saw him this Friday and it felt beautiful we talked laughed I was so happy to see him. He gifted me a small bear. As night fell he was off to see his friends and we were supposed to see each other the next day. That same Friday night he texted me first. He dosent usually do that unless he’s feeling emotional or if he’s under the influence of alcohol or weed. Which him going out with his friends definitely meant he had something.  He texted me saying “ hey you up?” Spamming the chat box with cute pet names he’d call me. And I woke uo I lied I didn’t sleep. Then we talked for a bit and he said he was off to bed. He then said “ I love you see you tomorrow “ I said the same then he said “ I love you, I miss you.” 

Then tomorrow we meet up around 6pm in front of my building he hugged me and I felt something was off his heart was beating really fast. When he said we needed to talk I already knew.
 Basically he said the distance between us is hard. He said he Dosent wanna drag me anymore or make it seem like he was lying he kept saying he was so grateful and he loved every memory and he Said if he could do it all again he’d do it. He kept putting his arms around me. Crying like me. He also bought me water and we laughed through tears about sad jokes. Even in pain we laughed together. 
He said he wanted to stay friends I said I didn’t wanna lose him out of my life and he gripped onto my hand holding it. He said he needed some time before we can talk or well see each other again. 
He said a bunch of things I understood but at the same time I didn’t.
Never in my life I thought if two people love each other they can also have their end. 
 That hurts the most that I won’t get to hold him talk to him I don’t even know when will I see him again.
  his sister is my friend and she told me before going to the bus to collage he hugged his sister and said “ take care of Rita for me” (which is me) 
I don’t get it I get it why we
Can’t be together distance is hard. You can’t see them, and you can’t focus on anything. A lot of things can happen cause of distance.
  But at the same time.. man I love you. It’s clear you have feelings for me too. So why are you doing this.

This decision he made he did it for us. But how is this helping now when I am crying every two seconds? How is this helping us now when I feel him I’m connected to him I know I am. 
 I wish I could know what he’s thinking and does he care still? I don’t want him to just move on. 
 I am overwhelmed I don’t know how to cope with myself. 
I’ll be fine for like 2 hours then I’ll breakdown.
Our town the places the songs.. memories.
My phone the pictures.
The bears I have the clover leaf necklace I’m wearing he gave to me.

I’m not sure but I think he still has a sheep keychain I gave to him.
I think he has that for his dorm room.

I keep firing him everywhere I go but I can’t seem to like find him.

        Where is he? What’s he doing. 
All I know is I want him here just next to me.",05Nov2019,1
466,"This might be not as problematic as the other posts. I grew up in a family household where I'm scared from my parents, it's to the point where I'd rather be alone, I loved them but we don't have the perfect history, I remember when I was younger (maybe 14) I have to go to school and my uniform was not yet clean (my parents do our laundry back then) I went downstairs planning to wash it then dry it in the dryer, but my father was already sorting out the white and colored clothes (A normal person would ask my father to do my uniform first) but what I did back then, I took the uniform from the spinning washing machine (while my father was away) and wash it myself then dried it with an electric fan, (which is not efficient) then I got to school with wet clothes, they found out about it they called me ""Retarded"" ""Dumb fuck"" it hurt me back then, I was not retarded but only scared to them that I don't bother them for anything. I don't do my homeworks when I was younger because I don't know how to do them and I'm just too shy to talk to my parents about it.

Like I said, we don't have the perfect history.
My father is accused of having a mistress way too many times, but not to the point of divorcing
My father used to kick my head when I can't read the analog clock.
My father beat me with a pencil case for losing way too many pencils and many more
It's traumatic for me, that whatever they do to make me happy, I remember those days
Hell, I can't even look at them straight in the eye

I'm not this timid when it comes to school with my friends, I even joined an impromptu speech

471,"Before I begin this is my first time in this sub so please excuse any weird mistakes on my end. 

I'm 15 and live in Australia. 

\-For about 6 months now ive had issues with depression and suicidal thoguhts. I have been seeing a child psychologist who has gotten me to do a shit ton of quizes and stuff and ultamtly reccons ive got depression and a few other unrelated things. She is going to try and get me on meds but as time goes on that seems to be a long way away. Additonaly ive bene diagonesed by another doctor that i have ADD. 

\- More onto my experience with the depression side of stuff. Every few days my 'mood' would basicly jump of a cliff. I would feel like complete shit, think about slitting my wrist, what i would write on a note and who i would give it to. I would then have trouble finding enjoyment in shit I would usualy find fun. For example, I realy love playing that shitty game Overwatch so I would play that to chill out. When I was in one of these 'states' I just took off my headset and started crying. Now I think about it i've started crying a lot more as a result of this shit.

\- Then there is school. My experince at school has been a ride of ups and lows, most of the time at low points. I experienced a bit of bullying throught my ealyer times at high school but realy that isn't an issue for me at the moment. Its not like I don't have friends at school but I am deffinetly not friends with everyone. In my grade of about 250 kids i would get along with about 50 of them. The rest of which would give me weird looks and shit throught the day and just ignore me. Another 50 of them would be straight up cunts. Again, as an example I was minding my own bussines today in class when one came up and said 'no one in the grade fucking likes you'. Now this is not knew news for (I accepted that quite a while ago) but even so I still felt like someone had punched me in the stomach for the rest of the day. 

\-Home life isn't to bad, my perants care for me but can be controling cunts sometimes. Each night they will for instance lock up my phone (which for most people isn't that bad) but I have blatently told them I need it so that throught the realy bad nights I wont 'spiral out of control' but they either dont give a fuck or don't listen when I explain it. 

What am I asking advice for? What the fuck I am ment to do. 

I know that next 2 years will be realy fucking bad. There are quite a few events coming up that will make my life living hell, sadly I can't elaborate on them because I would basicly be dosing myself. I know there is a chance that I wont make it through these years but oh well. There are several other schools in the area I could go to but doing so could make shit worse for me (mightn't make friends ect allthought now i think about it this isn't realy a bad idea (although my brother who gos to the school i currently go to would cop a fair bit of shit)). Ive also been concidering just digthing school altogether to go to do prac work or something. Then there is the final solution.

I know this probally seems like im living to some of you out there who have been to hell and well yeah im sure your right.

Less than a week ago we returned from a week-long family visit to another country. during the time away we had employed some builders to redo our hallway. However, upon returning home we discovered that our brand new table had a rectangular mark stretching across the entire time, the mark measured around 1m wide and 2m long. Today we met with the builders and they flat up refused to believe that anything they did could have caused our table to be damaged in such a way that is displayed those marks. The builder's claims that the table was cheap, badly made and from bad materials, however the place we bought it from claims its 100% real oak and is made in the best way possible.  The markings are really obvious and the builders are refusing to pay to say it was not them even though they were the only ones who were in the house at all during the week-long building.

I know we are married but I don’t want to buy him something that big. 1. He’s NEVER gotten me anything like that 2. We never go on dates 3. He told me that I should have just given him custody when I tried to divorce him during the first separation, instead of trying to fix our marriage. Since I told him I was unhappy today. 4. I told him that I wanted us to evolve together. NO, he told me only 26 year olds look for spirituality. Yoga etc. he told me to marry someone my own age. He’s just into video games and that’s his chill time. 5. He refuses to quit weed with me. He says I’m an addict (that’s why I’’ve stopped smoking, it doesn’t match my vibration any longer) and I want him to be on the same wavelength 6. He told me his parents don’t do things together either. They both do their own thing and then watch tv together. (I’m almost positive his step dad is having an affair. He’s always on business trips) 7. Even when the bank account is flushed with my money. He’s still not happy. I’ve literally lost every inheritance check, letting him be in charge.

480,"Hi, I'm a medical student, studying medicine stuff this and that and hated being in this career even since before going to college. I always know that I don't like medicine, I don't want to be a doctor. I'm from a doctor family. I was always a well-behaved kid, never cheated on an exam, have decent grades in high school, rarely swear(yeah I was kind of a nerd), not having much courage to rebel. My parents obviously wanted me to study in medschool. I know they have good intention, doctors having stable job and money. I told them I don't want to be a doctor, any job but doctor, every single day when I'm in high school, maybe that was not enough.  


ok now I'm in the med school. My grades went downhill, like really really uglily. Every subjects I got C or D or something like that and always be the slowest in class. There was a time that my friend discussing cases and I just sit there, in silence, understand nothing. I never felt like I'm a doctor, never really want to felt like one. Everyone of my friends know that I'm an art person among these doctors, even some of the professor knows. I've experienced many panic attack, mental breakdown, chronic sleep deprivation. Those things every medical students are destined to faced one day (which is messed up enough). Even someone who was very determined to be a good doctor can be destroyed by these medical study courses.   


Fast forward to now(I don't want this to be too long), All my colleagues already graduated for a few years now. I'm still stuck in this hole. The rule is that if I don't passed their exams, I have to retake it over and over and over again. Luckily I managed to fight though these hell and I got only 1 exam to passed to graduate. It is hopeful I'm not disagreeing. The thing is this exam is like a last boss. I have taken it for 6 times and failed every times. I tried every method, having my parents, my professors to tutor me, or even got a paid online course exclusively for this exam.  


I was always a positive person. I believed that hard work and accomplished anything, I still do, but this thing, this exam, it's one of the few times I felt absolutely hopeless. To add a cherry on top of this stink cake. My med school decided that it would be a good idea to added more requirement for a medstudent to graduate(so that the longer I was stuck in this school, there will be more new exams for me to pass. The ""1 last boss"" thing for me was not that true anymore)  


 After these years that I'm away from the ""panda-eyed medical student routine"" I got more time to do to thing I absolutely love, ART. I really want to get serious about it. I took so many art courses and met so many people that truly in-sync with me. I practiced croquis and writing comics like, a whole lot!! I love telling stories. I think after I escaped from the medical school I'll find a collage to study art seriously, I want to be better, I want people to comment on my work, I want to improve.  


My current state. It's been 9 years since I entered medschool. Nowadays I don't have to do any medical practice anymore, just stayed at home preparing for exams. I want to pass to graduate. It's like it's so close, but I also dont care that much if I never graduated from a medschool and never be a doctor(quite contradictory for myself). Everytime I tried studying I felt nauseous and sick. I'm so sick of studying medicine. I can't stand it for 10 minutes. maybe it's PTSD. I actually don't want to feel all of this. If I keep getting sick from studying how can I pass this exam (an exam that even you did your best, still not guaranteed to pass. it's very hard) . I just can't seem to find a way to be peaceful with medicine after all I've been though. I made this thread because it's 1 month till the exam and I planned so much to study, setting schedules and failed miserably doing the actual study. I felt trapped in life. I'm almost 30 now and I still don't feel that my life has even started.

482,"So I (17f) was invited by my boyfriend's family to spend Thanksgiving and the following weekend with them at their ranch out of town. This sort of thing has never happened to me before, and I feel so honored and happy that they would even consider offering me something like that, and I really think it would be a good way of getting out of my comfort zone and getting to know his family better.
However, Thanksgiving is my mom's favorite day of the year. Every year we watch the Macy's parade together on the couch and make all the side dishes while my dad cooks the turkey. We always light our Christmas tree that night. Holidays mean a lot to me, too, and this may be my last Thanksgiving at home before I move out. The thing is, my parents got a divorce over the summer, and my mom has been antagonizing my dad ever since. They can't sit in the same room together for longer than 20 minutes. (She's also starting dating other men and won't stop talking about them around me and barely let's me get a word in. She's sort of turned into my roommate, instead of my mom.)
I ended up getting the weekend off work (surprising, right?) and told my boyfriend that yes, I could come, and I was really looking forward to it. But this morning when I woke up I felt so unbelievably guilty about abandoning my mother on her favorite holiday that I thought I was going to throw up. 
If I did stay for Thanksgiving, I know it wouldn't be anything like it used to be. My family is pretty much broken. But I feel so awful leaving my mom alone on her favorite holiday, and I don't want to abandon all of my favorite traditions with my family. 
Should I call it off and stay with my family?

Tinder, Badoo and other dating apps are really not my thing, mainly because EVERY single experience I've had with those apps have been HORRIBLE. Guys not looking like they do on the pictures, our personalities don't match or something is just off. 

I barely go to parties at all mostly because I don't have any friends who throws parties, I never go to the club because I prefer to just chill, play video games and smoke weed. 

It's getting a bit frustrating cause I haven't had any action in a very very long time and slowly but surely it has been bothering me more than I thought it would. I feel like I'm starting to forget how to find someone, how ridiculous it might sound..

I’ve been at my second job for 8 months now. I can say this 100% honestly if it was for my few friends and small family I would have killed myself by now.

I’m writing this on the way to work. I want to cry thinking about it. It’s a good job, not too stressful and an exceptionally high pay. (£9.20 an hour) 

I feel so left out by my colleagues they can easily have conversations with their backs turned. Speak to each other outside of work etc. And I’m not involved at all.

I’ve suffered with depression, anxiety, ocd and ptsd for about 5 years now. (Not self diagnosed)

I’ve been looking for a new job but I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m stuck in a rut and can see exactly how my life will play out.

Please give advice.",05Nov2019,3

502,"so i just recently moved in with my dad and i slowly began realizing why we left him in the first place. 
my dad refuses to cook or clean, or buy food. he believes i should pay for it since i have a good paying job at walmart. as soon as i get home from an 8 hour shift i am forced to cook for us  while not having any time for homework, or even time to just sit down. along with that he refuses to let me quit my job because “it is more important to have a job rather than happiness” although i’m only 16.
being around him makes me miserable. he constantly yells and cusses and whenever i try to speak out he tells me to shut up because “i’m a woman and i have no say in anything”
he always tells me that he’s ashamed of me and he rarely helps me in any way.
maybe i’m overthinking it? i haven’t been able to talk to anyone about it because nobody seems to really pay attention or i get responses like “i told you so” 
i’m so tired of feeling like i have to take care of him. i never exactly understood why my mom left him, but now it’s extremely clear. i hate living wjth him but i know if i left he would text me every day saying stuff like “you will regret leaving me when i die” and “i hope god allows me to haunt you when i die” it’s like i’m trapped and i’m too afraid to do anything because i’m always putting my family’s feelings first but i’ve become so tired of him always putting me down.

504,"So as I have entered into my late 20's friends are harder and harder to come by. You are just not in the situation to make friends as easy as when you were in school. So for the past year or so I have made sure to keep a pretty strong friendship going with my wife's best friends and there husbands. The group normally hangs out a lot together.  


So our group of 3 couples has been hanging out for 7 years together and in the past year things begin to seem off. One of the couples never wants to hang and seems to only  to want to be around us when we are the last option of friends to hang out with. The other couple is pretty neutral. So it just seems like this distance is growing. I didn't want to seem like the uncool or unpopular option. So I would try to really befriend the husbands and have fun activities going, but it didnt seem to matter. This distance continued to grow.   


So we are well known that if a big trip is planned that we are always down to go, but recently through  social media we saw the more distant couple out camping. No problem seems fun. ""Guess they wanted to be alone or hangin out with another friend group?"" That is no probelm, but later in the night my wife shows me that they are out with the other neutral couple. So pretty much our 7 year group minus me and my wife. I felt very hurt. We are always down to hang and be apart of the group, but were not invited. More than anything this just hurt my feelings. It seems like they planned a fun hangout and chose not to invite me and my wife.  


So months before this all happening we had planned to go on a trip to Chicago with the neutral couple. So now after this trip we didnt get invited to I feel very cold to the neutral couple. My wife plans to ask her best friend once they are alone in person and get a reason to maybe we were not invited. But I cannot seem to shake a feeling of betrayel. Just bummed over all.   


I am noramlly a pretty sensitive person. I try not to take things personally and have gotten better. I guess the reason this hurts is because its an old friend group and the last people i expected to not really want to hang out with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how should I act on this Chicago trip. I want to just ignore the other couple and just enjoy my trip with my wife, but not sure if im just being overly sensitive. Should I just kind of act like the trip that we didnt get invited to never happened and act like everything is fine? . I know this seems like a kind of jumbled story, but any advice is welcome.",05Nov2019,1

So I’m kinda stuck rn with this first world problem, I recently got told by my boss that I can buy anything I want under $200 over the weekend and he will add the money to my pay check. I’m super grateful for this because most of the time I don’t have that money to spend on myself.

So now I’m thinking of what to get and I thought I could buy 3 space heaters and give them to my family around my house since it gets freezing during winter, I thought this was a good idea but now I’m thinking “this is the a rare chance to have $200 to spend on yourself are you sure you want too spend it on stuff other people would be using?” I can’t really think of anything that I want besides a speaker for producing.

508,"I'm 24, and I'm on my fourth year of university. I hate studying at the uni more than anything, especially given how much time I spend commuting, it feels like I'm going to work, but without getting a paycheck. Because of this commute, I can't even land a part-time job, and I can't afford to move to the city I attend the university at. 

I got my BA degree last year and wanted to pursue some kind of office job in my city, so as to at least cut down on the commute, and actually get paid for spending my days at a place I hate. Sadly, all jobs at the entry level required a Master's degree, so I'm stuck here again, for two more years. Deep down, I expected this, but as usual I went into my job search with blind hope, and as usual got diddly squat in return.

I only have one passion in life - firearms. I love guns, I love shooting them, I love studying the way they work, I love researching their history, their use, the different models, the companies that manufacture them. I cannot find this level of engagement and excitement in anything else I've done so far. Of course, I have other interests - music, movies, video games, but nothing comes even close to sparking as much joy as guns.

Unfortunately, I live in Poland, where you need quite a bit of disposable income to jump through all the hoops to own guns and ammunition. This also makes finding a job where I could handle guns that much more difficult. There's a handful of shooting ranges around my area that I could try to apply for, but that requires going through courses in firearms safety and handling, and working at the range would be a full-time job, leaving me with no way of continuing my education.

I hear people saying that you should try to get a job that you're passionate about, so here comes my question - what should I do? Continue studying, get a Master's, try to get an office job and own guns as a hobby? Or risk wasting a year of education and try to get courses in gun handling and apply to work at a shooting range (which from my experience as a frequent customer looks very enjoyable)?",05Nov2019,6

512,"My elder sister, we'll call her Autumn, has always been a huge drag down on my life. Since I was growing up she would physically and mentally cause me distress, never leave me alone, etc. I blatantly remember when we were kids and she wanted me to shut up, she would cover my mouth and plug my nose and literally suffocate me. Now we are older, and I live with my father in a house, just us. I had a cat that I loved more than anything, named Zoey. I have no girlfriend and my friends and I sometimes argue, so Zoey was my rock that kept me going. She slept with me every night, always cuddled in my lap when I was on my computer, etc.

Anyways, in August I went to bed with Zoey at my side like always. I woke up, and she was just... gone. I searched the whole house for her, backyard, neighborhoods, everywhere. I got in my truck and drove around neighboring areas, nothing. Eventually, I gave up. It was really hard on me, not even knowing my cats fate. 

About a month passed, and I found out through Autumns ex that she STOLE MY CAT AND SOLD IT!

Are you fucking kidding me?

I was disgusted. I had such bad anxiety and depression I was throwing up. I couldn't believe my flesh and blood would do that. This was all months ago now. I haven't talked to her since, and I never want to again. The reason I'm here asking for advice is everyone in my family, including my mother and grandmother, are telling me to forgive her.

This time I have a friend who says I should move up north to them, and at first I was really excited. I mean I still am of course, as a kid I've always wanted to move up there where they live but the problem that keeps eating me is that this is a real scenario I have control over now instead of just in my head. Thinking about it more and more is starting to make me remember that I'll be by myself and no crutch to lean on, but on one hand I'll be around my friends and hopefully have a steady work ethic and flow.

He doesn't tip. Or leaves like two dollars on a $70 meal. 

It's mortifying to me as an American to think that these servers aren't getting tipped by us. And he won't let me pay because he's very old fashioned, which I appreciate... but I feel really bad for these waiters, since I fully support tipping really well for waiters.

The only problem I have is my mother. I'm 22 and living in a city it's kinda hard to find accomodation on my previous 0-hour contract before this new job. I sat down with her and explained parts of the contract and mentioned that I would have to work at home outside of office hours, she has a thing for turning the internet off when something she wants doesn't happen (Her partner lives here as well so it's not just me in the house), I mentioned that she wouldn't be able to turn the internet off in case I get asked to deal with some tickets from home and she hit the roof telling me ""I pay for the bills, don't you dare tell me what I can and can't do in my house"" as well as some other more colourful things. I pay board, I pay for the things I use. often a third of the bills because I don't want to freeload off her when I earn money. So it's now become a thing of, if I have to work from home, I have to rack a phone bill up just because I don't want to use her internet in case she goes off on one and turns it off halfway through something, But I can't get an internet connection of my own because then she wouldn't have control over it.

Basically, I’m changing catalogues and was going through what classes i would need to graduate, and found out that if I were to drop my minor (creative writing, 18 credits total)  i would be able to graduate a semester or so earlier than planned (winter 2020) 

My dilemma comes in the form of me wanting to graduate in Spring. I want this for a couple reasons. I’m the first person in my family to graduate from university, so my entire family is coming down for my graduation and party, and my best friend who is practically my twin gets out of the army in spring of ‘21 and was planning on coming down to help with grad prep and just hang out since we haven’t seen each other since the day we graduated high school (2016). My grandpa also is still getting over a nasty bit of cancer and I want to give him more time to recover before needing to travel. 

But I don’t want to spend the extra money on tuition for that next semester if i don’t have to. I’m not bothered about dropping the minor, it honestly wasn’t what i was expecting and i’ve taken all of the classes from it that i wanted (that no longer count due to the new catalogue, so i’ll effectively be restarting my minor) 

So I guess what I’m asking is for advice on what to do? Without my minor I’m only 11 classes from graduating and can easily do that in 2 semesters, but should i give myself an extra cushion semester afterwards? I’ve had some friends do that, but I’m very conflicted on everything and just wanting to know what other people away from the situation have to say.",05Nov2019,1
535,"Some background,  my grandpa isn't in a good state of mind right now.  On top of just losing his marbles as he ages,  my grandma has been in and out of the hospital with dialysis complications and recently hip surgery/recovery for the past 3 months which is putting major stress on him.  He isn't making any sound decisions, and last night he went on the boat and gambled away $3500 (because he is ""so fucking bored in that house"" he claims).  He laughed about it as he called and woke me up at 5am this morning asking me to loan it to him until January (when something kicks in with a bond he has and he has access to the money).  I told him absolutely not,  while I do have the money I'm not going to feed into his addiction as this has been a reoccurring problem (I loaned him $1000 last summer when he did the same thing and claimed he didn't have anything left to survive off of).   He did pay that back,  it took about 4-5 months but he did.  This time around I absolutely do not trust him,  his mental health is deteriorating quickly as my Grandma's health worsens and I can see him turning around going right back to the casino and losing most if not all of the money I loan him.  He thinks my grandma is at the end of the road and I think he's using her condition to justify his poor behavior (on top of the gambling issues he has been a major asshole to me and my mother the past few months).  My last 2 phone conversations he has threatened to kill himself because ""he's fucking done"" and ""no one cares"" when my mom has been over there regularly cleaning the house for them,  cooking for them,  and checking up on my grandma at the hospital when he needs a break.   He actually has attempted suicide by sleeping pills once a few years ago,  and I'm not sure if these are just more than empty threats. He hung up on me today right after I told him I wouldn't give him the money so I'm really worried about his current state of mind.  It's very hard to talk to him and make him understand things because his brain just isn't there anymore.  He is old, stubborn,  and set in his ways.  Luckily he's going to see his doctor today about being put back on Xanax,  he's been on it for years and was recently taken off (not sure why) but me and my mom noticed a massive change in him when off of it.   Just not sure what else to do here,  me and my mom know he belongs in some kind of home or assisted living (along with my grandma) but we already knows he's going to shut us down immediately and not want to hear a single word about it.  Anyone out there have advice on how to go about bringing up the idea of assisted living to him and what to do when he inevitably flips out about it?  And any advice on what do about the more current problem of his gambling and suicide threats?",05Nov2019,2

I went from being your average autist with very few friends and no girlfriend, to getting fit as fuck and getting together with the popular guys (I dont even like them that much, Im just in it for the women).

Anyways, Im not sure if I want to get one. They all 4 are fairly experienced, even though is their first time with an escort, they are pretty thrilled about it unlike me, who hasnt got any sexual experience. Its not that I care about losing my virginity with an escort, my dad did the same thing at the same age anyway, is just that I dont feel comfortable doing it with a woman 5 years older than me. Theres also the option of getting blind drunk for it, but I dont know. 

I just want to know whats the deal with escorts. I dont know how they operate outside of charging a 100 dollars for an hour of fucking. Do they drink? Is there foreplay or shit like that?

539,"Hi everyone! This all may sound a bit stupid but I’m really struggling with this so would love to get some advice.

I (21F) moved into an apartment with two other people last year. I’m still in school as an undergraduate and I only moved into this apartment because I transferred schools (where I had housing) and the school I go to now does not have housing. I’ve had no problems with living here; I live with a 24F who works full time and a 40sM who works freelance.

However I have noticed a decline in my mental health over the past year, and it may be because I’m a slave to my own bedroom. Don’t get me wrong, 40sM is an extremely nice guy. But I feel like I just can’t relate to him at all. He uses the common room 24/7 so I’ve tried sitting out there with him to chill and hang out, but it’s all just so awkward and uncomfortable so I resort back to my room. I can’t have an actual conversation with him. He has his friends that are his age over a lot, and as a 21F this can make me feel uncomfortable at times. This might literally be the dumbest thing ever but I had a guy over the other night and walking him out while my roommate and his friends stared at us from the common room was very, VERY uncomfortable. It almost reminds me of living with my dad again. I’m the kind of person who thrives off of social interaction while also knowing where my limits are and when I need to wind down. In this case, I’m just getting no social interaction at all and too much winding down. It makes me miss being comfortable in my own home or even with people who make me feel comfortable.

This girl who goes to my school recently offered me a cheaper place to live right next to my school with other students, but the place is a shared room. It makes me wonder if giving up my single room for a shared room for the sake of my mental health is worth it. Our lease also just renewed for another year, so if I were to move out I would probably have to sublease it (?). Looking for some opinions on all of this. Thanks y’all!

tl;dr: being uncomfortable living with my much older male roommate has made me feel like shit mentally and wondering if it’s worth it to move out and live in a shared room with people my age.",05Nov2019,1
541,"This is mostly regarding homework but this is true for me with almost anything. 

The thing is that I get distracted, or even if I'm not   I could only half pay attention to the work. The only that does get me to put 100% of my effort is just doing things at the last minute. Obviously, I should not be doing that. 

And I hate that I feel like my brain works a little harder and that I actually understand and find answers to things when I do that. 

When I do get things done on time, it lacks quality, but it's done because I'm only half paying attention to the assignment. When I do things last minute it's either of better quality, and done or just sucks, but I always finish it in half the time then if I had done things early.

554,"This is a rant, I don't know if anyone is going to see this, and I don't know what answer I'm expecting, or if I even expect one.

I'm 18 this year, above attractive girl with good features, from an above average income household of me and my mom. I don't know why, I've been spiraling out of my own control for about 4 years of my life.

Especially recently, today morning I cut myself accidentally while feeding a stray cat. it bled a lot, but I didn't feel it and i don't know why I found myself facinated with the wound. I've had suicidal tendencies was self harming about 2 years ago but I've stopped wanting to die, now, the idea of dying scares me. but after I accidentally hurt myself today, I found myself wanting to cut myself again, to see if it hurts. I found a knife, but it wouldn't cut since it's dull, so I stopped with the idea, since stabbing myself would definitely hurt. 

I feel like I want to go and buy a knife now to see if it would cut, but my rational mind tells me not to. my mood in the past 1 hour has been switching between being completely calm, fucking horny, wanting to self harm and crying like a child. 

I've always felt quite detached from everything. Also, I don't have a great memory, I can't remember much. My maid who took care of me from my birth to about 14 years old, I can't remember much about her, my elder brother cried when she went back to her own country, but I couldn't find it in myself to care much. The guys I've dated, can't remember what I did with them, or how we broke up. I don't think I ever loved any of them.

My relationships with people are weird. I'm an easy person to talk to, and without sounding like I'm bragging, I'm popular in school. but I find myself surrounded by people who don't know who I really am, and I can't trust a single of them to tell them. I don't reach out to people, I am never the first to text or ask anyone out. 

my relationship with my mother is weird too. I don't think she ever loved me, especially within my childhood, but for some reason now she's been trying to take care of me, and that scares me. I have a lot of mood swings when she nags or does something for me. I used to hate her and hoped that she would die because she doesn't take care of me, when I had a fever I called her for help and she came back yelling at me. She doesn't remember my birthday. But now, I don't hate her, but I don't think I love her either.

No one knows I'm like this, and I don't plan to tell anyone around me. I don't know, I don't trust anyone.

I don't think I will ever kill myself, because I'm too much of a coward, but when I can't even remember what I ate a week ago, and I spend my life meaninglessly, I don't know what I'm living for.

I don't know if it was a trigger, but a guy I met off a dating app for the first time today told me he loved me. I haven't been this emotionally unstable in a while, my life had been relatively calm and I don't feel much, it all spiralled out of control after I heard him say it in a call. I don't love him, I just met him.

Honestly, I just want to talk to someone about this. I don't know what I'm expecting, would it be complete silence? Would someone call me dramatic and lying for attention? Or would it be anything that could get me out of this mental state. I don't know.",05Nov2019,3

There is nothing illegal about this because technically the buyer now owns the product and can use it in any way.

I have two more years to I guess “decide” what I want to do however, I have lately been contemplating if it’s worth it or not? I will spend 12 years of my life after high school working on becoming a doctor and then be on call 24/7 until I’m 55 (assuming I succeed in becoming a doctor lol)

So, now that you have an insight at what my life is looking like so far I have this one question. (Please take this seriously! Your comments will have an influence on how I will live the rest of my life). Should I pursue a job as an anesthesiologist and spend the early years of my life confined to work until I get a job at around 30-31 years old? Also at that I will be on call 24/7 so there won’t be much room for long vacation and travel until I’m retired. My second choice is to get a decent job probably something that is of middle to lower class pay and just live life. Buy a motorcycle and travel all 50 states (always have wanted to ride one, rn I only had enough money to buy an older bronco) spend most of my money on traveling and seeing the world, take a gap year before college, and just fun stuff like that. 

Before you right this off as an obvious choice try to look at it through my eyes... I see life as something that will eventually come to an end and could abruptly stop at any point, meaning that I could get my medical degree and the next day die after being hit by a drunk driver. I want to get the most out of this next 80-90 years I have left. I don’t really fear death but am honestly kinda interested in it. Where do we go after death? Is there really a god? Do we actually have souls? When I began to think deeper into this I began to see that life is sorta pointless lol.

I’m not sure if I’m in the right place but I was wanting some advice on a matter.

Long story short from what I can gather through tersimonals and articles my mother may be considered a “toxic” parent. I am a 20M going to school, my parents have agreed to pay for half of my schooling as long as I do well.

It’s many small things, they don’t hit me anymore for things. They used to for not eating my lunch or going out with friends or not finishing my dinner. But they realize I’m too old to hit. Recently I realize that any situion that goes on, my mother seems to play the victim card. She brings something up, I correct her, she say “oh I guess I’ll never bring anything up like that every again” very passive aggressively

She gets my blood boiling when she does this. She talks to me about my fathers flaws and really aggressively tells him to correct his flaws. I find that she has never apologized for anything in my life, she is filled with this sense of entitlement in private and in public. She always creates a scene in public and doesn’t care what people think, even though I may be with my friends or strangers. 

She only makes it seems like she cares when we go out for dinner with her friend and she brags about me. She doesn’t allow any of my friends to come over, sometime we want to have a couple drinks and she says that they need to get out if they are drinking, right in front of them. Understandable, you don’t want people drinking. Cool I get it. 

They ask about my friends and I tell them we usually go out for drinks or go to another persons house since we’re all busy, but my mom thinks I’m still a child.

She asks that I’m still a young kid and she’s the parent who has control over everything in my life.

584,"Ok so let me say this first, i’m not the greatest at storytelling so bear with me. But dear reddit I am consulting you with a very important question facing my work environment. A little backstory for some context I’m a male high school senior and just transferred to a new school so i’m new as it is not only at school but at work and I started working at Taco Bell with a good mindset and was genuinely enjoying it (i’ve been working there for like a month) About second or so week in I started getting scheduled  a lot with this one coworker in particular who I am highkey falling hard for, that’s great and all but the vibe is kinda awkward cuz for one I just got hired and she’s been working there for a while, for two, I told my homegirl that she was pretty cute, and yk how females are so my coworker already knows and that’s guaranteed. (for some more context that was like a week ago) And the only reason I haven’t really hit her up yet is because she’s one of those goodie goodies and i’m.. more of a chill stoner type😂 like goddamn man i have the chemical structure of acid tattood on my shoulder. So i’m kinda trying to get my shit together before making a move bc ik that drugs and shi ruin relationships. So yeah to wrap it up everytime im scheduled with her the vibe is just kinda weird and I can tell  she trying to not let it make things awk and just work like regular coworkers and this is where we are at the time of me writing this so calling all superreaders help your tweaker friend out!

585,"Last month I [18F] started dating a really great guy [23M]. We have so much in common and he really brings out the best in me. I'm currently a student at a college about an hour away from where he lives. Although he didn't complete a degree, he works full time living with his parents.
 
My parents have met him and both liked him. Recently, however, they are telling me they dont want me to date him. They explain that I ""can do better"" than someone without a degree and should keep my options open. They basically imply that he is a loser at every chance they can get.

I've explained to them how happy this guy makes me and how genuinely good of a person he is. They seem to be more focused on his financials and education. Both of my parents have at some point told me that they don't want to hear about him from me. 

I'm close to my parents and want them to support me, especially because of how exciting this new relationship is for me. I also don't want my boyfriend to start thinking they don't like him.

586,"I know how this sounds but it’s true. So I use escort services when I’m not dating someone and on a dry streak, been doing this on and off for over 2 years. Never had any complications up until 3 months ago. So I set an appointment up with a new escort I found to have some fun. We did and I enjoyed it a lot so I booked her again for a week later. This escalated quickly to her coming over every night wether I could pay her or not. Then just hanging out in our free time (movies, going out to eat, ect). Then about 3 weeks ago she told me she loved me. I took it with a grain of salt at first figuring she did this with all her clients. But she has spent the night almost every night since then. Last week her landlord kicked her friends she was staying with out so she had no place to stay so she has been staying with me. The other day she told me that she loved me and that she wanted to get out of the escort business and get clean (she has a coke problem). Now I really do have strong feelings for this girl but I’m conflicted. I keep bouncing back and forth between thinking she really loves me and that I’m just a means to an end right now. She has been clean for over a week and to my knowledge she hasn’t been working at all. She is at the house when I leave and there when I get off work and my brother says she doesn’t leave the house at all that she barley comes out of my room. Now this girl is super hot and way out of my league which is one reason I question the credibility of her saying she loves me. I really do love this girl though, it wasn’t supposed to happen but it did. she’s a wonderful person and it’s got nothing to do with sex I just enjoy spending time with her and being around her. I want this to be real but I just keep doubting that it is. I know I should just ask her but with my doubts about her being truthful I wouldn’t whole heartily believe it. Anyone got any advice on how to go about this. I don’t want to believe it’s real if it’s not but I don’t want to mess it up being pessimistic about the situation either. Her past doesn’t bother me at all I just want something real with this girl.",05Nov2019,0

We have became really good friends over time and had different partners, but i have always felt, that i have strongfeelings for her, hidden somwhere inside me.

This year we graduated, went to different colleges and she ended her longtime relationship. Since we talked basically everyday in high school, i started to really miss her and boom, my feelings for her are stronger than ever. We see each other every couple of weeks, we go out to get a beer and talk about stuff. She often says, that she misses being in a relationship and than we discuss the guys she is seeing in her college.

The thing that is eating me alive everyday is that since she lives 2 hour drive from me and we have been good friends for a long time, us two being together is basically imposible. Not to mention that she probably doesn't see me the same way.

592,"There's this guy at my high school that's making my life miserable, and I really don't know how to continue with the things I love with him there to ruin it for me. 

I feel unjust in feeling this way because he hasn't actually done anything to me in a few months, but he continues to be a horrible person to others, and the success he has is driving me insane. 

So here's the background information:
This guy is involved with the same activities, same friend groups, same extracurricular interests as I am. He's always around, and has always been around all throughout highschool. He's super friendly to people, and people love him, but he makes fun of them behind their backs and gets off on their unhappiness. Despite all this, all my friends still love him and strive to get his approval, when they know that he makes fun of them. He even will make fun of people to their faces, calling them ""fun sponges"" and ""gross and ugly""; he will push down people who are in is way or who he just wants to be on the ground, this includes me; belittled a friend of mine by making fun of their father for being an alcoholic, even though he knows that it takes a heavy toll on her well being and it is a really big family problem for her; on multiple occasions he tried to trigger a friend of mine's PTSD after they were sexually assaulted; and there's more problems I have, but I can go on all day about this. 

Despite knowing all that he's done, everyone still loves him. He was even nominated to become the president of the Thespian Troupe (drama club) at my school. 

My friends have called him manipulative and toxic, yet they still are friends with him and every single day I hear him bash one person or another. 

He's in one of my classes, he hangs out with my friends, and now he was just put into the same play as I'm in because there was a lack of characters and the director wanted him in it, so I don't feel safe anywhere except my own house. 

Please, if anyone has any advice on what to do, please let me know. I can't keep going on like this, I'm very tempted to drop out of school and do homeschooling because of him. I want everyone else to see him as I do, but whenever I talk to my friends about it they say ""I'm biased"" because I don't like him. That doesn't make what he does better??? They'll also tell me not to talk to them about it because they don't want to hear about it. I love my friends dearly, it's only in this regard that they're not the greatest.

My family is very supportive and helpful I have a wonderful boyfriend who is supportive and helps me when I feel overwhelmed, but I still feel like shit all the time. 
I have trichotillomania and thricophagia, which I have never told anyone other than my boyfriend. He doesn't really understand it and when we were talking about OCD the other day and I said I have OCD he didn't really put two and two together.

I've been passively suicidal for years now, I would never act on it but it's an overwhelming feeling at times. 
I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this, my boyfriend isn't the most emotionally intelligent person, which is fine he's working on bettering himself and I can't dump all of my problems on him.
He also knows about my passive want to be dead and it worries him but I can tell he doesn't know what to do about it and I think it's unreasonable for me to expect him to solve all my problems.

•I put on makeup one morning. She calls this activity “so white”

•My friends come in the room for a moment. She says “omg caitlin allll of your friends are white”

•She comes home from a day in chinatown. I’m asking her about it, and she brings up a word I don’t know. I ask her what it means. She calls me “an uncultured white girl”

•She is a nursing major, and I am an environmental science major. She tells me my major “is such a white thing to pick” and that I could “never handle nursing being white”

605,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am a graduate student at a large American university. A while ago, I received a poor module grade. The feedback contained various strange statements, for example, that my paper did not contain X even though it did. It also said that they would have expected a better paper of a talented student, and that my paper was not at graduate level. The remark sounded very snide. Even if it were made in good faith, it did not sound as though she was weighing my paper impartially, but rather in comparison to what I am like in class.

At my university there is a teaching board, comprised of students and professors, there to discuss student feedback on modules. The action I took next was to let the student member know what had happened. I asked them to mention that feedback would ideally not include the professor's judgment of the student as a person, since this kind of feedback is generally not helpful, and a bad grade should not have anything to do with the student's 'talents'. 

I also wrote a response to the professor in I said that I did not find personal statements appropriate, and that I asked for this point to be made at the teaching commission with all persons remaining anonymous. 

In the professor's response, they sounded extremely contrite at first. I then replied to say that I would just like to move forward.

A few days later, I got yet another email from this professor. Essentially, they wanted to make this a point on the agenda of the annual teaching evaluation, since I had 'slandered their name'. They had forwarded the correspondence to other professors, removing my name but leaving enough information to identify me.

I fear that this professor has used this as an opportunity to make herself appear as though she has been wronged. I have not told anyone but the one other student, so I am not sure why she claims that I have slandered her. In fact, the other professors may not want to work with me now for fear of me being 'difficult'. I have no idea what to do, and whether I should (or can) do anything.",05Nov2019,5

607,"TL;DR will be at the end.


First of all, I'd like to say that I'll be using this throwaway account in order to avoid my stalker from finding my main reddit account and that I've thought of posting this to LetsNotMeet and the Discord subreddit but finally decided that maybe this would be the right place. The only detail I will reveal is that I'm a woman and that I have a mental disorder which includes psychosis as a symptom, these two details are relevant for the story. I'll call myself ""Emily"" and my stalker ""Mike"" throughout the story, These are not our real names.


Year ago before discord existed I met Mike, we had a lot of fights here and there but he still seemed cool to me. The more I talked to him the weirder he'd get. At times he would just say questionable sexist stuff which slightly offended me but I shrugged it off as it being his dark sense of humor. Fast forward to a few years later, I was sad and lonely with no one in my life to talk to so we tried meeting up in real life which failed thanks to family issues but years later I'm glad it did otherwise chances are I would've ended up like that one girl on Discord who was murdered by their incel orbiter.


(this happened outside discord) One time I had a psychotic breakdown during a chat with him and all the time I was talking to Mike during my breakdown he was mocking me so I cut him off days later but he added me back a day later trying to justify his actions as him doing it to get my attention or because he was depressed or other things that would make no sense (a.k.a Guilt Tripping). This went on for more and more days until I finally snapped, tried to get rid of him and changed my steam profile so he wouldn't talk to me again.


I had Mike added on my inactive discord account for god knows how long but I decided to block him there and created a new alt which eventually became my main (which btw I had only shared with friends I know I can trust and was only in ONE public server in which none of my mutuals was in), a few weeks later I get a friend request from him on my alt. Now I don't know HOW he got my discord tag because he doesn't know any of my friends, although the stalker himself had confessed to have been stalking me on twitter (where no one has ever posted my discord tag ever). I accepted his friend request and pretended to be another person, which I'm pretty sure might've failed. I created another alt account and did the same thing I did with my inactive account.


Just one day later... ONE DAY, I was talking to my friend in bed when suddenly: ""Mike has sent you a friend request."" and not just one but many friend requests from his alts which had offensive names threatening me such as ""Emily is a bitch for dating transgender people"", ""Emily is a coward"", ""Hide your twitter account"". Just when I thought everything was over I get these friend requests and my mind just freezes for a sec so I screencap what I see and ask my friends if It was just an hallucination (because I suffer from schizophrenia), unfortunately they all confirmed it wasn't. I decided to make yet ANOTHER alt account this time but I only gave it to 5 people I really trust. So far nothing has happened but if it does, I will update.


**tl;dr:** *incel orbiter adds me on discord, claims to have found me through twitter although none of my personal information is public there, i block him and his alts, no matter what i do he always comes back.*


What can I do to avoid this? I've considered calling the police but my stalker lives in a completely different country so I doubt they'll take it seriously. And before anyone suggests blocking, I've done that many times, it just doesn't work anymore.",05Nov2019,3

Do you ask future sexual partners to get tested for STDs before getting intimate?

Ok, so when I was a child I remember that my country was going through the VIH prevention campaign. It was everywhere. Schools, hospitals, even the church. A close family friend discovered she had VIH because of her cheating husband, it was such a difficult time for her. It encouraged my mom to give me The Talk™ and she would always tell me to practice safe sex. Typical awkward stuff when you’re in your early teens. 

Now, the twist, I’m asexual. For those who don’t know what that is, it’s basically lack of sexual attraction towards other people. I do have a libido and my body works just fine, I just never see a guy and think: “Omg, I wanna sleep with him!” Even when I’ve been in love, I simply don’t have this need. 

It’s been great because I’ve lived through my teens and early 20s without fear of catching STDs or getting pregnant, buut I do want to get married one day and have a family. So I know that in the future I will have sex. 

But I’m still afraid of catching something, even condoms are not 100% effective. 

Should I ask my current boyfriend to get tested? He hasn’t asked me, but even though I’ve never had sex I would do it because it’s only fair. 

People tell me “you have to trust your partner”, but honestly? Put my health at risk just to have sex? It seems silly to me. 

But maybe I AM exaggerating! 

Thoughts? Thank you!",05Nov2019,3
614,"So my husband comes from a really big family. With a big family there is a lot of drama. He is closest to his siblings who are closest in his age. I get a long with most of them. His brother has always hated me for whatever reason. I guess he feels like I took him away when we got married. Anyways his brother has a wife who has always been nothing but an evil bitch, but has also become someone I got close with. Anyways she confided in me at the beginning of the year, that her husband (my brother in-law) had some naked pictures of her sister on his phone. They have 3 kids together and live with her parents. She also told me that she found videos of him secretly recording her mom in the bathroom. The whole thing is fucking weird.  She has always cheated on him, and instead of leaving him. She started cheating on him with men from tinder. Fast forward and they are getting a divorce, he is living with his parents and is drunk on my couch multiple times a week. I hate having him here, and when my husband tells him were busy he texts me paragraphs and paragraphs asking why I am mad. Am I wrong for not wanting him over?",05Nov2019,4
615,"I’m fucked but am I really

I’m so fucking stupid. Smoked weed in my dorm. Got caught by the administration lady or something. Banged on the door, asked me if I had been smoking,  my goody two shoes ass says yes. She asks me to bring her the rest of my stash. There I go, handing her 7 joints I planned to ration for the rest of the week. Told me to meet her in her office. I asked if I was going to be expelled, she said no but there’s needs to be a conversation.

I’m on my way to her office, high as fuck, yet able to maintain a shred of my divinity to defend my case. I acknowledged that I was aware of the rules and assumed full responsibility. I really wanted her to know that I wasn’t trying to bullshit her.. yet. So then I said that was the first time I smoked and my roommate was never involved. Which was half true bc my roommate really wasn’t smoking with me during that sesh (she was asleep, so it was the truth), but we had lit up numerously prior in our dorm. Yeah, I get it. Why am I complain about something that I knew was preventable and inevitably going to happen. BUT hear me out. I’m more than just some troubled brat who needs to be taught a lesson 

The lady said that she was shocked when she smelled the loud from my dorm. She didn’t take me for a smoker and preferred me to do so off campus. I agreed with pleading and tearful eyes. She also told me that she will acknowledge my character and feats in my community as well as the crime itself. I’m a sweet girl. I’m literally a goody two shoes to them although many can plead otherwise. I seem as innocent as they come. However... I’ve had a rough past two semesters due to issues within my home life, and my grades tanked from a shiny 3.8 GPA that earned my way onto Dean’s List and National Honors Society (Phi Theta Kappa) to a wretched 2.3 GPA. (No offense to those with that GPA but that’s a significant decrease for someone who’s had drastically higher). My depression has really fucked me over academically but I’m on medication that has really helped me manage it better. Anyways, I’m really bringing up my grades, my lowest is a C but that’s only bc she doesn’t update her grades likes she’s supposed to. If my calculations are correct then I will be able to completely turn my grades around. If they even look into that, I guess that’s what I’d have to say? But she didn’t ask. I really hope that the good girl they think I am compensates for the things that they should know that could possibly help my case. 

I didn’t lie, I didn’t hesitate to obey her demands when assessing the situation, the only resistance I displayed was against bursting into a fury of tears. I am so pissed at myself. Believe, I know there was extreme bad judgment especially when knowing the stakes. However, with the information SHE knows and what SHE perceives me to be, the student from my campus to attend the National Honors Society Ceremony along with her, to be. What do you think her verdicts doing to be? I really do think she sympathizes with me to a certain extent, but I made sure to take full responsibility. I really didn’t get proper opportunity to plead my case. It was just that one 5 min meeting. She said it was a 50/50 chance. 


Sorry that this is long. I’m still high as fuck and I’m pretty sure my trip has turned sour but I’m trying not to freak out bc I’m in my first class. There is an argument happening. I cannot breathe. Tell me how stupid I am, idc, but give me an honest question.

617,"Recently me and a good friend of mine got into an argument because I complained she's straight up ignoring me, she told me she needed space and that she gave me clear signals about it, that I didn't catch even if she indeed give me any, then we started arguing a bit more. In the end I did apologize and we made up but I still have the sour taste in my mouth after that conversation. 

She's basically a sister to me and her reasons for distancing herself are personal issues, I told her she can count on me if she needs to talk about these and I promised I'd give her space that she needs but I can't help worrying about her, I really want to ask how she's doing even if the response is ""I'm fine"" then we stop talking but it kinda misses the point of my promise if I text her just a day after.

625,"Hi, 

I'd like to seek some advice on a personal topic. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I hope someone can help me out. For multiple years I've been stalked by someone. When I lived in the United States he tried to get in touch with me (anyway he could) even if I blocked numbers, IG accounts, FB accounts etc., while I clearly stated I was not interested in that. For many years I was off social media because of this issue. While in the states, my family would catch him on the home cameras standing behind trees near my house and leaving things at my doorstep. He even used to send me messages when he knew I was home. This clearly made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe, so I decided to go to the police. I had a great detective who cared about me and my well-being. Eventually the case got to court, with the goal to get a restraining order against him, however, the local court decided to dismiss the case resulting in him just walking away freely, and the stalking continuing from a distance. Luckily, I had the chance to move to Europe. That certainly gave me some peace, but soon I will be moving back. This should be unknown to him, but since I have been back on social media for some reason I get friend requests on Facebook from people that are friends with him. Recently, he also sent me a follow request and message on IG, these acts do not all take place in the same time period. I'm trying to ignore this, but due to this, I have a strong feeling of unsafety again. My problem is that I don't know what to do, in order to go back to the States with a safe feeling. I feel like going to the police is not an option, since I haven't been in direct contact with him lately and I'm also living abroad. Are there any people here that have been in this situation or something similar? And if so, how did you handle this? 

I hope someone can give me the golden tip on what to do since I just want to live in safety and peace. This is for serious responses only.",05Nov2019,0

629,"Throwaway is throwaway.

Where to start? I'll go with saying that I'm the person at fault for getting myself into this mess in the first place, but that doesn't change the fact that there's a problem. One that I can't seem to fix or find an answer to. So, there's this engineering degree, it's an associate, not much but it's something to get basic level knowledge in the field I want, or so I thought. Turns out that (I learned over a year in because I neglected to look into it further) that none of my credits count towards a BS degree of Engineering at the university that's close to home. That I, in fact, would need to take a lot more math classes, science classes, and more. To top that, from what I've heard from employers, I can't even get an internship with the degree.

Now onto the current classes. I've already spent too much money and time to just give up the degree though the thought crosses my mind but this is my last semester. I would just follow along with the other students and ride the sinking ship into the harbor, but I'd rather learn something in class. I'm not good at much, but when it comes to acquiring knowledge not only am I generally good as learning from others, it's literal the one thing I enjoy. Being able to apply the knowledge is even better.

But as it stands, the professor (who has been here for only two semsters after the previous professor left and has done a lot of nothing in that time) doesn't teach, at least not in any of my classes. He sits in his office, on his computer, all-day even during class. I have essentially paid the college to tell me ""go on YouTube and learn it yourself"" (that's not an exaggeration, he literally said go on YouTube) and even after trying to, I still find myself stuck with an F in his classes.

Altogether, the degree doesn't count towards future education, it isn't enough to get even a starting level job, I'm not learning anything, I'm failing the class, and no one seems to cares or has the answers, and I've asked pretty much everyone I can (Advising, Dean, etc). The only person I haven't is the professor himself (though I did send an email about my grade and future assignments), and that's because he isn't exactly approachable, or one to listen. I once tried to explain why the PLC system and Hydraulic system weren't compatible (this is mainingly because they are learning systems specifically made for their respective systems, from different manufacturers, and aren't meant to be used together), and that didn't even get through to him, and he supposedly has a doctorate. 

What should I do? Should I bother with further education? Change degrees? Is there an option I don't know about that advising didn't think about? I feel lost with no direction at this point and would gladly hear any advice that could be given.",05Nov2019,2
630,"My husband works in a field that, to not be too specific, is like hospitality but with mostly men for customers, out doing manly things proving how manly they are. This environment of course can breed lots of testosterone-induced bad decisions, especially when alcohol is involved. 

So recently they were entertaining customers after a long day of manliness and lots of alcohol was being consumed. My husband had ducked out early to go to bed. He was told after the fact that his boss consumed a bit too much and proceeded to make some crude comments at the one woman that was there, who happened to be the daughter of a regular customer who was also present, and then slapped her on her butt. 

So the dad of the woman was understandably angry. He tells another employee about it after the fact who then tells my husband. The dad ultimately decides they don’t want to report him to the corporate office because they don’t want to cost him his job. 

Here’s the problem. This company is VERY liability conscious. We are talking they go to insane levels to protect themselves. This boss has now proved himself to be a liability. Even though this dad (and presumably the daughter, I asked what she thought and apparently no one’s actually asked her opinion) doesn’t want to make trouble for the boss or the company, he could change his mind, or the boss could do this again with someone who isn’t so nice about it. The other employee doesn’t want to report it because “well he said he’s not gonna do anything.” So now it comes down to my husband, who has only heard this story third-hand, but I’m afraid that if the company finds out he knew and didn’t report it, he could get fired too. However he’s on the fence about it because he only has third-hand knowledge and “it was told in confidence.” 

I told him when he asked my opinion on what he should do that my belief is the morally right thing to do is to report it because this man has now proven himself to be a sexual assaulter and by them looking the other way they are letting him get away with it, plus he’s putting our livelihood at risk if this ever blew up. We’ve reached a complete impasse on the matter. 

So in his situation, what’s the best path forward? If he doesn’t report it, how do we move forward, because right now this whole thing scares me a lot?",05Nov2019,1

647,"Hi everyone,

My friend from college, who used to be driven with a goal in mind, has now lost all his motivation. Please bear with this story after this - I met my friend in my undergrad while helping with a project and I became good friends with him after that. We had similar interests in pursuing our goals and building a venture of our own in the near future. We committed our time during the final year to work on developing an electronic product for a local manufacturing company.  Both him and I shelled out money even though it was him who supported the project financially to a larger extent and I was mostly involved in development and testing (Field Testing was always done by both of us). In short, we drove it to completion, but the company couldn't accept it because the BOM was too expensive compared to its Chinese counterpart. The project was a failure also because of the fact that we took too long to finish it. This ended around 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

Following this, we tried our hands in a lot of other projects, but couldn't go past the development stage due to reasons like time and money (both of us were working to support our families) and also partly due to the reason that we couldn't get reliable interns to work. Amidst this, my friend thought of taking a break and applying for higher studies while I decided to improve my career in my day-job. 

&amp;#x200B;

He got an admit from one of the top universities in product development and techno-management and was the first to get the admit among all applicants and I was immensely happy that he may get to pursue his dreams. But it all came crashing down as he couldn't procure a student loan due to financial instability in his family(there were no scholarship options available for international students for the program he wanted to pursue). With work too tiring (almost 16 hours/day), and almost non-existent options for a higher degree, my friend broke down in a spiraling depression as he couldn't prioritize his career goals over his family conditions. So he decided to solve problems by switching jobs to support his family for a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a friend who has been trying to help him all these years, it pains my heart to see that he has now abandoned his dreams at building his own company and pursuing higher education (which could potentially help him in his future venture). Of course, he could start after a few years, but I feel he might always regret his current decision. Also, I am not the one to dictate what he should do with his life, as that may seem like manipulation and reeks of personal gain. But as a friend, I am obliged to tell him the truth that life is supposed to be hard, and that you should never give up your dreams for anything, and also at the same time I should help him arrive at a pragmatic decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question for fellow Redditors is that, 

1. How do I motivate my friend to his older self again? 

2. What advice would you give my friend? (and possibly me as well)

648,"I have had this suspicion for quite some time, and to be honest, being a sociopath wouldn't bother me one bit. I've tried those online self-diagnosis tests, with mixed results. 

Anyway, I've always been different to others, not sure why though. My peers say I give off ""psychopath"" vibes, not much of an edgelord though. I am quite self-aware of the fact that I'm a power-hungry person, fairly selfish, greedy, and obsessed with being in control. I seem to find confrontation everywhere, even though I hate it and it gives me strong anxiety.

I generally dislike people, but also don't, if that makes sense. I can't seem to get along with many. I also find it fairly difficult to become emotional. Nobody comes to me for emotional support, because I almost never genuinely care. I do not pay much attention to 'right' &amp; 'wrong', even though I can mostly tell them apart, so I could do something 'wrong' intentionally. I have stolen as a child, only stopping because I was caught and afraid of punishment. I have also hurted animals, yes intentionally, as a kid. I've done none of that stuff for a long time.

I use manipulation tactics from time to time, but avoid sleazy manipulation (e.g. suicide threats). I'll add that if I feel somebody 'belongs' to me, I'll protect them at all costs, just like any other material object I own. I am a loner by choice too, not too interested in relationships.

I always noticed that we have many things in common. We both are a bit shy, we have the same humour and even have the same hobbies.
I also noticed that you made me lots of compliments. Do you remember in 6th grade when I drew pictures for you and you complimented me for my nice drawing?
Do you remember all those small compliments you just made me out of nowhere?
The next thing I noticed was that you always made eye contact with me... In class you were used to turn around sometimes and we made eye contact.
I know that I was pretty shy at that time and we didn't talked a lot, but I was in love with you since day 1.

But things changed when this boy came in our class in grade 7.
He bullied me a lot and he destroyed my self esteem.
I got depression and even got a lot more shy.
In this time I didn't talk to you at all, not because I didn't wanted to but because I thought you all saw me as a looser.
Well, that got better.
I even became sorta friends with my old bully. 
He apologized to me and he has been really nice since then. 
That was 1 1/2 years ago.

Last year I went to my first party.
You have been also there and we talked a bit...
You complimented me for how smart I am and you even asked if I ever had a girlfriend.
Was that the next sign?
Since then I wanted to have more contact with you, however the next day at school you acted like nothing happens.
Next party, same thing.
We talked a lot and you asked me some personal questions.
I thought more and more that you may love me...
But I was just to insecure and to shy to show you that I like you too, well when thinking about it I think I never really did.

Then something shocking happend.
When we were on a school trip together you spend a lot of time with my old bully.
You sat beside him in the train and you laughed a lot.
Yes, I was really really jealous.
My old school bully does what I was dreaming of for 5 years? Fair life

Well, next party, next signs...
Again, we talked a lot, for hours...
It was our closing ceremony of our class and we spent the whole night by talking next to the campfire.
It was like the best time of my life.
I was laying there on the bank and you were sitting there in your sleep bag. 
Well, then you offered me your pillow so that I could have it a bit more comfortable. (Sign?)

After that we had summer holidays and I was thinking of you EVERY FREAKING DAY.
I thought multiple times about texting you my feelings for you but I couldn't.
I was scared of the consequences it would have.
If you wouldn't love me I would look like the biggest jerk  
and all my friends would know. I still was know as the silent guy. And we would still go to the same school...
That's why I didn't but I know I should have...

Next school year and we have some classes now together.
We see us a lot in the breaks sitting together with some friends at the same table.
But what I also noticed is that you were together with my old bully more and more.
Well, you asked a lot of times if someone can hand you his homework even if you know that I was the only one that has done it, so I gave it to you, multiple times.

But since the summer holidays something changed...
Even if I tried starting a conversation you were nervous and I was nervous too, so we didn't talked much in school.
I tried making the first steps, texting you, starting a conversation but you always just answered with simple questions so that the conversation couldn't keep going.
On the same time, you talked more and more with my old bully and you spend a lot of time with him in school.
I tried making contact with you and sometimes I see how you turn around to look at me, and you turn quickly away and very nervously when I catch you in that moment.

Please, I love you so freaking much but I can't show it really to you...
Please give me a sign that you love me too because all these years I thought you would do so.
I've never met such an amazing girl like you...
Maybe it's already too late to explain to you what I feel because you lost the interest in me...
Maybe you are just to shy to talk to me or to give me any signs like I am.
Maybe you think that I have no interest in you because I don't talk a lot to you or give any signs other than eye contact.

But please let me know if you love me...",05Nov2019,1
651,"Hi! I‘m a 19 year old girl and I live with my parents. All my life I wanted to live with my parents until 21/22 as I‘ve always heard that living alone comes with many difficulties and living with your parents is a luxury, which in deed, it truly is. BUT as much as I love my parents (my stepdad and my mom) I can‘t live with them any longer, as they are very toxic people.

Don‘t get me wrong, they are not bad people, they have their lovely traits and I really don‘t mind spending time with them most of the time but I realized that living with them breaks my mentally.

5 years ago I moved from them to my dads house because I couldn‘t bare with them any longer, we were having TERRIBLE fights and I was suffering from depression and self harm. Those 3 years I spent living with my dad, I healed mentally and became very happy. When I was 18 I moved back to my mothers house, as my dad doesn‘t have much money and a big place. With my two other sisters (step and half) and my stepmother, there wasn‘t enough room for me and I felt better moving back to my moms as it would mean one mouth less to feed

So I‘m living with my mom and my stepdad for one year now and all the bad things (the big black hole I call depression and selfharm) are coming all back as living with my parents is pretty hard. They abuse me verbally and even though I know that they don‘t know what they are doing by that and that they have their - how I call it - difficult personalities (a choleric and a perfectionist) it is very VERY hard for me. 

My boyfriend and I have been talking about me moving to his place as I want to get into this university which is nearby where he lives (my parents still dont know about that either, they think I want to go into a university that‘s near my place). 
But as time passed and as I‘ve been struggling more and more to live at my parents home, I realized that I can‘t live with them any longer else I will fall back into that old black hole again. I‘ve talked to him and his parents and they are welcoming me with open arms as they have a big house and he has his own „apartment“ above his parents living area. I would start to work and give my contribution to the household, payments etc. etc.

Now. Talking to my mother scares me. I‘m literally frozen when I want to go and talk to her. I‘m scared that she will get upset. I‘m scared that they will throw me out of the house or play the guilt trip. I mean they will quite understand that I want to move out and move in with my boyfriend as soon as I will pass the entrance exam to that university (which will be in august) but I‘m not able to explain why I want to move out NOW. I‘m also scared that they will use my dog as a way to let me feel guilty. „What about her? Who is going to look after her? She will be alone the whole day!“ And I dont want that either.

So here I‘m asking - do you guys know a way how I could possibly tell my parents the best way that I want to move out? I already have some ideas but I think I would be a little more confident if you guys would suggest something! Thank you for reading this whole ass paragraph btw lol and sorry for any mistakes my first language isn‘t englisch. ❤️",05Nov2019,1
652,"Hi there. I have been turning a creative passion of mine (wire-wrapping crystals yo make pendants) into a little business. It's not crazy successful, but I really enjoy it. I don't have that many expenses right now, so I make enough with it. I sell online and in person, and have really been trying to take it to the next level.

Sometimes I am unsure of how much to charge for my finished works. I want to be fair, to the customer but also myself.

Will you give your opinion? Obviously someone who likes this style will pay more than someone not as into it. Just wanted to see what strangers on the net would say.

Sometimes I feel like I should get a ""normal"" job but I don't like schedules and feel I could end up making enough through this. It makes me happy. Most jobs I have had in the past make me miserable in some way.

653,"Details: My girlfriend and I have been slightly overwhelmed with social obligations between the two of us since we've gotten together in the past few months. We both have small friend circles, but between the two of us, that makes for quite a few social requests that crop up each month, especially when you throw in family on top of that. After all of our individual and together plans we felt kind of drained and like we weren't getting enough individual down time or together time. 

...It sounds like the simple solution would be ""Well just don't do so much stuff,"". But it isn't always that simple. Especially when you're busy and it's people you really do enjoy and want to see asking you to do things. It's easy to just look at the calendar and see you're free and schedule it. Without realizing it we'd quickly be booked 2 months out pretty easily. Things that we genuinely wanted to do and looked forward to, and were still really fun even after we did them, but were leaving us drained, separately and together.

So I just put recurring ""free"" weekends on the calendar for every other weekend. This way when we get an invite from someone, we'll remember to keep some weekends for ourselves free and only offer up the open weekends to social engagements unless it's something one of us really really really wants to do etc. 

You don't owe explanations to anyone and personal time is important too. It is SO nice and stress relieving to look at the calendar now and have those down weekends to look forward to.",05Nov2019,1

655,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm an obese person in my late twenties(my peak weight was around 160KG (350 pounds)). I've been always obese and with a sedentary lifestyle. This has been the reason behind many sleepless nights and weeks of depression and self-loathing. I've never lived near a gym without subscribing in it, but without going of course.

I found love around 1 year ago and I made a promise to my fiancé that before wedding I would fix my weight problem and improve my lifestyle. I thought I could *transform* my body in a year, but boy, was I wrong.

I traveled to work abroad last November, and **I've accomplished nearly 30% of what I was hoping to achieve in a year, and I'm NOT happy with the results, even though people keep telling me that my body has changed since then (I was wearing 4XL and now I can wear 2XL clothes).** I'm not making up excuses but people have no idea how hard it is to resist the urge of binge eating at night and skipping workout, especially when living alone.

My wedding is in exactly 3 weeks and I'm so ashamed and angry at myself and at my weakness. I've been thinking quite often of doing something that might lead to postponing the marriage, but she has waited long enough, and even if that happens, I'm not even sure I would stick to my plan.

Note that given the fact that I come from a conservative family, the wedding night would be my first time ever to expose myself to a woman. My body is very flabby and consists of mainly [subcutaneous fat](https://www.healthline.com/health/subcutaneous-fat).

657," I hope the post isn't gonna be too long because theres quite a bit of a backstory, but PLEASE i REALLY need advice.  
I'm 15F.

Last year for a few months i joined a certain club at school. I was the only girl there, with 3 other guys. All of them seemed kinda shy but i'm generally open to meeting all kinds of new people so i kinda tried to become friends with them, one of them seemed to be a bit more talkative than others, so we just sometimes had casual conversations before the class would start. Nothing special. I greeted him in the hallways just like i greet everyone else that i know at school. Again, nothing weird, right? WELL...  
This year, for a whole bunch of reasons i couldn't attend the same club at the beginning. Well, that guy from the class somehow found out where all of my classes were, and for weeks straight started to stand outside of my classroom, waiting for me to come out. Then, when i would come out with my friends, he would somehow ""block"" the way, so that way my friends would keep going, while i had to stand and talk with him. he would ask me the same kinds of questions like why wasn't i attending the classes and stuff like that in FINE DETAIL. while he seemed normal i would tell him the reasons but somehow he still INSISTED and sometimes got kind of stiff(?) and aggressive in a weird way. He would get louder and the whole situation was always strangely tense.  
Today, after coming out of my class, he got in front of me and greeted me. i greeted him back. He asked something like ""What's new?"". I simply answered with ""Nothing much"". Then all of the sudden he gets weirdly aggressive again and says this loudly ""I'VE BEEN ASKING YOU THIS FOR 5 WEEKS NOW AND YOU'VE BEEN ANSWERING THE SAME EXACT THING."". i got confused, and asked him calmly what was he talking about. he said ""DID REALLY NOTHING HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE FOR THERE PAST 5 WEEKS?"". (i know it sounds very off and awkward, but that's just really what he said. i have no i idea why did he take it literally). i got low-key scared, said ""no"". and kinda ran off with my friends. He didn't talk to me after that that day, but i could constantly see him from the corners of my eyes wherever i would hang around with my friends, and i knew that he was looking towards my direction.  
Usually i answer in a very cold, short way. I try to hint that i feel very uncomfortable, my friends try to keep me away from him as anturally as possible. But this just keeps getting weirder and he won't stop. The only thing i think i can do is to talk to even more of my friends about it, they all kinda know this by now because THEY CAN SOMEHOW NOTICE THIS WEIRD GUY WAITING FOR SOMEONE EVERYTIME THEY LEAVE A CLASSROOM. Maybe they can somehow help me to avoid him?  
The bad thing is, the teacher asked me to attend the classes. I love the teacher, and the subject A LOT so i will have to go there this week. Its just that i dont want to have anything to do with this guy.  
I've considered that i could talk to the principal or authorities, but where i'm from -- it's not really a thing? (if that makes any sense?). If the whole situation isn't involving anything illegal or something then teachers don't get involved.   
He has done a bunch of weird shit like this, i could go on almost for hours.

660,"This is a throwaway account because people I know personally are aware of my main. Also, sorry if this is (very) long and if there are grammar/vocabulary mistakes, English isn't my first language.

A bit of context:

I'm an artist. Always have been, always will be. The only thing that I truly love to do is create. BUT, over the years, I've always kept this part of me as a hobby, never something that I told others I could do professionally. In high school, I always chose scientific subjects and tried to fool myself into thinking I had a passion for science. I had relatively high marks, but the truth is, my heart was not in it at all. My parents kept telling me that art wasn't secure; that if I chose it, then I would end up as my brother (who is an artist and didn't complete his high school degree) and work at a restaurant with minimum wage. They told me I was so lucky to have a mind for both science and art, and that if I was going to uni, I should choose the most ""reliable"" thing: science, and more specifically, chemistry.

So I did, and as a result, I'm an artist studying in a field that I now hate and have no idea what I should do. I should also preface that my family's financial situation is pretty bad, so this forced me even more to seek a more acceptable career.

I'm in my first year of university but everyday, I find myself hating it more and more. I know this should be the ""best time of my life"", but it feels like the worst for me. I feel completely out of place and idiotic. These simple concepts that everyone seems to capture so easily are completely lost on me. My schedule is packed and the only thing that gave me a little bit of joy during my high school years, art, is something I can lo longer do because I have no time. On top of that, the subject that I chose, chemistry, is barely even taught, too! We mostly have a bunch of other subjects, like physics and geology, that I absolutely hate with a passion. 

I know I can't go on like this. I already feel myself slipping into a state of depression because of how unfulfilling my day-to-day life feels right now. But my parents have already paid for my tuition this year, and even though I'm not in the US and the prices are nowhere near as high, it did cost my family a lot. A scholarship also doesn't seem likely to happen anytime soon since the procedures to get one make it super hard for an immigrant, like me, to be granted one in my current country. 

I've contemplated just accepting depression, hiding it from everyone and trying to finish this damn degree. Unfortunately though, I'm an open book and I simply cannot hide any of my emotions. At all. My mother would know right away, and would understand that uni is what's causing this turmoil in me (since I've already discussed some of my feelings with her).

I'm at a loss. Should I tell her that I can't do this anymore? Should I drop out? The enrollment date for the art school near my area is long past, as is the deadline for getting your tuition money back if you decide to leave my university. Or should I continue for the next 4 years and just put up with it? Should I finish this year and start art the next?

I just don't know what to choose. Any help would be appreciated. 

TLDR : I'm a broke college student studying chemistry, but I actually want to do art. I hate my current situation and want to change it. What should I do?",05Nov2019,2
661,"I'm a junior in college this year. I've changed my major three times since I started and I simply cannot decide what to do, as well as having a very hard time deciding on what to do. I am currently failing all of my classes because I've lost all courage in my college career and just don't think it's for me. Looking for ideas for an alternate route - preferably one that isn't military or involving going to a different form of schooling such as a 2-year degree at a community college.

The only downside is that my parents practically control my life. They pay my car insurance, phone bill, and other things like that, and if I were to tell them I'm giving up on college, they would dump all responsibilities on me, or take the car and phone away. I have no problem taking on the responsibilities of paying for these things - I'm not an entitled brat that refuses to pay for the finer things in life - but I will need my plan b to help me to be able to pay for all of the above, as well as an apartment because I wouldn't be able to live with them for long, plus I already have plans to get an apartment with my girlfriend and our friend.

So my question to you, reddit, is what are some plan b options I could take to avoid college and still survive life, that makes enough money to afford car insurance, a phone bill, and an apartment as well as the ability to survive (food and all that)?

665," My mum is not a bad person; she is not nasty, mean or vindictive. She has never neglected or abused me. My issue with her is her lack of boundaries and her inability to empathise with how it makes me feel. 

For as long as I can remember she was overprotective. My brother and I were ‘coddled’ and she hated us going out. If I was ever to go out for the night, she would often try to subtly put me off the idea. If I was to go somewhere with friends, she would always ask me if I paid for it all. This always bothered me and she still does it to this day. Friends I have had 15+ years and she will ask me every time if I paid for their meals, hotels, trips etc. something I have never done. She is basically implying people would use me. She was always very suspicious/standoffish to new friends whenever I would first bring them around but as time progressed, she would do the complete opposite and be overly nice and regularly give them gifts. Growing up she would get involved in every argument I had with a friend, against my wishes. She has caused a lot of issues between my brother and his girlfriend for getting involved in their drama (from overhearing them argue when they lived with her). 

My biggest issue is that she lacks boundaries. If I tell her to not to do something, she will still do it because of her ‘good intentions’. When I was moving out from her place, I gathered all my belongings but there was one box I wanted to sort out before moving (things I had to throw out etc.). I specifically asked her not to touch the box and she said no problem. I come home later that night and she had moved the box into my new place to ‘help me’. She also sorted through the box herself and reorganised it for me. Another example would be when she was helping my clean out my house, I told her not to clean my bedroom as I wanted to do it myself. She said no problem and I left to pick up some bleach and when I got back, it was done. I sound ungrateful as she is trying to help but she ignores my wishes every time. She will even physically get into my personal space. She recently tried to reposition my scarf while I was driving on the highway, she will randomly try to 'fix my hair', pull down my top etc. These are just random examples but this is continuous. 

I used to let it go but I recently, I cannot handle it anymore but when I express to her how her lack of boundaries upsets me, she does not understand at all. I have told her countless times and she says the same thing “I am just trying to help”. I tell her I know her intentions are good but it makes no difference to how I feel. She doesn’t apologise and repeats the same statement over and over again. She will then either cry or go silent on me. 

I have spoke to a few people about it and I get ""that's what mums do! you would be sad if she didn't!"" which has me second guessing myself. I am 28 years old btw.

667,"Earlier today I was pulled into one of my professor's office to discuss some make-up work that I needed to do. After we discussed that he pulled out a 'mini' test from the week earlier and said that my answers matched another students almost word for word. For this test we were able to work in groups of four and while we discuss the questions and what we believe the answers are, we always write the answers on our own and definitely do not copy each other. I even named the people I work with and he claimed that the other student was not one of them. I literally do not talk to anyone else in this class but them. I was not able to compare my test to the other person's because he would not show it to me. I've been given a zero on it because he does not want to report it officially, but these are our only source of grades and a zero would really hurt. I want to take the issue to administration because I know I did not cheat, but on the off chance that me and another random student wrote very similar answers I do not think the school would care that I have never worked with whoever it is and just see two answers that are the same and call it cheating no matter the circumstance.

668,"Hi! So I have two best friends who I’ve been close with for a few years now (they don’t know each other). Over the past few months I’ve been noticing that their replies &amp; messages seem to have become more scarce. 2+ weeks could go by before I get any sort of response. They never used to be like this and there hasn’t been any major changes in their lives so I’m just really confused. 

I’m definitely not the kind of person to expect messages ever few hours or even every day. I know people get busy and I sometimes can’t reply every day so I don’t expect others to do the same. However I do think there’s a difference between missing a day and going for 2+ weeks without messaging someone while you’re also posting on social media every day, replying to post comments, and posting about how you have nothing to do on your day off. I also examined myself to see if I did or said anything that may have caused this change. I try to send a small message during the silence to show that I’m still thinking of them but nothing overboard. When they finally respond I do my best to continue conversation. 

I guess I’m just upset because it feels like being ghosted for periods of time. I understand people can’t always talk but it would be nice to receive a quick message saying “busy this week” or “don’t feel like talking to people right now”. What’s ironic is that one of these friends just messaged to complain about someone not responding to their messages when they were trying to make plans. After I listened to them vent and gave advice they stopped replying again. 

Is this a legitimate grievance? I feel hurt by their behaviour and I don’t know what I should do. I’m also the kind of person who never wants to stand up for themselves to friends because I don’t want to “rock the boat”. Should I say anything and if so, do you have any tips on what to say/how to say it?

672,"Hi, just going to post this here to try to get some outside views on my situation.

So long story short im deciding whether I stay living where I am now or move back home with my parents. I am 21 years old and was at university for 3 years but failed my exams recently and got thrown out of university. I currently live in the city I did my studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am lost on whether I move home or stay because I currently work where I am but I only make enough to get by, I have been trying to look for other jobs but its very hit or miss where I am with what industry I want to work.

I have weighed the pros and cons but there are just things on both sides that make me struggle. I am someone who struggles with mental health and it was fine up until recently, I have recently broken up with my girlfriend, been kicked out of university and I'm just a bit lost with what my next step is and feel a bit isolated. If I move home I know I will be able to find more work but I have all of my friends and social life where I am now and have no friends or anything at my home town. If I move home I still have to pay my rent for the flat I currently live in, I can try and find someone to cover my tenancy but the landlord seems to dislike it and the way my rent works is its all paid for by 1st January but tenancy is until 31st June. 

Is it worth me just moving home and getting a fresh start and starting again. I haven't got a degree and feel like i've wasted the past 3 years of my life. I'm lost on what career path I even want to do now but accounting has always been my main interest.

673,"I’ve always been the short, fat, funny guy. I’ve never felt good about my body and I love making everything funny, but when I am serious, no one takes me seriously. 

I’ve finally lost 34% of my body weight. I’ve gone from wearing 2X to smalls. I’m definitely building muscle, as well. 

This is wear sex comes in. Even after losing so much weight, I couldn’t imagine thinking of myself as sexy. Funny? Yes. Attractive? Yes. Caring, loyal? Yes. Sexy? ..... I’ve spent so many years hating the way I look, I’m finding it hard to change my thought process. I want to be able to woo my partner the way she deserves, but I feel like this view of myself is getting in the way. How am I supposed to act sexy if I don’t feel sexy? I think maybe I don’t feel serious enough to be sexy. That mixed with poor self body image.

Has anyone else struggled with your self image getting in the way of your performance? What helped?",05Nov2019,3
674,"My student got 0 on a quiz. I watched him look around for 10 minutes and look me in the eye, never writing anything. At the end of the quiz, he gave it back to me blank. I told him he had forgotten to write his name and quickly wrote it on his paper. 

Today I gave him the quiz back and he said he would never leave all answers blank and that it is my handwriting of his name, not his. He said he answered every single question. He is essentially accusing me of having lost or disposed of his test and giving him a 0. This is a crazy lie. He went to my boss to complain and wrote a written statement that he fully answered all questions. 

I am new to the school and my boss is investigating by asking other students what they witnessed during the test. This class is pretty nasty and i don’t think any of them will stick their necks out for me. 

Tomorrow I have a meeting my boss has arranged with me and the student... wtf do I do?",05Nov2019,5

He's been really trying to get me to dress in more black and listen to more rock but I haven't had the courage to tell him that that's not really who I am.

679,"We're a group that's going to Nepal in a couple days and we managed to gather a lot of donations for clothes, shoes, stationary, etc.

We also got enough money from fundraisers to cover a year-long food contract for an orphanage. After paying for that, we'll have roughly $3,200 to spend on whatever we deem the most useful. 

What would be the best way to spend this money? We're going to 2 orphanages (including the one mentioned earlier) and a community center. We're trying to find another food contract.

Current ideas are building a classroom if they have a reliable way to use it (teachers) or attempting to manage some form of more efficient bathroom to make their lives a bit cleaner.

680,"So this is probably going to be a novel, but there is tldr at the bottom

This all starts when I moved in with my best friend(x)  whom I've known since 5th grade. I moved in when I couldn't stand living with my parents anymore because they try to dictate my life like a child (I'm 21), so I called x and he had no problem driving the next state over to come get me. For a while we had no issue other than me not having a job and pure coincidence it happen to be around the time my seasonal depression hits so it was really hard for me to get out of bed let alone walk around town looking for a job. I got one from one I've the temp agencies up the road from the house. X and I decided to go together to help motivate me which I super appreciated and we both ended up getting jobs. I quite mine after a couple of months because I didn't feel like I was being fairly compensated for the work I was doing, and not too long afterwards my friend quit his job too. Time passes I end up at this fast-food place finally and I guess I'm stuck with it for the time being. My first issue came up when I noticed x didn't like working or having a job, but whatever he make his own choices. Now though it has stated to put a financial strain on the house that a part time job can't cover. On top of all of this he borrows a lot of money from me which usually goes to buying weed. (which I don't even keep track of because he's my friend) I give him half my check to cover utilities and rent and he still borrows another hundred or so Everytime I get paid. even though his girlfriend works like 70+ hours a week making more than me. He also has an anger problem, which I didn't think was a big deal some people just have bad days, but then I noticed that he was either screaming at his girlfriend, his kid or one of the dogs at least once a day. He doesn't get super pissed at me because he knows I will eventually stand up for myself if he just flys off the handle at me for eveything. He's also an animal abuser. That the only term I can use to describe his actions. I've seen him hit the dogs with just about every bunt instrument in the house. All of the dogs are terrified of him. I used to have a puppy that he have me from a litter that was born when I first moved in, about five months later I heard x getting onto my puppy for pooping in the living room and as I turned the corner from the laundry room I saw him slam my puppy on the ground and whatched him twice on the floor for a second and die right there. Only a handful of people know that last part. That was about the time i started to notice my friend changed significantly and has become a total piece of shit. Recently he's been very critical of the fact that I dont do a lot of house chores when I'm home, which us fair I usually don't, either because I'm feeling lazy, I'm just exhausted from work, or my anti seizure medication just leaves me depressed in my bed all day. At the same time x is sitting around the house 90% of the time playing video games or watching TV, ocassionally hanging out with his friend, or doing manual labor for someone once in a blue moon. My step brother who happens to be going to college in the same town offered to get an apartment with me so he didn't have to live on campus and I could move out from x's, but neither of us can save up enough money to put deposit on a place and utilities. If anything I could just save up for a studio but I run into the same problems I would have if I moved in with my brother.

TL;DR: I moved in with an old friend of mine and we've both changed so much that we can't live together.

682,"I am in college and had a class with a girl my age. She laughed the hardest at stuff I say, smiles a lot at me and to stuff I say. She said hi when she saw me ask what's up. We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me. This was the closest she's been to me. There was a whole room not a lot of other people. When I talked about another girl that likes me that I don't like and asking for advice from a woman I talk to in college to not lead her on. She joined the conversation said that the other girl will continue pushing and I have to ignore all together and tell her I'm not interested. This was the biggest response I got from her and longest convrsation. She started this stuff after I asked for advice, . I told her someone said my hair looks like the clown from it and she said that's not nice. I saw her in the hall one day we stopped seeing each other in class. She saw me and stopped and asked me how my classes were this semester and she had the biggest smile on her face. I ask her stuff and it's like she has a hard time with conversation but has the biggest smile on her face talking to me. I said my advisor would kick me out bc he knows I smoke pot and she says ""awww"" I do get an awkward forced vibe from her. I asked her how her classes were and it went over her head. I crossed paths walking on a small walkway and she didn't look me in the eye was looking down and said hey very softly, unassertively. Most recently we had to go to a lecture in the biggest lecture hall on my campus.

She then had the non competing kids go in another room to work on a skit. So I went. She acted surprised and asked if I was competing. I said yes and moved on. We’ve worked on this skit for a week now. Then comes today. She said she signed me up for a contest, says I have to remember my speech, and all that before this Saturday. I have no clue what to do.

686,"Just to clarify. I'm a 17 year old guy. I'm a pretty anxious anxious person and I've never really been great at talking to girls. 

I wouldn't really post about this stuff on Reddit but I've honestly no clue what to do about it since I don't have any friends in my class who I can exactly rely on to wingman for me. 

So there's this girl I've been into for a while. We used to sit next to eachother but lately we've all been moved around. The class is packed so I can't really move back to where I was (the other side of the classroom) . I'm usually horrible at talking to my classmates, it's all awkward and all but idk it just seemed so natural to talk to her and I guess that's where it started but that's besides the point. 

I don't have her in any other classes and we haven't ever spoken outside of class, she's usually with her best friend outside of class too. 

I've not really had a crush on anyone in months and not a proper crush in like a year so I'm clueless as to what to do. I'm terribly insecure at times and just can't ever seem to sum up the courage to talk to her especially considering she's a bit more outgoing and extroverted than me. I don't know really and this is turning into a slight vent and maybe it's an inferiority complex of some sort but even if I do like her I feel like it would be a waste for her to have to deal with someone like me.

The problem is, that I get super anxious about class tests, we will be writing one next week and I simply don’t understand, why I always get so anxious about that, like I understand everything about that topic and have had no problems with the exercises in class. Technically I should be the last one to have to worry about the class test, I have friends who are on the verge of failing this year, but even they seem to be more calm about these situations. 
These fears basically apply to any school subject I am good at, but it is definitely the worst with maths, although it is the subject I am best at. 
There are other subjects, where I am only average and I don’t have any/only little worries before a class test. 

Could this have something to do with high self expectations? But I don’t get then, why I would cause myself so much stress over this. 

Hopefully someone can help my understand why I experience these weird and unfounded fears and help me overcome them.

694,"I'm nearly finished my first semester of university already - it was just four months ago I was nervous entering the place for the first time. Where the hell did the time go? Anyway, I'm studying English &amp; History and hope to become a teacher one day. In university, I more or less have no proper social life. I know people, I'm popular enough, I'm on the students council, however, I'm never really 'bothered' to do anything outside of university, mostly because I'm always tired. The people I am close enough with just go with others and that sucks. I'm not 'close close' with anyone, and it's strange because when I tell people this they say they're the same.

I'm staying hours away from home and travel home every weekend. It's my first time away and it was tough at first, and it still is in someway. I'm staying with a family and they're nice. I find myself always thinking of home though, as my family and my girlfriend are there. I also still find myself thinking about secondary school (high school) a lot and am missing it a lot more than I thought. I miss my old friends, even though they've moved on long ago, something I feel I can't do for some reason. I miss my girlfriend a lot too when I'm away, she's going to college next year so hopefully she'll get in. I see her as much as I can on weekends, but sometimes we're busy and we go weeks without seeing each other. Despite that, it's always magical when I see her. Still, it feels strange without her sometimes.

As for my subjects, it frustrates me because I do study and I do read a lot, however, I seem to only get C's when everyone around me (who is drunk every second night) somehow gets better. The reading is hard and sometimes I don't understand it, however, I always try. It's tough going from secondary school with good grades in my subjects to average now. I'm disappointed in myself as part of me feels I'll never get it in college. I don't want to waste the experience either as I know how valuable and expensive it truly is. I don't know what to do as I feel I'm wasting it away and ruining it. Are my subjects really for me? Am I doing the right thing? Why am i overthinking so much? I really don't know. Does anyone have ant experience or advice? Thanks.

And I told him at the beginning and several time throughout our relationship that drinking and driving is the line that he cannot cross and that I would consider leaving him if he did.

Well it turns out that she panicked and said yes because she didn’t want to hurt my feelings, she then went on to friendzoned me.

It kinda sucks to get friendzoned but it didn’t matter to me half as much as the fact that she lied to me a led me on for a bit. Not to mention it feels a bit emasculating to be friendzoned and I probably look like kind of a jackass to some people

The options I’ve considered:

1. Let it go and be friends; not a bad option since I wouldn’t have to find a new lunch table and I would still have someone to talk with, but again it’s a bit emasculating to be friendzoned stay friends

2. Get her out of my life; a bit of a sucky plan but maybe not a bad one since i feel like I’d be cutting my loses and it would seem like a reasonable reaction to being lied to

Her family is very dysfunctional and she suffers from severe anxiety and depression, so i genuinely thought she was in trouble.

She used to be so disgusted by the people who does hard drugs, and even by people who smokes. I brushed it off that day because she said it while being shitfaced, so I thought it wasn’t actually true.

714,"My grandfather recently passed away and left me with his dog that he's had for the last 5 years. At first everything was okay and I was more than willing to take the furball in, but unfortunately we soon found out that my cat is allergic to him. I thought it was just because it was a new animal in the house, but after a trip to the vet it was confirmed that it's not something that will go away and he shouldn't be around the dog. 

I've tried reaching out to family members to see if any of them can take them in, but they all tell me in their own words that: *it's my problem now since grandfather left him to me*.  I'm scared to surrender him to a shelter, because I don't want him to get euthanized. I've tried to put adoption flyers up in my town, but it's been over two weeks and still nothing.

715,"This kid, we’ll call him Jack for confidential reasons. Jack and I are okay friends. More like acquaintances. We talk in one class period and a little in another. We don’t hang out outside of school, but we know each other and that’s what I’m trying to get at. 

Today he walked in class and he looked off. After trying to joke with him, he didn’t laugh. I asked him if he was okay and he shook his head know. A minute or two later, he came up to me and whispered to me that he held his father’s gun to his head to “see what it would feel like”. This is not like Jack. I don’t know Jack well, but this is not him. I don’t know what to do. He could be bluffing and just saying that because he feels depressed, but still, I cannot assume that. I need to assume the worst might happen. I don’t want to report him because he’ll have to go to a mental hospital. He’s never mentioned anything about depression, but I know it’s easy to cover up. Me and only one other person know about this. I feel like maybe he’s seeking attention, because he’s always kind of been like that, but at the same time, maybe he seeks attention because he needs help. 

I don’t know what I should do with this information. I told him that he needs to get help quickly. And I told him I’m always available to listen. I stressed it hard that I will listen to him any time, anywhere. I know him well enough to care about his situation. He could just be going through a bad week, but maybe it’s more? What do I say?

722,"I need some urgent help because I really don't know how to handle this situation. I've been employed at my job for the past 4 months and I've been doing my absolute best since I've gotten there. Including staying after shifts when they need me and showing up no matter what issues show up in life (lots of people call out), but no matter how hard I try they keep coming against me and I don't know what to do anymore.

*Long Post*

There was a situation regarding 4 women that came up to me (I work at a resort) and were bullying me and harassing me when I tried to check them in. They kept accusing me of going to charge all of their cards for extra amounts of money when I was simply explaining to them the incidental hold that was needed for only one card and they could pay however when they leave. They kept interrupting me when I was trying to explain the process to them, co-signing to each other, etc. I was really at a loss of words and very uncomfortable.

I went and told everyone in the back office TWICE about it that they were making me very uncomfortable and they basically just waved it off. A week or two later, these women proceeded to write a bad review about me and my job proceeded to write me up. I don't believe that that is fair. I did everything I could for them, showing them around property and getting their rooms right next door to each other and they still didn't care.

This is not the first time I came to my manager for a situation I needed help with. There was another supervisor who was giving me a hard time when I needed help and my manager replied that he simply didn't believe me because he doesn't believe that supervisor would ever do that. 

This same manager also speaks to me passive aggressively when I come up to him for a question or if I'm just coming to him to confirm the protocol that we have at the job making me feel unassisted and in the wrong for even asking him a question. He literally talks to me like I'm stupid. I'm very upset that within 4 months I've already received a write-up and management is not doing anything for me even though I've come to them with my problems, I haven't been getting assisted and I haven't been getting heard and they continue to say that ""they're here for us and they have our back"". 

I'm already stressed with school and health issues and I really feel like I'm alone and that no matter what my managers do, they can do no wrong and I'm constantly feeling down because no matter how hard I try to do my job, they don't care. This manager has even been going around talking about me to other people with lies saying ""I'm rude or I'm mean.""

He never even speaks to me. 

I'm planning on going to HR with these instances that I've documented. Is anyone here from HR that can give me some advice at how to go to Human Resources for help? I want to send an email to schedule a meeting with the HR director. But, I'm really scared and I really feel alone because I've received no justice or help since I've gotten there from any management. I'm in school right now and I don't need this type of stress.

725,"My boyfriend (M39), developed two bulging discs two months ago. He didn't do anything for the first month because he thought it was just back pain from sitting in his chair for a week straight practically. He went to a chiropractor (bad idea) they said something about his rib being out of place which was wrong so they had him come back a handful more times to get his back cracked. Eventually he realised nothing was getting better. His doctor didn't want to do an MRI for whatever reason.

In the middle of the night the pain was so bad he just went to the emergency room, they did an MRI and they said two bulging discs in the lower back and some deteriorating tailbone cartilage. They gave 10 days of steroids to reduce inflammation. The steroids helped the pain a lot but he was still in extreme pain when they were done. The doctor said that back pain is part of old age and he needs to get over it. He has not tried physical therapy but can't get an appointment for 6 weeks. Last night he was at the point where he was contemplating suicide and breaking up with me because he didn't want me to go through him being so crippled and he felt like he wasn't himself anymore because he was in too much pain to do absolutely anything.

729,"Approximately two years ago I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Initially, my parents were proud of me for taking the initiative and seeking mental help. However, the tables quickly turned after I was told I had GAD. They would gaslight me, tell me it wasn’t a real diagnosis because I spoke with a counselor and not “a doctor”. 

Now they are trying to coerce me into joining the military. A lot of talk about how it would be the best thing I could do for myself. How it would make me successful. I decided to be honest with them and say that I had concerns about how it might effect my mental health. I’m aware that certain things like that could bar me from enlisting at all. 

Now, the response I got wasn’t... surprising, but still disappointing. I was essentially told to lie to the recruiter (should I even WANT to enlist) and say I’m perfectly sound, mentally. I’m really really not comfortable with that... at all. On top of this, I got the same argument of “you spoke to a therapist, not a doctor, so your diagnosis is fake. it’s not on your medical records so it isn’t real etc”

I’m currently seeking follow up therapy for more reasons than one.

My stepdad told me that he believes “psychology” is a big joke because he was able to manipulate the system to get adderall. Seems kinda stupid to say it like that...

730,"Two years ago, I escaped 1400 miles to get away from my abusive partner. It was the hardest thing i’ve ever done and am still dealing with the trauma from it all. I have a long distance friend who i’ve had for years. Her partner is very abusive to her and she keeps going back to him. He tells her he will end his life without her, that he need’s her and that she’s the only thing keeping him alive. He has also showed up to her work uninvited and caused a scene and also showed up to her house after one of their break up’s and wouldn’t leave. I realize I have a subconscious bias in this situation but hopefully every one can see the picture i’m trying to paint. She was recently talking to me about him and how he’s changed and how he’s going to get help. I let her know that I love her and that I will always be there for her, but I also knew that I had to think about myself too. There have been instances in the past where I would break down crying due to the fact that I was hearing about all of these things happening after it had already happened to me. I told her that when she talks about these things it affects me negatively and that I wouldn’t like to hear any more unless she needs me. I explained that hearing certain things make me spiral down a hole that’s extremely hard to get out of. We talked about it and she understood completely but was very apologetic which isn’t at all what I was hoping for. I didn’t want her to feel sorry for me, I just needed to set that boundary for myself, which is something I struggle with. Ever since then, i’ve felt a slight rift between us. We don’t talk as frequently as before and when we do it’s usually short conversations. I feel like I messed up and executed all of this poorly but it’s hard to tell because I have always blamed myself for putting myself first.

Now to the advice bit - I have a friend who is in between houses and needs somewhere to stay for about 10 days whilst they sort somewhere new to live. I feel really bad and would love to help as I feel like bc I have my own bathroom and rarely see anyone in the kitchen it would be fine/not that much of an inconvenience for everyone for my friend to stay.

738,"Hey everyone, I am at my wits end.

I (22F) broke up with my abusive ex (45M) a few weeks ago. We met at work and were on and off together for a year. During that time, before, during and after sex, he would take photos of my body. Most of these were closeups of my ass or boobs, so my face is not in them so I don't mind.

Note: I have one distinguishing tattoo on my ribs. However, from front-view shots and rear-view shots, the tattoo is not visible.

Two months ago, whilst swimming (naked) at a lake, he took many photos of my naked body. Some from behind, some from the side, some from the front. In some, my face is not visible, in others they are. For some photos, I knew he was taking photos of me and posed, and for other photos, he took them without me knowing when I was not paying attention (i.e WITHOUT my consent!!!). After the day at the lake, I expressed my worries and asked him to delete them, but he convinced me to let him keep them.

Now that we have broken up, he has point blank refused (both on phone convos and via text) to delete them. He has become increasingly mean and vicious. He even threatened to end things with me permamently (i.e break off all contact) if he deletes those nudes. Finally, after days of back and forth, he claims to have deleted them.

On the day at the lake, he took those photos on an iPhone (presumably iPhone 5,6 or 7) and he claims to not use the apple cloud or google photos. He says he only has the photos on his external harddrive and claims to have deleted them. Because of his erratic behaviour, I don't believe him.

Long story short: he says he deleted him, but how can I be sure?  
Is there any sort of way for him to send me proof that he deleted them from his harddrive? Is there any way I can feel safer? Also I am German, and he is Irish but lives in Germany. Do I have any legal rights?",05Nov2019,1

744,"Hi Reddit, this is my first time posting. Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading.

A little while ago I (20f) broke up with my mentally abusive bf. We shared an apartment and a dog together before he moved. We couldn't afford to cancel the least as there is a pretty pricey cancellation fee that we'd have to pay. I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to take on the responsibility of keeping the apartment (as well as the dog-DUH) . I even decided to resign the lease when the original one year mark was up. This was easier for me to than finding a new place and moving again, for probably the 5th time within 3 years.

So here I am, I have an apartment all to myself and my sweetest dog, but starting to struggle financially.

I looked at my bank account and cancelled some of those forgotten or unnecessary subscriptions that keep draining my money (Spotify, PS4, Barkbox). I am working on learning how to meal prep and do weekly grocery shopping in order to prevent food waste. I am trying to find other ways to either save money, reduce costs, or maybe make some extra. 

I'm sure some of you will tell me to re-home my dog, as she is a privilege and not a necessity, but I can't. She is what keeps me going on a day to day basis as I am pretty much a loner. I go to work, come home and then spend the rest of my time at home. 

My apartment is only a small, 1 bedroom, so I can't really get a roommate. I can't think of anything else to help me. I make more than a lot of people my age, but I have a decently expensive apartment, and all the rest of my bills end up being about 4/5 of my income. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that maybe I haven't thought of, that will help me stress less about my financial situation. All advice is appreciated.",05Nov2019,2

749,"i matched with this girl on tinder and we hit it off really really well, and i admit i've fallen quite hard for her. we went on a date just a few days ago. we chatted loads, she opened up about some personal things, and it generally went quite well, her words being ""it was super nice"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

this week i feel like the dynamic in our conversations isn't the same, but i don't know if it's my fault. she admitted to me before i saw her that she's been depressed for a very long time, and for a while she's been able to deal with it fine, but as of recently it's gotten kinda bad again.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been doing my best to make sure she knows i can be there for her and such. back to what i was saying about the conversation dynamic, it feels different, idk if she's still interested.

&amp;#x200B;

since we went on the date her chat has been a little bit toned down than before we met, or at least i feel that way. her messages have been a little more bland than what i'm used to.

however, and this is gonna sound a bit weird, she's still been flirty and since our date she's sent me some nudes. today she sent me a pic of another convo she's been having with someone else from tinder, asking me ""how do i tell him i'm not interested?"". these things combined tell me that she is still interested, but her chat recently doesn't seem to reflect that, and again idk if that's my fault or if maybe it's her depression acting up. i want to ask her if she's doing ok, but i don't want to risk the potential of there being nothing wrong, and her getting offended by me asking.

i feel like she's trying a little bit less but, like i said, idk if it's my fault or her mental health. she started work somewhere new today, and i asked her to let me know how she was getting on. she did message me after it was finished to let me know she was done for today, and we spoke a bit about what it was like, but the rest of the chat today has been kinda bland like i said. she'd received some bad ish news about her health recently, and i thought i'd send her a smallish message about how she shouldn't worry, and that it'll work out etc, to which her response was along the lines of ""i don't worry it's ok"" and ""ty x""

last night was alright though, we were sending silly pictures back and forth, and she was dancing around mimicing some video that i sent her, and playing along with my jokes and such

i'm just very confused, and it's really getting to me because i really like her.

basically, i wanna know - is it me, or is it her? from what i can tell she's still into me, what with the nudes and asking me for advice on how to ignore other guys, but i'm not too sure. should i just assume she's not been having good days as of recently?",05Nov2019,0
751,"I'm in my third and final year of university. I'm studying economics and computer science. However, most of my course is majoring in economics, I dont get a huge selection of computing modules, so I try to focus in what sounds most interesting. 

But the module I picked this term. Oh god. First off, I found out that I shouldnt have been able to even pick it in the first place, apparently I haven't done any of the prerequisites and required second year modules. The guy told me I'm probably going to fail because i have none of the prior knowledge. Second off, i have an assignment due in Friday, I need to make an IoT device, i got a bunch of parts and dev board, but I honest to god dont even know what I'm looking at. 

I've been emailing anybody at the university asking for help, or if it would be possible for me to change modules this late into the term (deadline for changing is week 2, its week 7 now) I'm hoping because I shouldnt have been able to pick this class in the first place, they'll make an exception. But so far it's just been a bunch of emails back saying ""not sure, email this other person"". And I'm just stressing out.

Like honestly, I dont think I can pass this module, like not even 40% minimum. I'm just completely lost on what to do and I cant proper study everything for it because I have other modules and a dissertation to write. 

I did find out that if I can manage a 70 average in everything else and get a 0 on this class, I can still come out of uni with a 2:1 around 65%, but that would require getting a 70 average in everything else, which might be doable, but no idea

754,"Hi r/advice, this isn’t as serious or urgent as other posts but it’s been bothering me for a while and I need to get it off my chest and hear other people’s advice on this. I’m currently 21 years old in uni and generally enjoying life, learning interesting things and having a good time. Here’s the problem: I still think about an ex-girlfriend and a relationship I was in 3 years ago quite often. 

We dated for 2 years and a bit (when I was 17-19) and she was the first and really only person I’ve fallen in love with. We had a lot in common and had a generally great relationship for a long time. We were both very happy and in love. She eventually broke up with me and I was pretty torn up about it as at the time I didn’t see it coming and didn’t understand why she wanted to end our relationship. We continued to be “friends” for a year but I still had feelings for her and was still very raw about the whole situation. Once the summer came I dropped all contact with her, deleted her off all social media and haven’t spoken to her since in an effort to get over her.

Since then(3 ish years) I’ve had other short relationships and crushes but I’ve never felt that level of connection with anyone else. I feel like I’ve moved on from her but when I get lonely I think about what a great relationship we had and how I haven’t felt that way since then. 

So is it normal to still feel this way about an old relationship? Should I try and get some closure? Is there anything I can do to stop feeling this way? Any advice is appreciated, feel free to ask any questions, I’m not the best at expressing how I feel.",05Nov2019,1

763,"Hey y'all.

I'm 15 y.o. female and my closest friend started distancing me. So he is a really hard person, he don't want to tell u some problems,but he shows u that he needs help, and i want to help him, i'm forcing him to tell me but he is very stubborn and nervous. I always tell him about my feelings(cause he is asking me) and he is like a therapist for me, we are there for each other in horrible and good moments but 2 weeks ago he started avoiding me, he is very impulsive and have a heart of baby, he was angry about me cause i was talking with other people and not him every time. We wanted to sit on a carousel but there was only one place left and i sat on it without him so he got upset and never talked to me after that day, and he was very aggressive when i tried to talk to him and help him get happier for a moment.
 he said that i was his only true friend and he wasn't mine. it's wrong actually,i have never had such a good friend and i really miss him, i want to tell about my life and to talk and laugh about memes and etc. And he wants too,i know it, he told that to friend of ours,but couldn't do the first move,he wanted to but couldn't ( I'm not surprised,he is not a very brave person or, uhmm i don't how to call it) and when he is angry or resentful about me,he doesn't even LOOK at me,but i know he wants to be my friend again. I need him and he needs me. He is very funny and always makes jokes about everything in class but he is really depressing and have a really depressed life, he turns all his pain in humor and we were doing it together before that happened. His mood changes too fast.like he has a bipolar disorder.(actually if he will start talking to me should a tell him this?)

But the main problem is, this isn't first time, he acted like that twice, once i didn't even know the reason, and I always was writing him and trying to chat but he wasn't. And then he said ""uhmm hey,can you forget about me acting such an asshole and contact with me as good old days? I happy about that. But this time it's a complicated situation, i don't message him cause i have my principals too and i shouldn't make the first move always. But it's hard to him to make the first move and I don't know what to do. Even if i try to chat, will he answer me? 
My friend told me to not to wait and start with a big text of explaining his personality and our relationship.and may be mention to get screened for bipolar disorder.

I miss him, often if something good or bad happens in my life, or if i see some good meme,in that moment i think ""oh i will tell/show him"" but then i remember that i can't  and it makes me really sad. But that's not only about my wish, I think he needs me cause he told me that before getting angry.

767,"I started working at my current job 12/27/2019. This job requires you to work outside all year in ALL weather conditions, because of this the employer gives a $400 clothing allowance so you’re more prepared for the job and weather. 

Unfortunately they only give this allowance once a year- in October. Since I was hired at the end of December (the coldest time of the year btw) I wasn’t eligible for this allowance but myself as well as another employee hired around the same time were told we may be entitled to a “partial clothing allowance”. While we waited for the “partial clothing allowance” we had to purchase our own coats, long johns, wool socks, gloves, boots, hats etc. to be equipped to withstand the negative degree temperatures and feet of snow our area gets trampled with. Living in the north you already have most of those items but I didn’t own items for long exposure to the cold. I mostly owned things that kept me warm while I ran to my car, than to my office, only for a min or so outside. We also had to purchase things for the 100degree summer heat including light weight clothing, shorts and multiple pairs of shoes(we walk anywhere from 10-20miles in a day we go through shoes quickly!) So I purchased all these things with my own money. 

Fast forward to September 3rd of this year. I applied for another job not expecting much as I have applied for this company in the past and never heard anything. To my surprise they called me for an interview, then a second interview- at this point I notified my boss that I was interviewing for another job (on September 23rd). The job I interviewed for is on a military base, the background check was extensive which included my current boss being interviewed by a military official, and weeks of questioning my friends, family, former bosses and coworkers, fingerprinting, hearing tests, etc...

During this background check it was time for our yearly clothing allowance at my current job, which we received on Oct. 11th. I’d just like to add, that same week we received the allowance we were hit with a freak winter storm.  The temperatures didn’t go above freezing, they were anywhere from 2-25degrees that week.

We receive ‘credit’ (not cash) to be used at 4 local outdoor clothing stores. I bought a coat, jackets, long johns, hiking boots, and gloves and my $400 was spent quickly as quality winter gear is not cheap! The women who runs the office was encouraging me to spend the money quickly so she could turn in the paperwork, she even scolded another employee because he hadn’t purchased anything in the first 2 weeks that we received the allowance. 

On October 31st I received a verbal offer of employment via phone from the place I applied to. I gave my 2 weeks notice to my current job on Nov. 1st. I signed a written offer of employment on November 4th. 

Today November 5th my boss called me into the office and told me they MAY require me to pay my clothing allowance back because “I knew I was getting another job and still spent the money”. I am completely irate! Not only was I encouraged to spend the money quickly but my boss and office women knew for weeks I was a candidate at another job, they never once told me to hold off on the allowance until I heard from them or that a scenario may occur where I’d have to pay back the money. I was also totally unsure of the other job offering me employment based on an alcohol related ticket I got 10 years ago and I knew how extensive the background check was. I had no idea if I would be selected or not so I prepared myself for the winter weather by purchasing winter clothing! 


I sent them a copy of my signed offer of employment which included the date (Nov 4) and told them they could compare that to the dates on the receipts from when I purchased the clothing (3 weeks earlier!). They told me they would discuss it and then make a decision and may only require me to pay back “some” instead of all of it. Which I still think is bullshit! I told them I am more than willing to return the items they said “the stores probably won’t accept the return”. I have children and every cent I have is budgeted out so I can purchase them items for Christmas.  To have the possibility of $400 taken from my paycheck will totally wreck my kid’s Christmas. 

I feel I should present them with an itemized list of clothing I had to purchase with my own money and tell them I am owed reimbursement...

I just need advice or opinions. Am I wrong? Should I repay them? Or should I fight this tooth and nail?",05Nov2019,1

776,"For a little background, my kid has significant anxiety. He has generalized anxiety disorder but in general his major stressor is school. The unfortunate part of his anxiety is that it manifests as oppositionality. That means that when he is extremely anxious, he is often rude. He will talk back. He won’t stop asking questions or trying to clarify things at these moments. He can’t let things go. It can be very frustrating to those in authority. Yesterday he had a meeting to reintegrate back to school after a 3-day suspension, which was for leaving a school party when he wasn’t supposed to, then arguing with the principal about how that incident occurred, ultimately calling her a liar as she was accusing him of something he claims he didn’t do. Despite having the right to be present at yesterday’s meeting, I was deliberately excluded by the administration and told I wasn’t invited. This sudden change was surely very anxiety-provoking to my son, as was the admin’s refusal to allow my
son to have a resource staff member there to support him. He came out of the meeting and told me he had been “suspended indefinitely” and was no longer allowed to attend that school. The principal’s reason for expelling him was that he was “extremely oppositional” during the meeting. For his part, my son says that they were calling him oppositional for not agreeing to things they were accusing him of. He has been called “rude” in my presence in the past by admin for the same reason...denying something happened when they claimed it did. In that case, admin was ultimately proven wrong. In any case, even if my son was being very rude, would rudeness warrant expulsion? Important to note as well that I had just filed a complaint against this administration with our regional
director’s office last Friday. They sent an email with my grievances listed directly to the principal that expelled him. Important to note as well that he does not get into trouble at school.

I get frustrated (like when driving for example), I can be playful and agressive with my SO (they know I'm joking, I always say sorry if I take it too far) but once something pisses me off I skip seeing red and just go straight to black. The last argument I was in I had lapses of memory and from hearing about it and the snip-bits I remember I said some truly awful things and even became agressive...right in front of my infant. 

I of course took full responsibility for my side and my actions. I knew at a certain point I was getting to the point of breaking and instead of walking away I stupidly tried to deescalate the situation  and I failed miserably. I know I shouldn't have handled it the way I did, not to put the blame entirely on me because it takes two to tango but I know how I acted and it was wrong.

In the moment though its like I've taken a back seat and someone else has picked up the reigns. I have no control or choice in what I say and though I try to stop myself I physically can't and I absolutely hate myself afterwards.

I maybe have these boughs of anger once every 4-5 months. Me and my SO bicker at times and disagree but we typically can sit down and talk things out once things escalate in any way shape or form. 

..But when me and my mom argue it's impossible to descalate due to her being passive Agressive, (that being a huge trigger for me and she's aware) and not listening when I try to speak (talking over me to the point I scream because i think its the only way Ill get heard) me and my SO live with her right now due to new baby and trying to save money.

I do NOT want this around my child. I don't know if I should get help, and I don't know if I should come up with an at home plan but I don't want people to walk on eggshells around me.. I'm not an angry person, I just don't know what gets into me when I do become angry, and I feel so out of control. I feel like a monster. 

How can I get a handle on this? Do I need to set up a contingency plan? Or should I get professional help? If I can handle it on my own I would rather do that but.. I just don't know anymore 

Tldr; I'm not an angry person. When I do get angry though it's explosive and destructive and I don't know what's wrong with me or what I should do about it. All I know is it needs to stop because I don't want to be like this

Luckily, I am right next to Starbucks and also next to a little table with way more comfortable seats. But again, boss doesn't want me to leave the kiosk other than Starbucks(I guess the mall would potentially fine him). 

He said he would show up randomly everyday(tommorow is my first day alone so I don't know if he will stay true to his word, especially considering he manages 5 other mall kiosks in 5 other malls in different areas)so that gives me anxiety but good Lord this job goes by so slow yet it pays too much for me to quit!!",05Nov2019,2
779,"Hi guys :) 

So I’ve been struggling for a while financially, I’m starting to finally get a grip on everything. I planned on leaving a little amount of money on the site for my next paycheck (this Friday) to do something for the weekend for me and my boyfriend. (He currently is not working and we are not having any other financial help except my paycheck to cover all expenses as we are waiting on his Visa Greencard to be Approved, we came from Germany but I’m an American citizen) 
So for over one year I have been working straight 6-7 day’s a week until recently when I started this new job where I’ve been having Saturday and Sunday off. But now after a while I just feel worn out too, I know I’m young and I know other people have it worse but I just feel exhausted too 😞 long story, short my bad 😂 
I really need like a break and want to do something fun to forget about all the stress for at least just once day. I live around Orlando and I’m not 21 yet so I can’t drink 🍹 does anyone have any fun recommendations as to what to do for the weekend to get a break where I don’t have to spend a lot of money? 
Thank you in advance 🙂",05Nov2019,2
780,"Okay so this is a throwaway because my ""friend"", let's call him Mike, knows my account. 

Anyways, this so called friend is more of a coworker than a friend. We're cool and all but we don't talk too much outside of work. I've met his boyfriend twice, once when I first started getting to know said Mike and the second time about 2-ish months ago. We didn't interact much but he seemed like a down to earth person and thought I was, too. 

So at work the other day, Mike's boyfriend came up to me out of nowhere while I was working (we work in retail) and gave me a wad of cash. I was very confused until he explained that he couldn't find Mike and that he had to leave and that he trusted me to give the money to Mike. Although I was uncomfortable, I took the money to give to Mike. 

Now, I could see Mike's bf from my peripheral as he was leaving and looked over to say bye, only to find him standing there smiling at me and then blow a kiss at me. He then winked and left without another word. I stood there not knowing what to do except to ask myself, did that really happen? I think I might be overreacting and it might just be a normal thing he does but I found it odd and don't know if I should tell Mike or not. I've asked my partner and they said to not mess with it, that it's not my business. What do, Reddit?",05Nov2019,1
781,"So a bit of a backstory: I met this guy(21) a few months ago on the Internet, he messaged me on twitter and we started talking. We have a lot in common and I honestly haven't met someone so genuinely thoughtful and wonderful in years. We live in different countries, around 2k kms away from each other. At some point he kind of asked how I feel about long distance relationships which I'm absolutely terrified of and he said he completely understands and has never mentioned it again.

Though, at some point we were talking about moving in together(which is still wayyyyy too early for me and is not going to happen anytime soon) and I'd love to be able to spend every minute I can with him because I do genuinely love him but lately I've been having these thoughts where I'm not sure I want to be in a relationship at all. It's absolutely not his fault, I just feel like I'm not the type of person who belongs in a relationship. I enjoy being free and doing whatever I want whenever I want and I know I'm being selfish because I don't think I'll be able to sacrifice some of my freedom for another human being. I was never able to truly express my feelings due to past trauma with abuse and I feel like I'd be exposing myself enough for someone to hurt me again(I'm 100% sure he wouldn't do that but y'know)

I don't really know what I should do in this situation, I've been in three relationships before and I never felt good enough to stay for longer than about a year. Any advice would be much appreciated.

784,Has anyone had a fling and just could not get over it? It happened over 19 yrs ago. I think about it when my needs aren't being met. It wasn't a great fling. The attention I received was amazing. You know like when you first start dating. I miss that. I want that again. Sad I know. How do I move past this?,05Nov2019,2
785,"So for context, everything in my life until this moment has been good. I had a good childhood. A good group of friends. A steady job. A loving girlfriend. I'm 22 years old and I've been living on my own since I was 17.

In January of 2019, I was offered a new job with the potential (potential meaning it was a 100% commission based position) to make 4 times as much as I was making at that time. The caveat? I had to move to a new bigger city 20 hours away from home. Not bad right? That's it? Yeah. On top of this, my company would pay for accommodations, supplied me with a company vehicle and a company phone. This is where it started. 

Moving away from my family, friends and girlfriend was difficult at first but I tried to find a healthy new balance. Initially my first few checks were massive in comparison to what I had made previously. But slowly over time they began to get smaller and leveled out just UNDER what I use to make. I searched for advice from my new peers and the conclusive answer I got was I had too many distractions back home. My focus wasn't where it needed to be. And I believed it. I stopped talking to my old friends. And in June, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 and a half years. At the time I thought this would benefit us both as I could focus more on work and she could focus more on her school. Plus, the distance between us made things difficult enough as is. So that was that. 

A few weeks later my company overpaid me and ending up clawing back $1600 off of my next check. I had a $3.99 check that payday.  And since at this point - without having to pay for rent or bills - I had developed a bit of an overspending habit, I took out a loan to cover the debts I have. BIG MISTAKE. One loan turned to two. Two to three. Then my paychecks started to get worse and my debt just managed to continue to get bigger. A few months later my checks got even worse, I was barely surviving at that point. My checks would hit the bank, and immediately get sucked up by debts leaving my barely enough for basic necessities.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings me to today. I found out I'm being fired for a lack of production. This means I will have no home, no vehicle, and no phone in a matter of a week. I do not have any friends that will let me sleep on a couch or family who I am able to contact. I have no savings as that all got sucked up during my harder months. I'm about to be completely fucked and I'm so stressed my physical health and mental health are slowly evaporating in front of my eyes. What the fuck should I do? What the fuck can I do? Any and all advice is incredibly humbling &amp; appreciated.",05Nov2019,2

794,"Hello reddit, I need hella advice. Im currently taking a discrete maths class, and I bombed the midterm spectacularly, like a literal 50%, 16 points below the class average.  The thing is, on the previous two assessments we were given, I did pretty well, I was half a point below an A on the first one and I got a 100 on the second one. I thought that the whole unlimited time thing was the reason, as well as access to the internet was the reason, as well as the ability to check answers with my friends but upon review my midterm, I realized that this wasn't the case. 

Im just really dumb. Like, I lost ten points because I magically forgot how to divide during the midterm, another six because I mixed up the definitions of two terms, and several other points because I did not read the questions properly (did not simplify all the way). I'm so mad, like how can I be so stupid? Like, the exam was so much easier than the assignment. I get that I got a few extra points on my assignment because I get my friends to peer review my assignments before hand (mainly because I have a bad habit of either forgetting to turn in assignments or mixing up math symbols), but I never had an issue in the class to the point where I only understand 50% of the material. Is there anyway I could possibly get over this hurdle? I feel like this wasn't an issue of me not studying enough, as I would at the very least get an average grade if that was the case.

I found out about three years ago that my moms step dad set up cameras around the house, in the showers, in bedrooms to watch my aunts nude! even my parents in the bedroom I guess.... not me btw I wasn’t even born. 
The thing is, my beautiful aunt who was being watched DOESNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS AT ALL
I love my aunt! I’m about to go to her house right... she takes me traveling she owns a restaurant she’s single with no children, she’s a lovely person. shes also sorta intimidating 
but everyone, my parents, sibling,grandparents, aunts, hide it from her! 
I always question their view on this. I get it’s not my opinion but i keep asking why they don’t tell her..
Their responses are things like 
“What you don’t know can’t hurt you” 
Or even this one that makes more sense: “they don’t see each other that often anyway”
I went boating with them this summer! It was a struggle to not let that cat outta that bag I was talking about it the whole time to my mom
Maybe it doesn’t matter, but my aunt says her personality is INTJ. 
I believe that everyone!!!!!!!! deserves the truth. 
If it were me ID HAVE TO KNOW. it kills me to keep something like this, I asked my mom (they’re twins btw) what she would want to have happen if it was her and she said she’d rather not know. Idk what my aunt would want.... 
what would u do?stay out of what’s not mine? 
Things like this have ran in both sides of my family..... 
but I feel alone in being the only one thinking that my aunt DESERVES to know that she was being watched in the shower by who she thinks is an innocent man. 
Since I’ve never brought it up, maybe she DOES know. But everyone says she doesn’t

He also made nonsensical decisions like taking a shower knowing he would be late and changing his trousers after he spilled juice on them at breakfast.

He goes to my school so we often see each other the days where we both have school. During our first vacation I found out that he was gay but not out. I waited until after our vacation to tell him I knew about his secret and he was completely shocked. I didn’t tell him that I was gay until weeks after when he heard a Grindr (gay app) notification sound from my phone. From that point we became even more close, now sharing our gay experiences with each other. He’s been on and off (2.5/3 years) in this toxic relationship with this guy who’s extremely abusive and manipulative and has threatened his life multiple times. Being a good friend i of course let him know that this isn’t worth the trouble regardless of how amazing the sex is. He agrees but somehow always finds himself back over there. Anyways, during our second vacation we ended up getting super drunk one night and hooked up. The next day we acted as if nothing happened and continued on enjoying the rest of our vacation. Till this day we’ve never spoken about it, which is no issue for me at all.

He calls/texts me basically everyday, we know each other inside and out. He tells me EVERYTHING about his on and off again situationship and stresses that he despises the guy.

For the negative comments, a majority of female peers and I think it’s unfair that the trans student speaks badly about the non-trans girls bodies because she got everything IMPLANTED. 
The student also goes into the girls restroom and makes sexual conversation about other girls bodies and tries to see them fully exposed. 
Student gets very upset over small things and threatens to punch and beat other girls.
Today, she threatened my friend and I saying “If you don’t stop reporting me I’m gonna f**** punch you bitches in the face!”.

Her threats have meaning because she has attacked many female students and beaten them badly.

812,"I am so freaking emotional and I feel like this has only gotten worse with age. Sorry if this is long, it’s a mixture of examples and rambling. 

My boyfriend and I live together, we have a great relationship and rarely fight. He’s really shown me a lot about myself - one major thing is that I really struggle to accept blame/apologize. Not a great quality to have but I’m working on it. 

The other day before work he told me something that I do that bothers him. He was very calm and not attacking in any way. My immediate reaction is to deflect...what is HE doing that MAKES me do this thing he doesn’t like?! I realize I’m being ridiculous, apologize, and tell him I’m going to work on it.  Seems reasonable? Maybe if I wasn’t holding back tears the ENTIRE time. And it’s not something unnoticeable. It’s the lip quivering, can barely get a word out, about to explode situation. Over NOTHING.  Just normal, everyday interactions make me upset if they don’t go PERFECT. 

And that’s pretty much how it always goes in any sort of confrontational situation with anyone. I always want to cry. Even if a situation makes me angry, I want to cry and it feels like I have no control over it. 

Another example - a few weeks ago I got really sick for 48 hours and had to miss work for 2 days. My PTO is pretty limited for the rest of the year, so I was going to do whatever I could to make up time and not take a paid day off. I could tell that my boss was not happy with it, but was okay with it, just by the tone of his voice. I could barely speak to respond because I could feel my lip quivering like I was about to burst into tears. Just him being slightly disappointed was enough for me to have to excuse myself to the bathroom to dab TEARS FROM MY EYES. 

I get frustrated at work or don’t understand an assignment? I can feel tears welling up. WHY?

I’m confident. I like myself. I like my life and I’ve worked very hard for it. 

I haven’t always been like this. I was a very emotional, anxiety-ridden child, but I really came out of my shell in high school and definitely bloomed in college. Now it seems like as an adult, when my life is the best it’s ever been and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, I’m just always full of emotion and I want to find actual ways to deal with this. It’s not just crying. I do feel like I get irrationally angry, annoyed, irritable over little things and it’s hard for me to let go at times. 

I feel like I should mention I’ve been diagnosed with OCD. It’s mild, I don’t take anything for it, it’s usually pretty manageable. My therapist told me some of my emotions may come from my incessant need to please people, but I’m SICK of being told to meditate, be “mindful”, be “aware of myself”. I want some RESULTS.

813,"So I live in a house with 3 of my best friends from over the last decade. One of us has been falling behind recently, and we all want to help him up so we can continue living here without issue. We live in an area where rent is high and growing every year. Luckily, the four of us get along so well that in the last 2 years any issues we had with each other or with life were solved and celebrated within a week. The one who’s fallen behind recently quit his job. He claims he’s going through a midlife crisis besides being 27 and only having started his adult life at 25. Before that he rarely ever had a job and definitely didn’t have any plans on moving out of his parents. His parents and I kind of forced him to move because they were afraid he never would. 

In the last 2 years, he turned his life completely around. He went through a couple of jobs, but was quick to find a new one. He’s a stoner too and was easily able to quit for months on end for a job that tested. He also has a gf that is very self centered and has an inflated sense of entitlement and ego. We’ve had a couple of problems with the two of them, including her living a the house rent free, we took care of it. She also once lost, found, and then forgot about so therefore killed his pet snake that was under her care right after we moved in, and while he was on vacation with his family. The only other slight issue that we’ve had with him, is that he is blind to mess and smell, we take the extra effort to make sure we all keep the house clean though and it hasn’t been a problem. 

But last month it’s like he just gave up. He’s calling it a midlife crisis. He quit his job just because he didn’t want to do it anymore. Despite the fact that it was the best job he’d ever had, his own words. He now just lives on the couch, playing video games and watching anime. Even his gf just sits next to him silently for hours on end. On top of that he’s been spending like crazy so we know that rent isn’t necessarily the top priority right now. And we say that knowing how much he had saved up, and knowing he’s already almost through half of it and it’s only been a month. Since he’s not trying to find a job at the moment, it’s cause for concern. 

We want to help him up to his feet because if he’s calling this his midlife crisis I’m afraid to see where he’ll be at when he is actually in his 40s. If anything he’s having a failure to launch and it’s due to his own self-sabotage. We all want to help him, but at the moment talking to him is like talking to a child. He’s lying and making stuff up just so we’ll leave the issue alone. But he’s on the lease and if he doesn’t pay rent that not only ruins the household, it ruins the friendship. For the record too, we do have a plan on how to handle this, we’re just making sure we get as much anonymous input as we can first, to make sure no good idea gets left out.",05Nov2019,1
816,"I have a unique case of T1 diabetes. I have no family history of it and was diagnosed at 28 after a very bad accident. My doctor told me it was most likely brought on by the injury. 

I have went through the DOT physical a few times but never as a diabetic. I know I meet the requirements to obtain one, but I am worried one of the steps. I already lost a job in the beginning of the year because of their unwillingness for them to wait for my insurance to kick in and I didn't want to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for the visits and tests. 

What I am asking is if anyone can explain how the process works and how long it takes. Also because of not having insurance ive really had to ration my insulin, so my BGL has been pretty high.

823,"Hey redditors, I am a 20M college student whose father passed away when I was in high school and  mother passed away last July. As a result I have inherited more money than I'll ever need. If I never wanted to work another day in my life, I wouldn't have to. I have fully processed the loss of my parents but there is something else that is still stressing me out.

 I feel like I now have a substantial amount of power that I could use for good, but I have no idea where to start. I am reluctant to talk about this with my friends because my remaining family have told me not to disclose how much money I have to anyone. I have considered starting a business but I have no clue what kind of business I would want to start or how to run a business. My major passions in life are learning foreign languages (I taught myself Russian, Swedish, and Japanese), drones and robotics, and I have more recently gotten into music production. I would love to do something involving one of these fields, but I don't know exactly what.

Due to the stress of my mother passing away, I dropped all my classes in college to take the semester off. I was studying Economics but to be honest I was only ever in college because it was expected of me. I hate school, it feels like a waste of both time and money and I don't want to go back. I just can't learn by listening to somebody ramble on for an hour, I need to do something myself to really learn it. All the skills I have mentioned above were picked up out of school on my own time. I am not sure if I want to go back or not, but I know that if I do go back I don't want to study Economics anymore which would mean not graduating on time.

I have a bad feeling that 2 likes 1. I’ve known 2 for 3 years or so. 2 is very boy crazy and she’ll like basically any boy that she comes across. She’s liked 1 before and she tried multiple times to get with him. But she failed. 2 is actually the one that got 1 and I together. And she really supports our relationship. And she’s so proud of us. She really cares about 1 and I appreciate that. Lately though, she’s been getting quite close and clingy to 1. She always wants to be with him and she always flirts with him. I’m very very obsessive and clingy to 1. And the fact that 2 is getting really close makes me uncomfortable. I know how 2 acts when she likes someone. And she’s doing the same things to 1. I don’t trust 2 even though she’s my best friend. She’s not a very trustworthy person. However, I do trust 1. I just want to find out for sure if 2 likes 1 and I was wondering if anyone on here would know how.

831,"My job is a nightmare from heck. I started over three months ago, I've passed 90days at my job. And technically under my employment contract, I should have received a pay raise and benefits for the last two weeks. However, that's not happening because I ""must PASS probationary status in the opinion of the company"". Basically, they told me that they're gonna hold out, and no matter how hard I work, not pay me benefits/salary increase until I am a ""satisfactory"" employee. Which is..... something. 

I've not received hardly any feedback about my progress in my role. My manager, the person who hired me quit, (he told me he was planning to weeks in advance), and the CEO tried to make it look like my manager was fired suddenly. 
I've had senior staff members scream at me in my office for following my manager's directions. 
I've had the HR/payroll department laugh in my face when I explained that the reason I was 8min late one day was the literal blizzard outside, (I was the second person to the office?) and later overheard ""well she should have left her house earlier!"" 
I've been told I cannot talk to some of my co-workers in the office. Not gossiping. Meaning I couldn't ask questions of other people, just the CEO. 

I have access to my predecessor's emails and they started in Sept 2018, and as of April 2019, had still not received insurance coverage. All of this is sketchy af, right? 

Cue this week. I have no management, as my last boss has not been replaced, and all upper management has been at conferences the last 2 weeks. Instead, I am required to text the CEO everything I do, every account I handle. I've had two doctors appointments the last Friday's. One I knew about a solid month in advance - as they book out months in advance, I got lucky. I put in the time request as soon as I knew. I took a half day. I attached my literal appointment confirmation email. The person I handed it to (the CEO'S daughter, who works in management) ""lost"" it, and payroll literally came to me being like wtf where were you last Friday. 

Last Monday, my doctor got results back, and wanted to go over with me and plan a treatment plan. He had appointments Fridays or Mondays. I again, stapled the request to my timecard as soon as I knew, and moved on. Payroll ripped off my request because it ""wasn't November yet"" and did lord knows what with it. Monday, I brought in my doctor's note, stapled it to my timecard, moved on.

This morning, I get a personal text from the CEO. ""No leave will be approved if no leave application is submitted in advance."" That's it. That's the message. 

Mind you, I've submitted leave requests for anytime I've left work. And I took HALF DAYS on my two doctor's appointment days, and brought in proof of where I was, did everything as above board as possible, and am still getting berated for it. 

Upper management, including the CEO is back tomorrow, and I'm having a panic attack. I have two interviews on Friday for other positions. My husband and I have enough savings for a few months if I quit. And I cried at my desk today. I've never walked off a job, but I don't think I can handle this any longer. What do I even do.",05Nov2019,1
832,"Okay, so the title basically explains it. I have had a friend with benefits for about to two weeks now (haven’t done anything for about a week bc we decided to not do anything until after my exams). 
Then last weekend I went to a Halloween party and this guy fancied me and asked if I want to go out sometime, I said yes and gave him my number. 
I don’t know if I want a relationship though, a few reasons: I got out of a year long relationship about 5 months ago, so I want to have some more time to myself. I’m also freshly 18 so I can go out now, meaning I can talk to or kiss (if the opp comes up) anyone I want, I can just do my own thing. And lastly, I’ll be going away for almost a month soon and starting a r/s won’t be practical. Also I think next year I’ll be living overseas for a bit, also not practical.
So, I don’t want to lead this guy on by saying we could have a relationship at some stage, however I did tell him that I don’t think I want a relationship right now.
As for the fwb, I don’t really want to give that up either.
So I don’t know what to do here, keep dating this guy and have a fwb, or drop the fwb and see where the dating thing goes. I don’t want it to look like I’m hoeing around either. But I can finally do stuff, and I want to live it up without getting tied down too quickly.

833,"I’m not proud of it. And I wish to god that I could just get out and go to school like every other highschool student. On all levels I’ve lost motivation to exist. My mother’s absence could be a part of it. I have no other parent that I live with. We live in a city with no extended family. When I do go to school, I have to stop myself from sitting on open windows or talking to any of my mutual friends because It make’s me feverishly manic on the inside. If it gets too much to hold in I’ll go in a bathroom stall and carve out some sort of fucking release. 
Nothing makes sense and I have no control over anything. I’m afraid of what I’ll do if I’m in that school building full of disappointment and restless worthlessness. 

No way of getting a therapist or talking to a school counselor. Our dean will just put you on godamn suicide watch if you tell them how you’re feeling and call it a day. How the hell are you supposed to trust that shit? 
I’m disgusted with myself that I can’t just function like a normal fucking human being, that I can’t just suck it up. The self resentment always seems to slip through the cracks. I don’t want anybody to worry about me, waste their time, pity me with coddling. 
I want time to stop. 
For it all to be over with, gone. 

I’ve thought about leaving school for a year to do ‘home tutoring’ with my extended family who lives out of state. They’ve offered and are willing as long as I know how difficult the change might be and the commitment it will take. 
But I have no clue if my mom would even allow that. She doesn’t take anything I’ve told her seriously or disappears for a couple days so she can forget about it. Ran away from home in the past for almost 2 weeks and she didn’t call, text, or even notice/care. When I told her that I left after I came back she had the same sneering look of “Oh really? Did that really happen? Oh are you gonna cry?”. And yet she’s offered things. To get CBD oil and a psychiatrist and all this shit that she never follows up on.

I’m done. I want out, and I can’t stand another second of her pretending to care. Material shit doesn’t matter to me or mean anything in the long run. Hell, she neglected to get basic needs like food and toilet paper for weeks on end last year and came back with a couple shirts as some sort of makeup gift and called it a day. 
I’m fucking done.

836,"Hi guys, 

I am currently studying Computer Science at my  local university here in Austria and I dont really like it. The whole programming stuff doesnt suit me as much as I wished it would and overall it seems to be the wrong degree for me overall. To be fair I was quite naive when choosing what to study, so I made my own bed on that one. Now I have to find something else and man its so hard to find something when you dont know what you want to do with your life. 

The thing is I am quiet anxious about the fact that if I quit my CS degree and cant manage to find something equal looking on the payment side that I will regret this decision down the line.

I am currently trying to evalute what seems to be the best fit for me and where I have my strenghts. I somehow enjoy working with and learning languages as it was always quiet easy for me to learn the whole grammar side of a language. At my commercial college I learned 5 years Russian and as things are when you are young and an idiot you dont think about the long run and what possibilties you have with foreign languages. What I want to say with that is that although I really enjoy foreign languages I kind of let it slip in the last 2 years at commercial college so my grades werent that great.

842,"Hello Reddit, I [24F] have a great friend [27F] who I became very close to in the trade school we attend together. We are in the same class and also hang out at times outside of school. 

When we first met, she was a little quieter and smiley. Very pleasant to talk to. She is a mother of 2 younger children and married for 7 years. 

As we became closer and I would casually speak of my mental illness issues (I’m very confident with where I’m at mentally, and never feel I should be ashamed of my struggles), she became more comfortable around me and opened up about herself and her struggles. 

She seems very depressed, and unhappy in her marriage. She feels stuck in the marriage because of her finances and her kids. But the biggest issue that she shows is her self hatred. Every day, every time we are at school, she speaks of having no confidence, constantly says “I can’t do this” or “god I suck at this, I’m so horrible) and has to go to the bathroom and be upset. I feel so bad for her. She texts me to come console her constantly during class in which I reassure her over and over again but nothing really helps. I have definitely given the advice of therapy and I can only say so much, but she is having trouble reaching out to a therapist because of fear that her family (husband) might judge her. Her parents are super busy with their work and have always been pretty lame parents in general and she can’t talk to them. 

And as much as this makes me feel like a total asshole, the constant remarks about hating herself and having to reassure her is exhausting. I am at school trying to learn my craft as well, but also putting a lot of energy into helping her. I don’t want her to drop out (which she speaks of a lot because she thinks she is worthless) and I want to help her the best way possible.

How can I speak to her differently to help her productively?

Am I a jerk for feeling a bit exhausted from all the reassurance?",05Nov2019,1

It's a 2 week process, I would be flying back home to Puerto Rico from Orlando, FL which is  2 hour flight. My parents live 10 min and an 1hr and a half away from our home in FL, I know they can probably help us with our 2 little kids in this process of me being gone for 2 weeks to learn this process. My wife started yelling at me saying I was selfish, that I'm only thinking about myself, how is she supposed to manage work and being with 2 kids, that I needed to grow up, $2200 to learn how to make surfboards? That's so stupid, you need to work a Full time ( which Iam) but I'm not a mechanic nor a handyman, and surfing is something I am passionate about and truly enjoy. I figured with learning this skill, I could possibly make my own boards, paint them, make my own brand on the boards and hopefully start selling and manufacturing more and even repairing them to bring in additional income and who knows? Maybe open some sort of business on the long run since they host surfing competitions near me in Melbourne and Cocoa Beach, FL. I feel like some women in general just don't see or trust those types of goals unless they immediately see income coming in, boards can cost anywhere from $150 (old or used) to (brand new) $600-$1000, I know if I talk to my parents they are willing to help anyway they can if this is something serious I want to go through but she's definitely shutting it down.

844,"[Trigger warning: suicide, depression]



So I’ve had 3 friends tell me they are feeling suicidal/self-destructive in the past 3 days (2 of which were today). Thing is, I’ve been having similar ideations too lately and my depression is at an all time high. FYI I have had these thoughts intermittently throughout my life and, after so many years, I have developed solid ways of coping with them, so I am not a danger to myself. However, hearing other people saying the same thoughts and feelings out loud is quite triggering, despite the fact I know I won’t ever actually act on them. 

We all just happen to have very difficult things going on in our lives at the same time, Therefore, I have come to an agreement with each of them, that we should ask if the other person is feeling up to listening to them vent and that the other person should feel free to say they can’t listen at any point.  However, this information has just been dumped on me, without warning, by all of them. Obviously, it isn’t my job to fix their problems and it isn’t even possible for me to do so. It’s just difficult to say that you can’t listen to someone when they come to you in such a dark and vulnerable state. I know my own mental health should be my top priority at all times, but I can’t help feeling guilty.

Any advice?

845,"I recently started a new job. Now this job involved being recruited by a recruiter.

This recruiter essentially virtually saw me from getting a telephone interview to being given a place at the job, yet at no point did I actually meet this recruiter, she had a very attractive heavy accent I think it's Canadian?

Anyways, a few weeks down the line I overhear their voice and realise that's my recruiter who put me in this job. And it clicked to me who this person was when previously I bumped into them and got the odd passing hi (the typical hey man as you pass your bro and that's all there is. ) 

But now that it's clicked this person who was saying hi to me whenever I'd pass by them was my recruiter,  and I have a few issues.

I find them really attractive, besides the accent they are also physically attractive. I am in a long term committed relationship and will stay that way as I'm at the point of getting married with my amazing other half. And before anyone judges I have no intentions of trying to hook up, I just struggle now to the point its been more than a few weeks, I haven't really had a conversation with them and actually would like to be thankful and just casually have a chat.

Then she took my best friend's water and then when she REFUSED to give it back after being asked nicely MULTIPLE times the friend she blamed it on had to pry it out of her hands and then shoved the friend because she wanted her to move for no reason. Then she talked crap about me, my friend and my best friend in the period we don't have with her. And she said I was the bad friend and guilted me into the point of crying my entire last period. She acts like everything is normal and even asked to hang out. Do I confront her? Do I drop it? We are all mad at her because she thinks it is okay to act like a two-year-old.

848,"I (26f) just moved back to an area that it near my parents after being gone for some time. My parents are absolutely the most incredible people I have ever met, they’re kind, generous, best friends with each other and have been married over 40 years.

Recently I was talking with my mom, and she mentioned to me that her and my dad have always felt a lot of guilt for me having grown up very poor. I never knew I was poor growing up until I got to high school, but I was never spiteful about it. They’ve always given me everything they could, and supported me all throughout college, albeit not financially. 

I wouldn’t trade my upbringing for anything on this earth. I don’t know how to express to them that I’m not at all sorry for having grown up poor, and it literally keeps me awake at night knowing that my parents feel guilt about it. We’re both comfortable now (my dad managed to get a great job and make some smart investments). 

I just can’t wrap my head around it, I’ve never been anything but grateful for everything they’ve given me. Just because there weren’t as many presents at holidays doesn’t change the fact that they would do anything in the world for anyone and I can’t replace that.

I want to know how to talk to them about this with just saying something like “oh, no it’s totally fine.” It IS fine, but I feel like that’s not enough for me to say to them. Any advice would be appreciated, and I mainly just needed to get this off my chest.",05Nov2019,1
849,"Im 19, i’m in a huge turning point in life right now, and something hit me today that really scared me. I only really hang out with my 2 best friends, we’ve been friends since kindergarten, and my one friend is trying to break away from the other, we’ll call them X and Y.

X recently was feeling depressed and we got notice of this from his ex, she said things like he was planning to kill himself and that he even had a date. friend Y thought we should tell his mom before we move just because if anyone deserves to know, it’s her. anyways afterwards we talked with him, he really let his emotions out, however today me and X were hanging out and he told me some upsetting things. apparently X’s mom hid that she had developed another tumor(she’s had problems with breast cancer on and off for the past few years) from X and instead told his brother who isn’t as close with his mother. X feels like since we told his mom she is now hiding these things so he would have less stressors to deal with and apparently it really damaged his relationship with his mom. X now almost completely blames Y for this and nearly hates his guts and doesn’t want to even hang out with him anymore. Y didn’t do anything wrong, he loves me and X, we’ve been friends since childhood and the only reason he suggested to tell his mom was because he wanted to do the right thing and because he wants what’s best for X.

anyways I went into a little too much depth with that, but it’s just one of the many things that are scaring me. my gf of 3 years broke up with me back in spring, my dad is kind of falling out into a depression, our family isn’t what it used to be, and now the last of my friend group is practically cracking at the seams. I just want to know how to cope with this, it’s so hard to develop new relationships and move through this life while ignoring that nothing lasts and that even the grandest things you build in life will be reduced to nothing like it once was. I’m feeling lost and i’m in need of that balance and comfort we all crave, but it’s so hard when life feels like i’m on a tightrope trying to hold onto my happiness.",05Nov2019,1

Problem is, this past year, one of my friends came out to us (the friend group) as trans. Her name is now, let's say, G. I don't want to exclude her or make her feel more dysphoric, but G hasn't done anything to make her even so much as pass. She can't afford HRT yet, but she hasn't made any other efforts to try to pass.

She hasn't done voice training. She has only worn a feminine top once in a blue moon, other than that she wears boy clothes still. She also has a 5 o'clock shadow and often skips shaving. I'm only saying this to get my point across that she doesn't pass at all. 

Should I still let her sleep over with the rest of the girls? If not how should I turn her down? I have no idea.

868,"So, I've asked people this before and it always comes back to ""only you know the answer to that"" but in reality I truly don't.

Growing up I was attracted to boys, yeah. Once I started hitting my teens I realized I was attracted to girls too, but I had to hide it because I was in a religious household and gayness was not tolerated. To this day my mother is very homophobic and she told me it would be very difficult for her to accept me if I was gay.

So all my life I was kinda programmed into ""liking boys = good, liking girls = bad."" I doubled down on my ""total love of boys"" after girls started calling me a lesbian for not kissing a boy yet.

As of now I have been in two serious long term relationships with men, neither of which worked out (of course.) First one was abusive and the second one was just kinda complete after a year of us being together. Even when I was with the second one, something felt like it was missing, and I was continuously looking for girls to hook up with and ""add to our relationship"" because it felt like thats what was missing from it was, well, another girl. Didn't really click that maybe it was because I was with a guy that made me unhappy.

One of my greatest regrets is when I was with my now ex and had met this amazing, beautiful girl. We went out as friends once and I felt myself falling for her so fast. But ultimately she left my life because I wasn't single and wasn't able to be with her and only her. I look back at the time we spent together and I miss it so much and so wish I had been single at the time so I could have been with her. To this day I think about her a lot and if I will ever feel that instant connection again.

Lots of what I have done in my past has been making those around me happy or proud of me. I typically went after guys I thought would impress my friends because it felt like thats what mattered, ""wow hes hot, my friends will think I really bagged a hottie. And he makes a lot of money, my mom will love that.""

When I go after girls its more of what I want. ""She's beautiful, those glasses are so cute, she has a nice vibe, I love that.""

I just feel so confused.

My last relationship was with a pre-hormone (Idk if thats the right word) trans-girl. I was so happy to be able to say ""I have a girlfriend"" and I was always more physically attracted to her when she passed. The aspect of her being able to pass as my boyfriend around homophobic family was a plus. It was like having my perfect girlfriend and not having to go through the stress of my family hating me for being gay. Maybe it was wrong to feel that way, I don't know.

Anyhow, we broke up a few days ago and now I'm beginning a journey of self discovery. I'm buying a van that I'll be turning into a camper soon, I plan to live out of it and travel. Maybe write about my experiences, I don't know. The one thing I am most excited for is being able to be with a woman away from the prying eyes of my family.

When I picture my future I picture it with a woman. Ever since I realized its okay to be gay, I always have. I feel like as I get older, I am more and more attracted to women, and I feel like I'm ""becoming"" a lesbian. But I feel like thats so ridiculous! I thought the point of being gay was that you can't change it, that you can't change who you are and you're born this way. It feels like if I call myself a lesbian this late in the game, I'll be called out, I feel like I'm just confused, I don't know whats happening to me.

I am so confused and I think I just need someone more experienced in this to talk to me about it. I don't have any lesbian friends, my one gay friend has always been gay since he was a kid and has always only liked guys.

873,"This may be a bit confusing, but bear with me. 

So I have two friends: A and B. Then there’s the guy who we will just call Guy. 

B has a tendency to have crushes and get over them quickly, so when she said she had a crush on Guy, nobody really took it seriously. This seemingly ended and she had multiple crushes after this that didn’t lead anywhere. 

This all came to a climax when everybody (except me) went on a school trip. B would always come to Guy’s dorm trying to talk to him. One night she and her (also my) friends went to his room without A and hung out. He admitted that he liked A which obviously crushed B. Everyone told A and she seemed like she didn’t care and wouldn’t speak to him out of respect for B. B got over it, insulted him and started to crush on another person. 

The summer holiday ended and A admitted, despite saying she wouldn’t, she spoke to Guy and started to like him. She asked for B’s blessing and B was very happy for her and encouraged her to do what she wants. A then started dating Guy, but was still a little concerned as B was still adding Guy to her private stories/posts. 

Fast forward to now: We have classes that help us with our careers after school and we can select our classes based on what we want to do, e.g students that want apprenticeships will sign up for the class that teaches you how to apply for one. Anyways, my friend A was absent during the signing up. B signed herself to Guy’s class and signed A up to a different class. B then sat next to him during the class and tried to flirt with him - much to his discomfort. She told A that the classes were randomly allocated to people and that she doesn’t know what class she’s in, which is an obvious lie. B then asked A out to dinner for a girls night and refused to bring anyone along to which A refused. 

B is still messaging Guy every time he posts telling him about her life and her traits. Guy thinks she is weird and wants her to leave him alone but doesn’t want to be confrontational. A fears confrontation but is very angry about the situation to which she confided in me. 

What should I tell her to do? 

What if this flirting persists? 

Also, side note: B has told me nothing. According to her, I don’t even know that she liked Guy. In saying this, me talking to her would expose the fact that she’s being talked about.",05Nov2019,1
874,"I'll do my best to keep this short.

I'm out of college this summer (decided not to return, and enter the work force), and I decided my part time job would become my full time job- I work as a delivery driver for a food service app called Bite Squad, similar to Grub Hub and Uber Eats. It pays fine, and I love working there- you're basically your own boss!

Anyways, I just got an email from one of our market managers saying that our branch is shutting down, along with quite possibly the whole company - 200 management personnel and 70 markets were all fired and shut down just today; he said that this is a result of over 60% decline of sales. The last day we'll be working is December 5th.

Prior to this, I have worked only two official jobs in my life, for a combined four months. I've been working at my current job since July 19th, so by the time we close shop, this will have been my longest tenured position. Before I was hired for Bite Squad, I applied to maybe 50 different places in the area, and only one place gave me an interview, to which they didn't call me back. (I had a 5th degree theft misdemeanor in January 2018, so I figured that probably hindered my job search.)

I am totally inexperienced socially as well as financially outside of this job- what are some easy places to get hired at with little experience? I looked at Grub Hub, and they're currently not hiring in our area, and I don't turn 21 until the 23rd so I can't apply to be an Uber driver (Well, I could, but I'm not waiting until the final week of the month to hope they'll hire me when I have rent and a car payment at the beginning of the next month to pay.). Please, any advice is welcome- I've never been in this position before, and I don't know where to turn for the next job.

He started eating breakfast at 8.45am and I told him to hurry up and continued eating at a normal pace. He also made nonsensical decisions like taking a shower knowing he would be late and changing his trousers after he spilled juice on them at breakfast. 

At the airport I started to walk fast to find the gate and my friend walked at a normal pace behind me. We found a information point to ask where the gate was, we couldn't find it, I panicked and said we should move on but my friend was right to stay in line and wait.

884,"My boyfriend (28m) and I (22f) have been seeing each other for about 7 months and we live together. I was in a really bad situation at my mom’s house a few months ago and my boyfriend was kind enough to let me stay with him. So, my boyfriend and I get along well but there are lots of underlying issues. He was an alcoholic a few years ago and he’s bipolar. Also, his dad and siblings are raging alcoholics/drug abusers and I think, based off what he’s told me, that he believes that’s what his life will turn out to be as well. So I almost feel like he’s a ticking time bomb and as soon as something traumatic happens in his life he’s just going to fall back into his old ways. I have no idea what would set him off and then there’s also a chance that nothing will and he will just improve his life. 

My issue is that I don’t have many friends and I don’t have family that I could stay with. I feel trapped. Also, it’s only the past couple days I’ve had this overwhelming feeling of being trapped and anxious about this. The majority of the time he’s a good boyfriend and he takes care of me. I just don’t want to bet on the fact that he will change. At the moment we are living in a shitty apartment and have been talking about wanting to move, doesn’t seem like that will ever happen. I want to go on a trip this winter, doesn’t feel like thats ever going to happen.

I don’t like feeling like he’s just giving me broken promises and I’m going to be the one who gets hurt. Also, I’m scared to leave him because I really don’t have anywhere to go. I’m even scared to bring up problems I’m having in the relationship because there’s a chance he tells me to leave and then I’m fucked.

So apparently I’m bad at math. Very bad. I think it can get better, but it will take a lot of failures to push me to a success. I’m capable, it will just be a slow process, much slower than I would like. 

I need three calculuses for my atmospheric science degree. Phew. Tough. I’ve never been a quantitative person. But I love the atmosphere. I’m so good at earth and climate sciences. It’s the calculuses I’m horrible with. 

It would be a dream to forecast the weather, study atmospheres of other planets, and really research just about anything from hurricanes to climate change; it doesn’t matter to me, I love it. Dats my thing. But, I don’t have nearly as much resume experience with it as my peers do since I used to be an English geek.

It’s no good comparing yourself to others, but while I’m making good marks in the class, a lot of my peers are out there already piling onto their resumes and building the experiences employers care about. I can’t do that until a few semesters in the future when I have more knowledge about weather science, and that’s supposing I can make it past three semesters of calculus. 

In English, I have extensive experience and a built up resume. I am a published poet, granted only in print (two poems I’ll admit but hey they were published 🙌🏼). I have short stories published (print). I am a published news writer since high school, and last year I worked at the college newspaper, and have many articles, stories, and photo stories circulating online that you can look up right now, and a few are only in print. I write manuscripts. I am notorious for writing ridiculously well-written essays in a matter of hours and receiving exceptional grades for them. I plan on selling poems and short stories in the future not too far from now, quite literally in a few weeks. 

I left the English major because I was horrified that I’d be some unemployed literary degree unable to make rent. That’s the risk with an English degree; there is a good chance you won’t get hired because it’s not considered an essential degree.

But apparently, it’s possible to make some serious bank off of English, and this is literally something I’ve found out today. And it’s not very rare either; technical writer positions in the local DMV area alone have salaries posted from $43k-$113k, with a median at $73k. A lot of those positions (I’ve been researching) don’t even ask for a lot of experience and start you out of the gate making the median salary. Most of the openings I’ve seen offer more than $70k. Not as much as meteorology by any means, but it would seem to be a stable future.

So now, I’m not sure what to do with myself. Do I continue my atmospheric science degree? What if I fail calculus? What happens to all the wasted time and money? What if I don’t fail calculus, what if I get by, and graduate with this degree, and find an exceptional job? Should I go back to majoring in English, a field I already have experience in and excel in, for the stability of knowing I can do it? Should I major in English and minor in atmospheric science, or vice versa? What if I go back to English, graduate, and find a horrible job that can’t support my family? What if I go back to English, graduate, and do find a good job that can support my family?

They say you should stop worrying or thinking about things that are beyond your control, but I just can’t do that. I am a planner by nature an avid over-thinker. So I suppose I’m posting to see if anyone has advice. But please don’t say follow your heart. My heart is torn between two fields and I don’t know which piece of it to choose. I really am seeking logical, constructive advice. Thank you so much for your time 💙❤️",05Nov2019,2

891,"My husbands cousin has twin girls that are obsessed with makeup. They are juniors in high school and I’m a makeup artists so we are really close. I do their makeup for dances, they text me pictures of their looks and I give constructive criticism and feedback, they’re a complete joy and I really like that I’ve e been able to bond with them over their makeup artistry. 

Their dad (who they live with half the time) struggles for money so they don’t have anywhere near the collection they’d like to have but they can always get their fix when they come and play with my stuff. Because I’ve been in the industry for about a decade I’ve collected an absolutely gargantuan collection of makeup, most of it free (gratis.) 

the girls birthday was recently and I figured that since they are starting to get pretty advanced in their artistry but are at a standstill because they don’t have the set up, tools or products to go all out that i could finally clean out my room and give them everything they need. I called and asked their dad (my husbands cousin) who was in tears when I told him what I wanted to do and was incredibly grateful that I’d give them such a big gift. 

Everything I gave them was used, but sanitized and in OK condition. It was about 150 lipsticks, 4 dozen or so pigments, a box with 100+ lipliners in every color imaginable, glitters, blushes, bronzers, highlighters, dozens of eyeshadow palettes.. you get the idea. It filled 2 tall ALEX units to the brim (the gift from their dad) and I got organizers off Amazon.  They came home on their birthday to find 2 Alex units in their bedroom absolutely filled to capacity with high end makeup, the value of which is in the thousand of dollars. Again, I didn’t pay for most of the makeup, it’s stuff I got for free through work. I only paid for the organizers and obviously through hours of work setting it all up. 

They literally fell to the floor crying they were so happy, lots of screaming and jumping and hugging, dad crying with them. All in all it was fantastic. 

A couple of days later I get a call from an unknown number, it’s the girls mother and I can hear in her voice she’s already trying not to cry at the beginning of our conversation. Just like their dad she doesn’t have a lot of money but she had saved up and gotten them the MR and SG palettes from Anastasia Beverly Hills, she had really struggled to save up for it and was really hurt that no only had no one told her about what we were doing but that the girls had barely reacted to the palettes she got (both of them were in the collection that came from me along with almost every other ABH palette.) To be fair I don’t think the girls were ungrateful, that doesn’t sound like them at all I think they just give her the screeching, jumping up and down reaction she though her gift would get.

I honestly don’t know what to to fix it or what to think but the wonderful feeling I’ve been riding high on all week has been replaced by the horrible feeling you get when you cross a line and hurt someone. Just needed to vent to some unbiased strangers, I’d love your input or thoughts on it as I can’t seem to sort out my own.",05Nov2019,10

Today, however, he asked me for nudes. When I told him no, he continued to ask over and over, and when I asked him to stop he just said “Nope... you’d sent them if you love me.” I told him he should be careful because I have the ability to report him, and he just kind of acted unbothered and said “Report me, it’s no problem,” etc. I live in the U.S. and he lives in the U.K. I’ve already reported the case to this one website that takes report forms for cases of child abuse and pedophilia, but is there anything else I should do?",05Nov2019,1

897,"My girlfriend (haven’t been going out very long, but have been “fwb” for a while. When I met her, we met in a mental hospital, and at the time she was a lesbian. She was there because she overdosed on her medication. 

No one has heard from her since about 6-7 pm on Friday, November 1st (of 2019). It’s important to mention that she receives SSI for a disability, and Friday is the day she got her check. (1st of the month).

Why would she be missing: I knew when I met her that she had “tried” heroin. That was a major red flag, but we weren’t anything except platonic friends at that point. So I told her that was a bad idea and left it at that. After this, through a long series of events, we start dating and she “quits” completely. (I’m aware that I’m a moron, but I love her, so... like fuck off and just help me or skip this post, please). I asked her about it a couple times recently, she said she hadn’t done it and had no desire to do it. I believed that (yes I know, moron). 

Friday night while I’m at work we’re texting each other about getting a State I.D. No argument, just conversation. Her last message to me was at 6:45pm. I text her again around midnight saying that work was really busy. No response (which is strange to me). Saturday, no response. I start worrying and start calling her. Her phone rings all the way to voicemail.

Sunday I contact her best friend via Instagram messenger, a girl I’ve never met and lives on the other side of the country from us. I tell her who I am and that I haven’t heard from her since Friday night. She tells me that she hasn’t either. 

Monday comes, I call her therapists office to see if maybe she checked in with her doctor like she does same time every Monday, but they couldn’t tell me anything because I’m not on her release forms. So I call the mental hospital where we met, they can’t tell me anything. I call the emergency rooms across the city (Philly), they said no one by that name has been checked in, and no “unidentifiable females” have been picked up in this time frame of her disappearance. I call the local precinct near her house, they say they don’t have her. I called the roundhouse in case she was awaiting trial, they said there’s no record of her being arrested at any time past or present.

Today is Tuesday and I just came from her house. Her roommates haven’t seen her since about Friday. I went to the bodega on her corner and showed them a picture, they recognized her and said they hadn’t seen her since Friday either. Every time she gets her check she walks about a mile to a 7/11 near Temple University (Philly) at about Midnight to 1am. I asked the 7/11 employees. One of them recognized her but couldn’t remember when he saw her last.

Her friend who I had been talking to about finding her for days now brings to my attention that she went to a neighborhood called Kensington (where most addicts in this city cop hard drugs) and she bought 14 bags of heroin. She was on her way to get cigarettes and that was the last she had heard from her. (Yes, her friend waited days to tell me this, until I was on her front step freaking out).



My guesses to where she is:

1: A mental hospital in a dual diagnosis unit as a result of overdosing.

2: Jail. But they said there are no records

3: The morgue. And this would absolutely crush me, so I’m hoping it isnt that.

Im aware that once I find her I have to leave her, and keep her at a distance and not be with her anymore. But I just need to find her first so I know she’s alive somewhere. Any ideas?",05Nov2019,1

899,"Hi everyone.

As a little bit of financial background, growing up, my family has mostly been lower middle class. My parents have also never been fully transparent about finances. But they aren't luxurious spenders and they don't spend needlessly. So we aren't rich but I don't think we were also fully ever in an emergency state. 

I am 22 and just graduated from an MA program. I moved back home and have been job searching since I graduated this past June. It's been depressing, to say the least-- I don't have friends in my hometown, and I keep -almost- getting opportunities and otherwise being flat out rejected regularly. My parents and I generally have a really loving and wonderful relationship, but of course, we have our spats. I've also always had mental health issues (diagnosed with major depression episodic and generalized anxiety disorder). 

I think my parents have been seeing how.... sad I've been and they offered to send me on a trip to Europe to get me out of the house. They insist that it's also important that I take full advantage of this time because I'll be working for the rest of my life.  I'm very thankful for this opportunity but it's hard for me to accept because of our socio-economic history and because I don't want to be a burden to my parents. 

I also struggle with my dependency on them and am very anxious that I'm too sheltered to the point of no return. I don't usually make decisions without them and their approval. Even with small things (like as much as I want one, I won't get a tattoo because of how much my mother disapproves of them). It feels wrong to take this trip-- I would think that I would be overjoyed at an opportunity but I am full of dread and guilt. 

I also don't know how related this might be, but I have an older brother who I'm pretty much estranged from. He was emotionally abusive towards me growing up, and now he's fully independent and rarely relies on my parents for anything. My parents have never acknowledged his abuse, and it's probably the only dent in our otherwise fine relationship. I can't help but think that I am inadequate in comparison to my brother if I take this offer. 

I just can't shake the feeling that it's wrong for me to take advantage of this offer. I have student loans from my grad program-- I'm tempted to ask them to just help me with my loans until I find a job instead of sending me on a trip. But that also sounds spoiled and selfish of me. I understand how privileged and lucky I am to having such supportive parents but I don't know what the best decision would be for me to be better and to grow as a person. Any advice is helpful, thank you in advance.",05Nov2019,1
901,"I (18M) am having a hard time with motivation, direction and just getting fulfillment from things. Every day feels the same and pretty much is. I wake up around 8am and go to my community college until 1-2pm. I come home and have a few hours before work which starts between 5-6pm usually. In this time I have a hard time finding anything to do so I often just eat lunch then take a nap which tends to last longer than it should(2-3 hours). Finally I come home around 9:30-10:30 and shower. By then it's almost midnight and I just end up watching YouTube videos for hours in my room until I fall asleep usually around 1-4am. I'm physically fit and healthy, I get a lot of exercise at work loading trucks at UPS and I kind of enjoy it. My main struggle is that I can't really find anything to do, and when I do I have a hard time enjoying or getting any fulfillment from it. I have friends, and when we hang out it's great but we're so busy it doesn't happen often.

It is my 3rd time doing the exam btw. The first time I failed cuz I wasn't able to start the car since they apparently fixed the clutch (yes, my instructor taught me with a messed up clutch and though I could still drive it with a bad clutch, it was entirely different- only learned of this because they told me so on the last day that they'd have to fix the clutch) and the second time I was very nervous due to the first time.

We both were interested in each other, but never got the chance to date or ever try anything more than be close friends. Part of that was my hesitance (my parents are very conservative Christians and she was... very not), and part of it was distance when I was in college.

Now I'm happily married to a wonderful woman and in my mid-twenties. Let me say that rationally I do not even want to think about this person anymore, but I keep having these dreams and it resurfaces old feelings. After a dream I think about her for days and I feel like I'm in high school again.

My personal theory is that there was no sense of closure in my mind. It wasn't like other relationships I've had where there was a clear ""we shouldn't keep dating/talking"". We just kind of faded from each other's lives slowly.

This ended up being different from what I wanted so I planned on doing computer science my second semester. I took some programming classes and enjoyed them at first but quickly got tired of sitting at a computer for hours every day.

 Over the summer my parents opened a restuarant and I worked there almost every day for months and I have worked at their previous restaurants all throughout high school. Im now back in school and im still going home to work at the restaurant every weekend. Ive really come to enjoy working in the restaurants they own and thought maybe business would be a good major to pursue so I can open my own restaurant someday. I enjoy the environment of the restaurants and the idea of being able to be my own boss and run my own business. 

Now I have to decide if I want to go in the direction of owning the restaurant someday and doing a business major, or finding something else I would enjoy that isn't part of a family business (I think civil or environmental engineering would be interesting but when I look at job prospects I don't like the idea of sitting at a desk in a tie in front of a computer screen everyday).  People ive talked to say that I can do engineering now and always fall back on the restaurant if I decide. But ive been given the offer to start being groomed to take over the restaurant now, which would mean passing on the opportunity to do something else in college

918,"When I was 18, I moved out of a pretty domestically fucked up household to take a leap of faith on the likes of a 22 year old band dude I met over twitter. I moved across the country to be with him.

We lasted for almost 4 years. Moved to LA together, moved to San Diego together. I was convinced he was the love of my life and I had zero doubts about the possibility of breaking up. We've been through a lot, as life can do alot of damage in 4 years. I kind of stopped taking care of myself and wasn't treating my depression and became a bitch, in all honesty.

One day, he woke up and it was like a flip switched. Dumped me and moved out that day, I was crushed. He kissed me and promised we'd be fine.

I looked at his Instagram and found the girl he had already, same day begun exchanging likes with.

Later found out she was born in the year 2000.

I took a depression mental breakdown trip and backpacked from San Diego to Oregon to run away from my problems. He met up with me and I picked him up from his new apartment, a 3 bedroom shared with 6 men in their mid twenties, and smoked him out with my weed. I brought him a kombucha and a water and poured my heart out to him and asked for him to reconsider.

He told me in the week I was gone, his band went on tour, he already had been finding comfort in someone else, he had an amazing mushroom trip where his peripherals had changed and now he sees things differently, and doesn't see himself with someone like me. He had this new hoop earring on that was the real kicker.

A few months later, I get a message from said girl, talking shit to me for apparently not being nice about her when I had found out. She then took a turn and started saying things like he buys her and her friends beer, sends her money, they have awful sex and she avoids it, and that he punched a wall because she invited her ex boyfriend to one of his shows.

I'm sure the best option is to stay out of this. I am still brokenhearted. What he's been doing is straight up illegal. He's 26, she's 19, he invites her over to his apartment for psychadelics, beer, cigarettes. I am just lost in this world and don't know how I lost to that. I'm 22 now and am left with debt we collected together, all of our pets, and have just been having a hard time, I feel like he took a lot from me.",05Nov2019,1

I (17F) have recently landed a part time seasonal job at a retailer. I applied at a hiring day and got the job on the spot. It wasn’t my first retail job and I have cash register experience and customer service training. 

My first day there was spent after hours learning how the store works and learning how to use the tills. Our training was done in a big group of seasonal hires and it was only about an hour. My second day was spend helping a coworker replenish stock on some displays but no one was there to train me. I had been told at the orientation (my first day) that the first few weeks would be spent shadowing employees and being trained, none of that happened. My second day went along fine as it was halloween and the store was dead. Come my third day though, that’s where things went bad. A coworker who had been there for many years told me I would be doing cash alongside 2 others. I thought that was fine and went about doing so. The problem was, i was only trained to do a simple transaction. Every customer I had required more than just scanning and bagging. My first customer needed a refund and my senior coworker was surprised no one taught me how to do one. I kept having to ask him how to do certain things and I felt horrible wasting the customers time. It was very nerve wracking for me. 

While i was trying to get the hang of ringing people through and apologizing for the delay in service, I came across another problem; the tills, when paying with cash, don’t tell you how much change to give. Finding this out I asked for a calculator to find out how much I would need to give the customer back (let’s say that the amount of money being paid is quite large). My coworker got a bit upset and asked if I really couldn’t do the math in my head. I can’t do the math in my head. 

With my lack of training and the pressure of rude people, I don’t think i have what it takes to work at that store. It isn’t even christmas yet. After customers making mean comments about my use of a calculator, I excused myself into the bathroom and had a full on panic attack. I called my mom and she insisted on picking me up. I spoke to my manager, and apologized for my outburst and said that I couldn’t return to the floor and that someone was coming to pick me up. She understood and wished me luck on calming down. 

TLDR: I cant handle working retail and I need to know how to quit. 
 
I am beyond embarrassed and I don’t know how to go about quitting after what happened. I’m not even sure if I can just quit on the spot without giving in a 2 week notice? Any advice is helpful.",05Nov2019,1
921,"I know I shouldn't envy the life of celebrities or public figures BUT the ones that are living the life I want/desire did it on their back...! As a teenager, you're told to work hard and go to school to accomplish the things you want in life! I did all that and more! Went to school and studied Entertainment Business Management and went on to start my own small businesses. I can't help but to envy celebs that slept around and are living a great life. Their famous for things celebs were shamed for back in the day. 

Cardi B is a fucking former stripper/escort who used to drug and rape men! Now she's one of the biggest rappers!

Kim Kardashian was sucking and fucking on tape and now she's one of the biggest celebs. She slept with half of Hollywood.

922,"I’ll try and keep this short but can provide more info. I am 24 F and my partner 31 M. We live in a 3 bedroom house and he has recently remortgaged so pays around £300 per month. This is hitting him quite hard as he doesn’t ask me for rent and doesn’t expect me to pay (we’ve been together 4 years and this has always been the case)
I pay £250 towards bills and he pays £200 into a joint account. I am studying full time and working a min wage job as much as I can and we both are happy with each other’s contributions so this isn’t an issue. 

Recently my colleague at work 33 M has had a lot of issues with his living situation. He lives with a friend, who has no job and lives with his parents. He expects my colleague to pay for food etc in nights after we finish work (we work in the hospitality sector) and also is really annoying him by how he’s always at our work and also home. He feels he never has a break and cannot relax after work with colleagues etc. He also does a lot of favours for his current friends family, ie lending money (which hasn’t been paid back) picking up children very early etc. This is causing a lot of friction. I am also friends with his housemate though him and work. 

He really wants out, ideally to buy his own place or business where he can live (bar etc) but needs to save. Me and my partner are planning to move next year at some point as well so this wouldn’t be a long term thing. He is aware of our plans to move. We’ve offered him to purchase our house as he really likes it but can’t afford it right now due to debt. 

My partner is happy for him to move in (colleague is gay male as well so no chance of anything like that happening). He also would think about charging the usual amount for lodging of £300 p/m which would cover mortgage. We will write up a contract just in case and it wouldn’t be a long term thing. I will suggest this to him this week as we need to talk about his situation anyway as he is very upset with the way things are currently and has asked our boss for advice. Our boss is talking about moving in future and him having his place and running work but this isn’t going to happen anytime soon. We already have a good relationship both in and outside work and know boundaries - ie if we go out drinking it’s nothing to do with work, in work he is my line manager. 

Does this sound like a good idea? It benefits both of us, he is also very mature and sensible, doesn’t drink much doesn’t do drugs etc, very ordered. Can anyone see any downsides? 
Would like to add we have a close enough relationship as well we know what is work and can share grievances and also I’ve applied for other jobs towards my chosen career and he’s been supportive etc. 

Thanks in advance for any replies!",05Nov2019,1

925,"Hello, before I ask for your advice I need you to k ow my situation. I’m 16 and throughout my life I’ve been abused by my mother (who’s a single parent) when I was 5-7 she would slap me and hit me over little things (which she now denies) and for the past few years she’s constantly manipulated me and emotionally and verbally abused me. She would constantly tell me I have no friends and I’m going to get no where in life. She’s nearly drove me to suicide on many occasions. She recently got married to someone who has done nothing but scare me. I won’t go into details as this would become a 8 part documentary. A few days ago I had to go into my room and barricade the door, my now step dad started trying to force the door open demanding I give there blessing for the wedding and constantly trying to break into my room (if you ask me there both crazy. My mum was watching him the entire time and eventually he left (after an hour) my mum told me to pack my shit and leave or else she would call the police

(Ever since I was little I’ve loved my grandparents more than my mum. They’ve done nothing but care for me and love me, I’m more attached to them than anyone I’ve ever known)

My grandparents (who knew my mum was crazy) gave me emergency money to take a train to where they are. I took this opportunity.

After a few days I’ve found out social services have gotten involved and I might get to decide what happens next. Foster care or stay with my grandparents (my mum never wants to see me again)

If I go to my Grandparents, I’ll be with familiar people and people I’ve loved since the start, I know they will take care of me and tbh I’m scared of loosing them. The cons are I’m taking my gcse (important exams) this year and if I got to my grandparents I’d have to switch schools which would make it difficult for my grades. However, I am dedicated to doing whatever I can to get back on track

If I go to foster care, the only benefit is I can stay close to my friends (who have been there for me through thick and thin and have always had my back) and I can continue to go to my school. The cons however are I have no idea who this family would be and I’d might never see my grandparents again which scares me to tears.

So all I ask is what should I do? Should I stay close to my family where I know I will be happy. Or focus on school where I will have my friends but be in the unknown.

926,"Hello, I (26F) have a male friend (28M) that I’ve known online for 10 years. We have never met in person, but have video called/Skyped in the past. He confessed feelings for me years ago but I did not feel the same, and told him. He understood, and the friendship continued. Fast forward to 2019, he has been increasingly clingy with me, especially since my relationship ended last month. He messages me on Facebook messenger all day everyday. He claims I am his only friend, which makes sense because whenever I respond to him, he answers RIGHT AWAY. Sometimes, I will wait like 8 hours to reply to him, and even still, he replies immediately as though he’s holding his phone waiting for me. He asks what I am doing every night so we can do something together (online gaming). I have had to mute his notifications so I don’t get annoyed throughout the day.

Here’s what I’ve kindly and subtly tried to get him to back off a little:
- texting one-worded replies/instant convo enders 
- texting WAY less often
- telling him I can’t wait to date someone in my town
- telling him my crush messaged me and we have a date 

When I told him about my crush messaging me the other day, he became down, asking me who he is and is he a good person, and if I’d tell him if it doesn’t work out. Whoa!!! How can I get this clingy friend to back off and get a life? He has no friends so I am trying to be gentle. Thank you.",05Nov2019,1

928,"so I was hanging out with this guy as a friend occasionally. he ditched me and went to college in a different area. I felt betrayed because he hardly paid attention to me and I felt like he didn't care anymore (if he did at all) he told me he wasn't my friend and then told me he was, I felt confused on where we stood for a long time. last time I saw him he bailed fast and didn't hang out with me his last month of summer vacation. I excused a lot of his behavior for some aspects of anxiety because he has social anxiety I figure its probably a struggle to hang out with me, he cant make eyecontact or anything else. I asked him to send a pic of himself to me and he refused and said he didn't like me like that which was kind of randomly bold of him. honestly I cannot get this guy off my mind, it has gotten so bad that he's all I ever think about. even the rejection wasn't enough for me to stop trying because I thought maybe he'd change his mind. he told me we could be friends so I  believed him now I just feel neglected.  

&amp;#x200B;

another factor is that he's Asian, im white. I don't know if it has anything to do with anything but I think us purusing a relationship is harder because when we did see each other we had to hide so his parents wouldn't know about me.

**TL;DR | Thinking about changes to implement in my life to stop overwhelming thoughts rushing through my head, thoughts of death, being paranoid about nonsense. It fucking sucks. I want to live. I want to stop feeling like my life doesn't matter. What changes have you made to stop overthinking?**

I am 24, I have a beautiful family with loving relationships all around, I work, I have a gym, A car, Access to a phone. I'm good.

I have no reason to want to die but I want to. Being alive doesn't seem to make sense to me. I don't know why I wake up feeling like everything is so worthless, constantly overthinking most moments of my everyday existence. It sucks... It truly is crippling. Overthinking is something that takes the life out of me and it can make me feel life I have no soul. I'm truly done with it. I want to live in the present and stop trying to be so fucking deep. I want to make some changes today that can help quiet the nonsense thoughts of things that shouldn't pertain to me or concern me.

I am not here to have someone tell me my life is worth living and time will heal all no. Fuck all that. I need some momentum today. Change isn't going to wait for a soul in this life, our time is too short. I have time right now, today. I've had a fighting spirit in me for a while and my flame is on fire. 

I do have a relationship with Christ. Like most people I was raised in the catholic religion and know very well of the bible and of Jesus teachings. I have my own ideas about faith and what God is but I am strong in my faith. I do have an overwhelming feeling that life will eventually work itself out. 

I think I got this but I want to stop this nonsense man. I am done with talking, I've done so much of it man. I want to change my life today. 

Meditation, Revisiting my faith, speaking to my pastor, these are all things I am considering to stop the madness. I was also thinking of completely stopping to watch any type of content on YouTube. Like anything that really doesn't add value to my life. We all are addicted to it I swear. 

Fuck these demons, I just want a quiet mind. Seriously.

Context: Best few dates I’ve ever been on. Impeccable intellectual, emotional, and physical chemistry. The kind of person that made me smile from even a text message. However, this causes a rift in my mindset/perception of continuing with this...despite how petty it may seem. 


We were cuddling/talking in the morning after having had sex the night before...he stares at my lip and looks blank and flustered..then he asks “is that a cold sore.” I had just finished a weekend backpacking trip in hail the night before, so I had super chapped lips that caused a crack in the middle. If it even matters, I don’t get cold sores. I explain the matter with the same context to him, completely stuttering bc I’m just in shock at his tone of seriousness. I ask him if he’s actually angry, and he’s says in a calm tone “yes, I am.” Then he realizes how dead quiet I got...and adds “I’m not angry just sad.” He says all of this in an almost flat tone. I don’t say a word for a tense few minutes and he repeatedly apologizes, and I just silently nod. When he leaves, the banter returns to normal, but my mind has shifted and I just feel so small inside and disgusted with myself. We don’t kiss after that, and he doesn’t kiss me goodbye. We hug. He leaves.

I just feel so unsettled and confused because he was such a sound person. I try to tell myself that it was a just a small, petty passing moment but honestly- I just cried over the existential aspect of being tired of guys (even initially promising ones) making me feel small.

I enjoy the mountains being near by but thats about it. I've actually been wanting to try something new. 

The company is offering a 10k per year raise, a 2k bonus for moving, they pay moving expenses, help with rent for the first year, and I would be essentially thebonly employee and starting up a new branch. The catch is its basically a 2 year agreement and im kind of over the job. It has its pros ( I work alone, there is no time commitment per job I can finish it in 4 hours and still get paid for 7, and its very easy work.

If i make this move i can afford my own place, afford to help my side buisness grow, get to experience something new.

i'm (21F)  a senior in college and about 1.5 years ago a guy (22M) and i hit it off and we hooked up a few times. we fizzled out cause i guess he wasn't interested, but i haven't stopped thinking about him. he graduated and moved across the country, and we don't really talk at all except for replying to each other instagram stories sometimes. he's by far the hottest guy i've encountered in my life, and he's a really funny and really nice person. i never really got over him, and he's usually at the back of my mind a few days a week, but i just chalked it up to an oxytocin overdose and i just deal with it.

943,"TLDR; my roommate is nearly 30 and depressed at where his life is. He seems to have just given up. He wants to be successful but doesn’t want to work for it. I want to help him through this. No I’m not kicking him out. 

He said he feels like he’s going through a ‘mid life crisis’ despite not even being 30 years old. He recently just quit his job in a very troubling way, he is vacationing every other week now with his gf despite saying he’s only got $2k in the bank and our rent alone being over $600 a person. We still have a year and a half on the lease, which has four people total on it. We’re all friends and up until this point it has been relatively smooth sailing. 

He claims to be stuck in life despite never giving himself the chance to get started. He hasn’t been able to keep a job for more than six months without quitting. He’s failed the last handful of courses he’s taken at our local community college, and now plans on going back to school full time with a part time job, even though that failed spectacularly last time when he failed all his classes and quit his job in one afternoon.  

When you read between the lines, his problem seems to be motivation and the fact that he just doesn’t want to work for anything. He instead immerses himself in video games, anime, and weed to distract himself. 

On top of that he has a girlfriend that isn’t necessarily toxic for him, but instead has similar issues that he takes on as his own. So his relationship has become a negative feedback loop that over the years has detached both of them from reality. For example, he wants to own a house on land in an area not too far away from where we live, but the houses are about it not over $1 million, and he doesn’t see that as a problem. He assumes he’ll be rich some day. Another example, is she calls herself an animal lover and they bought a snake together. Just after a year he forgets to shut the cage entirely and the snake escapes. I was the one who tore apart the house to find it, they gave up after 4 hours, I find it after a week of nonstop searching. They took the snake to the vet and everything is fine, it found the perfect place to hide next to the water heater. But a handful of months later, and they kill it, because they forgot about it. To make matters worse, she convinced him it was his fault and you can tell how heavily it weighs on him. 

To go further into their relationship, because it’s easily the biggest motivator in his life, they don’t have a sexual relationship. It’s not something they share with everyone cause it’s no one’s business. But I know because he’s been confused by it for a long time. They’ve been going out for almost 5 years and he is a heterosexual virgin. She claims to be asexual, but has had sex with his friends before they got together, and nearly broke up with him to sleep with someone a couple years ago. And even earlier this year she was getting really personal with another guy at our house and it seemed to put him in a depression. 

So, that’s my story. Sorry it’s so long. I want to help my friend out and I definitely don’t want to have to resort to kicking him out. My roommates and I already have a plan if worse comes to worse but we want any input that might prevent the worse from coming.",05Nov2019,1

Well she added me back but I haven’t said anything because I’ve come to the realization that she is now talking to one of my good friends and I just guess there is no hope left for me, I just don’t know what todo, no one else likes me and I just want to find someone but I just feel like that will never happen. I get that I’m not the most sociable person but no one ever talks to me. Like I said I just don’t know what to do no more.",05Nov2019,1
947,"It's honestly not her fault. She is 13 and her mother is the real hoarder. She's grown up with it,  so she really doesn't care if dirt is coating every inch of the house. She is homeschooled, and doesn't leave the house much. She showers once a week. I always wear shoes at her house because if I don't it will basically be like walking on a dirt road. I posted a picture of her room if you want to check that out.  

I don't know what else to say. If you have any specific questions please ask them. I want to help her but I don't know how!",05Nov2019,8
948,"Hey everyone this topic may seem a bit serious for this sub but I think I need help. I’m currently a high schooler and I have decent grades but I have this porn addiction and a procrastination issue. Some weeks I can go a few days without master-bating and looking at porn but i eventually do it. And after I’m done I feel extremely lazy, like I can’t do anything at all. I  then procrastinate and don’t get any work done, I just indulge myself in food and go on my phone the whole day. Half the time I don’t even feel real sexual pleasure I just feel tired and exhausted. On the days that I don’t master-bate i have a high chance of just procrastinating and doing nothing except watching YouTube. I’m open to all advice on how to fix this.",05Nov2019,2
949,"My grandmother has had heart problems for years, and lately they have taken a turn for the worse. She lives 2,000 miles away. We are not close, but it breaks my heart. I’m most concerned about how my mother will deal with this. She is almost 60, working AND taking care of my toddler full time and supporting me while I’m in school. She is the best person I know. I don’t know what to say or do. My mother and I are very close, but never hug or say “I love you” we haven’t in years. She is a very strong person, but I don’t know how she will handle losing her own mother. 

To make things even worse I screamed at her earlier today because she took my daughter to see my ex husband’s mother heavily against my wishes. I am close to having his parental rights terminated, and want her to have nothing to do with their entire family. I have thought it through for the past two years and this is the best option. He is violent, highly delusional, mentally unstable and he went to jail for severely abusing me. My attorney agrees, but this was not an easy decision for me. I know this is a lot, but I just want you guys to understand the full situation somewhat. 

I feel terrible for yelling at her now on such a horrible day in her life, and after all she does. I had no idea my grandmother is dying and that my mother just found out. I don’t know how to help her, and feel so terrible for yelling at her now. I don’t know how to show her I care. We aren’t the type to even hug. I have no idea what to do at all. I know how incredibly selfish it sounds, but I’m also worried it will affect the ability for her to care for my daughter. I am a little over a month away from finishing school and desperately need to get a job so I can support us, so hopefully my mother will finally be able to stop working. 

I have a lot of problems expressing my emotions, and so does she. ( at least the positive/empathetic ones :/ ) I have no idea what to do or how to deal with this horrible situation. I feel terrible and want to help but don’t know how. I have mental health issues myself. I really don’t know what to do, and am spiraling fast. I am so worried about my mom and feel terrible that she still has to take care of my daughter through this. I don’t know if I should drop out of my program, as it’s the only hope I have for a stable career. 

TLDR: my grandmother is dying, and I don’t know how to help my mother through this at all.",05Nov2019,1
