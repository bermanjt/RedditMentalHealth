Other people are happy, working towards their dreams. But my dreams are impossible because all i want is to be respected and loved. I am on my way towards a path, I have an identity. I do what makes me happy, but that doesn't translate to others loving me because there are many things I like to do but I don't have one true passion.

Desperately need advice! I'm 23M for reference if it matters.

Everything was seemingly going great in my life, I graduated from college and received a few awards, landing a decent paying job shortly there after. I was always in great shape, took great care of myself, and was generally happy at this time.

Fast forward about a year in: my father passed away unexpectedly. I had never dealt with losing anyone close to me prior. My job is extremely unrewarding and not right for me (too little to do, very boring, no one to speak with at all, etc) I felt trapped at work, and super unmotivated as my father was always a person who pushed me and kept me motivated and on the right path, even if we weren't overly close.

A month after losing my father I blow my knee out, and tear my ACL, MCL, and meniscus. Basketball and working out has always been my escape and what makes me happy, and allowed me to tolerate everything in life. It was what I truly loved to do, and it was taken from me in addition to my father in the blink of an eye.

I ended up leaving my job, it just wasn't right for me, I was unable to go in and work due to my surgery and knee injury, and I just didn't have the drive to do the work from home so I stepped down.

My surgery was in July of last year, my father passed away in June of last year. It is now almost 9 months later and I still can't get out of the rut I have found myself in. I eat like shit, constantly binge eating things such as ice cream, and whatever is bad for me. I went from being extremely physically fit and took pride in my self image to hating it. I almost feel this is my biggest issue, I really can't manage to overcome this and I don't know why. This had never been a previous problem for me before and I don't know why I depend on this so much. I always immediately regret the decision right after, tell myself I'll get right tomorrow, just to fail again and again. I don't feel motivated to work or better myself, I just feel void of happiness. Ever since this all happened I feel like I'm just coasting through life. Things that made me happy previously no longer make me happy. I used to be very outgoing and always trying to maximize time spent with my friends and family but now I can't help but just stay at home more often than not and not leave my room much. My knee still bothers me everyday and I'm having issues with fully bouncing back that isn't a fault of mine. Waking up each day in pain really just puts me in a bad mindset for the day.

I'm currently working part time, with a few full time job offers on the table but I just don't know how well I'll do with my current mindset.

I often find myself wishing I could wake up and just be myself again but everyday just feels like a struggle and moving further in the wrong direction as opposed to the right direction.

7,"So B is kind of a nut job. Once when she was cutting my hair, a guy came in and asked if J could cut his hair. B said not right now, since J was on break. The dude goes, ""Oh, okay... he just said he'd be in right now. What time will he be back?""

B fucking lost it. She started yelling at him, telling him to take his money somewhere else (and she's just an employee, so she doesn't own the place) and pretty much chasing the poor guy out.

Last time I came in, she cut my hair extremely poorly. Like, hoo boy. Basically the sides of my head are shaved and she ""fixed"" the line on the right, where my long hair stops and the shaved part begins. It literally looked like it was cut with a weed whacker.

Haven't had a shot or blood test in about 6 years because of it and the last time I did I was so panic-striken that it took close to 40 minutes to do the test then I was fucked up and still shaking because of it for the next /two weeks/.
But long story short I need a bunch of tests done in the next few months. Like I literally might die without them. But I'm so horrified I would take death any day over even a single blood test. I genuinely think the only way I'd be able to get it done is if I was completely unconscious. Just knocked the fuck out before even leaving the house to go to the doctor. But since that can't happen, I'm stuck. What can I do besides cancelling the tests and just letting nature take its course like I want to?

11,"Hey everybody,

I’m a university student living in a 4 bedroom apartment where 3 of my roommates were assigned to me. 2 of them are sisters, and 1 of them is one of the sisters best friend.

They’re nice to me on the surface and everything, but there’s a big problem when it comes to different priorities and lifestyles.

I’m the only one who goes to university, 2 of them are still in high school and the older one just works a job.

They don’t respect that I have to rigorously study for my classes, as they always invite their friends over and party. They are very loud and are constantly yelling instead of using “inside voices” and don’t respect that I need and like quiet and serenity.

I even brought it up to the older one that week nights need to be more calm, yet every Thursday night they get drunk and predrink in this tiny apartment when I have a 10 am class in the morning.

The worst part is that they basically allow one of their best friends to live here. He’s always on the couch watching tv and is constantly here and sleeps over every night. Then, his girlfriend is always over because he’s here and she’s best friends with my other roommate. THEN, my other roommate’s boyfriend lives here and he’s best friends with the guy who’s living on our couch.

Everybody’s friends with everybody, and they’re all from the town where I go to school. I’m the outsider who nobody cares about because I’m just there due to the situation. 

This makes for a very alienating and unhappy living situation and I don’t know what to do about it.

I already had to switch to another building in the complex due to another roommate situation where I was flat out being bullied, and was happy for a while until these people moved in.

I don’t know what to do. I somewhat want to snitch on them for having other people live here, but it would be obviously that I was the one who told because nobody else knows about it, and the people who do are in the friend group. It would make my life a living hell.

Please help. My grades are dwindling because of it and I’m 5 hours away from my hometown and the only place I have to myself here makes me uncomfortable.

Thanks to all who help out.",11Apr2019,1
12,"Please help me reddit. I'm freaking out and the guilt is immense and it's been awhile since it occurred even. 

So a few weeks ago I woke up on a coworker's couch basically half naked. He mentioned that when he woke up there was another one of my coworkers next to me... Also basically half naked. I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AND THIS GIRL WAS NOT HER. Keep in mind we are NOT open and I have zero inclinations to ever be. I love my girlfriend dearly and I am very monogamous.

 I freak the hell out and Uber home to my girlfriend and have a panic attack talking to her since I didn't even remember when she went home from the bar that night. (Background: every time I get drunk, I feel guilty the next day. Especially the few times I've blacked out. So this is a little normal for me to freak out about being drunk previously). So I'm telling her her the best I can through the panic that I'm so upset that I didn't remember and that I woke up on the couch like I did and say that I don't know if I had slept with the coworker or not. She says ""it's okay, no matter what"" because she's amazing and she helps me calm down. But what if she was only saying that to get me to calm down? I try and remember things but I can't. My coworker then texts me apologizing for what happened. So then I'm hit with ""oh no. That did happen and I was so drunk I didn't know/can't remember"". And I haven't told my girlfriend this yet new info about the text yet. I don't know what to do. I love her and I'm embarrassed and scared to tell her that part because what if she didn't mean it was okay? I don't care about forgiveness, I care about her.  I know it's not okay at all and I feel horrible and I don't want to hurt her. But I really can't remember anything and I have no idea why I would ever, ever cheat on her. Even when blackout drink as I was. 

 I also work with this person like 3 days a week and it's so weird and awkward but we were good friends before. Advice about any part of this situation would be great please. I'm so upset with myself and disappointed. Ive been depressed and hating myself ever since and I think my gf probably notices. I haven't drank since,. obviously, and I constantly feel sick and like I did the worst thing ever to my girlfriend because I did. I don't know what to do.

13,"TL;DR My boyfriend and I are saving up about 3-4 months of expenses so that we can pick up and move to brand new city and find jobs when we get there. Is this a terrible plan?

Hello! I (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) are planning a great escape. We met in college and have been together for four years. We both graduated with Bachelors about a year ago. We had no idea where we wanted to live so I suggested we move back into my hometown area so we could be with my family. I got a job pretty quickly and my boyfriend got one about a month later. We both agreed to stay at my parents house to save up money for our own place... but you see those few months became indefinite. 

You see, about a month into our new jobs, my boyfriend decided he wanted to go back to school and get his masters so he started applying to schools. Since we thought my boyfriend would be going back to school is a little under eight months, we didn't want to get wrapped up into a 12 month lease for an apartment so we both decided to stay at my parent's house. My parents are very loving, they have never tried to push us out and plus they also have a pretty giant house so space has never been an issue. I just feel as though there comes a time when living at home becomes suffocating. 

So, fast forward several months and my boyfriend got into almost every school he applied to (YAY!) but he decided that school wasn't the right idea for him right now (due to finances and him not wanting to take out loans) and so he declined the acceptances. And recently he and I have started getting stir crazy about living at home so we have decided that we want to move out. But move out and move to a different city where the cost of living is not so incredibly high. So we have started crafting a Great Escape Plan... and it might be a little crazy... 

My boyfriend and I are actively applying to jobs in three different cities that we have identified but it is really difficult to get any kind of responses because we live wayyy out of state and none of the jobs will consider us due to that fact. So we have hatched a plan to save money like crazy people, create a nest egg of about 3-4 months of expenses and then just pick up and move to a new city and find jobs when we get there. This plan is insane right? I just keep thinking about the catastrophic events that could happen... but also it sounds really exciting to me. I mean I think that if we were ever going to do this in our lives this would be the time... we are young, we are both debt-free, we have no obligations except to ourselves and each other... 

Has anyone ever done something like this? How did it go? Should we do this? Thank you so much for the advice!",11Apr2019,4

15,"I really love running but I have a heart condition called SVT. I've seen 2 cardiologists about, and they both told me it wasn't going to kill me and that it's not as uncommon as I may think.

It's basically an extra electric signal in my heart that can be triggered by extreme stress or intense exercise. This usually results in an attack where my heart rate starts beating at 200+ beats per minute and this lasts around 10-15 minutes The last time it happened, I finished a 4 mile run and I was completely exhausted. My heart started beating at around 230-240 bpm. It really scared the shit out of me and made me want to stop running. This was about 8 months ago, and I have been extremely paranoid about hard workouts ever since. I try to exercise by walking 5-6 miles a day but I would much rather be running.

I worry that this condition is worse than the doctors think, and while I realize this seems irrational, I have always had a certain amount of health anxiety, and its hard to use reason to calm myself down sometimes. What should I do to try to get a grip on this and start running again?",11Apr2019,1

Me (22,M) just recently got out of a long term (almost 5 year) relationship with my HS Sweetheart (21,F), we've been long distance for a while as she went out of state for school. It's been a struggle maintaining a LDR along with school, and work but we've made it work. Long story short, we recently broke up due to drifting apart and so on. I love her with all my heart but not even two days later, I see really suggestive IG stories with her and one of her close guy friends who i KNEW has been shooting his shot at her for as long as I've known him. I had a feeling this guy was just waiting for me to disappear from the picture and I'm also upset she let it happen. I know she's probably got her own reasoning but still.

Am I in the right to be upset? Should I contact her and tell her how I felt? I'm kinda lost at what to do...

I am very familiar with dating apps, Tinder, Dilmil(south asian tinder), minder (muslim tinder). I had a very bad experience on Minder and Tinder. I met up with a few..surprisingly but the last date I went on I felt very violated and traumatized and never went back. I have grown a lot and truly feel I have matured especially since the last time and as I am someone who craves the love that a whole 7 billion other people crave for I cant help but feel confident and ready to try one last time. I have seen a lot of posts about how these dating apps are a scam but after hearing some success stories from close friends Im willing to give it a shot.

I know this should be a decision just for myself, but I cant help but be afraid that my close friends and family will judge me for going back to dating apps after such a horrid first experience.

22,"I know that most of the people here think that being a minor (16y/o) will make me unable to take care of myself and that this is just ""teenage Angst"" but in reality, I've been taking care of myself since I was 8. As long as I can remember my parents have manipulated and mentally abused me to the point in which I rather go to school and being bullied there than going back home. I've been fighting depression for years and everything was going well, I thought that I had recovered, but since the beginning of the year things are only getting worse. 

My parents changed their jobs so now they're more at home, keep in mind that till they changed they jobs I could only see them about an hour per day. My house is now like a nightmare, I'm the only one doing the chores and taking care of the dog, but I also have to study and go to classes, I feel like the stress is killing me. I have passed from beating depression to being at the edge of falling again and I just can't stand it. I don't want to be depressed again, it was really hard for me to survive last time and if I have to go through that again I'm not sure if I will be able to stay alive. My parents instead of helping me are only making this worse. They insult me, they treat me like a baby when I need to be taken seriously but the rest of the time I'm ""old enough"" for taking care of me. Sometimes there isn't food at home for weeks and they don't care about it even if I complain all the time.

31,"Hi, my dad runs a small painting business in California (35+ years) and he's always had repeat customers and new clients from word of mouth. The last few years, his business hasn't been doing too well so I thought it would be a good idea to start doing internet campaigns (mainly yelp, starter website, email address, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

We've gotten a handful of new clients this way but it seems to have also attracted a ton of scammers asking for estimates and then sending us fake or invalid checks to cash (that will eventually bounce) and asking for money back because they ""accidentally overpaid."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly, we know these are scams but as a business, I never want to rule anyone out as a scam until I see the tall tale signs of the ""overpaid, please send back"" or ""give the rest to the handyman,"" etc...which still requires me to talk to them, send estimates, etc. It takes our time to do it (though, I admit, when I feel something is off, I do a very VERY quick and rough estimate to see it play out) but in any case, it's really annoying to deal with. I have a full time 9-5 job and I do this on the side for my dad during my pockets of downtime throughout the day or evening so I really want to minimize any wasted time.

Whenever I tried to see my friend outside of school she was always busy with something, which is fine. Everybody gets busy, so I haven’t really seen her except randomly, only by circumstance of being in the same area of our school.

I saw her briefly the other day, she was on her way to her boyfriends, and she asked to make plans &amp; I said yeah of course because I was surprised and wanted to see her. 

Day of the plans come, I never see her. She never texts me or anything but then she’s posting things with her boyfriend. I text her and she never responds. 

I’m starting to think our friendship is just out of circumstance, or at least it has been for the past year. Before that, it was solid and I wouldn’t of questioned it.

42,"**Background:**

After a massive fight with my best friend at the time, I completely broke. Was already in a bad place with depression and seeing a therapist for a variety of stuff that happened over the course of a year (not all involving ex-bf). This fight killed me inside but was ultimately good for me because I realized she was a covert narcissist who I had put too much of myself into caring about. Thankfully, I found some great resources for this exact type of relationship abuse and been getting much stronger emotionally and trusting myself again. This fight was 2 months ago and we haven't really spoken since. We are roommates though.

On top of being roommates, her boyfriend lives with us so it is just us 3 in an apartment. At first, they thought I would move out because of the fight but when I made it clear to her boyfriend I wasn't moving, he said they would move and I overheard her talk about moving so it seemed like they intended to do so. Been 2 months now and the boyfriend just bought a brand new computer. I'm starting to think they don't have any intention of moving, at least not anytime soon.

When I said I wouldn't move, I said it was for money reasons though it was for much more than that. I found the apartment after a lot of daily searching, I set up everything from utilities to internet to renting the moving equipment. All responsibilities have been on my shoulders to make sure everything is paid on time, notifying management of maintenance, finding a washer and dryer, etc. This was the same for our previous apartment as well. Both great apartments for incredible prices due to my patience and daily searches. Plus I was very flexible with them paying me rent on time.

Anyway, I started buying stuff too including my own computer for school. I think they saw me buying all this stuff and think it is bullshit I can't afford to move. I can afford the one-time move, but not staying in a whole other apartment with much higher rent. They have 2 incomes plus her college loan money she won't be paying back for years. And yeah, I do think I am more entitled to the apartment with all the work and diligence that has been put into it. There is more to this but trying to not make this crazy long.

**The question I have for you:**

Her boyfriend is here illegally. He is not on the lease and can't be put on the lease cause then we won't qualify for the apartment. The property manager doesn't know but the office lady we deal directly with does and doesn't really mind. I asked her about what it would take to get him kicked out because I figure if he's gone, she'll go with him. She said she can issue a ""friendly"" letter stating he has to leave or get on the lease (which he can't cause we won't qualify anymore.) The official letter forces him out in only 2-3 days while a friendly one gives more leeway with more like 2-3 weeks. I don't want to put him or her on the street which is why I haven't really pushed the issue since I know getting the money for a move and new downpayment is hard. But I am also going crazy with them here, have anxiety all the time from her being around, and even though I've moved past caring about our relationship and heart-wrenching breakup, I can only move on so much with her living in the same apartment as me. I feel suffocated and my home feels hostile now. Should I give more time for them or ask the office manager to issue a ""friendly"" letter?

Also, I thought about asking the boyfriend if they are still looking for a place but I'm scared he will say they changed their mind and then if the friendly letter gets issued they will know I'm behind it. Right now it will appear more random since if they have changed their mind, they know I don't know yet. The office lady is willing to keep it a secret from them that I am asking for it. If he refuses to move then I run the risk of us all getting evicted though I doubt my ex-bf would want that on her record any more than I would want it on mine but they might be spiteful enough for it.",11Apr2019,1

45,"My sisters a single mum to 2 boys, ages 3 &amp; 7. They are both the result of one night stands and their fathers have no involvement in their lives.

When she had her first child she partied and took drugs with him present. It’s not like she didn’t have any time without her son- I babysat a lot as did my mum and aunties. So why if she got so many free nights did she need to do this whilst he was present? at my wits end I contacted social services.They visited, didn’t see any evidence of my claims and had no more involvement. 
 
She cut me off as a result of this but did stop partying with him present.

Fast forward a few years she has baby number 2- my mum passed away when he was  9 month.

I try to support my sister, I babysit 3/4 times a week. 

I do this  because when my mum passed my sister said she only kept baby 2 because my mum said she won’t be alone she’ll have her support. 

I didn’t want her to feel trapped like she had no life, but now I think I’ve just been condoning her bad behaviour. 

My sister doesn’t feed her children on schedule- she stays in bed and they climb on a chair to a top cupboard and help themselves to a chocolate for breakfast. 

Her main concerns are her appearance and her friends.

Her house is 90% off a time a mess.

She runs out of nappies and wipes but spends £35+ a week getting her make up done to party with her friends and god knows how much on the actual night.

She pays no attention to her 7yo and he is a visibly anxious boy. 
Some days she doesn’t take him to school because she’s slept in and she’s receiving letters from the school around his attendance. 

On Monday she asked me to babysit a couple of hours and then stayed out all night not even bothering to return to take him to school-  I walked him there so he didn’t actually miss the day. It’s not the first time it’s happened so now I say to her if your staying out all night tell me so I can wake up earlier to walk him to school (she has a car). She always says no no I’m going for a couple of hours then goes out and eventually switches her phone off. 

I confronted her this morning, she’s very much in denial and says she’s a good mum. I can’t raise her children for her because I have my own issues. I know now she’ll cut me off and continue with her lifestyle. 

all I want is for her to open her eyes and realise her children should  come first. I don’t want to contact social services again but I want her to get some support.

As the title suggested, I recently just sold my car back to my dealership.  
Now I still owe $10K to the bank that I took the loan from but I sold my car for $13K - Today, I went in and signed the papers to transfer the car over to the dealership's name and they gave me a cheque for $3K and said that the $10K will be paid out to the bank that my loan is under, but when I asked for a confirmation number, they didn't have one and the manager said to trust his words that my loan at the bank will be paid out by them in a few business days.

Is this normal? Should I have gotten some kind of confirmation letter or anything?  


I also don't have any documents that we signed either, they have everything with them and all I got today was my cheque for the $3K, and the bank still hasn't receive the payment to pay off the remaining owing amount ($10K) from the dealership yet.

52,"Title explains much of the situation. For more background information, I’ll start from when this mess began. 

*Just as a VERY IMPORTANT foreword, NGA is used to calculate rank. It is an average of all grades on the 100-point scale, using “weight” for advanced classes. All grades from high school are calculated EXCEPT the last 9 weeks of senior year. This NGA number (sans the final 9 weeks of senior year) determines rank. This is because the final grades for these classes are not complete and may alter rank.

Last week, I was told I was Salutatorian. I was elated and crushed. Elated because, of course, I was at least recognized. But I was crushed as I had securely held my #1 spot for four years. I also was far ahead of many other students. At least two weeks prior I knowingly was first, and securely.

I was confused. I was angry at myself for, in my mind, not trying hard enough. I was not angry at the Valedictorian The other kid, who I shall call Owen, is a brilliant kid. He is heavily involved in extracurriculars and community service. We are friends as well. 

I couldn’t bring myself to be angry at someone who worked fairly. I was devastated in failing my own expectations. I was angry at myself. I was told I fell short by one one-hundredth of a point (0.01). This just deepened my frustration. I asked the principal to rerun the numbers so as to make sure there was no rounding error in the computer system, and he agreed he would eventually. I just thought he agreed to placate my unfounded concerns.

In the following few days I swallowed my pride and got over myself. I realized I didn’t need to be Valedictorian, no matter how much it hurt. Internally upset, yes. But self-pitying? I was not going to act that way.

Then this Monday I was called into the principal’s office. Turns out, after rerunning the numbers, the principal decided that Owen and I would both be Valedictorian. No school in our county has ever done this. Apparently 0.01 points was negligible in the principal’s eyes - or at least that is what he said.

Over the past few days there has been a building amount of evidence pointing towards (what I would like to call) a coverup. My evidence is as follows:

- A teacher who works closely with grades was surprised that Owen was not Salutatorian. I had, as she put it, “smoked him,” and I was ahead.

- I hand-calculated my own ranking NGA from my transcript. It was much higher than the NGA I have currently due to my final 9 weeks classes dragging it down.

- I discovered that Owen’s NGA was close to mine when using the wrong NGA: the NGA with grades for the final 9 weeks.

- The counselor refused to give me my NGA that calculated rank. After I insisted many times, she simply changed the subject.

- The yearbook will not be showing Owen’s NGA nor mine. Every year prior, NGA for Salutatorian and Valedictorian has been listed. Why else would they not show it if not for a large discrepancy?

- The principal, when confronted, never denied that there was an error. He never tried to dismiss it when there should be irrefutable proof that otherwise shows no mistakes were made in calculating rank.

Essentially, I have no proof that there was an error. But the school refuses to give me my NGA, when they are required to give it to students. This, I believe, is the most incriminating, as well as with the principal’s reaction.

I believe they used the wrong NGA in calculating rank. I do not mind sharing Valedictorian with Owen - in fact, it’s actually nice. There’s no one else I’d rather share it with.

What I DO mind is the rumors claiming I was given Valedictorian as “pity.” People are claiming I whined until I got what I want - which is not true in the slightest. I have worked very hard for these past four years and I do not want my efforts to be stained by rumor.

Is there any way to get the school to own up to their mistakes? I still want Owen to be Valedictorian. I do not think their mistake should mean denying Owen this, especially when he was told so.

Is there any way to address this? I just want people to know that I am fairly Valedictorian, not clawing my way to the top in desperation.",11Apr2019,2
53,"Not sure where exactly to post this so just posting this here. 

Earlier today my co-workers and I, all shift managers at a somewhat large e-commerce company were at a meeting. During the meeting we were going over metrics, I had better metrics than the other shifts - not to brag this will be useful information later. Towards the end of the meeting, our manager was going over how we should improve on communication between shifts. To force some communication he asked another manager and I how our shifts have been working together (we work together on one day a week) The other manager mentioned that my team has not been working as hard as his and people from his shift have noticed and used it as an excuse during accountability, obviously not true as we have better metrics. I feel like he has been saying this often about my shift and pushing blame my way whenever his metrics on this specific day are brought up as I have overheard him say this before or other things similar about my shift.

55,"I'm in my second year of college going for a computer science degree, and I don't know how well I'll be able to handle the future semesters. Since I transferred to this new school (this new school has a compsci major and my old school didn't), it's been hell. Some professors are decent, but in the two semesters I've been here, there have been at least a class or two where I'm teaching myself the entire class because the professor is god awful.

&amp;#x200B;

For this semester, I've been teaching myself C++ and discrete math because both of my professors explain everything terribly (when I asked around, this was the common opinion as well so I know it's not me). I'm running out of patience because youtube tutorials don't cover everything that my professor expects us to learn, and the notes that he gives us are practically written in another language; it's extremely difficult to grasp. I go to tutoring for discrete math but I'm getting tired of that as well because the tutors aren't helpful at times and there's a lot of questions I have to ask (mainly for HW). Also, between classes, assignments, studying, and teaching myself the material, I don't have a lot of free time for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a side project I've been working on, and it's become the light at the end of the tunnel because I truly love working on it and I know it could blossom into a beautiful future for me if I work hard enough at it (I prefer to keep the details of this project private for personal reasons). I work on it in my spare time, but because school eats away at my time, I haven't been as active as I want to be in the past couple of weeks/months. I don't want to put it down because I did that last semester to focus on calc 2, and I wasted a lot of time. I could have put a big dent in that project, but didn't because school got in the way.

Taking a semester off is out of the question because my parents would fly off the handle and get very interrogative. I haven't been motivated to work on school stuff and even my project at times.

In addition to 4 fender benders, I got my 2nd DUI in November of last year. Drove into a guard rail after falling asleep. That totaled my vehicle (second time I totaled a vehicle). I am on supervised probation for one year. License is suspended until about Sept. However, I have been clean 68 days. It helps when you are one urine test away from jail. I am scared to get behind the wheel again. I am tired of insurance calls. I wonder if I am worthy of the privilege. 

But, on a day-to-day basis, alcohol gave me something to be excited about when I got home. I could drink a couple of pours of bourbon and just space out to music or horror films. The only person I have to keep me company is myself, anyway. Half the time I cannot get out of my own fucking head to begin with. I have no friends. They have found jobs elsewhere, moved away, began raising a family. I don't want to do that. I don't want to date, I don't feel it suits me. 

I try to travel when I can. Music, sports, history. That's why I go. I also like being around strangers I know there is a small chance for commitment. Just bar chatter and move on. I likely won't see them one more time.

I have been to 5 or 6 therapists in the last 3 years. I attempted suicide in May of 2016. Sometimes I think it helps, but the fact I cannot afford to pay out of pocket for therapy hinders the quality (or so I've considered). I must use insurance, which limits my selection. I had to leave a very good therapist because paying for her was borderline financial suffocation. 

I have tried hobbies as a pleasurable distraction, but I grow disinterested somewhat quickly. I just cannot focus for too long without wishing I had something else to move on to. That's why I find myself on places like YouTube a lot. I can change the channel/type of video as soon as I feel the boredom creep in.

59,"I'm so stressed out, I feel like I could just combust right where I sit. Today has been a roller coaster. 

Work was okay. Work is always okay. I enjoy what I do for a living. That's not really an issue in this. I was in a good mood at work. 

Me and my girlfriend have been looking for a bigger, possibly cheaper apartment for a few weeks now. We have lived in the same 500 square foot apartment for nearly two years now. I enjoy it, but there are some downsides. She wants to move, and won't really consider staying here for another year. My lease here is up at the end of July, but the company is making me renew my lease by the 14th (this Sunday), or else it's going on the market for somebody else to rent. I've been discreetly trying to convince her to stay here, while at the same time I'm slightly wanting to move. One issue is money. That's always been an issue with her and I. She has a shopping problem, and that has always hindered my ability to save money because I have to pick up most of the bills. 

I love her - I really do. Although, there are a few things that drive me crazy. One, obviously, the money thing. She is also very messy (the polar opposite of my lifestyle), and she can have a bad temper at times. 

Why does all of this matter?

My brother called me today to tell me that he was offered a job in Denver, Colorado (we both currently live in Ohio). He was very excited to tell me the news, and he wants me to move out there with him, his wife, and their son in July (perfect timing). I would live with them until I could find a job and my own place. This is awesome. I've always wanted to move out west. 

But here's where it gets hairy. Thanks for reading this far.

One, I don't know if my girlfriend would want to. I know I can't hold myself back based on her personal wants, but that's just the kind of guy I am. I've always been a wimp. 
Two, I don't even know if I want her there. I can't continue on with her financial behavior. 

I haven't even mentioned any of this to her yet. She is still at work. 

This is all that I was stressed about until I got home a couple hours ago. 

I turned on the kitchen sink, and out comes a stream of jet black water. I've never had this problem before. But of course when I'm attempting to convince my girlfriend to stay here for another year, this happens. I dont know whether or not I should tell her about it. I googled it, and it means that the hot water tank is going out. That's not a huge deal. The apartment maintenance will swap it out. To her it would be a huge deal breaker. 

One more small anecdote to really drive the stressed out point home: I still need to finish filing my taxes before the Monday deadline. The problem is that my W2 is screwed up, and I can't get ahold of anyone to help me.

65,"I'm a 16 year old male living with my dad (60) but I lived with my mom for a majority of the time from April 2013 to January of 2019, my mother (49) got seperated from my dad when I was 3 (after pretty much forcing the family to move states before I was even born and making my dad pay bills because she was saving up for a boob job) my two oldest (half)sisters who he had practically raised from the age of 4 and 6 respectively immediately treated him as scum of the earth and only came to his house for holidays with me and my actual sister (8 years my senior), then my mother started cheating on my very hard working dad with a man who played video games at least 12 hours of the day then when I was in 4th grade my mom moved to a town 20 minutes away from my dad me and my dad thought that it was fine I only went to her house 2/7 days in a week anyway, then after my first day of 4th grade she did 3 things: took me out of school in my hometown with my friends and put me in a new school at the other town, she filed for divorce after being seperated for 7 years, and she broke up with her boyfriend. I hated my first day at the new school but my mother told me 3 days and if I didn't like it I could go back to my hometown I'm now a sophmore in highschool in said town not because I've made friends after 6 years but because my mother lied to my face and kept me in that town after my dad lost the divorce case despite the lawyer for kid's (me in this case) saying that I was better off with my dad because I was showing signs of depression at age 10 then before the case was over she had a new boyfriend. About 6 months after the divorce and I was living with her 5.5/7 days a week she was pregnant with my little (half) sister then about 2 years later she bought me a dog a 3/4 german sheperd 1/4 chow all black cute as all hell female, now I was still going to my dad's on weekends and my (pretty much) step sister was taking care of the dog when I was at my dad's then she didn't want to so my mother had to, she didn't like that so she had the dog put down (by letting it run away and not claiming it). Then my depression got worse (I had just lost my one source of constant happiness) and then at 13 I started contemplaying suicide and decided I would cut my wrist somewhere outdoors and at 15 I finally had enough and tried but I couldn't break the skin... so I went home defeated and feeling numb inside and out I burnt myself just to feel something (edgy, I know) but shortly after I met my gf and became happier then after getting my license at 16 and my dad bought me a car I just started staying at my dad's more and my depression lessened even more until I realized that it was my mother who made me feel worthless cause she never spent time with me or did anythimg she just bought me things so I'd leave her alone and it worked, until it backfired on her cause one day I stopped going to her house and haven't gone back since.

But...

A lot of my clothes and games and other personal items me, my dad, and my friends spent money on are still there and my little (half) sister misses me. Should I swing by and get my things and visit her or just make life easier and not starting more drama by going there?

67,"For clarity. I'm an adult. I've worked several jobs before. and it's not the working aspect that scares me.

it's the aspect that I don't know what a ""good"" job looks like. 

I've had a long string of shitty jobs. 

First job I worked as a gas jockey and then quit after management changed and my workload was drastically changed from doing the regular gas jockey duties to basically taking care of the store while the new manager sat behind the till. I quit after the manager and a customer sat and berated me for taking a bathroom break. (we didn't get scheduled breaks) 

I worked as a laborer for public works. This was probably the best job I've had. if it wasn't for the toxic environment of my home town and being passed over for raises/promotions several times because the boss had an issue with ""young kids"" I probably would have stuck around. 

I worked a job where I was supposed to be trained as a butcher.  They stuck me in the back, didn't train me to do anything and just had me do work in the freezer. Then they trained the next guy hired on.

Longest job I worked was a carwash where I was basically stuck in the washbay and forgotten about. Didn't know when my days off were so I could never plan anything. I was the first to be sent home if it was slow, And eventually I ""was let go"" because I took medical time off to let the minor case of trenchfoot I got from working there to heal. (they were supposed to supply footwear but the walmart the boss went to didn't have my size, so it was either cope with too small footwear or just buy and bring my own. I was making minimum wage.) 

Then lastly. The job I worked before I went back to school was in the oilfield working 14 hour days for stretches of 21-25 days in a row depending on ""if they could get somebody to fill in for me"" Then it's 4 days off and right back to it.  

In any case. I'm terrified because in the time I've been a student. I've been able to actually make friends and gain a new hobby or two. I actually have things to do on the weekends. I've been able to have a life. Something I've been wanting to have since I left my home town. 

I'm terrified that it's going to be another case of ""give up all your plans and personal time. You don't get a set schedule. You get to work in the back by yourself. we're barely going to train you. 

I know not every job is like that. but what can I look for? 

How do I avoid getting stuck in one of those situations again?",11Apr2019,2

69,"Alright, so I’m not sure how worried I should be. I’ll explain. 

So I was with a girl, and during sex our condom broke, I didn’t “finish” inside her, however I know that there was probably stuff already inside the condom. 

We immediately stopped what we were doing, washed everything, and just went to bed. She said she was on birth control, so I didn’t worry to much that night. 

In the morning we went and bought a plan B because I was a little paranoid and just wanted to make sure. 

We then went to grab something to eat but she didn’t order any food and said she would “eat later” and take the pill before her work (which was in an hour). She seemed a little worried about taking to pill and was a bit dodgy in general. However she told me she took it, and I believed her at the time. But now I’m starting to worry, just cuz it got in my head and I’m over thinking things. 

So my worry is she didn’t actually take the pill, and that the only thing keeping the rest of my life from taking a sharp left turn is her promise that she was on the pill. 

In the end I guess I’m asking for advice on:
A) if she actually was on the pill and **didn’t** take plan b. How worried should I be?
B) if she did both, how worried should I be? 
C) if she wasn’t on the pill, and didn’t take the plan B, how fucked am I?",11Apr2019,1
70,"Hi. 

I'm the second of three children. Our parents are both dead, with my mother finally dying when I was eighteen. By then, I was already living on my own after getting kicked out at sixteen. At that point, I was flourishing, with no desire to see either my brothers or mother ever again. 

Unbeknownst to me, I was still in her will; her hopelessly convoluted will, which listed myself and my brothers as her heirs. Willed to us was her house, which included a stipulation: only once my youngest brother, five years younger than me, turned twenty-five, the house could be sold. 

Next, we turn to the asshole in my story: the executor of her estate, Ben. 

I met Ben once, a long time ago. My family had bought beef from him years before, and we had once gone to his house (or farm? I was young, and I distinctly remember having a GameBoy Color and playing Bloody Roar with his daughter). She chose this particular person because no one else could stand her. She was estranged from her own family, had driven away her only friend after he started living with us for a time and roundly despised my father's side. Of the very, very short list of people, Ben was the only one who would agree to take on the role. 

I've personally always disliked Ben. Before my leaving home, he was abusive to me. This, in conjunction with a mounting League of Legends addiction, untreated mental health issues and violent siblings, ultimately led to a breakdown. I spent a few weeks in a mental health ward, wherein I would find out I could no longer return home. 

So, I'll skip ahead now, through the six years since then. I was recently contacted by a P.I. hired by Ben. Tonight, after finally speaking with him, he offered me $20,000 to back out of the will, bringing me here tonight. This amount, he claims, would be roughly my share after taxes and outstanding debts are paid out. 

I have no doubt Ben is a leech and backstabber. Looking into houses in the area, they easily go for more than $600,000. I have no doubt my mother accrued many, many debts in her time; but, I also hold sincere doubt that she managed to increase her debt to that much. His intent is to maximize the payout to my brothers when the time comes, the younger currently being in his care. 

Were it anyone else, I would tell them to wait. However, this man triggers me. The thought of interacting with him gives me extreme anxiety. I get taken back to days when I would be in constant fear, with serious suicidal thoughts that I've only recently managed to train out of myself. Having to deal with him for the next five years is terrifying. 

Another factor is my job. I work retail, and I'm being demoted at the end of the month (my job role is being eliminated companywide, but I knew this was going to happen eventually). I'm keeping my pay, but I'm about to lose quite a bit of my paycheck. This money would give me a cushion in case my situation worsens.

With my mental health in mind, what would you all suggest? I'm currently leaning toward taking the money, though I may press him for more, as I'm sure he'll see it as a small inconvenience against his eventual payout. But, I'd like the opinions of others not as attached to the situation. What are your recommendations?",11Apr2019,1
71,"This isn’t a big issue compared to some of the posts on here but I’ve been going to the same gym for quite some time and there’s a guy who works at the gym (late 30’s, I’m in my early 20’s) and he constantly hits on me. When I’m walking up to the gym and see him checking in guests I actually dread going in. Because I’m absolutely not interested and am going to the gym for the sole purpose of working out.

Usually he’s with another employee so he keeps his flirtations to a minimum but he was alone today and proceeded to hit on me pretty aggressively. 

Tonight, out of the blue, he followed me on instagram which I think is absolutely inappropriate considering I never gave him my name or showed interest back.

So my question is: Should I report this to the gym?

72,"I am in high school and at my school most people are involved in sports. It’s kind of expected that everyone does a sport, so as the young, naive teen that I am, of course I tried a couple over the years. I thought maybe there’s something wrong with me because there was no sport that I was enjoying, until I finally realized (took me long enough), sports aren’t for everyone and that’s okay, I just gotta find the things that I enjoy. People go to parties, spend all their free time with friends, are in school clubs and stuff, and I’m just not into that kind of stuff.  I know i’m not the only one like this, and I know that it is okay. I know that everyone is different and has their own things they enjoy and that’s cool and everything, but I just don’t know what I enjoy, at least not yet. I come home everyday, watch Netflix for hours and hours but that’s not really what I want to do, it seems it is just the only thing to do. I’m bored of this mundane, dull, routine, but it seems there is nothing else for me to do. I sat down and thought for a couple minutes “what is important to me?” and I couldn’t really seem to find anything. Sure I enjoy music, playing guitar, drawing, but I couldn’t really seem to think of anything that is important to me. There’s nothing I would die for, nothing I’m passionate about. I have accepted that i’m no athlete, no partier, not obsessed with school, and I’m okay with that, but is it normal to at times have nothing important to you?

74,"This is going to be a long story y'all, so grab some snacks and settle in.  


I am a 13 year old female. I am dealing with a lot of stress, mostly school related. I have a lot of assignments/homework due but on top of that, recently a girl and her friend (we'll call them... Julia and Mary) in my science class started teasing me. Almost taunting me. She'd say stuff like ""hey my birthday's in 2 weeks wanna come to my party? HAHA just kidding you're not invited."" as well as stuff like, ""I just LOVE your outfit. It's so trendy."" (sarcastically.) She would also invade my personal space A LOT which I don't appreciate at all. I know it sounds stupid and it didn't used to bother me much but it has been relentless for the past month or so, and it's been getting to me lately. They tease me about my outfits, who I hang out with, the stuff I like, etc. (I'm a big Harry Potter fan so they love to tease me about that.) Anyways, my best friend usually takes care of them for me with a witty comeback or a joke, because I'm terrible at that kind of thing, but I realize that she's not always going to be there when I need to deal with them.   
Tomorrow, for instance, the whole school is going on a field trip except for me, Julia, Mary, and a few other kids, none of which I know that well. The kids that aren't going on the field trip still have to go to school, so I'm going to be stuck with them literally all day. I don't know what to do when they talk to me. I just stutter like an idiot and can't think of anything to say back. Again, their stupid jokes and sarcasm-filled insults never really used to bother me, but lately they're having more of an effect on me.

My next issue seems so stupid I don't even know if I should mention it. But hell, why not. I've liked this kid ever since the beginning of the year. He's adorable, nice and has a great sense of humor. But the only problem is, he never talks to me. He never even looks at me. He knows my name and a little bit about me, but it's almost like he avoids me on purpose. We currently have 2 classes together but he pretty much never acknowledges I'm there. It just crushes me because I know he doesn't like me but I feel like if I talk to him at all it would be way too obvious that I like him.  I think he might already suspect it. And I know how trivial this is compared to other people's problems, but I really don't know what to do about this. It's like I'm just waiting for something that's never going to happen.  
So all this has me pretty down in the dumps. I often have a feeling of emptiness. I have kind of a salty personality too so sometimes I snap at people when I get irritated and I feel like people think I'm a bitch for that. When in reality I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just easily aggravated. I feel like no one will ever love me and I sometimes feel like everyone hates me. I also think I may have very mild anxiety as I have a lot of little quirks and nervous habits. I'm not going to lie, I've cried at night because I've just felt overwhelmed by all this and had no idea what to do.  
But it's not all bad. I smile, I laugh and I joke, and I have an amazing family who loves me and a few close friends. I'm not constantly sad, it just comes and goes when it pleases. I really just needed to write everything out so that maybe it would make more sense to me. If you've read all of this I'm actually really surprised.

80,"I am currently finishing up school right now and will graduate December 2019. My fiancé and I are getting married Summer 2020 (we have been together 5 years). He currently has a job as a sound engineer for a recording studio and makes about 30K a year. He has been working there for two years now and is hoping to find a new, better job as he is quite underpaid and treated pretty crappy by his Bosses. Right now, my Fiancé is entertaining the idea of quitting his job and attending grad school at a very elite school in one of the most expensive states in the US. He applied and was accepted for the Winter semester of 2020, which is right before we are planning on getting married, so he would be there for a semester, come home for the summer to get married, then we would both go back together while he finishes up grad school. It is super awesome that he was accepted and I think that is why he is getting pretty serious about the idea. At first, it was more of an ""I'll apply just for fun and see what happens,"" so I didn't think it was too serious or tbh even a possibility. I guess I'm posting here because I am concerned about this whole situation. We live on the complete opposite side of the country, so it would be a huge move. I have never been there and we would have to live near campus, which we cannot afford. I only work during the summer and get occasional gigs here and there and have like $800 in my bank account currently and my fiancé has about $15,000 in savings. We already have about 50K in debt collectively from Undergrad, and if he goes to grad school it will only increase dramatically, especially with no scholarships. He has been offered a job working for the school but it directly pays about half his tuition each semester, so it's not going into his bank account. I will have to find a job to support the both of us and I don't even know where to start (I will have a teaching degree for Music Education and be certified to teach K-12th grade music). 

I guess I'm looking for advice on how we can figure this out. I really want him to pursue his dreams and be his number one supporter, so I would love for him to go if it is what he really wants. I am more concerned with the logistics of how we are going to pay for everything... Maybe I am just overthinking this... Any advice? 


TL;DR: Fiancé wants to quit work to attend grad school at a very elite school in a completely different state (also, one of the most expensive states in the US) right before we are married.

I'm a 24 year old who doesn't work, doesn't study and hasn't gotten any qualifications above my Year 12 Certificate (Unless you want to count a qualification that enables me to obtain a specific license, which has expired 2 years ago). Each time I tried studying I've always dropped out because I felt no motivation, no desire to do anything except stay home and just jerk off and meet up with my mates whenever they want to go out.

Now is a different story. I've figured out what was wrong with me, my behavior and all the other jazz. I surrounded myself with toxic people, was always in the wrong environment, surrounded by drama and was also toxic and negative towards myself and other people, my partners in relationships, and to be honest, I did deserve to get dumped. If anything I was always nihilistic and I took measures to get rid of everything that affected me in a way that was negative.. which also gave me a non-existential social life.. not that I had a stable one to begin with. I've cut porn out of my life and also fast food, because I realized they were my escapes when I was feeling down/sad and ever since then my minds felt clear, I mean i feel shitty but it's like I know what to do, it's like my motivation started growing again and the motivation that fuels me is to stop being the way I am right now, being a manchild genuinely fucking irritates me..

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I figured out what I want to study and I also have a future position opportunity open for me if I decide to go ahead with studying, but at the same time I feel like I should work and start studying at the start of next year and save up as much as I can during the remainder of this year.. I mean I could do part time work and full time study but I just feel like I'm not going to earn as much.. I had a friend tell me that If I had absolutely nothing to do or had nothing going for me, he said just start studying now and let other things come along.. that way I'd have something to do and not let myself rot at home 24/7.

91,"Some background for context.

* I had a terrible childhood I was verbally abused for 14 years and I am a more sensitive/emotional person so a lot of the things my dad told me really destroyed me inside and I basically lived in my turtle shell for 24 years. I have nothing to show for this time, no relationships, no happy memories (the few are actually from playing video games), nothing except a HS diploma if that counts i guess.

Either way, 7 months ago i managed to not commit suicide and i dragged myself out of that pit and I have been depression free since then. I have been trying to get my life in order and actually make something out of it.

I have been working part time pretty consistently and I am currently trying to save up to move to GA to live with a friend. Well no surprise my family despises this idea and I've already heard all about how moving away will throw my life away and ruin it etc. But that is not why i am here. 

(i am trying to keep this short i swear)

I am here because my parents managed to get into trouble with the IRS. So now they owe 3,000 in a few days and my dad says they have to pay there are no payment options. or he refuses to do that i guess. Plus they will owe from this year and every year after since my bro and I are grown and they cant claim us anymore. On top of this before whenever i would get paid i would give what my dad wanted. I got paid 1200 my dad says gimme 800,900 ok fine. I get paid 2000 my dad says gimme 1500 ok fine. I dont want to do that anymore. I want to live my own life and do something.

So now I am at a point where I give them what 1500, 1000, 2000. basically save none of my check since i get paid once a month. Or give them my savings and get pushed away from being able to move out. Either way its give them my savings or give them my check I wont be saving anything. Every time I have gotten paid the past 4 months there have been arguments because I dont want to give him 50%+ of my check anymore. My dad always says he wants my brother and I to help that he wants us to stay here and help and take care of him and my ma and when they die we get everything. Get the house, cars, etc whatever. But I dont understand why i have to wait for them to die. Why cant i get things for myself. I feel like If i dont move out now, I never will and Ill just be stuck here forever. Because we are always ""poor"" and they need help. 

But if i dont help im a terrible son and my dad will hate me. The last time I tried to move out, (i lost my nerve) he told me he would never speak to me again and wouldnt even answer if i called. That was just leaving... this is not helping so I can leave. I dont want to look back when I am 30 and feel like I should have just killed myself but I feel like If i stay here thats the path Ill end up on.

95,"A little background on me: I’m a senior in high school, schools ending in about a month and a half. After that, bye high school and everything in it. 

So, a few weeks back and possibly even a month by now, in one particular class I got to know these two dudes who are close friends. They ended up sitting next to me for some reason. They’re really cool and I enjoy their presence. One in particular, though, I had always found attractive.  I actually met him and realize that he and I have more in common than I anticipated. It’s so awesome. 

I found out he had a girlfriend because he pointed it out not too soon after I met him, the second day I believe, so he definitely wasn’t trying to hide that. 

I can definitely feel some sort of a spark between us, maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I can just kind of feel it. The way he speaks to me and looks at me, overall the way he and i make jokes and get along, it’s all there. I don’t get the “simply friends” vibe from him. He isn’t being an asshole and straight up pursuing me, though, which I think is actually really good. 

Anyway, I’m just extremely conflicted. This guy, he feels so fucking perfect like one of a kind. I am extremely against cheating and stuff, so I don’t want to home wreck anyone, I know how these things work. I know that if he pursues me he’d probably end up doing the same to me in the future. I guess the best outcome would be I play the waiting game but like I previously mentioned, there being a month and a half left, that’s not an option. A part of me says get over it and just graduate and get the hell out but fuck every time I see him I can’t handle the feeling I get.  I honestly don’t know what to do. It would be a shame to just let an opportunity like this one go but at the same, he’s not mine to keep. Fuck, I have no idea what to fucking do. I honestly don’t know why life had to do this to me. 

So yeah, that’s my dilemma right now. It’s likely the answer here is to let it go because karma will fuck me over terribly, and trust me, I know that. More than anything, if I didn’t I wouldn’t be here right now. I guess I just want to hold on to any hope I mean c’mon. A one of a kind dude, everything lines up, the spark is there, but he has a fucking girl? There’s a month and half left? Fuckkkk? 

Thanks in advance for any help at all. 

TLDR: I’m a high school senior with a month and a half left of school, met this guy and had an immediate spark. He and I have common interests and it’s just so great, I get the vibe he might be into me too. He has a girlfriend and he’s not actively pursuing me and I find that a positive. I understand karma would Vite me in the ass if I hope wreck and I’m against the idea anyway. I’m conflicted and I have no idea what to fucking do.",11Apr2019,1
96,"I'm sorry in advance for how long this post is. I just feel like there's quite a bit of information relevant to the situation and I don't want to leave anything out. Any advice that anyone can offer would be super helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I'm 19, about to turn 20 in May. This friend (we'll call him Jake) is 22 or 23. He's been through some super rough patches (expelled from college twice, gone through a couple super bad breakups, attempted suicide several times) and I and some close friends have made it a point to stick with him through it all. We stay in contact with his parents if he says or posts anything worrying, and we do our best to free up time in our crazy schedules to meet up with him periodically. However, just because of the way it's worked out, I've been able to stick with him the closest. I went with him to the ER last time he hurt himself, and I've just been able to meet up with him the most. It's not like I'm somehow the most friendly or loving in the group, but I've had more free time than the others, and I've been in the right place at the right time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, over spring break of this year, my best friend (we'll call him Seth) and his dad took me to some dirt bike trails, to teach me to ride. I had almost no experience on anything with less than 4 wheels, so I had a blast learning how to ride a dirtbike, even if I fell off every 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

After school started up again, Seth and I met up with Jake to grab some ice cream and just be bros. When we were having ice cream, Seth remembered that he wanted to take me to a motorcycle dealership to have me sit on a few small road bikes (I'm a towering 5'2"" lol) and see how they fit me. So we all decided it would be fun to shoot over there and just take a look. We had me sit on a Honda Grom (because Seth wanted to get a good laugh at how normal the tiny little bike looks on me), but we ultimately settled on the fact that I would eventually buy a Kawasaki Z125. It's a really small bike with a small engine, so Seth said it would be great for me to learn how to ride without having to worry about losing track of how fast I'm going, until I become more comfortable with riding and can move up to a bigger bike.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, Jake said he might like to buy it ($3200) for my birthday. I told him I would never ask for something that huge, and he should most definitely not even consider doing that. I said if he wants to get me something, he can take me to grab breakfast at good bagel place downtown. He told me that $3200 isn't much at all with how much he makes at his job, and that he thinks it would be a ton of fun to see me whipping around with my friends that have bikes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on one hand, he does have quite a bit more money than most 22 year olds. He was kicked out of college 2 years ago, and has been working for a tree removal company that pays him well, and he's been able to work like 60-80 hour weeks when he wants to. I think he's making close to 40k/year, which while that isn't crazy, it's a lot for our age in our area.

&amp;#x200B;

However, he, by all accounts, has a very distorted view of friendships. He has always thrown money around at his friends, and we think it's because he feels that in order to have deep connections with those close to him, he has to buy loyalty. Obviously none of us want him to feel this way at all, and we prefer to pay for our own meals, pay for our own movie tickets, etc. However this just seems to be an idea that he has pretty much solidified in his head.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to Seth, and told him that if Jake texts him with questions about what kind of bike we were looking at, etc., to try to talk him out of it completely, or at the VERY least to at least point him to bikes that are as cheap as possible. Seth texted Jake and tried to find out exactly why he wants to buy the bike for me, and after about a day of dodging the question, he said that because I don't have my own personal vehicle yet, he thought it would help me out and would just be lots of fun for me. Now, I drive my parents 2013 Honda Accord, and am more than happy with, and extremely thankful for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Seth told Jake to make sure a motorcycle is ok with my parents, and Seth seems to be looking to contact my mom about it. My parents are fine with me having a bike, but are also understanding of me being hesitant to accept it. They said they aren't going to tell him he can't do it, but they understand that I want him to know I will be his friend regardless of what he does/doesn't do for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know that I can talk him out of this. Seth said he thinks Jake is genuinely just trying to be a good friend, but I'm still afraid that this is his attempt to buy a friendship that he already has. He has had a hard life, and I want him to feel that he doesn't have to worry about his true friends ever turning our backs on him, or leaving him behind just because he doesn't drop thousands of dollars on us.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my main question is this: Is there any approach to this that I could take that wouldn't be rude or insulting to him? Is it rude or insulting to deny the gift if he shows up at my house, already having purchased the bike?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm so sorry for how long this is. I just feel pretty scummy, because yes of course I want the bike. It fits me, it's safe for such a new (and small) rider, and I love it. But I would never want to see it again if it means damaging a friendship or taking advantage of a vulnerable guy. He's is smart guy and he definitely craves genuine friendship, I just feel sick when I think about the fact that this bike  could come from such twisted, yet innocent and well-meaning intentions.

98,"Some background info; 
(I will call this guy E for privacy reasons.) So E and I have been friends for two years now. We go to school together and are in the same classes. E and I became friends bonding over anime when I was going through my weaboo phase but gradually started bonding over art. One day I pulled out my sketchbook and started flipping through my awful fanart at the time, checking to see if I needed to finish anything when E says, “Hey, those are really good! Can I look in your sketchbook?” And me being the art kid who needs constant validation I agreed. He looked through my book and I looked at his and immediately there were red flags. I’m not saying you need to use guidelines when drawing people but he has none. The drawings just looked- off. They obviously looked traced. I didn’t say anything about it but noticed that some of his drawings looked very familiar (spoiler: because they are traced) and I never actually see him ever draw. He always says he is going to have a drawing spree over the weekend and brings back like 30 drawings all in a different art style. It’s never consistent might I add. His art style is ALWAYS different. Not saying you need to have a set art style, but actual artists draw a certain way and even if you are trying to draw differently, it always manages to look similar. 

Skip to this year, yesterday, I found his Instagram when scrolling my recommend accounts and decided to follow him. He had an art page and I immediately saw something he posted that looked JUST like some Teen Titans fanart I’d seen on Tumblr a the previous day.

I feel so guilty when I imagine hurting him, yet at the same time, I feel a super strong urge to do so.

104,"I just made my reddit account in hopes that someone can give me some advice on what to do.

There has been several robberies in my high school locker room. At first they were things being stolen from backpacks left outside of the lockers, but soon after things were beginning to get stolen from inside our lockers. After this happened, my mom and some other parents went to complain to the school, but the school dean brushed off what happened and said that our backpacks don't fit in our gym lockers, and that it's impossible for someone to get into our lockers. There's been around 3 more locker break ins, and 3 airpods have been stolen, and a combined amount of around $600 has been stolen from my group of friends.

Through various coincidences, rumors, and gossip my friends and I know for sure who the person is that's breaking into our lockers. The issue is that we have no actual video evidence or proof, and he is African American so if we accuse him we're afraid we'll be called racists (we're not what so ever).

I have personally seen this suspect in the PE office (connected to the locker room) when there was no staff present going through drawers. The suspect also is the son of one of the school janitors so he might have access to various keys, and even possibly the master key that opens all lockers. The suspect has also been selling aripods around school for cheap prices. Lastly, we overheard a group of girls talking about how our suspect has been stealing airpods. Due to all these factors my friends and I are very sure he is the thief, however we don't know what to do now. Should we present all this spectral evidence to the dean? Should we go confront the actual suspect?

We have been trying to get video footage of him breaking into our lockers but it has been very difficult. We've had someone (usually someone who isn't practicing) hide in the back of the locker room in hope of catching him while the rest of us are at practice. The few times we didn't have someone on surveillance there happened to be locker break ins. 

Today, our lockers got broken into again, but only the people who had aipods before got their lockers broken into.

I have a D in math because I wasn't at school for like a week for a convention I go to everyear so I missed stuff but the only way my teacher lets us make it up is to come in after school but I cant because I have to catch 3 city buses so missing the first one makes me take a whole hour longer to get home and my little brother will be stranded at a different bus stop waiting for me around a crappy area. I cant get a D or else i get summer school and that fucks up pretty much my whole summer.

PE is not supposed to be a assignment class its supposed to be a class that after its over you dont need to worry about! But if i dont this project then my PE grade will for sure be a F because we only ever have 10 point assignment this one is 150 points. And I feel like all my classes say the same thing that you will only pass if you put in your best effort but do they not see that best effort for 6 classes is fucking impossible! And my yearbook class is basically just impossible you never really know what to do in that class then she yells at the whole class and like everyone fails that class.

And the underlining cause of all this is school because i cant think for one second its just shit after shit after shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know if this is the right place or if I should even be asking this. This question is not related to career advice but I do think that it's my career that is being impacted and that's why I am trying to get some real advice that I use to improve my personality. Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 38 year old IT professional in a mid-level leadership position. I am introvert by nature but I don't have social anxiety. I love being in social settings. My issue is that I enjoy listening rather than talking. Now this behaviour doesn't really help me when I am in a leadership position and moreover when I am trying to move up the ladder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed that people think I am not a strong leader because I don't have the loudest voice in the room. I do my job and beyond without advertising that I did that for the team. I am friendly and likeable but I don't social unless I need to. And I have started to understand that to grow up from my position I need to be that outgoing, social leader who people hear and look up in a certain way. I know people who fake leadership by stating the obvious loudly in a room and then repeating what others say over and over. I know people who get the popular vote and use it as a sign of leader. I didn't really care for it but now as I try to grow, I can see I am going into run into this problem where I am not a ""leader"". I also have the challenge of not giving swift replies. I usually take time to listen to the question, think about it and then answer. If I try to give a quick answer, I mess up. Sometimes I will say something and then few  hours later I go ""Ah...I could have said this"" or ""I should have presented it this way to make it more clear""...you get what I mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I do feel I need some help on how I can not be just a listener and a somber leader but rather be a leader with flair. I necessarily don't feel like I need to change my nature but I do need to nurture some skills that will help me present a better leadership image. I recently started reading a book called ""Quite"" by Susan Cain in hopes that I can get some help but I would like to get some advice from the reddit community in helping me understand the situation better and let me know what are the things I can try. Maybe I have this completely wrong. Maybe I should remain true to my nature but the truth is it doesn't really fly in the real world when there's so much competition and challenges.

Thanks everyone for reading it and much thanks if you have some advice for me.

- I have one internet friend and one real life friend. So if I were to make yet another internet friend, that would mean that would have to cut into time from chatting with my first internet friend. Furthermore, if I am to hang out with my one real-life friend, I have to go radio silent for the night/day from my internet friend as I hang out with my real-life friend

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I'm currently a University student and I work on campus part-time to make some money. I work every Sunday morning, where there's a child and youth program (I don't work with the kids or anything, just the front desk, so I interact with a lot of the parents and their kids when they come in and leave). So I worked this Sunday shift from September up until this past Sunday, which was the last shift of the season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story: Okay, so every Sunday there would be this dad that came in with his 6 year old son, he would sometimes come in with his wife and daughter, but rarely, because his son was the only one participating in the program. Anyways, I always said hi to them coming in, like every other family, and he would always begin to make normal and casual small talk before going into the main building. Asking things like what I study, what I plan to do after school, etc. etc. There was nothing wrong with it, and he seemed like a really nice guy, but just a bit of a different personality, kind of quirky and odd. Anyways, one morning he came in and said he thought he saw me during the week walking down a street near campus (this is possible, but the street he mentioned I don't walk down too often). I didn't think much of it, but looking back he might have been trying to get information on where I live? Fast forward to my very last shift, most of the families made a special stop to see me before leaving to say goodbye. Dad and his son come by for their goodbyes and the dad starts his small talk again. Except this time he starts asking me things like ""so you must live around here then right?"" my stupid ass (I know this was the dumbest thing to do) tells him the closest major intersection (there are tons of buildings near this intersection so it's not like he knows my exact building, but definitely wrong move). I know I should've lied and said somewhere else, but I'm so bad at thinking quickly and I didn't think too much of it at the time. After that I told him I was moving back home (which I am) to another city (lied about this city, thankfully). He then proceeds to ask me for my Instagram to ""keep in touch."" Again, stupidly, I couldn't think up any excuse on the stop so I just give it to him. This was the weirdest part in my opinion, I can't imagine my dad asking some 22 year old girl for their Instagram in front of me, his child (even if I were young), it's a bit odd. Anyways, I blocked him as soon as I got home and after I reflected on the situation a bit longer. I really don't know if he had ill intentions or if he was just kind of an awkward dude, but now I'm a bit creeped out, thinking he's going to be lurking around my area...

139,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a rambly mess. Sorry about that. I've been at it an hour, and almost deleted the whole thing. I don't even know what I'm trying to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that by telling my story I can bounce some things off some other wonderful brains and get some much needed perspective.  I think of the last decade as basically three life stages -- promising high school student, floundering college student, and finally despondent graduate diagnosed with bipolar depression and living with his parents.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 The short version - 

High school, I graduated 7th in a class of 600, spent my senior year in the top leadership position (drum major) in a nationally competitive band, and went to college on a full-tuition scholarship.

College was rough. I didn't transition well (fights with parents over money), depression set in second semester freshman year, and hasn't really let go since. I spent a lot of the college years nurturing various addictions (alcohol, not-eating enough because it was expensive to do so, league of legends, and magic the gathering).

I never really chose a major. I graduated in good academic standing with a 'difficult' degree (chemistry) mostly out of habit rather than because I was striving towards any particular goal.

Since graduating, I've spent far more time on the couch than I care to admit. I managed to pay the bills selling textbooks on Amazon 3 months out of the year - this 'blessing' turned out to be a curse. Without a reason to get out of the house and socialize... I never did... I spent a week in the mental hospital over this past New Years for a manic episode - the second major one I've had in the last year and a half. 

This month I've been substitute teaching. I don't like it, the pay isn't great, but at least it gets me out of the house and on a regular routine.

&amp;#x200B;

The long and rambly version:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*high school\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I was motivated by the game of school. I've got an addictive personality and, well, A's in red ink and climbing the class rank ladder were all I needed.

In the long term, all I knew was 'college' was on the distant horizon. Aside from 'go' and 'maximize scholarship' this goal had no teeth - I had no idea what I wanted to actually \*do\* once I was there. 

Despite outwards appearances and success at school, home life was rough. I didn't have a communicative relationship with either of my parents. Dad and I talked nearly exclusively about politics and my mother was a stressed-the-fuck-out alcoholic who I fought regularly with.  

&amp;#x200B;

I got virtually 0 'how to succeed at things' advice from my parents. It was actually my 1 year ahead of my high school girlfriend who shepherded me successfully through high school. She was an overachiever herself and I had the benefit of learning from her experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

The seeds of a battle with depression were sown here, too. Junior year I can still recall having conversations about the winter blues and seasonal affective disorder with teachers... 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Post college\*\*

Sold textbooks on Amazon to pay the bills. Between that and odd jobs, I only had to work \~9 of the last 36 months to survive. I basically spent the other 27 in a bout of depression. Most days it was a struggle to get off the couch and make breakfast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out not having a traditional job bit me in the ass -- living at my apartment, with virtually no excuses to get out of the house, lead to a pretty bad downward spiral. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a week in the mental hospital over New Years for a manic episode - the second major one I've had since graduating from college.

Turns out that when you spent most of three years depressed, you forget how to be a happy person when good things \*do\* happen, and you can over-do it... a lot...

&amp;#x200B;

In the last year I've broken up with my girlfriend of five years and moved back in with my folks. The hospital was \~6 months ago. I've only just gotten my feet wet with working again - I've spent the last month or so substitute teaching and I intend to Uber after the school year ends. I don't \*like\* the work, but it's structure (which I've sorely needed).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*college\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The transition from high school to college didn't go well at all. I made it to the top leadership position senior year, but I was a mediocre drum major. This weighed on my self-conscious heavily. 

Things at home had totally deteriorated. Fights regularly with my mom, who was prone to wild mood swings when she drank (some nights she would be bawling and seeking a level of emotional support I did NOT know how to give and other nights she would be raging and calling me all sorts of nasty things). 

Needless to say I had zero help from home navigating the college application process. 

I landed at the safe State school after applying to exactly 0 other places and with exactly 0 idea of what I wanted to do once I was there.

First semester freshman year I had a 4.0 -- but nothing else went right. I was falling into depression and had just enough energy for school. Everything else totally went to shit - I made no new friends, I survived my extra-curricular (college marching band) and for a while I got by hanging out with the people my roommate brought by, but was eventually ostracized by them. They all moved into a house together the next year - and explicitly asked me not to join. 

I don't blame them, I was a dick and hard to be around, but I was struggling with a lot and didn't have anyone to talk to about it.

I had kept telling everyone I was going to be a doctor, because it sounded impressive, but I hadn't a clue on how to even do that. The process of figuring it out completely overwhelmed me and I gave up on the idea. 

 I spent most of second semester addicted to either League of Legends or Magic the Gathering.

Sophomore year went better than freshman year -- a friend introduced me to a new crowd, at a new dorm, and for a semester things were grand.

Does this sound reasonable to you? I get the whole “break it you buy it” mentality, but I feel like I should have asked if he had some kind of insurance that covers his gear. 

I’m now out $220, and I regret immediately clicking buy on a new item without consulting him about other options first.

145,My husband recently told me he might be depressed. I was wondering if there are any people who struggle with depression or maybe a psychologist who could help inform me more about it and things to help him through it. Like should I encourage him to get out on the days he just wants to be in bed? And things I could do or say for him to feel a little less shitty? Can depression go away or is it something he may continue to struggler with forever? I could really use any and all information you can give me. And yes he’s seeking counseling.,11Apr2019,1

149,"So my mum has two dogs that's she never looked after much. No walks, forgets to feed and water, doesn't take to vets when needed. Pretty much the same way she parents xD

Anyway a few things had happened and my dogs ended up living with me and my Nan. My Nan does not want them. My mum is midway moving house and is currently living with her bfs son. Plus, one of my dogs has recently had both her eyes out and needs a lot of training, love and attention. I've had my dogs on and off for a few years now but I've had them non stop for about a year now. Both are doing so much better both in health behaviour which makes them so much more attractive to her.

I'm scared she'll take them back once she gets her new house. I'm very close with both my dogs and I honestly feel like they're suffer so much if they go back with her. She doesn't abuse them enough for me to call animal rights or anything, it's more of a quality of life issue. The blind one will definitely end up being left to live her life trapped in a single room with nothing to do and the other will probably pull out the rest of his fur (which he use to do from boredom) he's use to going on a 4 mile walk every day and meeting all his friends at the beach, I don't want that taken away from him.

How do I gain ownership? If I knew exactly what to do I'm pretty sure I could pick my moment to get her to sign them away. All I need is something legal so if she changes her mind I could threaten to call the police, which is something I'm certain I'll need. Again, I don't have my Nan on my side, my aunt had seen how they're improved and thinks she can help but I feel like she's all talk, I doubt she'll lift a finger if the shit hit the fan.

153,"Hi, this is my situation:

I'm turning 27 soon, and for about the last year or so, I've noticed my friends are going in a different direction on their lives:

* the ones in year-long relationships are making plans to get married and have a family
* The ""too cool for school"" friends are finally getting their lives together, getting their education and working to pay it themselves.
* A third group with jobs and single just doesn't want to go out anymore. They feel too tired and rather stay at home playing videogames or watching netflix.

Thing is, I understand most of them. we're on the curve to out 30's and gone is the time of wild parties and hangouts.

But I don't feel that way; I got my education right and on time, and I've never been lucky in love so I've been single most of my life (still want to keep dating tho). On top of that my job keeps me traveling during the weekdays, and only come to my hometown on weekends. I get here bored and starved for human contact.

I still feel like going out to the bar at night to drink, meet girls, go to parties, play in the park. When I want to hang out I get frustrated because they only want to chill at home or if we do go out, everyone is gone by 11 (I undesrtand it's not their fault). I feel like there is something wrong with me because I can still keep going till 2-3 in the morning. I wake up early and don't feel tired. I want to keep meeting new people.

Should I meet new freinds? should I just give in to the passive life? Am I being immature for my age?

(He lost his last job due to sexual harassment) A few of us have went to our HR with issues and absolutely nothing has been done. Is there anyway I can get something done about these issues?

157,"I think my Dad is Abusing my Mother. 
My dads childhood best friend committed suicide. Ever since then he’s been acting, I don’t know how to explain it. He wallows in self pity all day. He wants everyone to feel sorry for him. I honestly don’t think he’s faking this depression at first. However, he is being such a fucking jerk.

 Before you call me an asshole. It’s been almost a year. He makes everyone around him, mainly my mother miserable. He wants everyone to feel as shitty as him. He uses his “depression” and the fact that his friend died to “get away with” his assholery. 

I feel like everything revolves around him. He is so controlling with my mother. He wants to know where she is every minute of the day. She can’t go to the doctors office by herself. He constantly patronizes and complains about EVERY minor thing she does wrong. When I say minor like microscopic every minuscule thing. He talks about how incompetent she is and deflects his wrongdoings and/or mistakes. 

She represses what she’s feeling just to not make him angry. I feel she sacrifices and acts exactly how he wants her to be and it’s STILL isn’t good enough. I feel like she’s trying so hard to keep this family under raps and I help the best that I can, but every time she’s up, he drags and shoves her back down. 

When she runs errands when he isn’t around I go with her just to get a vibe of how her psyche is and to make sure she’s ok. I never really know unless he isn’t in the room because she acts differently. It’s the only time she gets a break from his shit. Still she’s always rushing to do things so he doesn’t call her. 

When he does call her, he asks my mother what she’s doing, when she’s getting home, why aren’t you home, the whole spiel. I know her mood is being brought down by this. She often cries when she gets off the phone. She talks about she doesn’t know how much she can take. I don’t know what to say nor know what to do. However recently when this happened she thinks that this is God’s punishment for her. (A couple of decades ago my mother was raped and had an abortion) I just told her no one deserves to be treated that way and didn’t know what else to say. 

 He is constantly negative every time something good happens he doesn’t care, he brings the mood down ALL THE TIME. In retrospect, I remember being like 10 and her insinuating that if she didn’t have any kids she would’ve committed suicide. I honestly want them to get divorced but I know she would never go for that even IF he was beating her black and blue. I don’t know what to do.",11Apr2019,1

164,"A bit of background, I met my friend, B, our freshman year of college through some mutual friend and we ended up living together the remainder of our time at school in addition  to the mutual friends we had met through. 
 
B and I ended up connecting quite a bit while living together since we both were in long distance relationships and were majoring in same field and had quite a bit of classes together. We would end up hanging out and having some “deep” conversations since we were in the same situation, which really helped me get through some rough points in my relationship. Of my other 2 roommates I would’ve considered myself closest to him than the others. 

After graduation, when I proposed to my girlfriend and he was one of the first people I asked to be in my wedding, which he accepted. Since he was going to end up in my wedding party he was heavily involved in all of the events leading up to the wedding (engagement party, bachelor party, grooms dinner, etc.) My wife and I got married with him in our wedding and everything was fine. 

Eventually he proposed to his girlfriend, which didn’t surprise me based on the conversations we had had in the past. I wasn’t even caught off guard when didn’t asked me to be in his wedding knowing he had brothers and older friends that would take precedents over myself and our other roommates. 

After his wedding my wife and I would invite him and his wife to parties/get-togethers we were hosting which they would accept weeks in advance. I would usually text him a few days prior to firm up the details with them to which they would say they “forgot” they had other plans and couldn’t make it to our gatherings. This happened about 4 or 5 times in the course of a year before I eventually called out the fact that it seemed they always “had plans” whenever we were having a party no matter how much of a heads up we  gave them. After this, he apologized for not planning accordingly and promised to make more of an effort to make it to our events. After that I haven’t gone out of my way to invite them to any of our gatherings, nor has he “made an effort” to reach out to me (or our roommates) to get together. 

At this point I’m just at a loss as far as what to do. I’ve made multiple efforts to include him in my plans while he has mad none. It’s been about 6 months since I’ve spoken to him and even longer since I’ve seen him. I’m at the point where I have to accept I will never speak nor see him again, which is difficult for someone I lived with for 3 years.

We aren’t allowed to sit with anyone other than our class, and they take attendance at our tables to make sure everyone is here. The teachers have been pretty flexible, and for the past month or so my friend has been able to sit at my table with me. We would chat, and this was before she got her iPad.

There is a secret hallway out of the way in my school, and you technically aren’t allowed in there but my friend and a bunch of people from her class all stay in there for lunch, just playing on their iPads and computers. Breaking rules makes me really anxious, so I always opt to go to the cafeteria. But she would rather play games on her stupid iPad in the hallway then hang out with me. Not to mention, since it’s mostly 8th grade boys who hang out there, it reeks of B.O. Even on the off chance she comes to the lunchroom with me, her and her other friend who has an iPad will just play on them together, while I sit there being completely ignored, except for when she tells me about the game she’s playing.

I was venting to a different friend about her, and he said that my iPad friend had been complaining to him multiple times about me not wanting to break rules and not wanting to stay inside the B.O. hallway and just go on our devices. He told me that the last time she had complained to him was a week ago. I felt really betrayed by this, because we’ve never had a fight, and I’ve done my best to preserve my relationship with her no matter how dissatisfied I am. I’ve never complained about her until today and to learn that she’s been bitching about me for weeks? I don’t know, man.

She is very opinionated and aggressive and is very rude sometimes, so it’s hard to criticize her or disagree with her at all, so I’m forced to agree with her. She forced us both to break away from a “toxic” person, and she made me say stuff to the person to get me to break away. Me and this person were on ok terms, but she forced me to go away anyways. She also constantly bullies this one short kid for being short and “annoying,” and she always makes sure I say something to insult him. I always feel bad, but I apologized and he said he was ok.

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to say anything too direct, because if she knows that the kid she bullies told me that she had been complaining about me, she would beat him up. I want to tell her something, but I dont know how or what, without ruining my relationship with her. Then again, if she wants to just go on her iPad and spend her lunches in the B.O. hallway rather then spend time with her friend, I don’t think I should be around someone who puts stupid arcade games over real people. 

If you have any suggestions, please help.",11Apr2019,1
171," 

Background: I'm an Asian American girl, in my 20's, and still live with my parents.

This is my darkest secret and I am ashamed to confess, even if it is anonymously. Yes, I understand that my ""problem"" can easily be fixed if I move out, but it's hard when I'm always anxious.

I love my parents and I understand that their ""criticisms"" come from a good place. They have made many sacrifices and placed family above everything else, like moving to the United States for better opportunities, despite the language barrier. I appreciate that, but I just wish I had more room to make decisions for myself.

For instance, I told my mom today that I was going to a friend's house. She got furious and listed out multiple things I could be doing instead. Then she called me multiple times and texted me about how mad she was. She also threw the clothes and makeup in my room onto the floor. (My dad can also just be as crazy, like how he set me up to go on a blind date with guy, b/c he knows that guy is successful and has money. But that's another story.)

I have two jobs right now, and I am saving up to get a car and eventually move out when I have a car, as I will mostly find a career that closely matches more with the degree I have. I also help around the house, and the tasks my mom told me to do today, it isn't like I can't do it some other day.

I think a lot of my social issues stem from my parent's need to have a control on my life. I feel like my friends have asked me on numerous occasions to hang out but I make an excuse most of the time. (I'm not feeling well, I have work, I'm finishing a project for college.) It just sucks how I have been hiding my ""real self"" and I have lost touch w/ most of my friends. My best friend ended our friendship, because I decided to stay at home rather than spend time with her, so there wouldn't be an argument w/ my mom. It still stings that my BF told me that I was old enough. I know I'm old enough, even if my parents still treats me like a child. (Even when other parents have let their child do what whatever they want even from a way younger age.)

I know that my only solution is to move out if I want to have more independence, but that's also scary that my relationship with my parents will be bad for a while; I don't have anyone else in my life that I could ask for help on how to survive in the real world, like helping me with my finances and budgeting my pay checks.

I will have a lot of guilt bottled up even if I move out. I feel like my parents are relying on me to become successful, so they can live a better life or have a life that meets their expectations. So yes, from their perspective what's the point of me spending time with friends (which none of them are considered successful from their pov) when I could be spending time doing something that will better benefit me in the future? It just sucks because English isn't their native language, so they are placed in a bubble being in the U.S. for most of their lives. I don't want to be selfish and do something that will just make me happy in the end.

But looking at the clothes and makeup in my room (that I haven't gotten around to cleaning up, because I'm want to get this off my chest.) It just reminds me of how materialistic my life has been. Of course, you can also argue that I have also live comfortably too. (I have lived a sheltered life.) What I'm trying to say is that I want to grow on my own terms and become my own definition of what it means to be successful. Although, if I could pick a job that makes more money or the one that would make me happier, I would pick the one that made more, so I can reach my goals of repaying back my parents. I feel like I have worked all of my life and I just want to spend more time to exploring other aspects of life and spend more time socializing. I want to overcome my greatest fear that I will disappoint everyone.

I can't complete a piece of work anymore unless I spend the first 4 months worrying and panicking and procrastinating to avoid facing the work because I don't think it's gonna be any good and then the last few days rushing to get it done and forgotten about for good.

Through support, I pulled myself out, started properly working out, travelled overseas and ended up living in another country. It was here I met my (ex) girlfriend and were very happy together. I eventually ended up working in a school as a special needs mentor and found it really rewarding yet got treated like crap through most of the schools I ended up in and it completely killed the enjoyment for me and it got me to a point of dreading waking up for work.  When my visa was up and I came home, my girlfriend has just got headhunted for her dream job and couldn't justify leaving just yet so we did the long distance thing. I decided to go back to school and extend my degree into a double degree with IT within a couple of years and I also picked up a job in hospitality which worked in well with my study hours. The plan was to get a job in the more open IT industry and move back with my girlfriend on a work visa.

And here I was, back at home with my parents. I wasn't trying to take advantage of the situation and I tried to help out as much as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was nearly done with my degree, I got the news a little before exams, the girlfriend had met someone else and we should call it. This completely came out of nowhere and I was crushed. I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't switch off. So when exams came around, I was so fried I flunked the exams and failed the papers. These papers were only available once a year and I had to wait another year to complete them. During this time, I worked full time in my hospitality job   
 which helped turn me into an alcoholic through drinking heavily after/during work almost every night. The hours also meant I would be working/partying all night and sleeping most of the day and had stopped working out. It took a serious toll on my body.

&amp;#x200B;

During my last semester, I decided to quit my bar job and do a bit of tutoring to help make a bit of money and slow down on the drinking. I recently finished my second degree but with my messy job history, I have really been struggling to find a job. I am not even able to get low paying jobs that would be handed out to high school students. I have attended multiple workshops to aid in perfecting the perfect CV and cover letter but I'm not even making the interview stage. It's just knocking my confidence down further and further and now I'm letting anything distract me (like writing this post) and just struggling to motivate myself. I'll have waves of motivation, I'll apply to a few jobs, get back in the gym and try to pick myself up again. But after the soon followed stream of rejections, they just knock me back down to square one.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a great group of friends and they are all very successful in what they do but I just feel like I'm that unemployed loser friend who's living at home while everyone else is succeeding. I just feel like I'm getting sucked into that same spiral because I can't help shake the thought of how many wasted hours/years I've pissed away. The thing is, deep down I know  I could be motivated, during those surges of motivation, I get a lot of things done then it's like it's too much and it teeters off and it feels like, maybe I'll try that again next week and procrastinate till then.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm asking is, have any of you been in a similar situation where you feel like you've just wasted a large chunk of your life doing something you know you won't pursue and now feel way behind everyone else. But rather than staying motivated to change yourself, you keep getting sucked back down. What helped you finally say, 'I can do this and stick to it?'

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

I'm almost 30. Through years of procrastination and poor decisions, I've found myself at pretty much the same position I was when I first left school and it's really eating me up. I get waves of motivation but they keep crashing and I'm back to feeling deflated. If you've been in this situation, what  helped you finally break that cycle and stay motivated.",11Apr2019,1

182,"I'm 18 and he's 15 for reference.

**He wants to drop out of high school (GED), and our dad will let him. It's not that long until he turns 16, either. That's why I'm asking. He doesn't want a job, and I don't want him to not go to school because I just know he's gonna do something horrible what with all the free time. I'm so worried about him. Here is a description of his behaviors from childhood to now which is why I'm worried:**

&amp;#x200B;

When he was little, he didn't start talking until he was 4 years old, and even then it was only a few words when he wanted something. He had a dead stare in his eyes all the time. At age 6, he finally used complete sentences, and facial expressions started showing (but he still had a resting b\*\*\*\* face, always has). He also used to throw tantrums when he didn't get what he wanted, but that was just because our dad always gave in to them I think. 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually kind of resent our dad because he was always giving him attention and not me because he was the naughty one and I was the good one. My little brother was always talking back at school and never wanted to do his work. He got written up a lot for not listening and for yelling at teachers. He didn't seem to care. (One time he actually listened for a while, and he made decent grades. But that didn't last for long.) Even now he gets in trouble a lot at school.

&amp;#x200B;

As he got older, he started becoming more violent. At this point our dad stopped caring and just let him do whatever. One time, when he was 9, he told me he killed a bird when he was at the park with his friend. He seemed really proud of himself. I told on him, but our dad did nothing except tell him it was wrong. He never told me anything like that again, but I doubt he hasn't done it again.

&amp;#x200B;

He also sometimes has mental breakdowns. One time we were home alone and he started yelling at nothing and broke a vase. I tried to get him to calm down he that only made things worse. When I asked about it later he told me, and I quote, ""F\*\*\* off."" This happens every now and then, and every time he becomes hostile if I comment or try to help. I've also heard him mumbling to himself sometimes or looking like he's in a daze. I feel like this might be schizophrenia, but that's why I'm asking here so I know.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, back to his early childhood, our dad used to let him eat a lot, so he was really obese. And even though he's thin now, he still eats a lot. I'm talking eating until the point of extreme discomfort. One time he ate so much he was crying. I heard him in his bedroom from downstairs (he wouldn't let me call the doctor though). I don't understand how he maintains his weight, I hope he's not throwing up or anything. I've tried to get him to not eat so much, but whenever I try he shoves me away or yells or curses at me. I've tried hiding some of the food, but later I'll see the wrappers in the trash. I've stopped trying at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what might be wrong with him. Maybe if I can show our dad just how serious this is he'll actually see what's happening to his son and get him help. This has been going on for too long and I'm really worried about him.",11Apr2019,1
183,"My girlfriend is going clubbing tomorrow with a lot of her single guy friends. About 3 or 4 single guy friends who are known fuck boys. She had a thing with one of them a month before we got together. My friends are telling me to be worried but I don’t know. 

Is it normal for girls in relationships to go dancing and partying with single guy fuck boy friends or is my girlfriend going to do me dirty?",11Apr2019,1
184,"I play varsity sports in the fall which takes up a tremendous amount of time. I am looking to make good money after school for at most 18 hours per week, maybe less. I’ve applied to the generic jobs like Rite Aid, TJ Maxx, Hobby Lobby, Shop Rite, Dunkin’ donuts etc... you get the point but nobody is hiring me! I am very business minded and am looking forward to opening a business after college, but what are the options now that is beyond average?",11Apr2019,1
187,"I currently have a boyfriend. We started out so great. Since the first day we've known each other, we've always talked. It would go on from the moment we woke up until before we go to bed at night, or even before past midnight. It's like it's endless.

We've known each other for about 5 months now, and we've been officially together since 3 months ago.

We're in the same workplace, and we would still always talk for the whole day within our shift (we exchange our messages through email while at work). Once we get home, we would still talk until we drift ourselves to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I became a part of their team and of course, the email exchanges have stopped because finally, our workstations are just right beside each other. We have the same work schedule, and even the same day offs.

&amp;#x200B;

When we were just knew, we could always talk endlessly throughout the day. However, recently, we just don't talk the same as before. There are always hours of not talking, and it's like we're just going on a routine everyday:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Good morning""*

*""I'll prepare for work now. See you later""*

*""Have you eaten already?""*

*""What are you doing now?""*

*""Good night""*

&amp;#x200B;

It frustrates me whenever we don't talk, and it even frustrates me more if we are talking but really can't think of something to talk about except the few ones I've mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's healthy that people in relationships should still have their own time alone or with other people (friends, family, etc.), and shouldn't just rely only on each other. That's the positive thing I'm seeing for the times that we don't talk.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I want to resolve is, how can we have a proper conversation with a substance, like getting to know each other more, or just making exchanges that we could laugh together about? It's fine for me not to talk throughout day anymore, but were really not talking about something new now. I'm terrified that he'll get bored of me for this, but I'm afraid to open this up to him because I know that he'll get upset and will just tell me that there's nothing to worry about. But I really want to get to know him more, deeply.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be closer to his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I make more engaging conversations for us or stop worrying too much about this?",11Apr2019,1
188,"My wife was away on a trip with her friends, while she was gone I had the weekend to myself so I decided to clean out our basement and add stuff to our storage unit, a few trips back and forth later, I noticed she had a figure from an old video game, specifically it was a ""Portal 2 turret"" its like a foot or so tall desk figure, I like action figures and nerdy types of things and found out it was worth nearly $800, I tried to call her but she wasn't picking up, the next afternoon, she finally responded, but I thought I would just surprise her and try and sell it. (now realize this was a terrible idea) 
Keep in mind I'm not a complete jack-ass, we haven't touched anything in that storage unit for more than 4 years, and it was completely buried under several boxes. I've never even heard her talk about the video game. 

Anyways, I listed it on a selling app and ended up selling it for $650, l was planning on just giving her all the money when she got back. She got back, I handed her the money, the conversation went a little along the lines of:

Where did you get this?

I found an old figure in the storage unit you had, I found out it was worth a lot of money and sold it! 

Why would you do that without asking me? 

(At this point I knew, I f**ked up) 

Pretty much just went on with saying, we never go in the unit, I never heard you mention it, I never saw it before, I just thought it was something forgotten you wouldn't care about and thought the money would be a better surprise.

She was very upset, and couldn't believe I would sell something of hers without asking her about it. I ended up apologizing, I told her I didn't mean to upset her, and I should have asked, I handed her the money ( like I was going to do regardless) but she threw it back at me and said I might as well do whatever I want with that too. 

At this point, I was dumbfounded, I guess I went along the lines of my own thoughts that if someone sold something I didn't touch for 4 years, and handed me $600 I would be jumping up and down. 

I was a bit worried there was some sort of emotional value she had with it or something, after a day, I finally got it out of her that there wasn't, she bought it herself for $200 in 2013. 

I'm pretty much just stuck because it's been 5 days and she's still giving me the cold shoulder, I still have the money, and offered it to her numerous times, I apologized, should I buy her a new one? Or will that make it worse? Or just let it go? I've obviously learned my lesson and will never touch any of her stuff again lol.",11Apr2019,4

190,"My friend met a girl a few years ago. We were all getting along, or so I thought, until about 6 months ago when they both stopped talking to me.

After unsuccessful attempts to try and start a decent conversations and also arrange a time to give my friend his Christmas present, it has come to light that I have upset his fiancée. 

He said it was because of something I said during a game night and also because I’m a bit flirty. He also mentioned something about her having an abusive partner in the past.

I thought it sounded reasonable. So I messaged the fiancée with an apology. “Sorry if I offended you, sorry if I put you on the spot or made you feel objectified”. I’m not very good at apologies but it was genuine.

A message arrived back from the fiancée late last night. According to her I have been repeatedly making sexual comments towards her - as much as 90% of the conversation, I’ve groped her and also tried to put my hand between her legs. I’ve been a bad friend and also “actively damaged their relationship”. She’s made it perfectly clear that she doesn’t want anything to do with me.

I’ve never tried to put my hand between her legs. I don’t know where she got that from.

I have grabbed her butt as a joke before. I do it to a lot of my friends to get a rise out of them. It’s not a sexual thing and she knows that. I’ve done it to my friend in front of her and we have laughed about it.

I haven’t made overtly sexual comments toward her. I’ve “flirted” with her a lot, but not seriously or with any intention. I did it at first to break the ice and she seemed responsive to it, so I carried on. She never said or acted like she didn’t like it. I would have stopped otherwise. 
    This all happened around the time those “send nudes” memes were going around, so she got a few of those from me (as did everyone else) and she was fine with it.

As for being a bad friend, I wrote his phone number on a toilet stall door “for a good time call xxx” on a night out. Other than that I think I’ve been a great friend to this guy. I’ve lent him money, fixed and modified his car for him for free every time he’s asked, been there for him when he’s been down and let it slide when he’s done something stupid (like trade in a video game we went halves on).

He still seems half interested in being friends.
She wants nothing to do with me and presumably would prefer if he didn’t either.

At this point I don’t know what to do. I figure my options are as follows:

1)apologise profusely and against the odds win them both over.
2)attempt to keep a relationship with my friend while his fiancée continues to poison him against me
3)cut them both off, and wish them a happy life.
4)cut them both off, wish farewell to my friend and tell the fiancé she’s a fucking pathetic, insecure little venomous snake child.",11Apr2019,1

193,"I need advice on a few things reddit. So 2 years ago my father was diagnosed with bladder cancer, and after a long year of fighting it he was cancer free, but last month he had a checkup and they found a small tumour in his lung, he got a biopsy done and it’s cancer, well it’s Metastatic cancer, and if some people don’t know what that is it’s where cancer from one part of the body spreads to other parts. He has to get brain scans done because the doctors believe his memory loss, very bad vision problems recently, forgetfulness, headaches and constant nausea is brain tumours and that the cancer is spreading throughout his body. Now i know this isn’t easy and once it spreads to his other organs it’ll be pretty untreatable. I haven’t fully accepted that this is happening yet and i’m more in a state of shock, my significant other on the other hand has a history of being very mentally and emotionally abusive towards me, but I have chosen to stay with him because he says he will change, which he does, then he flares up, and a split will be way too difficult. When I told him about my father his response was “What’s the survival rates”. which I get is a fair question but when it’s pretty close to none it hit me hard. and ever since i’ve been extremely sensitive and upset obviously cause this is a lot to take in, he has been really pushing me over the edge with being super insensitive and plain rude to me (not about my father) but about everything in general and all together a horrible person.

197,"Hello Reddit, recently I've found out throw my son that his childhood and best friend is a queer. So here's the full story.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, my son, and my wife live in a nice neighborhood. Everyone looks out for each other and just about everyone keeps their doors unlocked because how safe it is here. Just about everyone here is a believer of out lord and savior Jesus Christ and attends church every Sunday, and everyone knows each other to some degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my neighbor have known each other since middle school and have been really great friends until recently. A few days ago my son came to me and told me that his best friend, my neighbors son, came out to him as a queer because he felt the need to let someone know, and he trusts my son since they've practically known each other since birth. I of course don't feel any negativity towards the boy for being a queer, but it's wrong and a sin, so I let my neighbor know and suggested he have a talk to his son and have him meet with our Priest to cleanse him of his sin.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not believe me, and as we kept talking, it eventually escalated into an argument. He told me that he couldn't believe I'd lie about his son like this, and I didn't want my son around someone like his until they were cleansed of their sins, and we just decided that our kids should not talk anymore. My boy is devastated over this, and I care for my friends son, and don't want him to end up in the underground because his father won't take him to the Priest.

199,"I’m going to keep this as short as I can. Sorry for bad grammar.

Rewind to 3 weeks ago, the second-day of track (I’m in junior high so it’s jh track). Our short distance coach passed around a paper w/ all the runner’s names and a selection of races you want to run, throws, jumps, and such. What I chose was the 4x400, 100m hurdles, and disc throw. 

Since this is junior high track, we don’t practice at the high school but we practice at a track at a park place so there’s obviously not going to be discus things there. 

Anyway, our coach told us if we were interested in field events and hurdles we have to go to  practices on Fridays (practice on Fridays is at the high school, which has more hurdles and field things there). I was thinking ok and that was the end of it. Then about a day later, our coach tells us “no practice on Thursday or Friday this week because of spring break” and I was like oh ok.

After spring break we have a week of practice and when it gets to Friday the coach tells everyone where to go. He named out the throwers and I wasn’t called out so I assumed I wasn’t going to do discus. I went with the hurdle group and that was it. 

Now present time, I’m extremely nervous. I wasn’t at practice on Monday because my thighs were in terrible pain and that was the day where I was supposed to figure out what events I was doing. I get to practice on Tuesday and find out I’m doing discus and the 4x400. The only time I will be able to practice the discus is this Friday. But there is a big chance of no practice on Friday. 

I’m saying there might not be practice on Friday because I live in Minnesota and we were just struck with heavy snowfall. Practice was cancelled today and most likely on Friday because more snow is supposed to come on Friday. 

If there’s no practice on Friday, I’m basically going to do horrible at next week’s meet. Like I don’t even know how to throw or hold the discus but I’m doing what I can to improve strength and stamina.",11Apr2019,1

201,"I don’t know what more I can say.

My dog is a super happy energetic pup! She’s pushing 14 years old but she’s always going to be my puppy. She has great energy, and is still bouncing around. 

Over the week, I noticed her limping. Then when I held and petted her, noticed her tumors have gotten bigger. A while back when I first noticed her bumps, after some testing, the vet had said the tumors were nothing to worry about. However, be mindful and bring her back if they suddenly change in size. As relieving as it was to be told everything was okay, the vet bill was a big pill to swallow. I still pulled up my big girl pants, worked hard, dipped into emergency money, and paid it.

Fast forward a couple of years to the today, the tumors have now changed in size. They are bigger. And she now has a limp to top it off. 

And I’m so crazy scared. I don’t have the money for the vet bills. My emergency funds are pretty much gone. My parents are not in a position to help, nor do they want to (they just don’t like animals). I’m a college student in my senior year. I’ve maxed out my financial aid. I regularly visit the food pantry. I’m taking upper level courses with a work load I have never even experienced before. I have so much debt on my shoulders I feel like I want to cry. I’m not looking forward to when I graduate, because that signals when I have to start paying back my debts. My partner just struggled to put a down payment on a house and is so far up student loans too, he is in the hole as well. 

I’ve had my pup for so long. I’ve had her since she was 6 weeks. She’s has always so happy. I love her to bits. She’s cuddles with me, loves to sit on my lap while I’m driving, I bring her to dog parks to run around and I’ve just always got to see her panting away being so damn happy. Right now, it’s just breaking my heart holding her and watching her do her normal things.

I’m just thinking about if I bring her to the doctor, just so he can tell me that’s the end, I don’t know how I can take it. But with more testing and possible surgery. I don’t even know if my dog can do that in her old age. I don’t know how I can handle that vet bill again either on top my emotional state. I am so crushed thinking about how I can’t take care of her or her vet bills. The last time to see the vet, test and biopsy the tumor, it cost over $300. I know some people here will say ‘oh that’s how it is’ or ‘that’s normal’. But I’m really near the end of my resources here. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if bringing her to the doctor will do any good, except to tell me bad news and leave me with a massive bill. Or to tell me some kind of bad news, with a way of fixing the problem, then there is an even more massive bill due to surgery.

I feel like a horrible pet owner. I’ve been able to handle everything responsibly until now. Work hard, pay all my bills, do what I got to do, help others, find resources if things are tight, live simply but still be happy. I truly feel like I’m at a loss right now. I don’t know what I can do. 

I apologize if this seemed long winded. I really feel at a loss and I need some advice. I don’t even know what to do from here.",11Apr2019,1
202,"When I was in M1 (first year of middle school) I had a “friend” who was 26 years old. Let’s call him Noah. 

Noah and I had a weird relationship. We had first met at the beach when he visited the island where I’m from. Now where I live there are a lot of friendly people so I was brought up to just be friendly to everyone I meet and to always listen to adults no matter what. So Noah has gotten himself lost on the long chain of beaches and was trying to find his way to the bus stop, and like the dumbass I am I told him I’d take him to the bus stop. On the way there he’d give me compliments, ask if I was really just 11 years old and that I had such a beautiful body for a 11. Anyway when we got to the bus stop he asked for my number.... I just want to go back in time and slap the shit out of me. Like what child gives a grown man their number. I have no idea why I did it. 

Two weeks later. I get a message from Noah. It started out nice, talking about dreams, my friends and family, he’d tell me about his. For the first two months I’d know him “nothing creepy”. But then all of a sudden it all changed. He started talking about sex. Now me being 11 I knew what sex was but I didn’t really understand it (if that makes sense). He’d talk about how chubby girls turned him on especially me. He said he was in love with me and I had no idea what to do. So I said I loved him too but only as a friend. 

After that. Every day he asked for pictures of me. It started with me fully clothed and over the weeks he’d ask for less and less cloths. The less cloths I wore the more I had to send him in different poses. If I didn’t want to send him pictures he would threaten to stop being my friend or he would come back to the island and kill my pet Guinea pig Kandy (RIP my beautiful baby). So I’d send it to him. 

This relationship lasted all of middle school and the first few months of S1 (first year of high school). His last text to me was “Hey so I think we should break up, it’s not you but you’re just getting too old. Wish you best of luck” then he blocked me on everything. I’d tried to get in contact with him by making new account on different social medias we talked on but every time he blocked me. After a while I gave up and was heartbroken because I truly believed I loved him, but in that sadness i was a bit happy to not be talking to him anymore. It took me a while to get over him and the trauma of it all. 

It didn’t help that same year I started dating a boy at my school who looked somewhat like him, but that only lasted 3-6 months I honestly can’t remember. He was a sweetheart. We only broke up because he wanted to focus on his school work and not make me wait.

But anyway I have a fear of older men. Boys my age 16-19 I have no problem with but over that I’m terrified of them. I know not all men are the same but I’m still scared. How do I even get over my fear? Also how do i get over the feeling that I’m just a horrible person and a slut for even falling for that obvious trap.

204,"I’ve always prided myself on my kindness and understanding. I haven’t had an actual fight or gotten angry with anyone since I was 11 or twelve. I never fought with my best friends or partners.

BUT. I’m realizing this may not be such a great quality. I feel like a doormat sometimes, like everyone could just walk over me and I’d just smile politely. I suspect this might be part of the reason why friendships and relationships fail - I don’t get angry over things. I don’t show the extent to which I care about things, and I’m not willing to fight for what I’m passionate about. In short, I’m boring.

The thing is, I don’t even think I notice things that I might get mad over. Sure, there are a handful of things - my (former) best friend bragging about matching with a guy that had just broken up with me, stuff like that. But I didn’t even notice that it bothered me until I thought back on it later. I’m pretty easygoing and rarely get bothered by things that happen to me.

Has anyone experienced this? I wouldn’t know how to stand up for myself or start an argument even if I tried, and I’m worried about what that says about me. I want to have the ability to do these things and not be a doormat. Honestly, any advice for improvement would be great.

205,"Hello people, beware of the wall of text below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i've known this guy for 15 of my 20 years, and we have been close since the beginning. When we first entered secondary school, is when our differences and personalities really became apparent. I was awkward and nerdy, but i played sports and nobody really messed with me much; i had a good experience. He was quite opposite, always the joker and class clown. He was the one with charisma, and when he hit his growth spurt and started working out he really came into his own. We had our fallings out and such(i may have been a touch jealous, but he also let his head swell greatly), and come through them. Fast forward to now, we've managed to end up in the same city for uni and we live together. We've always been able to discuss things rationally and i have a high level of respect for him which, in recent times, seems not to be reciprocated.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of similarities, neither of us are highly emotional but we do trust each other. There has always been a rivalry of sorts between us, whether it be pool, poker, dominoes, boxing, school, you name it. Its always close and we have alot of fun. Here's where my concerns come in, please bear with me lol:

1) When i didn't do that well on my A-levels (still good i think, but disappointing), he got a scholarship (all A's).

2) The one thing we have had wildly different experience with is girls. I was a virgin until 2nd year uni, hes always been   
popular.

3) He prefers to be around people all the time, i like being by myself in between spending time with my friends. He believes that without him there i wouldnt have been able to make friends in a new city. May or may not be true but thats no reason to look down on someone anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to things like this, he's always trying to give me advice and telling me how i need to be more open and ""the only way to *improve* is to practise"". The most vivid and hurtful memory was last summer after 1st year when he said he has no respect for me during our normal ribbing in the group chat. Nobody corrected him and he offered no further comment. At that point, i knew that there's some truth to any joke anyways. He didn't respect me. That honestly hurt a little bit, which is quite rare for me. Anyways, i didn't say anything but i steeled myself. I had some work to do, for my own good mainly. Fast forward through that summer and i really put myself out there, and i had alot more interactions with people, it was a great summer for me. After that he even acknowledged improvement, but i still had no luck with girls so i had no experience. All the time when we're out and girls show interest he says, ""She likes you yknow you should do something, you need to get experience"". I always say im not attracted to her what do you expect? One day i ask him if he would be interested, if the same girls liked him, he says nah but hes not me. Huh, thats weird. Finally, he always knows exactly whats good about himself, but would be hard pressed to come up with something to say about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

These things seem small, but i cannot remember every little clue,and its the culmination of everything which stings. I've come to realise that we are just different and he comes across as a bit of a narcissist actually. I've told him that many times, just to bring it to his attention, but either he doesnt agree or doesnt see a downside to it. Am i thinking too much about this? Should i try to bring this up again?

209,"Hi, Reddit!

I’ve discussed this with friends and family, but I am interested in hearing some outside opinions on how I should handle this situation.

A month ago, I hired a guy (let’s call him Steve) off Facebook to help me move (next time I’ll hire from a specific company instead of some random guy off the internet - lesson learned). He and his teammate were polite and completed the move without any complaints from me. I wrote him a check and hired him for a second, smaller job a week later.

A few weeks later, the money was still in my account with no withdrawal pending. I sent Steve a text and did not receive a response. Messaged him on Facebook. No response. He was quick to respond when we were planning the moves, so it was odd for him to not respond at all. He also has young children, so I was extra concerned that he may be hurt or even dead. 

After a week of no responses, I started to hardcore sleuth. I ended up discovering that the last name he used on Facebook was not his actual last name. Why use a different name? He’s a registered sex offender! About a decade ago, he tried to meet up with a young teenager after having sexual conversations online. The young teenager was an undercover cop and arrested Steve, who went to jail for years for this offense. Steve has a criminal record beyond the sex offense, but that was the crime that stood out. 

When I looked into this more, I determined he is currently in jail. I can’t figure out why he is in jail, but it’s likely that he is incarcerated. 

I still want to ensure Steve gets paid despite my disapproval of his crimes. He did a job, and I believe he should be compensated for it, especially because he has children to care for (if he actually provides any care for them).

Here’s where I’d like opinions. Should I issue a stop payment on the checks ($25 to do this) until he is released from jail? I wonder if he can even cash the checks if he goes by a different last name. Should I wait to see if he gets out of jail and cashes the checks soon? Should I reach out to someone he’s related to and act as if I know nothing but just want to check in on the uncollected payment?

I never expected this when I hired and paid him, and I’m bewildered. What would you do in my situation? 

TL;DR: I hired a mover and paid him with a check. He hasn’t cashed it or responded to my messages, and now I think he’s in jail. How should I handle the uncollected payment when I still want him to get paid?",11Apr2019,0

Then I said “ I literally see where you hit me “ but they still denied. I know 100% it was them. I then called the cops and told them exactly what happened.

211,"*CW* possible sexual harassment/assault trigger

Context: I'm a 25/F living with my BFF's family right now-- there's his mom, 16 or 17 year old brother who I'll call Benny, and their 5 year old sister. My BFF and I have been friends 11 years now, so naturally his family and I know each other pretty well. Due to depression and anxiety, I've been isolating myself in the daughter's room where I've been sleeping/living-- I'm basically in here all day everyday if I don't have anything else to do that day. I have also been socially anxious lately, so I mainly only interact with Mom so I don't seem standoffish; and Benny when necessary, i.e. asking him a question about his mom or where I can find something in the house, things like that. Everything's been going fine, the household is pretty stable and quiet which is great.

There was a slight issue with Benny letting himself into ""my"" bedroom without knocking in the morning before he leaves for school. He didn't see me indecent or anything, but after the *second* time I did text him and let him know to always knock before coming in, because OBVIOUSLY. 

Well tonight he was in the bathroom (there's only one) for a super long time, and I had to piss. It should be noted that Mom works overnight, so she's not home. I knock on the door, and call his name. He opens the door in nothing but boxer briefs, with this brazen look on his face. By reflex, my eyes scanned him from head to toe, and I let out a taken aback ""Oh"" then furrowed my brows in confusion as to why he thought it was cool to answer the door like that. I awkwardly asked if I could use the toilet, then went in after he stepped out. I didn't grow up with brothers so I'm not sure what's considered ""normal"" in a household with teenage boys, but if I didn't know any better, I'd swear he wanted me to get a peek of his business. I mean, wouldn't it be instinct for a guy to throw on a pair of shorts before answering the door for a female guest? I freaked out in the bathroom for a few minutes, because a) I'm already struggling with anxiety to begin with, and b) I'm now faced with the dilemma of *bringing this to Mom's attention* and possibly facing some kind of bashing or accusation of wrong doing on my part, OR *not saying anything*, which may give Benny the wrong idea and/or backfire. 

As I exited the bathroom, Benny's standing in the hallway..still in his boxer briefs. I don't look at him at all and shyly say as I cross over into the kitchen, ""maybe throw some shorts on before answering the door next time?"". Nothing's been said since. 

So, whataya think, Reddit?! Should I leave this situation as is, talk to Mom, or something else?

217,"I’ve been to munches. I’ve gone to kink classes and I’ve practiced my skills on willing peeps. I’ve worked on my confidence, self image and I feel ready.

I wanna go to a kink sex party and I know exactly which one.

The only issue is that my parents know none of this, I live in their house as I’m a full-time student and I’m pretty darn young (though I am of legal age to go such classes and event).

How do I go about this?

My mother is a hardcore hispanic Christian who runs the household with an iron fist. I haven’t told her about sexuality, tendencies or classes as the last time I tried to cautiously approach the subject, she went nuts.

This biggest obstacle I have is the time of the party. If it were during the day I could make an excuse, but the party goes from 9pm to 3am and my parents despise when i stay out late. 

Now many of you may think, what? Kink sex party?! Just don't go! Problem solved! 

You have a point, but I’m tired of being constantly told that I can’t go anywhere other then school. 

I’m clean as hell, organized, got some good ass grades, diligent in my chores, I know basic night time safety measures, use birth control  and condoms (that I pay for) every-time (though I usually try to avoid PIV play as I still see it as a bit risky) and sometimes I even help them out with their work. 

For once I want to do what I like of such nature!

It’s not even dangerous! I’ve taken a bunch of classes, have my own equipment, know my limits, never done drugs or drank alcohol (nor do I plan to), don’t smoke and I have common sense (lol which is surprisingly rare) and I’m friends with quite a few experienced peeps who have been in the scene way longer then I. 

So how the hell do I get my parents to let me go or stay out long enough to go to the party?
Any ideas?

So a couple of things to know about me. I’m a 18 y/o male, probably a 8/10 in terms of looks, and a total geek.

So I need tips on how to I guess attract girls who might like me for me and share some of the same interests that I have. Do I need to talk more about anime and comic book heroes in conversations?

221,"A little background:

So I’m very newly a manager at my workplace and it’s all very confusing for me. For starters I’m younger than the majority of my coworkers and that in itself makes me a little uncomfortable. I already have trouble telling people what to do when I shouldn’t. 

We hired someone several months ago who applied as a manager but was taken on as a crew member so they could get some experience before we started training them. At the same time I was just becoming a manager, I’ve been at this place for over 2 years ago. Since they were hired on they talked a lot about being over qualified for their position and things of that nature. That immediately made me feel like he was trying to discredit me becoming a manager? I’m not sure how to put it just a lot of talking themselves up.

I haven’t had any problems with him honestly, he does a decent job as a crew member and everyone likes him. 

So we were closing together with 2 people one of them being one of his friends who has been here for almost as long as I have. Anyways it started with the other coworker asking him to go outside right at close which was fine with me. He came up and I jokingly said something like what are you saying about me I don’t even remember. He asked if he could go out and I just said as long as he gets his stuff done I don’t care. I then reminded him the back door was locked to which he said he could unlock it in a kind of rude tone. I mean maybe I came off rude I don’t know. When he came back in him and the other coworker were working on something and I heard him say something like I don’t even care if she was being serious??? I really don’t know. Then later on I  heard him say I yelled at him about a cleaning procedure which I know I never did. I might have reminded him to use the proper cleaner but I’ve never yelled at anyone at work. I have plenty of trouble telling people what to do in the first place which is 100% on me on something I’m working on. 

I just can’t get it out of my head and it’s possible he wasn’t even talking about me I just have a bad taste in my mouth since it happened. I don’t want this to cause tension or lead to some high school like drama between us. I know I’m not perfect and I can get frustrated when we’re super busy. I know I have some attitude but I don’t say sassy things seriously. I’m already struggling enough with my new management position and I really don’t want people not liking me. I don’t know. Should I just let it go? Or should I be concerned about this causing more problems. I feel like I’m blowing this up in my head and worrying myself about nothing.",11Apr2019,1

Right now, I've narrowed down my choices to three careers that I'm really interested in: Pharmacy, Physician's assistant, and Radiology Tech. The University I'm at right now offers both a PA program and a Pharm program, but the tuition is murder and I'm not feeling the campus culture at all really.  There's a community college very close to my house to the point to where I can walk to it that has a radiology tech program that only takes two years (as opposed to 6/7 for Pharm and 5/6 for PA). The tuition is less than 1/2 of the University I attend and I can get transfer all my credits without issue.

236,"So my Mum and Stepfather are splitting up after 15ish years. It’s been rocky for the last few months and they’ve been going to marriage counselling to try and rectify their issues, but it hasn’t worked and he’s decided he’s leaving. 

My issue isn’t with the fact he’s leaving. I’m 25, I can handle it. My two younger brothers I worry for but I think they’ll be ok eventually with the right support. 

I really worry for my Mum though. She’s already mildly depressed and taking anti-depressants. I don’t want this to cause her to spiral deeper into her depression. I’ve told her that we’ll make it work and i’ll do everything I can to help her but I don’t know if i’ll be enough. It makes me so sad because she’s so nice. She has her faults, but we all do. I just hope she can find a man who treats her the way she deserves to be treated one day. 

I’m going to try and keep her in a positive mindset but I just want some general advice on things I can say or do to keep her uplifted.

Thanks in advance.",11Apr2019,1
237,"Throw away account.

I'm only 18. I should be finishing up high school, on my way into a higher education, and I should have things under control. But, I don't. I really, really don't. I thought I was doing really good, I lost a bunch of weight, my grades were okay, and I felt like I had control. Some form of control. Now, I feel like I don't control anything. A lot happened the past year, so much change, so much depression, and anger. I never liked the way I looked, I always thought I could be doing better, but now it's gotten to the point where I despise myself. I've had moods and I've been upset, but it's never been this bad up until the past year. Things spiraled out of control, and I don't know what's going to happen when the dust settles. I tried to kill myself, failed, ended up in a care facility where I felt even more miserable, and then switched over to cyber school to try and get away from all the noise and upset I thought high school caused me. Turns out, funnily enough, that high school wasn't the noise. I am the noise. At first, cyber felt like it was working, but then I sunk further into the depravity of it all, and now I don't even want to log in and see the glaring assignments I'm missing. I think there's something wrong with me. Some kind of mental instability, some kind of chemical imbalance. Some sort of evil. I know my grandmother is bipolar, I very well could be too. I don't want a scapegoat. I don't want to blame my problems on this demon, I want to fight it. I want to lose weight again. I want to prove my parents wrong and graduate. I want to just stand up and scream in triumph, but no matter where I look or what I do, I just feel empty. I have a lot of problems, but instead of trying to tackle them all at once and overwhelm myself, I should probably get my head on straight. So, please, where do I even begin in seeking treatment? I know I don't want to die, but the thoughts are almost pervasive.",11Apr2019,2

Then that same week another girl (we’ll call her Madeline) who I’ve had a crush on and off since freshman year but I was in relationships so I never tried to pursue anything. We started talking more and more since my ex and I broke up and then we both went to a party and were super flirty with each other the whole time.

However I started my internship at a dentist not so long ago and I love it a lot. Recently they've asked me if I was interested in working at their office after I graduate since they need someone! That made me incredibly happy! They also asked if I had a free day in the week where I could come work as a student.

Now my question is, should I quit my job at the shop to go work at the dentist? This would seem as an easy to make decision but they need someone very bad at the shop. We're only with 3 when we should be with 5 and if I leave they will be with only 2.

I've been in a state of pretty deep depression for around 2 years now. I worked a job for 3 months in 2017, but that was the last time I had a ""real"" job. It was an entry level clinical research position. In the meantime, I've been supporting myself with online sexwork. 

I eventually got myself into therapy and have since been doing significantly better. I want to re-enter the work force, but I essentially did nothing productive with my life for 2 years.

How do I even begin to navigate this situation? I eventually want to go to medical school, and feel I am in a place to do it now that I'm managing my mental health issue. I've just signed up for a number of volunteer positions that I feel confident I'll get, but that will be more beneficial for my medical school applications than job applications as they're patient/hospital-oriented. 

I would really like to go back to working in clinical research. I am passionate about biology and feel like I've maintained good knowledge of lab procedure and techniques that I picked up during my 2 years in a research lab in college. I will gladly take an entry level position.

In our first semester I was doing our classes mostly regularly,like 8/10 classes.That may not sound like a lot but we're allowed to skip our classes when we're on our period or when we're sick and most of my classmates take advantage of that and skip way more classes than i do,however I'm now doing my classes regularly even when sick because i noticed he dissaproved.And here comes the end of the fist semester,everyone gets As and a few Bs and I get a C.The only C in the whole fourth year.I was histerical.A few days later I asked him what did i do wrong,he told me I'm less physically able than others in my class.Oh,yeah,he also comments about my weight a lot in a way a fourth grader would not a PE teacher.I know when I mentioned my weight a lot of people will say ""Here we go,that's the problem"" ,but I'm honestly just kinda chubby and while I'm not at all athletic I do participate in our class activities.Then my dad told me he didn't hire his son's wife a few years ago,not out of malice or anything,just because he simply could not.What-the -hell.I tried speaking to a teacher that's responsible for my class ( do you guys even have that word in English). He didn't even want to speak to her about it.His son gave me an A a few days ago(Yeah ,they're both PE teacher that's a long story).I was so happy and proud and thankful.And yesterday,just like that,he told me that A will be corrected to a B because I don't deserve it.What-the-hell!!! I know it might seem like a small thing compared to other stuff people on here complain about,but I'm supposed to get into college this year and this feels like such a petty move from someone who's supposed to be a helpful hand to his students.Who do I talk to about this?Should I mention what my dad told me to my principal,anyone?",11Apr2019,1
277,"Some context, so I'm in college right now and in my Tuesday morning math class me and two other people always group up to work together. But over time they seem to ask me for the HW answers. It gets annoying because they wait till the following Tuesday to copy my work. HW isn't the only thing either we have group quizzes and I end up doing all they work. Its like they don't put effort, but expect me to know everything. I'm essentially carrying our group when it comes to these group quizzes. They're cool people and since I have a small group of friends they seem like potential future friends, but what they do gets on my nerves.",11Apr2019,0

279,"TW: suicide, self-harm, overdose

TL;DR: I attempted suicide last year, have been feeling extremely low/alone ever since, need advice on how to deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

In December I took an overdose. Someone walked in, saw me vomiting, put two-and-two together and off I went to hospital. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I can feel myself slipping under again. When I went to hospital, nobody came with me - neither of my housemates, who I consider my closest, best friends. I'm not dumb, it was a stressful situation and they probably didn't want to deal with me. But I sat in hospital, in a hallway, vomiting, delusional and in so much pain. I've never felt so alone in my life and that feeling has been following me around ever since. 

I'm not blaming them, it's my own fault. But I'm being suffocating with that feeling ever since. 

I have a boyfriend and he's amazing. He's supporting me so much through all of this and genuinely want's me to get better and be happy...which makes me feel awful. I've tried everything to get better, to be happy and it's not working. 

I'm so bored. I'm so bored of living and existing. I'm so bored of the same routine, day in day out. It breaks my heart how all of this is affecting my boyfriend. I kept him up the other night because I was so low and wanted to self-harm. He stayed up until I calmed down and fell asleep even though he had work early the next day. 

I just need advice on how to stay above this. Anything would help, just something to help the dark moments. 

For context: I'm not allowed on medication for another while. When I attempted I hoarded about a six month supply and took them all at once. I'm in the process of counselling, etc. 

I guess I'm looking for some things I can do at home to help get me out of a funk, maybe something with my boyfriend even since he lives with me. Or just some advice on how to calm his worries.",11Apr2019,2
280,"Sorry for the confusing title. I can't figure out if me or my cat is the one conducting all this electricity.

However, whenever I try calming her down (she gets skittish when my brother tries to take her outside on a leash and she occasionally has random bursts of energy) I'll accidentally give her a shock of static electricity.

I really hope it isn't hurting her, but I can't figure out who's conducting the energy. She's a typical Russian Blue, and sleeps on a sort of fluffy blanket in my brother's room. I also like wearing fluffy sweaters and I've even heard it crackle when taking it off.

Wasn’t long before we started making out during our weekly Netflix Sunday afternoon. I left in a hurry because I had just broken up and felt guilty. We havent really talked since and I’m seeing him again this weekend. How do I say hello to him ? By kissing on the lips or like normal cheeks kissing (I’m French)??

286,Like there is not much to say about this my cat is always trying to knock my recycle bin over i have to keep him away from my room. How can i stop the madness?,11Apr2019,1
287,"For context, I'll mostly be referring to my friend John\*.  I'm in a groupchat with him and a good handful of mutuals.  We have met in real life before along with our closest mutual friend.  It was overall a pretty good time. 

  
We were supposed to meet again this summer and have a trip with a total of 5 friends from the groupchat.  I was kind of excited, as were a few others.  We first started planning in Jan/Feb but then stopped talking about it for awhile, but still expecting it to happen and to plan more at Summer got closer.  We were going to stay at John's house, as he happily offered, and his parents were supportive of that idea.  


A few weeks ago I sprung up the convo again; ""Hey, should we start planning the summer trip out a bit more, such as finances, etc""  
John quickly cut that off, saying his family was hit on hard times a bit due to a medical situation, and wouldn't be able to house everyone for a week or so.  
And this is totally understandable. How could I expect his family to house all of us when times were tough?  


...But then John, our closest mutual friend, and another friend are suddenly talking about a summer trip of their own that sounds in my opinion more expensive.  This was in a voicechat that I was also in. Instead of staying at John's house, John would get a hotel for all of them to stay in.  They were all planning to do a a few things in the area.  Plus there would be plane tickets.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been getting hints that John isn't particularity fond of me.  For example: When someone joins the voicechat, John is super chipper and loving asking them about their day, etc.  When I join and give a hello, I get nothing.  Nobody for that matter will talk to me unless I speak up like ""What's everyone doing today?"" and ill get either ""nothing."" or ""Overwatch."" back.  When I ask a separate person in the voicechat a question, John quickly answers for them.  Then, every additional question is answered with annoyance from John.  Or he'll answer with that fake stutter that implies my question was....unintelligent?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm so unsure about this situation is because I've lost so many friends who just ghost me one day.  I feel like I'm not a terrible person.  I care about my friends, I understand personal space, I care about the events in their day and their time, but I feel like nobody cares about me anymore, especially John. I feel that is an egotistical thought, but at the same time, I'm pretty sure this relationship isn't equal at all, which is never right.  He does allow me in the chat, should I just be thankful for that and just do something else when John gets sour?

  
So...If we are growing apart, should I just let it happen? Am I looking at things too deeply? It's sad because I feel like John bridges me and the rest of the groupchat. So if I just leave, I'll lose all the friends I have.",11Apr2019,1
289,"So I’m 25 and have been helping my mom get to and from doctors appointments recently. She’s usually in and out of the doctors at least once a month and has been on prescriptions for awhile (steroids, blood pressure and another one). She had a fall a few months ago and broke her collarbone, then had to go t the doctors for severe leg pain a few weeks ago as a reaction to reducing her steroid dose, then fell again recently and broke her arm pretty good.


I took her to the doctor today and we were visiting with her medicine doctor and on the way out I overheard them say something about that one of her MRI’s they noticed a “‘mass” but another MRI at a separate place they didn’t notice the same mass. So on the way out when he mentioned the “mass” I turned to the doctor and said “excuse me?” And he repeated himself again and said a “mass” so I said “excuse me” again because I am not a little kid and I know what a “mass” is and he mentioned a possible tumor. My mom was very non-chalant about it as I have been helping her so much these past few months in between getting her around the house, getting dressed, helping her to the bathroom at times and seeing her cry multiple times and doing my best to just be there for her during this period. It caught me so off guard that I didn’t want to bring it up in the moment and about an hour later had to take her home and instantly called one of my brothers to talk to about it (I have 4 older brothers).


As of right now I’m not sure if any of my other brothers are aware either and just really don’t know what to do or think about this situation right now. My parents split when I was younger and have both since Re-married but maintain communication and are still friendly and cordial to each other at birthdays and we all spend holidays together.


I also talked to a friend about it because I needed someone to talk to but between my mom dealing with nerve damage in her neck/spine, a broken collar, broken arm, diabetes and a few other less significant issues I am just so so so so so overwhelmed with this whole situation and love my mom so much that I never want anything to happen to her.

I cannot sleep. It’s like there’s a permanent switch in my head turned on. 

I have recently been put on new medication to help regulate my sleeping and control my mood since this whole no sleep thing is leaving me feeling pretty low. 

I have recently bought my first flat and live alone and thought this may have something to do with it so I leave the radio in for some comfort. 

The current routine I have which I know is not healthy and I can’t do this forever is.. come in from work go for a run or complete a HIIT workout until I reach exhaustion. Then hoping this will make me sleep, the new medication is making me fall asleep but the night terrors are unbearable and I wake up in such a state in the early hours of the morning and find myself pacing around my flat trying to calm down before mentally preparing to try and go back to sleep. 

By the time I need to get up for work I’m exhausted and dread leaving my flat to go to work. 

I’m now sitting at work on my 6th coffee of the day and it’s not even lunch time, filled with major dread to go home and fight this battle all over again.

Hi!

I am 20 years old an I‘m turkish and live in Germany (turks are the biggest minority in Germany). I was born here so I definitely do not feel like foreigner or something.
I come from a religious family (islamic), my parent both come from Turkey.

My parents gave me an arabic/islamic name. It‘s something like „Abdulkadir“ (not exactly this but similar, I‘m changing it to not reveal my identity here on reddit). I have also a second name which is a turkish name, similar to „Emre“ - BUT I have never used this name ever. Many of my friends do not even know I have a second forename and for example I didn’t even include it in my application to University and most jobs I had. So basically I am just Abdulkadir.

Anyways let‘s get to the real „concern“ here: 

Last year I made an experience at work that made me think A LOT about my name and how people in Germany perceive it.
In holidays I had applied for a job to work in a factory. I got an acceptance and the first day of my job there was a guy who had to guide me around and explain me what to do - he obviously knew I was coming and he only had my name noted in his work folder „Abdulkadir“ - when he first saw me he was really shocked and this is what he told me „Huh, when I read your name I was expecting someone that looked way more radical, you do not even look like a foreigner, what country are you from?“. (Btw I am very light skinned and people often tell me I look like french or russian, not typical middle easterner/turk). This was when I first truly realized how people can judge you only by your name. And I am sure this guy was not just an exception, I think he just said out loud what many people think.

I obviously have a name that’s very foreign to people in Europe, it‘s an arabic name that‘s not even a well-known one like „Muhammad“ or an easy one like „Ali“. My whole life long people around me had problems pronouncing my name (I can understand that). The first day in class with a new teacher who doesn’t know you yet and takes like 5 tries to say your name in front of class; when you introduce yourself to new people the bit of awkwardness when they try to understand your name; and lots of other examples people with unusual names can relate to. All of those did not really bother me but now I feel like there’s more behind it.
My work-guide obviously had a negative image when he got to know my name - it‘s a name you only hear in NEWS when they talk about another ISIS commander or some weird dictator in an „islamic“ country. I feel like many people perceive it as just islamic and now since Islamophobia is rising I fear it‘s getting worse. I honestly fear I might have worse chances in my career in life later when for example the wrong person holds my application in hand and reads my name and is instantly biased. Also in my personal life; I fear meeting a nice girl and introducing myself and she gets turned-down by the name or something. I know it sounds ridiculous but I‘m honestly worried sometimes. 

Now what I think of as solution: I met someone at my Uni who has my exact same name but in public he uses his second name which is a turkish name and it‘s very „western-friendly“. Names like Mert, Emir, Hakan, Sefa and stuff. Names that are easy and you can‘t subconsciously connect to something radical or islamic.
I was like „wait, I have a second name too“ - and now I want to start using it as well. Yesterday I had my first ever phonecall where I introduced myself als Emre, not Abdulkadir. It felt really weird though, to be honest. Because I have never been „Emre“ to anyone. And I can‘t just change my identity, can I?

 I had a russian friend in school who’s name was changed from „Yuri“ to „Jürgen“ when he came to Germany. Legally he is „Jürgen“ but few years later he told everyone afterwards to call him „Yuri“ from now on - like his original name and people adapted to it. I don’t know if I can do the same - I have so many relationships in my past and so many people for those I am Abdulkadir - I can‘t just start having a whole different name... 

I mean I even talked about this topic with my mum and she supported me when it came down to my career. She also thinks I might have a better chance at jobs when applying as Emre. But then again my mother experienced a lot of racism in Germany so she generally thinks that people here look negatively towards islamic/turkish things so she might be biased. I don‘t even know what to believe anymore. 


I need your advice users of reddit!
Do you think I am exaggerating and just worrying too much about a non-existent problem? 

Do you think it is okay to start using my other name, if yes, why? And how should I proceed?
If no, please state why",11Apr2019,2

Anyways, I blocked her about 2 years ago because I just couldn't handle being sad all the time watching her social media :/

I mostly forgot about her, but she dm'd today asking if I wanted to hang out when she comes back. I still haven't replied, but I unblocked her to take a look at her IG and it looks like she has a boyfriend.

295,"Okay so I'm a pretty dedicated student - I study fine art at a tech college and got a place at a very good university in September. I'm usually in my college's studios every single day from 9 till 6, even if I don't have classes because I love what I'm doing. Even after the studios shut I'll take work home with me.
Recently, however, I've met a bunch of cool new people that I get along with really well. And it's great! They're always really keen to hang out and I usually go along whenever they invite me out and have fun, but I'm finding myself slipping with my art, which is weird for me. This week I've met at least one of them every single day, and I've spent hardly any time working. Which is fine, one week isn't gonna make a huge difference in my progress. Like I mentioned before, I don't have to be in school nearly as often as I am, but I do like it. People have mocked me for these habits in the past, and I'm not sure if it's normal to feel so attached to my coursework anymore.
I've never really had friends like this before, who like to spontaneously make plans and meet up several times a week. It feels really nice to have that kind of relationship though, and I'm worried that if I start getting back into my usual schedule they'll think I'm boring or weird.

TL;DR, my question is : is it reasonable for me to turn down social events that I know I'll have fun at because of my self-imposed unnecessarily heavy work schedule? Am I not letting myself have a break, or is it normal to get nervous when I don't spend enough time in the studio?",11Apr2019,1

300,"So my best mate had his wedding a few months ago and one of his mates that I had never met previous to the wedding flew to our city to attend it.

302,"I don't even know how to start this. I'm sorry that this post is a mess, formatting whise but also when it comes to my train of thought thing. Also English isn't my first language, so I apologise if I made mistakes which may confuse you.

So after I finished school I basically wasted a year doing nothing (trying to figure out what I wanted to do and some dog sitting, also writing some applications for jobs/internships I thought could be interesting but didn't get/want anything in the end). 
After a year passed and I still didn't know what I wanted to do I just started University. After two semesters of being lazy, bored and unhappy I dropped out to enrol at another university and do something I really wanted to do. 
Fast forward to now, 3 semesters later. I had to quit, due to depression and my stupid lazy ass I didn't pass my finals and can't continue studying my major. 

So now I'm kinda lost. It doesn't make sense to continue studying my minor without another major/ switching minor to major without a new minor but I don't really care about all the available subjects. Each of them seems boring or too hard, plus I've already wasted so much time (turning 23 this summer). Also I only chose my current minor because I HAD to choose one and since I didn't find any of them interesting I just picked what my mum wanted me to.

So if I leave now, I'm leaving University without achieving anything... Being out of school for almost 4 years without achieving anything? Sounds stupid. Probably is stupid.
 But at the same time I'm so sick of University. Organising all your work, having to schedule all your assignments.. never really being done with the day when you get out of uni at 6pm. I like it but I also hate it and doubt it's the right thing for me.

I kind of just want a normal job. Getting a routine. Exactly knowing what I'm supposed to do. Being done with work when I leave work. 
(I guess I'm probably thinking of this too easy tho..)
And ofc getting money to support myself.

Now the worst part for me is probably that my mom (parents divorced, dad's a dick) supports me financially (on her own) and it is so hard on her. She told me that she had to take out a loan and I feel even worse knowing that, especially since I found out I can't continue my studies. Basically everything I've done was not only useless but also really hard on my mom and I don't know what to do now, how to move on and finally get my shit together. 

I'm really lost and I just feel like a gigantic loser. I still need to tell my mother about the recent changes (I'll continue my studies for my minor for this (4th) semester since it technically already started and is paid for, also since I don't have it figured out what to do next) but when I do tell her I feel like I need to provide her some kind of plan what I'll be doing.  Even if that's only to keep the last tiny bits of my pride together, seal them up in a bag und keep them hidden somewhere deep down. 

I also thought about working part time, saving up whats possible and going to an English speaking country once the semester ends and figure out the whole work situation there. I just had this thought in my head that my life needs to change (rather drastically) anyway, so why not leave the country, for a few years at least, since there really isn't anything keeping me here anyway. 

So, yeah. I guess I'm just asking for basic adive. In general or specific, I don't have any idea. Probably what's a not completely useless step to take to not fuck up my life further.
Also I'm sorry, I'm aware that compared to other circumstances my problems really are some of the lighter ones. Nonetheless, I am totally overwhelmed and don't really know how to move on from here, so any advice is appreciated.",11Apr2019,2
303,"Well she didn’t even necessarily see anything, I think. I was jerking off in the shower, with the water on (because god fucking dammit my family is loud) and the door locked. But seeing as it’s one of those doors you can unlock from the outside with your fingernails, it took her no time at all to get inside and go “pussee, mom said you’re taking too long in the shower.” Then, being the invasive piece of shit she is (she takes after my mother), she pops her head around the shower curtain. 

I immediately covered myself up with my towel, but I had my earphones in AND SOMEHOW SHE SAW MY BONER. So she went “Wait, why do you have earphones.... gasp! Is that a bone-bone? :0 I’m telling mom!!! &gt;:)”

And I did TRY to deny it but I was very shocked at the fact that she knew what a boner was, AND could deduct that I was masturbating, which is a concept she should not know about??? So essentially I was hissing at her to not, that no there’s no boner I just have a big pp, then she said “If you don’t admit it I’ll tell.” And jesus my mom is a very conservative Christian and a fucking nightmare on a good day, so I had to throw all the dignity I had left and I did say yes. Then my sister smirked and left.

318,"A year ago I was fat and had next to no social skills, especially when it came to women... 

The self realization kicked in when I downloaded tinder, got very few matches, and the ones that I did I was a complete cornball in my approach.

In the past year I’ve worked really hard. I’ve lost 40+ lbs, gained a bunch of muscle, and watch lots of personal and social development videos (I’ll list who at the bottom).

It’s clear I was given lots of gifts genetically which has only exponentially increased my transformation. Just so you can get an idea, I’m a 6’3”, blonde, blue eyed, white [21M].

In the year leading up to last week and updating my bio I had somewhere close to 35 matches total (IN A YEAR). Since updating it last week with more recent pictures I’ve gotten somewhere close to 60 (95 total). 

This leads me to where I am now.

I’m starting to resent every girl I talk to because not only do I no that they’re very similar to the girls that ignored me last year, but they’re complete fiends and I find it repulsive.

A few examples:
- one girl straight up dropped her address and has been begging me to come and ‘degrade her’, whatever that means
- Another, after talking to her for a while, compared herself to a cup of ramen noodles, because she’s quick, easy, and tasty
- Another one said I reminded her of popcorn, because she wants me to pop a nut and she’ll eat it up

Anyways, I’m looking for more than just sex and I’m scared it doesn’t exist or I’m looking in the wrong location.

I have been class president from the start of high school. My peers stopped running because they didn’t think they could win against me so my SGA advisors have made it pretty obvious that they don’t like that i have no competition. Their plan to avoid me getting student body president and is to convince the principal that it would be better if they picked the officers off of applications. It would have nothing to do with the student body’s choice. I am going to talk to my principal today, but I need help with important points to why elections should be run the same way as before. I know if they choose, I won’t get the position I’d like because they said I would feel “too stressed”. Which doesn’t add up to me because I have never expressed my stress to any of them.

320,"A quick look through my history and you would see someone who is incredibly unhappy in himself. I honestly feel I am a good person and all I really want is to form good sincere fun friendships with people(and in particular a girl) I think girls are more emotionally tuned in and maybe lads just take me on face value. They might see my good side easier than girls do. I talked to my sister and she is my biggest fan, she knows my essence is of a good, kind and warm person but she says she can see that perhaps my resentment and anger at being dealt a bad deck in life(I perceive girls as looking down on me and I feel shame in liking a girl because my mindset is of course they won’t like me) This sense of injustice is compounded by the fact When I see myself I see a handsome guy and it makes no sense that a girl wouldn’t take a liking to me. I have my flaws but so do others and that doesn’t stop them from getting with girls and forming relationships. I can’t even get into an unhealthy relationship...not that I want that but it’s like that struggle to find a connection. I just want to really get on with a person who sees me in a romantic light. I have many guy friends and find it easy to make them relatively but with women it’s a different kettle of fish. It’s not a case of before someone loves you, you have to love yourself, sometimes I do feel a sense of inner contentment and happiness in myself but what happens is, I’ll start liking someone and all my insecurity’s, my past bad experiences with girls, the feeling of being an afterthought, unwanted, sexually unattractive comes to light. My inability to flirt, to escalate things makes me feel worthless. Then I think if a girl actually liked you she would make it easy for you. When that happens, I am on a road to nowhere and I feel this overwhelming sense of self hated and anger at myself and not at anyone in particular, but the injustice of my situation. I’m like what is so wrong with me? Then I imagine guys who I see myself as being more handsome than but with better personalities getting with the girl that I like and I torture myself with the thought that they could have this girl easily if they wanted...this was triggered back when I was in school when a girl I liked a lot fell for this player type who just kept hounding her, it went from her feeling nothing for him to being head over heels. It’s something that stayed with me my whole adult life.

322,"I need some serious advice.  I have been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years- happiest times of our lives. We have plans to get married. I’m away for grad school and he has been working full time for a little over a year now, and has created this routine that he can’t get out of (smoking/drinking/not exercising/not eating healthy) which has caused his depression to worsen. He is extremely self-conscious since his routine has taken a toll on his physical and mental well-being. I have done everything I can to support him, I’ve been patient and encouraging, but it is so difficult to watch him suffer and not change anything about the routine. I have loved him regardless- he is worth it. 

This week we had a rough conversation about his depression. He said he needed some space to figure his shit out, which I respected. I checked back in with him after a week to see if he was okay and to let him know I am here for him and I support him, and he decided after that week to end our relationship for now to focus on getting better. I asked him how I could have prevented this/helped him more, and he said there was absolutely nothing I did wrong, I am perfect, and that this is a “him” problem. He is driving up this weekend to talk about it in person.

Is being alone with depression better than having someone to support you? I feel like he is making a mistake and self-sabotaging, thinking he is not worthy of this amazing love that we have. Is there anything I can say to stop this? Thank you all for your input. I am blessed to not know what it feels like to have depression, so I need insight from those that experience it.

324,"I'm living in Scotland. Have tried to contact citizens advice but the wait is ridiculous on the phone and in person and this is an urgent issue. 

I am trying to move out my flat before my tenancy ends. My contract states: 

""This Tenancy may be ended by:-
• The Tenant giving notice to the Landlord;
 The Tenant giving the Landlord at least 28 days’ notice in writing to terminate the
tenancy, or an earlier date if the Landlord is content to waive the minimum 28 day
notice period.""

My interpretation of this is I can move out within any point of the tenancy, as long as I give a 28 day notice period. 

I emailed my landlord to double check this was the correct procedure and he replied saying I signed a form saying my tenancy would end on the 23rd July and that I am liable of payments until then.

I do not remember this form or signing anything about a date to end my tenancy. I live in a HMO (shared accommodation) and no other tenants received a form stating a tenancy end date.

I asked for a copy of the form I filled out and he has been ignoring me for the last 3 days (he has ignored me before on issues with the flat).

325,"Hi. I'm sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub; I thought it was the logical place to start.

One of the carers who looks after our daughter transfered to another location (by choice to be closer to home etc.).  She was really lovely.  We gave her a small gift, said goodbye etc.

The problem is the other carer in the room.  She is just as wonderful but was really upset that the other lady left (they worked together really well and seem to be genuine friends).  She also confided in me that the room can be quite difficult at times (2-3 year olds) and I imagine she's worried about coping with someone new.

Anyway, my question is: is there anything I could do to help?  

Here are some ideas I've had:

Bake some brownies/muffins

Have daughter draw her a picture

327,"Long post, will put a TL;TR in the end
So a little context here.
Im a student abroad and i always wanted a cat, i rent a place with a girl i didnt (lets call her R). So i rent this place and she is not bad we are not friends or anything but have similar interests so i dont mind her. I have a few problems with her not cleaning after herself but my major issue is with my cat. 

One day a friend of hers came over and brought a little kitten for us to babysit for 3 days and she asked if i wanted to adopt. After a while i said yes and i persuaded R cause i had to have her consent (she didn't want him bc she thought it would make a mess and stuff). 

So after a while she would take him in her room and close the door and i told her i dont feel comfortable with that and she stopped. I also have to mention since my boy is a baby he play fights but will never attack ,but when he would go and grab her sock she would ""throw"" him and be mean to him and when he was younger if he but her while she hugged him she would throw him on the ground and bc he was a babe he couldn't land on his feet and would just fall. She would also annoy him when he slept or was on top of me relaxing and would go and grab him.

Now R loves animals but maybe she doesn't know how to act with them so i kindly said to her dont hurt him or dont throw him or bother him when she sleeps and she was like whats the problem he will be fine. But at least she stopped. 

I also have to mention that i fly home and i cant always have my cat with my its super expensive and she stays here so I asked if she could take care of him and she was super glad and sometimes she asked to not take him with me. But when im gone for more than 2 weeks i always have him with me, the longest ahe had to take care of him was 1 week.

So to the point now, i saw her twitter and her friends think it's her cat and she keeps uploading him and calling him her feline and stuff and she says to me constantly ""our cat"" where im the one taking care of him and buying his shots and cutting him nails and he always sleeps with me and i feed him and buy him stuff...she doesn't even fill his water bowl when she sees it empty. But she keeps says it's her pet on twitter and stuff like that and with me when she says ""our"" i once said haha he is mine and she joked that there is communism in our house and that he is ours..

I don't know if im being stupid for being annoyed, but when i see that she calls him her's and all her friends are like what a good cat you have and stuff like that i get bothered.

I don't know how to tell her it annoys me and if i do need to tell her or im being over dramatic, any help?

We started with 50varsity and JV, now we’re only able to fill 1 and 3/4 boats(12 rowers and 4 coxswains). 
Now the team could just be lazy or whatever, then they deserve what they got, but it’s most likely because of practice. We have practice at the end of school until 6:45(18;45 for my non USA ppl). Then we start homework. We have no social life which is kind of bad for us, being that we are social animals and now everyone on the team hates each other because we see each other every single day. So people are quitting because of the crazy schedules and now our coach is mad at us. What do I say to him to stop this stuff(I’m not a captain so it’ll be harder than just saying stop)?

347,"I'm not sure why and at first, I chalked it up to a learning experience but then I just kept doing it.

The first time I did it, the man was amazing in so many ways. He was 10 years older, very intelligent and a brilliant photographer. He treated me so well. I started getting uneasy because I didn't know how he felt about me. In hindsight, it's pretty clear he was very into me but because he didn't tell me how he felt, I panicked. I was shorttempered with him and wasn't very nice and he dumped me for it.

The second time was with a guy I went on a couple dates with. He was my age and we had a lot in common. First date went well. He texted me after telling me how much he liked and how comfortable I made him feel. I thought, ""cool."" On paper, the guy was ideal. Really good job, nice truck, lives on his own. The second date, he smoked me out in his car and ate at this awesome restaurant he picked. I knew  I could have a really fun relationship with him and then I lost all interest and ghosted him like an idiot.

The third time, I met this dude through a coworker's friend. I had been taking the coworker to a bar she likes to frequent because it's 2 miles from my house and she doesn't have a car. One time, she invited her friend and he brought this guy with him. The guy was focusing his attention on me and asking me about myself. Couldn't stop smiling at me. I knew he was into me and I was pretty into him.
The next time I saw him, it was the same. More talking, just me and him.

He's about 6 years older than me too, so there was definitely a bit of idolization going on there too, on my part. I really quickly developed a crush. One night after we went out dancing, he asked if I wanted to sleep in his room. So I did. I'm naive and thought this meant he liked me back in the same way. Turns out he just thinks of me as a friend with cuddly benefits. Recently (in a similar situation where I stayed at his new place after he moved out), I asked him how he feels about me and he tried to avoid the question and then said that I'm his friend. So that confirmed for me that that wasn't gonna happen.
Now Jerry, the other guy, is one of my closest friends. I used to talk to him all the time about how I felt towards Tom and he'd give me advice, etc...So he knows the whole situation. Really recently, Jerry and I went to a party together and hooked up, to both of our surprise. Jerry really wants us to date now, and I've now started liking him as more than a friend and want to do this but I'm hesitant mostly because I want to continue being friends with Tom (without the benefits) but don't want my (diminishing but still existent) crush on him to make things messy as I start dating Jerry. Also because Jerry knows about how I felt about Tom, and if I try to continue being friends with Tom, I'm worried Jerry might feel like I'm still trying to be with Tom, even if I say I'm not. I genuinely want to maintain a completely platonic friendship with Tom (I've since realized that dating him would never work out for a few different reasons) but my annoying crush-y feelings might make it seem to Jerry like I want something else. Jerry is sweet and pure and fun and closer to my age, plus he actually wants to be with me. Tom is someone I friendship-vibe'd with from the very start. How can I keep both these amazing friends in my life without making things messy as a start a romantic relationship with one of them (Jerry)? I wish there was a way to make a crush go away fast but my annoyance toward Tom for not wanting to be with me keeps popping up in my mind which sucks cause I don't want to care about that at all, I want to focus on Jerry and be just friends with Tom. Sorry for the repetitiveness!

356,What do I do? I asked her a question and she said she has to ask her boyfriend. What can I do?,11Apr2019,1
357,"Sorry for the long post.

Although I've only dated guys, I've always been curious about same sex relationships; I didn't necessarily believe I was bi. Sure, I appreciate the female body, I've had my share of fantasies, but I've never really had feelings for another girl. I've been dating a wonderful guy for almost a year, so things are going well.

A few days ago, I saw Grace again. 

Grace and I met in our college dorm; she was my first roommate. We became friends instantly: we had so much in common and spent almost all our free time together, laughing and joking. I liked her personality and ability to make me smile and laugh like no one else could. But, underneath all that bubbly facade, Grace was a troubled person. We fought similar demons. She had been sexually assaulted months before we met. She was depressed. Yet, I always tried my best to make her smile.

Less than a year into college, she took to drinking heavily, doing drugs, and hooking up with random strangers without using proper protection. During that stint, I became her unofficial babysitter. I spent so many sleepless nights by her side, always taking care of her while she was blacked out, always making sure she was safe. To this day, she still doesn't know I stopped two guys from sexually assaulting her once. 

I devoted my time into taking care of this broken girl, protecting her from all the toxic shit she tried to do to herself. I felt like I had a purpose. And then, I started resenting her deeply. Grace started hanging out with new friends and left me behind, so much that we became strangers. She started saying no one ever cared for her as much as they did. The few times she acknowledged my presence, she was drunk. She would try to get touchy-feely, demand my attention, ask me why I didn't care about her. Eventually, she moved out. I started ignoring her, walking past her like she was nothing, and that's when she started trying to reach out for me. We stopped talking for a long time. Sometimes, I really missed her.

A few days ago, I saw Grace again. She looked different: beautiful and healthy. She hugged me. We kept smiling and laughing the whole time, like two idiots. Lately, she has started texting me stupid shit and it's like nothing ever changed between us. I haven't stopped thinking about her. But, I'm trying to keep my distance. 

My boyfriend (who was with me at the time) confessed he got jealous for a moment because he has never seen me as excited as I was when I saw her. I told him about us, about how I still don't know how to properly put into words what I feel about her. He told me I should be honest and tell her what I feel before we both graduate this summer. I don't know if I love her, if it was just me being friendly and caring too much about her, but I never intend to tell her anything. I don't even know if I want to see her again. I'm confused. 

TL;DR:  Saw my old roommate again, after a long time without talking. Told my boyfriend I'm experiencing some feelings about her, he told me to be honest to her. I don't know if I want to. I don't even know what I'm feeling in the first place.",11Apr2019,2
358,"So about 2-3 years ago my mom's cat died fairly suddenly. I was attached to this cat since I lived with her for awhile while she had him, and it affected me really badly. I still cry pretty much any time I think of him. I feel incredibly guilty that I moved out of her house when he clearly enjoyed being around me more than anyone else, and that I was not able to be there (too depressed to get out of bed) when he was put to sleep. Basically, I was a shit friend to this cat, but he still loved me right up until he died. I kind of wish now that my mom had never had him, because I've been miserable about it for probably longer than I spent with him in total.

For awhile I had planned to get a cat when I was finished remodeling my living room. My therapist was really gung-ho about this for reasons I don't really understand. I think she thinks that having an animal to take care of would give me a sense of purpose. Once it actually came down to it, though, I couldn't go through with it. I have a lot of habits that aren't compatible with cat ownership. I don't really make any money, so if the cat needed some $8000 surgery, I couldn't pay for it. There's about an 50% chance that the cat would die due to something I did, and an additional 30% that it's just gonna die within a few years due to sheer dumb luck. Looking at cats on the local shelter's site and imagining what it would be like to own them turned into looking at cats and picturing each one as it would look like sick and dying. So I decided no cat deserves to live with me and gave up on the idea.

My therapist, when informed of this, wasted 30 minutes of a session trying to get me to list the good things that cats do. I have absolutely no god damned idea what this was supposed to do. I'm probably gonna end up dumping her because that shit was just insulting and infantilizing and speaks volumes about her opinion of my intelligence and capacity to make decisions, but now I'm wondering if she might have some kind of a point. It would be difficult, but there are things I could do that would make my house safer for a cat. I just don't have any faith in my ability to maintain those changes. And then there's the fact that, almost certainly, the cat will die before me no matter what I do or don't do. The best-cared-for cats I've seen only lived to be about 16-20, and I have no reason to think I'm gonna die in the next 16-20 years. (I've pretty much decided at this point that suicide is never an option, so I guess the therapy is working to some degree.)

Other people were less inappropriately pushy about it, but nobody really expressed any reservations about me getting a cat, and most actually thought it was a great idea. Reasons ranged from ""cats need loving homes, and you would love a cat"" to ""science shows that pet owners have less anxiety and depression."" All these are good arguments, but I don't think they're necessarily *better* arguments than ""a cat does not deserve to live with me."" I know what my life is like and I don't think a cat should have to be a part of it. I think they're better off in the shelter than with me.

I guess my question is why other people in my life think this is such a great idea, while all I see is a responsibility I probably can't handle. Am I overemphasizing the negatives or just being realistic? Even if I am just paranoid, is it really a good idea for someone this nervous to own an animal?",11Apr2019,1
359,"There has been a lot in the news about rich parents who buy their kids’ way into good colleges. Everybody is talking about this like cheating for your kids is something only screwed up rich people do. You don’t have to be rich to do bad things to try to help your kids and then have to deal with the guilt when it blows up. Here is my story. How do I make this right without hurting my daughter and my other kids?

My daughter was always the second-smartest student. There was one girl who always was a little ahead of her in every subject. It was really easy to be jealous because she is really pretty too and her parents both are lawyers with lots of money. 

I’m just a single mom with four kids and no child support living on my salary as a PA. If I lose my job we are all on the street. 

My daughter wanted to be number 1 in her class so bad, but she never could quite get ahead of the other girl.

That all changed when she came in for an appointment at the gynecologist’s office where I work. She was complaining of a UTI, so I saw her instead of the MD. She didn’t even recognize me even though I had been homeroom mother and field trip chaperone lots of times when she and my daughter were growing up.

This was her first UTI, and soon I realized she had just started having sex. What she actually had was “honeymoon cystitis” from too much sex.

I encouraged her to go on hormonal birth control, but she didn’t want the prescription to show up on her parents’ insurance. Instead she pulled her wallet out of her purse and said she’d pay me cash to give her the Depo shot if I did it without putting it down on her chart.

I was so angry I decided right then to teach her a life lesson and help out my daughter to finally get ahead of her at school. I agreed to give her the Depo shot and take her money, but I just gave her a saline injection instead.

I then explained that their condoms were causing inflammation and that her boyfriend should get tested so they could stop using protection. I had to show her the statistics on how safe the Depo shot is to persuade her.

She was expecting her next period to start in about a week, so I told her no sex at all until about day 8 of her next cycle.  She promised they would stop using condoms as long as his test was negative.

I told her that it was completely normal to stop having periods for months after getting the shot and that she should expect to have tender breasts, bloating, nausea, and some weight gain.

She had all those symptoms and no period when she came back three months later for her next shot. I knew she was pregnant without even waiting for the pee test, but I decided not to tell her yet. I made up an excuse to schedule a follow up in one month I put her down for the Friday before fall semester exams. I figured that was perfect timing for her to find out she was pregnant.

She completely bombed her fall exams. My daughter is now number 1 in their class and is going to be the senior class valedictorian.

I thought that was where it would end and that the girl would just get an abortion, but instead she decided to keep the baby. She is showing now, and with the stress of the pregnancy is close to flunking out. It didn’t help that her boyfriend demanded a paternity test, changed high schools, and won’t even talk to her.

I am happy for my daughter, but it’s going to be tough at graduation, knowing the other girl should be giving the class speech and not my daughter. I’m pretty sure she won’t show up.

I’d like to try to fix what I did, but I also don’t want to mess things up for my daughter.",11Apr2019,0

362,"It's been 2 months (I took some time off) since I was fired from a really good job. Excellent benefits, great income and income potential. I'm looking for feed back on how to present this (also how to present it succinctly) during job interviews. I was fired for attendance and I dont believe in being dishonest. Too big of a risk they'd hear or find out the truth anyway.


I had a first interview yesterday and outlined my response below. I'm so mad at myself for allowing a bit of emotion in my voice (big nono), so that's an issue too.


I told them (2 person interview) that i didnt believe in being dishonest and asked if I could give some context, but not an excuse, what I learned and why they wouldnt experience the same issue. 

I had the flu before Christmas, came back Christmas Eve and worked until the 8th of January, when I caught a nasty cold. X company was aware I was sick because I worked while sick before missing days and had doctors notes. Unfortunately, X company does not accept doctors notes to excuse absences and they had to let me go. Context is I'm a single mom with a 5 month old (at the time) working 50-60 hours a week and getting up 3-5x a night. [Sleep is less of an issue, but I failed to mention that]

I recognize getting sick twice in a rolling 30 days isnt normal and that there are things I can do to lessen the likelihood of that happening again. It isnt sustainable for myself or any future employer. I have committed to making it a priority to taking better care of myself through nutrition and tapping into my support system because that's what they're there for. 

Then I thanked them for letting me explain. Dunno if that was weird. The above is a condensed version of what I said. I was way too wordy IMO during the interview.

They did ask why I didnt take fmla/disability, but understood that I had just used it for maternity leave and was no longer eligible. I'm not sure if they thought it was extreme to fire an employee for getting sick with dr notes or not.

I usually interview well, but cant tell if they liked me. They did explain that initial interview is a getting to know you and getting a call back if they're interested. However, I dont feel great about it because they didnt ask me any questions other than going over my resume and one seemed to shut down after finding out I was fired for attendance. The other interviewer reminded me to go online to officially submit an application (job fair). The ex coworker who referred me said not to worry, they did the same thing to him. But this is a job fair and had already interviewed 15 applicants before me, so I'm worried.

Anyway, help me clean this up! Any suggestions or feedback?",11Apr2019,3

I digress, when she went to this island off the mainland (Shark bay, AUS) as a holiday with her family and some close friends, her family has always hated me as my parents were very free allowing me to do whatever I really wanted and saying I wasn’t “controlled enough” even though I’m probably one of the better mannered people at school, getting off topic.

364,"TL:DR my friends fiancée is accusing me of sexually harassing her and poisoning him against me.

My friend met a girl a few years ago. We were all getting along, or so I thought, until about 6 months ago when they both stopped talking to me.

After unsuccessful attempts to try and start a decent conversations and also arrange a time to give my friend his Christmas present, it has come to light that I have upset his fiancée. 

He said it was because of something I said during a game night and also because I’m a bit flirty. He also mentioned something about her having an abusive partner in the past s she can be a bit sensitive.

I thought it sounded reasonable. So I messaged the fiancée with an apology. “Sorry if I offended you, sorry if I put you on the spot or made you feel objectified”. I’m not very good at apologies but it was genuine.

A message arrived back from the fiancée late last night. According to her I have been repeatedly making sexual comments towards her - as much as 90% of the conversation, I’ve groped her and also tried to put my hand between her legs. I’ve been a bad friend and also “actively damaged their relationship”. She’s made it perfectly clear that she doesn’t want anything to do with me.

I’ve never tried to put my hand between her legs. I don’t know where she got that from.

I have grabbed her butt as a joke before. I do it to a lot of my friends to get a rise out of them. It’s not a sexual thing and she knows that. I’ve done it to my friend in front of her and we have laughed about it.

I haven’t made overtly sexual comments toward her. I’ve “flirted” with her a lot, but not seriously or with any intention. I did it at first to break the ice and she seemed responsive to it, so I carried on. She never said or acted like she didn’t like it. I would have stopped otherwise. 
    This all happened around the time those “send nudes” memes were going around, so she got a few of those from me (as did everyone else) and she was fine with it.

As for being a bad friend, I wrote his phone number on a toilet stall door “for a good time call xxx” on a night out. Other than that I think I’ve been a great friend to this guy. I’ve lent him money, fixed and modified his car for him for free every time he’s asked, been there for him when he’s been down and let it slide when he’s done something stupid (like trade in a video game we went halves on).

He still seems half interested in being friends.
She wants nothing to do with me and presumably would prefer if he didn’t either.

I am already beginning preparations to run away in case things go south, but as a homeschooler things are a lot more difficult than it would be as a public schooler. I want to continue with high school so I can get a diploma, but I don't really have grades even in high school due to the general ineptitude of my parents. I have done standardized testing for every year of my life, including taking the PSAT 8/9 and the PSAT 10 (and I have done well on all those tests!) , but I don't know how to retrieve that information, especially without informing my parents of my intent.

&amp;#x200B;

There are virtually no documents that show I have been in high school. I have my work from the past four years in my google account, but I'm not exactly sure how useful that will be to me, and once I'm homeless, I won't be able to use it because the police could track me with it.

I am fully prepared to lie to people in order to get my education and survive, but I am unsure how to go to school as a homeless person. I could always continue my homeschool through a service such as Khan academy, but I would much prefer going to school in a safe building rather than trying to continue it at libraries when I happen upon them.

Since then I’ve become increasing paranoid and scared to trust my girlfriends wellbeing particularly when she has been in a really bad patch and she’s by herself and she’s starting to get frustrated at me for it. 
I spent last year encouraging her to seek proper help and though she was on board with the idea she would never follow through with it. She has only started therapy again recently after I set it up for so she wouldn’t have to worry about if she deserves it or not . 
I’m always there to comfort her when she’s upset and she said she really appreciates all the help I have given but when she just gets out of a bad patch and I strongly push for her to properly take priority on getting help for her situations she’s gets angry at me for how hard I push it. I get so scared about how easy she moves on from issues without trying to prevent them for the future and often it doesn’t take long before she’s in another bad patch again, I really worry that things could go so horribly wrong again. I hate the person I become in those moments because I know I go overboard with it but I don’t know how to feel secure knowing I should be doing something to help because I know she won’t herself. 
I’ve tried talking about these type of issues with her before but she struggles with confrontation and takes it as an attack instead. I really do love her and when things are going well we’re truly great together but I can’t help but feel I’m not treating it right.

How do I handle myself in these situations in a healthily so I can help her in the best way possible?",11Apr2019,3

383,"To make a long story short, I recently started a new full-time job. The first three weeks, I was often in the office by myself with nobody to ask for support (my co-workers were all out in the field and my boss on sales meetings). Two days ago, on my lunch break, I had a ""hell with it"" moment, wrote my letter of resignation, and left it on my boss's desk. Went home early that day. I received an apology voicemail from him today, saying that they will train me and ensure that somebody is in the office at all times to help me out.

Am I making a mistake by going back? Although the apology was sincere, I'm assuming all of my co-workers will hate me and my boss will be fearful of me walking out again.",11Apr2019,4
384,"I’m 23 and I graduated last July and started working in a corporate job. I’m working as a Recruiter and I like it! Its fun and people are nice but my main motivation is to earn some money before starting my masters about something I’m really passionate about. I will be 25 by the time I start my masters.

Problem is I feel like I haven’t lived like I’m suppose to. I look back at my college years and find myself wishing _I wish I had partied more,I wish I slept with random people, I wish I tried more drugs, I wish I got drunk more often and went to every festival and every night out_

Which is funny. Because I’m not that person. I don’t particularly enjoy clubbing and I have never slept with a stranger I just met because yikes.  But now that I have seen the post-college life and spend time with people in their 30s and experienced the 9-5 life style... and people counting down to their annual vacations..
I feel like I’m suffocating...


 I keep thinking I should have done more crazy stuff because now those days are over and I have to save money and always plan about the future etc. Like look for someone to marry and make wise boring decisions. (I really do want to get married its not like oh society wants that,no I want that)

I also feel like if someone else lived my life they probably would have done a better job. This thought haunts me.

And its important to mention that I live with my parents because their house is exactly 1.8 km away from my office and in the middle of the city center. So I can just throw crazy parties in the middle of the living room or come home wasted in the morning and so on.

385,I’m a 17 y/o male. I’m the youngest of 4 and 2 of my siblings are out of college and the other is a freshman in college. My parents delayed me from driving until my 17th bday(March 2nd). I would always drive to work with a parent in the car. I always felt like I was a good driver and had tons of confidence. Then a week into driving by myself I wrecked into a pole. I went into a turn way to fast and clipped a pole and curb. It required the fender to be replaced. Ever since the crash (about a month)has just been replaying in my head. For past year I drove with my parents and  I never had a wreck even close to happening. Today was the first day I drove by myself and my heart is still racing. How can I calm myself down and become a safer driver. I am obviously driving the speed limit always now.,11Apr2019,1
386,"I've been working in a clothes department store for about six months ago. I'm a student who's here casually, but I am a very hard worker. I was offered an assistant manager job after only two months but turned it down because of college. I work hard yes, but also due to the my coworkers being mostly young students too, I'm lucky to have made many coworker friends and we chat here and there at work (obviously not in front of customers but instead say when we're folding clothes or tidying a fitting room).

One of the friends I've made is a guy, who I found out we had everything in common from music to films and got along very well. Before we knew it we were texting a lot, commuting together, and went out to eat a few times after work. I obviously developed some feelings for him, and know he felt the same (flirting, wanting to go out for more drinks just us two when we'd go out for drinks as a group). But I didn't think now was the right time to act on it, and clearly he felt the same way if he never explicitly said he liked me or actually made a move. Totally fine by me! Sometimes just having a work husband who you flirt with occasionally is fine for now. I really do (or did) value this guy as a friend first and foremost, and someone I could trust.

The only thing about this guy is that he is an extreme worry wart. He suffers from extreme anxiety, and flips out over the smallest things like clothes presumed stolen or someone leaving the floor for more than a minute. He worries about things that do not affect him in any way, which we all became used to. He also sucks up to my manager a LOT due to his anxiety about getting into trouble or his job stability being questioned. Although it's a pain, I tried really hard to be empathetic and kind to him and stuck up for him MANY times behind his back when people would make fun of him to me.

Then last week I had to leave my area to take an over the phone order. They pay over the phone for their clothes, we wrap it up and post it to them. The area we work in was busy and loud so I took the call to a quieter section of the floor. I told him I was leaving for 10 minutes and I'll be back. So I do the phone order, and go to wrap it up. As I'm doing so, one of the girls who works in that section came over for a chat. WHILE I'm wrapping it up (so I'm clearly working here) we made small talk about college work and our degrees. As I'm doing so the guy walks past (he has to pass this section to get to the stock room) and gives me a cold look. I shrug it off. By this point I'm writing the address on the postage sticker as he comes out, and the other girl is talking to me while I'm doing that. He walks past and this time stops and says ""umm excuse me but it's really busy in our area so can you wrap things up and come back"" and I smiled and said of course I'm done now anyway.

I get back and he seems fine and it's not even busy anyway but I go back to selling/tidying the clothes when my manager comes around and in conversation says not to do any more phone orders or leave the space. At first I'm like sure yeah then I think UM how does she know that me doing that is a problem? Then I realised he must have said something and I'm like wtf but I didn't do anything besides my damn job? I brushed it off.

Then comes tonight and my assistant manager (who's my age and she considers me a friend) had a heart to heart with me and told me that in June we're having a floor review on who's staying, who's being moved and who's job will become non existent (aka letting go). She told me look I'll be honest our manager is annoyed with you right now and you're in the grey area. I was completely thrown off guard and said to her idgi I do my job, do everything asked of me, deliver amazing customer service. The works! What did i do? She said to me no you do all of that perfectly well it's just there's a standard that you're not meeting by talking to others. I was so dumbfounded, I've never had a single manager tell me off for talking, I've seen oodles of coworkers talk INFRONT of customers, and in a group, and I've never joined in. Ever. So I asked her for an actual example because I couldn't think of any (I say hi/bye to everyone that's it) and she said ""Well I don't have any myself but just letting you know there is a coworker that doesn't like your talking habit and has told our boss on you about it a few times"". She did assure me that if I don't talk to anyone, keep my head down and work my job will be secured.

Now I have a fair few snakes in my department, mostly gossipy/bitchy women so my mind jumped to one of them and shrugged it off. Then I realised holy shit no it's none of them it's the guy I actually had feelings for...who I considered my friend...What the actual hell. When I realised that this one (or two who knows) comment he made to my manager about me now has her pissed at me when she doesn't even know the whole story (I was making small talk WHILE wrapping a garment) and my job is on the line. I don't even think he knows what he's done and how his snitching on his own friend has caused such a big riff. I had a massive panic attack at how overwhelmed and disappointed I was and cried my whole tea break in the bathroom. I don't know what to do.

I haven't seen this guy since last week because we're casuals on different days but I know we're both working together this weekend. I feel sick at the thought of having to be in the same room as him, I don't even know how I can look at him in the face. My initial reaction would be to confront him but his anxiety and snitching tells me he'd probs run to our boss, or HR. Why couldn't he have just told me to my face if something I did bothered him instead of running to my manager, demonising me and putting my job on the line? If we're close enough to get food and drinks alone, and text weekly, how could he do this to me? Wtf do I do?

Thanks for reading.

tldr; A coworker who I considered my friend and maybe more snitched on my boss that I was making small talk to a coworker while wrapping a garment for a phone order.

387,"I am a greedy, selfish, cruel and uncompassionate child who strives to try to live however I like while being confined in a bunch of ways by my absolutely-trying-to-be-open-enough parent. Why can't people just accept that? What the heck is wrong with them???

I don't say ""I'm selfish"" because I want to change and become a ""better person"". I say ""I'm selfish"" because I'm proud of it. I'm proud of my utter lack of compassion for living creatures. I'm proud of most things I do in life and on the Internet that aren't cringy. I would gladly trade my cats' souls for inanimate and cooked versions of them like you get in China where they eat cats and dogs but don't eat some other animal normal to eat here (in India, cows are holy but I would dare to eat steak straight in front of them in the middle of their cringy hailing rituals of people like Krishna and Vishnu). I don't have a cerebral/mental wireless connection to other people, so their lives mean nothing to me and their only uses are their special individualities (like the people that supply pleasure-inducing things like game developers, game players, YouTubers and people that work at food shops). I like thinking about absolutely disgusting violent scenes that I've never seen before and can only imagine, involving extreme disfigurations and mess-ups of people, animals and their organs for whatever reasons and I think that's part of the norm. (Keep in mind that I barely actually get into that much, but it's fun when I do.) Why can't people just accept that?

I would like to go to Hell because Hell is a pretty good place! It's where good old Lucy and his demonic cohorts live. Well, apart from whatever lust does because that totally ruins things for me. Unfortunately, that's just a fantasy because God, Satan and whatever else aren't real. But it's my decision to only care for my eternal, inescapable ""true consciousness"", which absolutely every other group of particles in the universe lack! Well, that's made confusing when you consider the fact that all of my atoms are constantly shedding away and being replaced as per the natural HUMAN nature. When it comes to philosophy, it's like I know all the answers to everything logic-based, and I know that there's no such thing as ""good"" or ""bad"" - it's just what deoxyribonucleic acid created so it could help itself take over the universe and last eternally which I KNOW it'll never finish doing because of the cosmocalypse, so just give up already and make the most of all your consciousnesses! That's just what I'm doing: aiming to be reasonably fine as much of the time as I can. Why can't people just accept that?

I've argued with my parent about these things when deciding not to do my not-self-set ""tasks"". Sometimes we waste like a few hours going all over existential subjects just so that I can justify my choice to be free. I don't ask for much from life: just free food, housing, toilets, beds, drinks and technology. I don't understand what makes people in real life such as the government such megalomaniacs. I just want that much to be fine. I was even considering making myself homeless because hey! It can't be that bad! Like, seriously. Lol. I've thought about it. (Note: I always deal with things head-on, intrinsically.) I've even considered sneaking out of the house further than I've done before to go to my school and erase my signature and also return my cats to the adoption centre so I can take back my ""responsibilities"" I ""committed"" to. But in the end, my parent is like ""just be quiet now, you're wasting tons of time. Get on with all your tasks you're behind on and just, like, shut up."" And I don't bother budging just because I'm a pussy that seems to take future punishment a lot worse than present punishment where I'm like ""seriously? Wooooooow, you didn't even try, pathetic little puny little puss puss."" From my perspective, she's just totally forfeit the argument by not bothering to finish it when it's ""a waste of precious time you need to use to catch up on your stuff"". Like, seriously! Life itself is a waste of time! Well not really, because the entire concept of ""importance"" is entirely subjective! Why can't people just accept that?

I don't care about my school mark, but she does. She's trying to get me as high of a score as I can get with reasonable effort when I'm like ""hey! I absolutely, completely, totally, utterly and wholly do not care if I get an N- for less than no evidence of learning!"" I'm totally retarded, and I embrace that! I like all the stupid skits and mindsets that come around with mental retardedness! In fact, maybe that's why I don't even have to cry for no reason like other people apparently do. Why can't people just accept that?

I don't give one hoot to my cats, or my family, or our communities (except the people that provide pleasure-inducing things like game developers, game players, YouTubers and people that work at food shops, as said earlier), or our world, or our meaning, or our neighbours, or our supporters. For all I care, I could wake up the next morning and see that my cats and family have totally been minced and butchered and stuck around the whole house. Sure, I might get the chills but in the end, the problem would be that I would have to clean all THAT UP OFF THE HOUSE!!! Oh, and not only that! All that mince I could've cooked and eaten would be wasted. But eh, I don't know how to hunt anyway because for your information, my parent's vegan. It's a lose-lose for me when I have to deal with not only the lack of contribution to animal exporting, torturing, farming and slaughtering, but the expense, lack of variety and lack of taste vegan meats have to offer. One time I even just snuck out to the store and brought chicken chips at the self-checkout register because I'm an introvert. I live only to supply dopamine for my empty head because apparently it feels good. (Why do things feel good anyway?) Why can't people just accept that?

I'm basically a stuck-up, self-absorbed, disgusting, fecal dog. Not even gonna say ""black slave"" because equality is very important to me. (Why can't we torture, kill and eat cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, parrots and turtles as well as cows, pigs, ducks, chicken, lamb and fish? Vegans should start a secret organisation that does just that just so they can spite all the normal meat-eating people instead of harassing people blocking off streets to do massive protests and getting themselves all arrested.) I can take absolutely everything offensive except for things relating to privates and something ""family-friendly"" I'm not even going to mention or blurt out because I hate it infinitely more than everything else put together and would risk such just for it to be destroyed from existence. I completely lack compassion for living creatures because as long as I'm not connected to them why should I give a hoot? Before you ask, I'm not EVEN depressed or a suicidal. Forgot where I should put that but I had to put it somewhere.. I don't even care that much about killing. I just want to be free to a minimum extent. Why the hell can't y/w'all people just accept that and deal with ittttttttttttttttt?????????????????????????",11Apr2019,0

390,"The last two months have been very difficult in our relationship. I have questioned him several times if he was taking his meds. He always said yes. Yesterday things were really off. After thinking about it, this morning I counted his pills. He has two months worth.

I've been questioning my sanity, my emotions and trying to figure out what was wrong with me. What was causing this change? Why was he so angry at everyone? Now I know why. 

I was mad, but now I'm just worried. Why is he doing this? We've been down this road before and I was very clear that if he didn't step up and take care of himself that I couldn't stay in this relationship. 

I'm worried this is going to destroy us. I can't be responsible for him when I'm already exhausted taking care of myself and our children. We both go to individual counseling, but he refuses to go to marriage counseling. 

Advice needed : How should I approach this so that he understands? Should I wait and count his meds for a week so I have definitive proof? Should I get his family involved? Call his Dr? What else is he lying to me about? Is he even going to his appointments?

398,"Hello, so I will get right into it. My little sister has been bringing up some very disturbing things recently. She is very funny and likes to spend a lot of time by herself watching youtube videos in her room. She is in 5th grade and has a lil friend group with all the neighborhood kids and they've been friends for years. She likes scary movies and creepy stuff. It kinds started with her drawing weird dark shit, which is cool, I do too, but she would add blood and say she likes being known as the ""creepy girl"".  So in my head i'm like, here we go, the angsty years (by this i mean where kids start trying to find a label like: class clown, drama queen, horse girl, etc). Around that age I myself chose to be more of a dorky/nerd type and my outlet was books and grades.

So she knows I'm studying psychology so she asked me about suicide and depression and we talked a lot about it and stuff. I chalked it up to curiosity etc. She still didn't understand chemicals in the brain and such so It was more just her asking questions and me trying my best to explain such an abstract concept in a way an 11 year old would understand. Well then my mom tells me one day that she had to go pick her up from school because she told her friend she wanted to commit suicide. During this, her friends and her were in a big fight and apparently my sister was being mean to a disabled boy in the class by laughing at him when he was getting upset, so they refused to talk to her; it had been a couple days from their fight and they still weren't talking. So she passed a note to one of her friends saying that she was going to commit suicide. My sisters friend took it to the teacher and it went from there. My mom got on her ass and my sister couldn't even explain death, afterlife, murder or suicide to be frank. She was using it to try to get her friends to talk to her again. 

 On a separate occasion my mother found a note, which my sister defended as a 'scary story' where she wished my brother and mom would ""die a slow painful death"".  She really does not like our little brother and cant grasp the fact he has autism and doesn't understand him. For some reason I had a gut feeling the note held some truth to it; because she has told be she wished we didn't have a little brother. I came home furious; why the fuck am I having to worry about weather my sister is going to go off the rails and hurt my brother or mom. I sat her down and basically told her to cut the shit and if she ever harmed our brother or mom I would personally beat her ass. During our conversation I could see in her face she knew I wasn't buying the ""scary story"" bs and I could tell she knew I was serious. There haven't been any ""scary stories"" since.

She does have attention issues but I never thought it would come to her talking about suicide to get it, I also thought she would never make fun of a disabled boy because that's not how we were raised (plus our youngest brother is autistic). Flash forward to just this week and my sister got a new chalk board in her room. I wrote on it "" I LOVE YOU &lt;3"" next time I come home my mom tells me she drew a chair and noose and wrote ""if i did it no one would care."" Is she being serous? I'm feeling very manipulated by her because she lies often, and I'm seeing some very serious problems in her behavior and outlook of other people, bordering on sociopathic. Is this really suicidal thoughts or trying to get attention?

At this point I don't know what to do. Is she really suicidal or just being an ass? The girl can't stand blood and has never hurt anyone but she will say this off the wall shit and it's like I don't even know her. Am I blowing it out of proportion or am I right to be so concerned? My family doesn't have that type of money for a good psychiatrist. I don't want to write off her emotions but when we talk or discuss these topics I can tell she is grasping at straws with this stuff. She respects me more than the other members of my family, probably because I'm the oldest sibling, but also because I've always been real with her.

So basically, one of the biggest problems with me is that I like attention and I hate the fact that I'm an attention seeker. I feel like that's making me become a toxic person in the lives of other, especially a really close friend of mine and I want to figure out how to stop myself, how to slowly change.

Like today for example, I tried to go out of my way and made bad decisions to try to get her to hang out with me. I realize now how stupid I was for doing that and wanting that attention. And I understand that wanting attention isn't bad but she doesn't like texting too much, and she's been hurt before by certain toxic friends before and I've tried my hardest to NOT be them and I swear I'd rather kill myself before I be them but I feel like I'm verging towards becoming them.

And I know all of this yet I still do those stupid attention wanting crap because I forget about all of this at that instant.

406,"First time here and poster. I apologize in advance if I’m posting in the incorrect subreddit.

Today this morning during a company meeting. We have a thing where we take a turns around the table to announce anything related to work. (We are a tech firm) 

I decided to be a bit engaged in the conversation. While it was fine and dandy. I was eventually shot down by my boss. I thought it was good enough to bring up to possibly present an opportunity for my career.

By the end of the meeting, there was one last announcement. My Boss recognizing my team, excluding me in receiving positive feedback from clients. This set me off mentally and felt my anxiety creeping up on me. I know I perform and put the numbers out there to cover my full day of work.

Aside from that I started to resent one of my coworkers. I know coworker under performs based on numbers and I just felt under appreciated.

I wrote a whole list of things on my spiral.
A few things: 

- Stress

- I’m an introvert and have a challenge being social during work with other coworkers.

- I’m lonely. Seriously, only time I become social is when I’m with my buddy at the gym. Or, with another friend smoking weed. This causes me to stay very late to satisfy this loneliness. Get between 5-6 hours of sleep.

- Anxiety. I start to feel at work every negative thing (arriving late, not meeting daily numbers , sitting and answering/making phone calls for 8 hours ) just anything related to work is negative. And they only focus on the negative and never the positive. Im starting to resent myself.

- I’m noticing less energy in reaching out communicating with my family and girlfriend.
I feel so terrible now that I’m acknowledging this.

- I keep everything bottled up.

- I suck at managing my income

- I want to talk with someone and seek help. But I feel I’m troubling my employer since recently I had a virual infection and removal of a wisdom tooth.

407,"I am not good at making a long story short so my apologies. I want to explain my father's past so you can get an idea of what I am dealing with and if there really is anything I can do. 
I am a 28/F pregnant with my second child and have decided to quit my job and become my dads home aid to earn money while being with my children. 
My dad has always been involved in the drug world long before I was born. Hes been chased out of Puerto Rico when I was months old and almost killed in front of me when I was 2 years old here in NYC. In 2001, my mom left my dad due to his addictions and finding out he has schizophrenia. 
Around 2010 he began getting his life together and got his own apartment after being homeless for years. In 2012, my mom, brother, niece and myself would get together often and spend time with him and go out downtown to enjoy the city. It was a great time in my life. My mom ended up moving to Florida in 2015 and my brother moved in with my dad right after. My brother also deals with a drug addiction and I feel as though he got my dad started back again cause after my brother moved to Conneticut in 2017, my dad began going downhill. I'd say it was a combination of being alone and having his addiction kick started that reversed all the progress he has made. All his family live in Puerto Rico and Florida so it is just me and him here in NYC. I was recently offered the opportunity to be his home aid by his case manager. We discussed that having me there can help him since his complaint was that he was alone and uses drugs to cope with his loneliness. Yesterday I asked him directly about his drug use and I got him to finally say ""yes, I use all my money to buy cocaine/crack"". He has admitted to using in the pass but denies using it in the present time. I knew he was using because his hands were burnt and dry, I found pieces of brillow pads and burnt pens laying around his kitchen. 
I asked him how can I help him stop and he said to spend more time with him. Which I know is probably a lie but I agreed to being his aid because I saw this as an opportunity to leave my stressful job and be with my family. My husband is all for me being a housewife and is a bit sceptical about having the kids around my dad. The care would be 3 days a week 3-4 hours a day so I wont be there that often.
My question is: Do you think my dad can come around? Is there hope for me to save him or em I being naive?",11Apr2019,2

413,"Quick little dilemma, I had a test at 12:30 yesterday so I woke up at 8 took a 50 mg vyvanse studied then took the test (felt like I aced it.) Took a short break then studied nonstop for another exam that was due at midnight. I finished the test around 11:30 (got a very low B.) I then proceeded to bullshit with my buddies (live in a fraternity house with 60 dudes) till about 1:30 AM.  I tried to go to sleep and after about 2-3 hours of just laying in my bed and not even getting close to being tired I gave up hope and got ready for the day. Started studying just now for another exam I have at 12:30. 

So I here’s where I need advice

Whenever I take adderall or vyvanse, I always end up never being able to go to sleep even though I take it easy in the morning. This happens to me every time I take it so this wasn’t a one time deal. 

1. Is it a big deal that I can never sleep when I take addy or vyvanse? I understand it’s suppose to keep you awake, but if I take it at 8:30AM and can’t even get close to sleeping at 1:30AM (17 hours later) is that a problem?

2. If this isn’t a big deal what can I do to help me fall asleep. 

3. Less serious, but would it be a bad thing if I consumed alcohol? (Assuming I start at 9, I will at that point be awake for 38 hours and taken a 50mg vyvanse each morning)

Please answer any or all questions you may have researched, have personal experience, or have an opinion that you would like to share. 

Thanks



***additional factors that I think might influence advice ***- I’ve been eating normally, been drinking water, Mountain Dew, coffee, apple juice and chocolate milk. Also have been using nicotine like I have been for almost a year.

Cops were called. All sorted. No one is pressing charges. The other guy told me that he will not be using his insurance for repairs. And it's ok, his damage was significantly smaller than mine.

This is my second try at college and is going terrible, I'm only taking 2 classes but I can't focus enough to get papers done for my writing class.

I'm most likely going to be put on academic probation again and honestly idk what i wanna do.

I don't know what i wanna major in honestly, I'm only going to college because i don't feel like i have other options.

I currently work a little over 20 hours a week washing dishes, it's not the greatest job but l work really hard to get my stuff done. I think I want to just work a full time job but I'm worried the pay would be to low to even move out of my parents house.

I want to live a basic life, i wouldn't mind working 40+ hours a week and making enough money to have an apartment and be able to play video games with my friends and have internet. I don't want anything too crazy. Do i need to go to college for this kind of life? How much would i need to make to live this kind of life? 

I'm not the strongest or smartest but i work hard when i need to.

Tl:dr. I'm probably not gonna make it through college, can i work 40 hours a week at an entry level job and still be able to move out one day? Or am i stuck? I feel like college is the only option to living a decent life, but i know that isn't true, any advice?",11Apr2019,2

421,"I’m gonna try not to go into too much detail, but basically my family/home life makes me absolutely miserable. I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’ve had multiple different types of medication, therapists, the lot. 

Because of these I struggle with jobs (every job I’ve had has led to mental break downs) at some point I resorted to selling pictures of myself bc I was desperate for money but jobs were so difficult for me. 

I currently have a fantastic therapist who I’ve been seeing for almost 2 full years. She has made me make a lot of revelations as to why I am the way I am. And the majority of them are to do with my home life. 

My family aren’t bad necessarily. I live at home with my mother, father, and 25 year old sister. My older brother (27) has moved out. They don’t hurt me (my dad had a phase of hitting me when I was younger but stopped and hasn’t laid a hand on me since), my mother has a great job that makes her a lot of money, I am allowed to live in their house rent free, and my mother actually pays for my therapy. But they have pretty toxic personality traits. 

For example, none of them really accept my mental health issues and put it down to me being lazy and not wanting to get better. I’m grateful my mother pays for my therapy but she has shown that she doesn’t believe it actually does anything, she just pays because she can and it’ll keep me quiet and away from a&amp;e. 
My sister is a habitual liar and regularly causes arguments and turns it so it seems as though I caused it and I’m being uncooperative. Among many many other things. Once again I’m not gonna go into too much detail but that’s not even the tip of the ice berg, it’s like the freshly settled snow on top. 

I’m currently ‘living’ with my boyfriend. But not exactly. I stay nearly every night in his home, where his parents live too. He only lives at home bc he’s unable to afford paying for his two children (who mostly live with their mothers but he sees them often) and while he’s studying for a degree. So obviously I can’t fully move in. Especially since we have only been together 6 months. 
I’ve noticed since staying at my boyfriends more that my mood has lifted exponentially. I will be so much clearer and happier, until I have to go home to them again. Where I once again become utterly miserable. I can’t spend 10 minutes in a house with them without feeling depressed again. 

So I’m not entirely sure what exactly I’m asking but I guess I just need to know if anyone has been in this kind of situation? 

Too miserable to stay in touch with family, but I have no where else to go, no money, and struggle heavily with holding down a job. 

I want nothing more than to be able to afford to move away and to hold down a job and just live my life without their bitterness and judgement, but it seems so unrealistic. I honestly don’t know how much longer I can cope.",11Apr2019,0
422,"so i’ve started working at this restaurant around a month ago and i’m their youngest hire. i’m a cashier and i work long shifts of around 8 to 10 hours and i work from Wednesdays to Sundays. i rack up around 40+ hours a week and i had 16 hours overtime on my last pay-check. 

this being said, i also have school to attend as well. my normal work day is as follows:
5:30- take my dad to work across town
6:00- get ready for school
7:00- drive to school
7:40 to 15:00- school
15:30 to close (sometimes 23:30, sometimes 2:00am)

this leaves me a few hours of sleep and caffeine does not affect me so i cant turn to that when i’m tired. i’ve started to be almost asleep while driving if there’s no one with me to keep me thinking/stimulated.

another part of this is that my parents don’t want me working this much even though i actually really enjoy my job and have even lied to my parents about how late i work so that i’ll still be allowed to work. they’ve threatened to make me quit if there are any dips in school performance or attitude. i’ve brought up cutting my hours a bit to my GM (who is honestly a generally nice person) because i signed up for a part time job and was given full time hours. he made a somewhat vague comment about me being able to leave at 23:00 before moving on. however, i’m the only cashier they ever schedule for my time slot and that would leave no one to do my closing chores and i just feel so guilty leaving my work for someone else. i also don’t get any breaks due to this and i usually take it once we close the building.

Sadly  though  this is not really what I wanted to do.I wanted  to VFX artist. But that's just not a career available here.
I am trying to learn that on the side, but it feels like I'm making  0 progress at this point. I am using blender and it feels like I am making  the same mestake  over and over again..but I don't  what it is.
I tried guides on Youtube.But its feels like they are all over the place, what I meant by this is that I don't  know where to start and with which one.

Next thing is I feel like I made a mistake to go to university.I do enjoy a lot.But what warrys me is the money, my grandpa makes around 
714.86 in USD a month that's 10k in ZAR.
I wanted to apply  for a study  loan, but originally my grandfathers money transferred into my grandmother's bank  account.And that was not allowed when doing  a request  for a study loan.So my grandfather opened an account  on his name but we have to have 7 months of bank statements.So now we have to wait 3 more months  before I can apply  again.But what I'm  stressed  about is what if I don't  get it,the study loan. My grades were at average  around 60% for all my subjects  back in high school.I feel really  selfish  about this all because  if I don't  get it I'll  have to dropout and all dept would be in his name.And I really don't  want that

And the very last thing is...well I met this girl on my 2nd week there. We became friends at a fast rate but like recently I have noticed how much I really like her.Like she is everything I ever wanted  in a girl.Nice, smart and loves animal's.We both share one thing  in particular..how hard it is for us to talk to other people and or be in front of crowds.But we do get along  really well.But I don't know if I should tell her how I feel.Im afraid it might  make our friendship  awkward. I don't know if anyone can relate  to what I'm  about to say but yeah.. everytime  I think  about telling her how I feel i just get more depressed because i can't  even stand to look at my self in a mirror how can she like a guy like me..that's my thought every time worst  part is I can't  stop thinking about her..like we are on break now and I wish it was just over...should I just let time pass and ser what happens?",11Apr2019,1

My situation

I am going to be completely honest about it, it may seem that everything I say is crazy and this is all fabricated, but believe me, everything in this is real.

My dad, is a pretty demanding person, atleast that is what I think. He is a pretty wealthy man and he expects a lot from me and my sister, but I think it is a little bit too much. At home we have rules like ""No Phones in OP and OP's sister's room"" and more stupid rules, he expects us to read a lot to the point where you just want to stay at school more than you want to stay home. We also have a another rule, No computer games. Now for a 12 year old, computer games are like a necessity, but I couldn't play. We really can't do anything other and read, go to school, and also, tutors. It gets to the point where I don't want my own two parents to be a home so I can atleast have some alone time and watch YouTube in my room. This is where my grandmother kicks in. My grandmother is kind, and I love her the most out of everyone in the family tree, she strongly disagrees with my dad's rules but still stands beside him, but behind my dad's back, she bought me a computer, like a gaming laptop, so I can play games. I only play once in a while, because I can't go to here house everyday and it's not like she can bring it over to my house where my dad might be home, and I am scared, scared to find out if he will find out and disown me, or beat me even, and all this worrying has gotten my grades lower, from what would normally be an A, to a B-. This even aggravated him more and I got tutors, he says I have an attitude problem, and shouts at me when I get a question wrong or accidentally say the wrong answer really quick.

We all have pasts and different experiences that keep us from falling or trusting someone. This makes the other person feel as though they haven done something wrong when they haven't. It can cause intense anxiety and days of not eating. This is where I am at 19 years of age. This past fall, I fell for someone who came out of a two year relationship. I felt on top of the world. He put so much effort into me that it was so hard not to forget about his ex who he broke up with just a month prior to coming into my life. This relationship consisted of numerous sleepovers a week, hanging out, going out together on the weekends,  trips to the mall, invitations to get food and even concerts. Everything a couple would do. Despite me laying my eyes on texts of him and his ex girlfriend where he asked her if she thought they could ever make it work again and if she ever saw him in her future. We know where that story goes. Suddenly one day, I was cut from his life out of the blue. No goodbye, no reason for why he wouldn't reach out to me anymore. Nothing. This left me lost and confused for months and still has me feeling damaged to this day. It felt so real and kept me wondering where I went wrong. This destroyed my already nonexistent self esteem. This made me feel very hesitant to trust. 

This past month is what feels like an absolute relapse of what happened to me however this time my gut tells me it feels much more genuine. I met a guy and we've known about each other for awhile. He goes to school about 4 hours away from me. He was home on break and the last day of him being home we met and hung out. We hit it off as we were the exact same person. I know this was my person. We both shared with each other that we have never connected with somebody so much and that we were the perfect person for each other. He deleted any of the dating apps he had on the spot. Our days of constantly snap chatting, texting, phone calls to say goodnight I even went out to visit him for the weekend. It was better than anyone could dream. It was practically like we were dating. We had plans for the summer and next year. I was told so many things by him about how he wanted to date me and etc. I had hope when  I thought I never would have it again. This hope was what kept me going through the day. Until guess what! Two days ago he told me about how just about several months ago he just had gotten out of a two year relationship and still feels betrayed by what happened. He gave her 100% while she was giving only 50% and how once she broke up with him and just a few  weeks later she found a new boyfriend. He expressed his feelings about how he thought he was ready for a new relationship but now he is not. He says he is not necessarily ready to put himself in a position to be emotionally hurt again while he has many things going on in his life. He explains to me that he needs to figure out who he is and what he wants. I can see this kid is emotionally damaged and I believe there are things going on that I don't know about and that he is not ready to share with me. He says he sees me in his future but doesn't know when exactly he'll be ready as there are things at home he needs to deal with. It feels genuine. He tells me he still wants to talk to me and be friends until the summer when he's hopefully ready. He says he has 0 intentions of cutting me out of his life but as of now he needs me as a friend. He says he doesn't talk to other girls and I want to believe it but after having constant hits to your trust and self esteem its extremely difficult not to fear the worst. He believes it is a case of right person but awful timing. I want to believe this but it is so hard for me. I don't know where to go. I believe this kid from the bottom of my heart. In fact my gut is telling me this is my person. I think he wants to make sure he is ready because he knows he has found a real thing with me and wants it to grow on a healthy foundation. However I'm at a crossroad between believing it will turn out okay for us as I feel like I've seen where this story goes. I want it to be different. I don't know how to be a friend to him right now and support him because I am hurting. I don't want this connection to die but at the same time I want to go missing from his life so he realizes what he is missing for a few days. If you guys could give any advice I would greatly appreciate where to go from here.",11Apr2019,1
431,"DISCLAIMER: I'm not a native english writer.

either way, to sort this out. My dad has an illness, i think it's called multiple sclerosis. My mother wants to commit suicide or well rather talks about it. I've recently lost my job and in process of searching a new one. So basically my father is a plant that can't move or speak(like just skin and bones) and he can't even talk. So my question to you my reddit is, what should i do? I never really participated in helping otherwise as working because it was too overwhelming, and i feel like my only solution to this is money so i can get away, that's way i'm learning front end in hopes of a better job.

432,"So I’m in collage right now and I’m having a hard time deciding if I should move or not. Right now I’m living with my roommate from the dorms and this other guy who’s like a friend of a friend. 

Summary: So basically they’re just really negative and they do things I just don’t understand why they’d do and I rarely ever have good conversations with them, most of the time their just drunk and coked out (I don’t partake) and say the same shit over and over again. One of them always has friends over and blasts edm music and my room is right next to the living room and I literally feel my room shaking. It’s not even just on the weekends, they’ll do that shit on like a Tuesday sometimes and they always stay up super late doing that shit and I just want to sleep.I still like roommate #1 despite the annoying shit he does, but roommate #2 I just hate living with. 

The only reason I haven’t left is that roommate #1 has friends over and we all go to the bars. Like I’m friends with all of them but I wonder how often I’d get hit up to go if I didnt live at the house we all pregame at. I’m worried that if I move I’ll have nobody to go to the bars with. 

So I’ve been friends with my roommate (let’s say roommate #1) from the dorm for a long time but honestly he has some issues. He takes anti anxiety meds which some people definitely need (like my sister actually) but I’ve known him since before he started talking them and idk if he really needs them. Like before he was taking them I never saw him have any panic attacks or decide not to do something for no good reason. This dude also drinks heavy and both my roommates are coke fiends (though this roommate not as much as the other). I used to like him but we’ve both changed a lot since the dorms 2 years ago (me for the better him not so much). 

He likes to try to like insult me and shit for any reason he can find. Like the dude thinks it’s funny to just out of the blue tell me “fuck you” and so obvious I respond with “fuck you” and we just keep saying to to each other. Like we’ve done that shit a billion times, it want funny the first time. He’s gotten fucked up and just started yelling shit at my door (he was really fucked up that night) at like 3 am before. Like when he’s in a good mood and sober he fun to hang out with but as soon as anything goes a little wrong in his life he’s just fucking annoying. He constantly looks for reasons to insult me but since as long as I’ve known him he’ll do some dumb shit and I don’t insult him like he would to me. Overall just don’t really have fun times with him anymore. 

My other roommate (#2)is a self described “crack head” cause he does a insane amount of coke. I don’t like it and don’t do it at all but this dude is almost always drunk and coked up. And every time he is he literally just talks about the same shit over and over again. Hes just fucking dumb too. He’s had a bunch of concussions Cause of high school sports but even since I’ve been living with him he’s given himself two concussion just be being fucked up and falling. He just does malicious shit like if someone is having sex he’ll put the speaker towards their room and play like Old Town Road or some things that’s annoying to have sex to as oppose to the regular edm he plays. And dude just always plays rocket league with some friend who’s come over while blasting edm music. So obviously I don’t want to just sit around watching them play video games so I’m just in my room watching shows and stuff. They’ve stopped recently but they always give me shit for being in my room and it’s like yeah I don’t want to just sit in on the couch watching other people play video games or watch some dumb shit (like we all like to watch the really popular movies but obviously we’ve already seen those a bunch. Just idk man different tastes in movies and shows. This dude actually tried to convince me to watch uncle Drew and tried to give me shit for it when I said that I know that movie was going to be awful (it’s a pg 13 Pepsi’s add made into a 1.5 hour movie). Also don’t really like this guys friends.

Neither of them ever make jokes and overall just aren’t fun to talk to. Basically my roommates and the friends I’ve met through them are my only collage friends (I couldn’t join a fraternity (my schools a bit frat school) because bad grades freshman year and I just haven’t met anyone outside of that really). I have high school friends back home (that I see every break) that are awesome. Nice, funny people that are just fun to be around and I feel like a better person hanging out with them. Where as my roommates just suck, I get a negative vibe from them and I feel like a worse person hanging when I hang out with them.",11Apr2019,1
433,"TL;DR at the end. 

So I have an academic mentor but she’s also a therapist, though it isn’t her job to give me therapy in this setting. She just helps with my anxiety around academic work. 

Heather (fake name) has mentored me since last September and we’ve gotten really close. She’s really helped me through some tough times and has been my cheerleader through it all, supporting me through a journey to give my abusive mother some distance and going through a cognitive diagnosis. She has been outright in saying that she really cares for me and I feel like she’s the mum I always wanted (though she would hate that, she’s adamant her age puts her in more of an older sister category 😂).

She has supported my healthy relationship with my SO and given great advice on personal matters and basically just is really lovely. 

So the advice. I’m breaking up from uni soon and will have my last session with her but hopefully will see her again in the new academic year. But I want to do something nice for her to thank her for being so great. 

I don’t know what is a good and meaningful gift, but not too much y’know? Please give me gift ideas! I like crafts and things so anything like that is good too!

434,Okay so basically this is a fictional scenario. I go and ask a girl on a date on Saturday but she replies that she can't because she has plans on that day. What should i do next?

435,I need to give some context to this question. So recently I've had this thing with a girl since January but she doesn't want to start an actual relationship because she's moving an 2 hours away to a new college. I'm fine with this but recently after she told me this she just completely changed how she was acting around me and kinda ghosted me. I got the hint but it's so hard for me to stop thinking about her. I'm anxious all the time even though I know how she feels and it's really fucking me up. She said she still wants to be friends and stuff and I want to spend time with her. But I also really need to focus on myself and improving myself and I have been finding that really hard to do lately when all I can do is think about her.,11Apr2019,1
436,"I literally dont know anymore. I dont know if what im processing can be considered love, or if its not. It feels empty and like my bodys just ""this person!!! Love them!"" But my concious self is just taking the backseat. I never feel emotionally attached, and i barely feel confident

Is this normal? Am i just overthinking it?

I never seem to genuinely love someone. Its like im trying to fit in and its an automatic response to appear 'normal'.

Even other emotions like sadness sometimes come as these weird facade of emotions. I feel like its not even consciously done. I look around and see what i should be feeling, then i feel that way.

437,"I am considering making a big change in my life in regards to my profession.

\[background\]

I have a degree in K-12 Education, specifically Physical Education &amp; Health. I haven't stayed in one state long enough to gain professional licensure (varies 3-5 years depending on the state) and am currently in my third state teaching.

My teaching jobs up until now have consisted of being an Instructional Assistant, a Long-Term Sub for the same department, and now long term sub in a new district/state.

Before moving this last time I was offered a position in the district that I loved, and it came with other ideal situations such as a varsity coaching position. However due to a job offer my spouse received we decided it was best to move and allow him to take this opportunity because it would allow us both to have a better life together (It really has be monumentally better).

However, because of this move I had to get relicensed in a new state, which took 6 months and made it more challenging to find a full time permanent position, hence the long term sub position again. 

This process has allowed me a lot of time to think about my career path and life, and realizing that I love teaching, but the environment I was teaching in prior was part of why I loved it so much and I have not found that here. I also worry that I only have so much time to find what I'm looking for so that I can build my time in one place.

&amp;#x200B;

During this process an opportunity has come up to completely change my career path. It would allow me to have a better salary,more opportunity to grow, more time with my spouse, better benefits, etc. My only concern is that I will regret not following  my passion.

my apologies for shitty formatting as I'm on mobile. 

So this summer, I (21f) will be going to see a concert down in Kansas, (We are coming in from Canada) with my very close friends, (21f) (20m) (20m) and as well as my brother (15) 

We originally planned a 5 day stay strictly to Kansas and back, but have now decided to extend the trip by 2 weeks so we can visit some people in California and just make the most out of the time we were all able to take off to get together. 
I was all for my brother coming with us to Kansas, but now that we decided to extend the trip and go further I'm just spooked and feeling uneasy about it and I cant really pinpoint why. I couldnt live with myself if anything happened to him, or any of my friends for that matter. On top of his age barrier and not really being able to do some things, and trying to include him in anything we can. 
My friends are very okay with him coming, my parents have warmed up to the idea of him coming for a longer duration as well. 
should I still bring him along with us? I would also appreciate if someone could recommend places to stay away from, and some things we would all be able to enjoy and do. Will be going from Kansas all the way to San Fransisco. 

Thank you guys!",11Apr2019,2
440,"Basically he’s(27M) a good friend at my(27F) work, I was telling him about a date I had on the Friday last week and usually we talk about these things. I only really talk to him about my personal life as I’ve known him for 3 years and we’ve developed a good friendship. 

He over heard me talking to my manager about the date I had that day. Bearing in mind I’m now on a team with women so it’s fun having these convos and I told her. 

He messaged me saying he’s no longer my friend and bye. I didn’t know what he was talking about and left it. The following Monday I seen him and said hi, he ignored me and carried on walking. I left him to it thinking he didn’t hear me. 

There was a fire alarm and I seen him, I waved and said I didn’t think he’d be in the office and thought he was away. He completely ignored me and my peer said that was so rude. So I knew something was up, I messaged asking if everything was okay. No response. 

Now I’m not begging for a friendship but I know the value of the people in my life and therefore will make an effort to keep communication open to them, I messaged him the next day asking for lunch. Nothing. 

I went to see him and it took 20 mins of me asking what his problem was, he said that he doesn’t keep friendships with people who say that they only trust people with certain things and then go talking to other people about the same thing. He also said that it makes him think what else do I talk about with them? I said I can talk about my life to whom I feel comfortable with, if you don’t trust me with your information then what value do you have in me as a friend. I said if that’s how he feels about something that’s my business and said Idk if I can be friends with him. 

Sorry it’s long but yeah. I’ve added a SC of what he said to me after that convo.

445,"I'm worried about going homeless, because I drive so much for work. I honestly think that my brother wants to kick me out to live with his girlfriend, and she literally drove me to tears one night (it was because she goes way into detail so fast that I can't really keep up with her, and that she doesn't really listen to me I feel like). I want to work at this one very popular retail job, live in Arizona and be with my parents, but I feel like they aren't very responsible either, as they had a child that grown up and is rejected by the family except for my father who refuses to let go. I honestly believe that I am going to be homeless, if I don't decide what I want to do right now. But the truth is I really want to live on my own, except that the living expense in Washington state is going really high. I was always under the impression that if living expenses are high here, so are the job wages? Right? So they kind of cancel each other out, right? Meaning, if I DO work at this one job, then my housing will match the wages I make at this one company, and vice versa.

I want to go to school, and make a steady income at the same time. I believe my parents and brother are suffering because of my indecision. My friends don't do anything besides play video games, work, and live with their parents. The ones that are there for me it seems, are the ones not going to school. I work fast food at the moment and I also believe it's driving me insane, really. I've been working here for about 2 years, and I drive like 60 miles everyday. See? This isn't working out for me obviously, but I continue to do it without regard for my future. I have no idea why I continue like this, but it's like I just believe that if I continue then everything will work out in the end. Like Dory's song from Finding Nemo; Just Keep Swimming. Except that this has gone too far.

I'm travelling so much because my parents moved out. They were closer to work and school. Ever since then I had the option of moving out with them, but decided I should get away from the craziness and move in with my brother whom had a room set up for me. I don't want to be homeless, and I especially don't want to fail this class, either. I'm so far away from graduation. I'm 21 years old, male, and I am scared.

448,"TL;DR: Struggling to find a sustainable diet that doesn't leave me constantly craving sweet things or left feeling hungry all the time and hoping someone has some tips on how to start?

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, I (22F) don't know if this is the right sub for this, but here it goes. I've been struggling with my weight for a long time. I was never heavily overweight, maybe like 5 kg (11 pounds) above what would be 'normal', not skinny but a pretty healthy weight.

Over the past years it's really started to bother me. I feel like I can't go swimming, or even outside if its really warm and I have to wear really short things. It's just a thing, nagging at the back of my head, all day every day. Added to that I've been through several long phases of depression over the past two or three years, where I never really found the motivation to work out or do anything for myself, really.

Right now, mentally I feel a lot better than I have in ages, which mostly has to do with having met new people and my wonderful boyfriend, and I've finally subscribed to a gym in my close vicinity. I've met with a trainer where I do cardio and weights for about an hour every two days or so, I try to go more often but I get sore really quickly and don't want to strain my body too much in the beginning.

My main problem is the eating. Naturally if I work out I'm going to be hungry afterwards, but since I've started to work out I feel like I'm constantly starving. I've tried to mealprerp and count calories, did Intermittent Fasting and all that jazz, I've tried a lot of things but none of it really feels sustainable. I always get the craziest urges for something sweet, as soon as in the mornings for breakfast. If I, for example, have an Omelette for breakfast instead of a sweet cereal or bread with some sugary spread, then I feel just plain horrible. And I know it sounds stupid but this has honestly been such a challenge for me, always and I just simply can't get myself to just eat a banana for the sweet part and feel 'satisfied'. I know that it's all a habit, but I feel lost on where to start and I feel like if I only were to get my eating under control somehow, this journey would only be half as difficult.

Yes, I'm planning to lose more than 5kg in the future, but for now I simply want a way to start this journey. Has anyone been in a similar situation and has any tips on how to get my eating right without starving myself or obsessing over everything I eat?",11Apr2019,1

When she is drunk she often goes on shopping sprees online, stays up so late aying games that she will pass out in her chair, and uses Facebook as a combination diary and platform for sympathy. She refuses in-person help and does not want to seek treatment for her substance or internet abuse because she was a psychologist for 30+ years and believes she does not have a problem.

The pattern of using facebook to vent frustrations is many years long and while she usually doesn't actively hurt anyone with her behavior, she is absolutely hurting her own situation.

458,"So...

As the title says shes mad at me and honestly I dont fully understand why.

Here's the story.

I am a happy guy. I like making people happy. If I can make everyone smile once a day I'd do anything to make that happen.

Well a girl who I had a crush on in high school(I'm 30 now so that was a long time ago) has been talking to me lately(she is very married, very religious and she smokes weed so much snoop dog is proud of her... cant stand that much use of it. I cannot iterate how much of, this ain't ever gonna happen anything between us) because of her depression. Thinking she is not worth anything to anyone really.

So yesterday I spend all day trying to just get her out of that mood and happy again through texting. To include telling her about my new toy that I use to mess with people(14 inch incredibly veiny gag dildo). To include sending a pic of it in my pants like I have a huge hard on(i did not undress in anyway). Anyway in her sadness the conversation shifts to i would never want her. So i ensure anyone would want her and shes an awesome person and if we had ended up we would have been very happy together.

Well after that she feels better. Well later that evening I go out for a smoke and my gf checks my phone and sees this and confronts me, angrily saying she is my second choice since this other girl is who I really want. Conversation continues where I assert she is the only one for me. Now it just feels like a stand off with no real decisions made.

She means the world to me. I lately think I must be in a Disney movie because of how I feel about her. Everything about me wants to fight for her but i dont know how.

Someone help please.",11Apr2019,1

462,"Long story short, I am transferring to a new apartment within the same apartment complex due to chronic noise issues (our neighbor is disabled -- possibly with something like Tourette's -- she is functional but frequently goes on disturbing tirades, and we can hear every word she says). After discussing several options, such as sound-proofing her apartment and transferring, the front-office agreed to a transfer.

463,"Hey Reddit! Thanks for taking the time to try to help me out. I’m really at a loss and feeling so incredibly stressed out right now.

So, I am with an incredible man (27m). We are super happy and have been together about 3 years. He has a good friend, this girl who we’ll call Sarah. They’ve been friends for years and years. I had absolutely zero problem with this friendship because I think it’s great for everyone to have both male and female friends! No threat, no problems at all.

Now, Sarah did have a huge crush on my man when they first met, over 10 years ago. She professed her love for him many years ago, before he met me, and he made it very clear to her that he had zero feelings for her. Their friendship suffered for a bit but then it bounced back after she promised him she was totally over him. They continued their friendship. (Side note: they have NEVER been together in any sense of the word. Never flirted, kissed, cuddled, had sex, nothing whatsoever).

Then I entered the picture. I really liked Sarah at first and told her how glad I was that she was in his life, and now mine. That lasted about a year. I saw issues under the surface for a while but I kept telling myself that she was just struggling to adjust to being involved in his life less now that a lot of his time is being filled by me. So I ignored it until I couldn’t anymore.

She started by being possessive and weird about how well she knows him and insinuating she knows what’s best for him, including trivial things like the length of his hair. It was irritating, but I still let the stuff go at first and kept it to myself because it really didn’t bother me that much. Then she started being rude to me at work (yes, we work together, which makes everything so much worse), started openly showing jealousy about trips my SO and I were going on, and starting to talk about me to other coworkers in the way of that I was jealous of her friendship with my man and keeping him from her. Which was zero percent true.

To make this even clearer, I host friend get togethers a lot. I always included her, would invite her to outings, to my birthday celebration, etc. So for her to say I was trying to keep her from my man is simply not true.

So then my SO’s family came into town. For whatever reason, she felt extremely offended that she wasn’t invited out with us?? And then I sent a Snapchat (to everyone) of our time out with them and she told everyone (mutual friends and coworkers of mine, including my boss) that I had sent that to make her mad. I absolutely did not. I sent it to everyone and had no clue she was even mad about not getting an invite at that time. Because why would I think she felt that entitled to my SO’s family time??

She sent an email to my SO venting frustrations like the family thing along with MANY points that were simply not true. We went back and forth with her for a few emails before calling a truce. That’s what we all decided. To just move on and start fresh. And my SO and I upheld our end.

She did not. She continued to lie multiple times about things that simply didn’t happen. She said my SO and I fight about her because I don’t want her included in things. Has never once happened. My SO and I agree about her being out of line and truly have never fought about it. We’re united in this. So that was a direct lie. Then she told people that I don’t like her touching my SO (hugs). Again, not true at all. 

She’s just creating issues to have issues. She’s completely assassinated my character to the majority of my coworkers and all three of my bosses. This is negatively affecting my life. So all three of us talked it out a couple of days ago. My SO and I got a chance to call her out on her lies and make her answer for them. My SO told her that if they hadn’t known each other for so long, he’d just cut her out and that he still will if she does this again. It was wonderful and therapeutic. Again, we gave her one more chance to knock this shit off and still be a part of my SO’s life.

So I just found out today many more things she’s completely fabricated to multiple people and I feel really angry all over again. Especially because it was like pulling teeth for her to admit she had been lying and having issues with me. To know she sat there and played dumb about why my SO and I were angry with her, while knowing she’s been telling everyone that I am jealous of her friendship with my SO, that I am keeping him from her, that I fight with him about her, that I am mean to her, blah blah, blah, is infuriating. So I think I’m going to have a hard time letting this go. I don’t even know if I should let it go?

This is where I need advice. I can’t just fully cut her from my life because I work with her. I want to tell coworkers/my bosses that she has been lying, but I don’t think I should because it will only further the drama. And as my mom has always said, you can’t change what people hear about you, you can only prove them wrong with your actions, and the people that really matter will know the truth. She’s right, but it doesn’t make it any less painful and humiliating to know that people think I’m this jealous psycho jerk, when I’m really a pretty docile and nice person.

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. I’ve spent a lot of time stressed out about this and it makes me really angry that this person has made it her personal mission to ruin my reputation, all while playing the innocent victim and acting like she’s done nothing wrong at all. I feel like I’m dealing with a petty high school mean girl or something.

Thanks!",11Apr2019,1
464,"My girlfriend broke up with me on Monday, and i've been extremely fucked up because of it. We both talked for months about how much we loved each other, and how deep and special our connection was. She then went to the Philippines with her family for three weeks, and over that course of time she lost interest, seemingly understandable to me because she was so far away for a long period of time. When she came back I went to visit her, and when we hung out, all the feelings that I was losing came back instantly, but they didn't with her right away. I texted her on Tuesday saying that she should take a few days to think about everything, and if that is truly her final decision, then I would come by and drop off anything I have of hers, but if she changes her mind, I'm going to be waiting with open arms.

&amp;#x200B;

465,"So I have a guy friend, i considered him my best friend and I know so does he. We ended up uh ""fooling around"" the first semester of college. I was in a bad place and tbh I could've ended up with just about any person I happened to be hanging out with that day. I felt like I just needed closeness with somebody and to put the focus on someone else.

Of course, I regretted it and we both agreed to never bring this up. I was almost disgusted with myself, still am, because he confessed feelings for me midway and to be completely honest, I am just straight up not attracted to him. I just told myself to not think about it and continue life as usual.

But now, whenever I hang out with him he always tries to turn it into a sexual thing. He says shit that suggests getting together again. He touches me, winks at me, tries to get me to confess any kinks i might have. It makes me fkn uncomfortable and I told a mutual friend that I was done hanging out with him solo. What also is really starting to piss me off is that he's SUCH a crybaby. He doesn't care to ask what any one of us is going through, yet always expects to be given attention for being a ""sad boi"" He purposely kills the mood by all of a sudden going dead silent and sighing and shrugging his shoulders. If I tell him about any accomplishments I've had, he just says Okay and moves on to a subject about him. 

Its hard deciding this because we both consider each other to be one of our best friends but its getting hard to be around him and I know he gets lonely. A friend ditching him has also happened in the past and I can't help but feel guilt because i know what that feels like. 

I'm thinking maybe just not answering him for a while and see how I feel in the future.",11Apr2019,2
466,"Thanks in advice for anyone reading!

SO! I'm currently about to finish up my undergraduate career in college, and as such, have been looking for some internships to pass the time before I head out to graduate school. A very close friend of mine (we'll call her Jane) showed me the Disney College Program, and some other professional internships that Disney also hosts in their parks. Jane had applied to a specialized chemistry professional internship, but she insisted that I apply to engineering based ones alongside the general program. (I'm a chemistry major, but I have lots of engineering research experience). When I applied for everything she showed me (including the chemistry one) she was upset because she was worried that ""I would be better for the role"", negating her ability to be considered for the position. Jane is an insanely talented and experienced student. I knew without a doubt she'd get the position, but some self-esteem on her end thought that I would be considered over her. At her wish, I ignored the emails about the chemistry PI and followed through with the general DCP.

I applied and got accepted for the general program, and Jane continued her process for the chemistry internship. However, shortly before the deadline for the chemistry PI, the recruiter followed up with me asking if I was still interested. I exchanged several emails with her about the situation I was in, and with the recruiters advice and comments, I followed through and applied for the chemistry internship without Jane knowing.

Fast forward a month and another wave of interviews, Jane was IMMEDIATELY accepted into the position, just like I imagined. I assumed since I wasn't initially contacted that I was no longer considered for the PI and continued preparing for the DCP general program.

About an hour ago, I got an email from the chemistry PI recruiter asking if they could call me about the ""next steps"" for the internship. (This is the email Jane was sent right before they gave her the position). 

I'm really struggling what to do right now. Jane, when we hang out, sometimes will invalidate her nomination to the position because ""if I applied she wouldn't have gotten it"". Since I assumed I was not going to get this internship, I had planned on showing her my denial to prove to her how wonderfully talented she is, and that she doesn't give herself enough credit for the successes she's had in college. This internship is a considerable upgrade to the DCP and I would love to work there alongside my best friend, but I don't know how Jane will react if I tell her that I applied for the position behind her back.  

So my question throughout all this - since I did this behind her back, should I deny the position and stick with the DCP? Or accept it and tell her that I still applied when she didn't want me to? I'd still have the advantage that they accepted her WAY before they even considered me, but I care about Jane way too much for an internship to put us on thin ice.

Thank y'all so much, I really appreciate it. :)",11Apr2019,1

471,"Hi Reddit, I coach multiple soccer teams. I am close to all my players and I feel like each team is it’s own little family. One of the teams that I coach is a U15 boy’s travel team. Since it is a travel team, it is technically volunteer work and is run through the town. Our goalkeeper is passionate, he carries his gloves everywhere! I saw him at our county fair and he had them in his bag, he even put them on and clapped them together while talking to me. However, he is part of a poor family. I have been coaching him for more than 2 years now and I am very friendly with his parents (who are very young) and they’ve expressed the difficulties of even just having to buy new soccer cleats because he is still growing. Well... this goalkeeper recently had his keeper gloves destroyed. When I asked how they got ruined, he lied to me and made up an elaborate story involving him misplacing them and them getting run over. I suspect he was being made fun of or being bullied and it was an act against him. (He is Puerto Rican in a very white neighborhood, and I’ve seen him and heard about him being bullied before for his skin color.) These gloves were his personal gloves, and for those that don’t know, goalkeeper gloves are a pretty penny. 

I’ll cut to the short of it- I want to buy him new gloves. Soccer is clearly an outlet for him and he loves to play goalkeeper, and he would always keep the gloves on him. I don’t think that just letting him use the towns gloves during practices is enough. (Yes we have gloves they are raggedy, old and gross.) However, I want to avoid a few things. 

1. Him getting them in front of the team. 

2. Possibly embarrassing his parents from a financial view point.

3. Getting in trouble with the town.

My plan to avoid these things is already set in place. I emailed the town club’s president about wanting to do this and I haven’t heard back yet, so if it is a no then that’s fine I’ll understand. I plan on confronting the parents, if it is a yes, having bought the gloves already. Just give a quick heart to heart as to why I got the gloves for him and if it’s okay, I’ll explain I have the receipt and can return them if they don’t want to accept them. And then either give them to the parents on the spot or at the end of a practice one day.

My big questions are, am I crossing a line doing this as a coach? Am I going about this the right way with the parents? Should I reevaluate/ are there things I’m overlooking?",11Apr2019,2
472,"If you read my previous post in this subreddit, you’ll probably know what I’m talking about.

Tldr for those who haven’t read my last post or just want a catch up, my now ex coworker(we’ll call him Dave) lost his job for some trouble he had in the law involving underage sex with a teenage girl who lied about her age. Dave wouldn’t hurt a soul, especially not intentionally and is one of the most enthusiastic employees I ever worked with.

My mother (our manager) has took his side all the way and become close friends very quickly. Because of how close he and my mum have got and the fact that Dave has been harmlessly flirting with my other co workers (Stef) who also happens to be my friend outside of work, Dave’s psycho ex girlfriend (Lily) and her friends have been non stop harassing everyone she or they could find on Facebook.

I woke up the other day to find a long paragraph sent to me on Facebook Messenger from one of Lily’s friends obviously directed at my mother, accusing her of sleeping with Dave, that he has a family and how horrible it would be if Lily were to find out.

I later found out that she had sent that same message to my cousin, my sister, Stef, both of Stef’s parents, Stef’s cousin and about half of my mother’s friends on her profile. I message her friend back, explaining that I want no part of what’s going on in her drama and that if she was wise, she would carry on or else she could land herself in a lot of serious legal trouble. She argues back, giving me information that I already know, stuff about Dave’s sentence and I tell her it isn’t what I’m arguing about. I’m telling her that Lily is accusing my mother of sleeping with Dave which isn’t true and that what’s she’s doing is slander and harassment based on a lot of assumptions with no evidence.

She all of a sudden apologies, saying she didn’t know it wasn’t true and was only doing it for my mother’s sake. This confused me in a number of levels. I felt like it probably wouldn’t get me anywhere if I argued further, so I just left her with another message telling her if she had any sense at all, she would stop harassing people who aren’t involved.

We have also found out that Lily knows everything that Dave has sent and received to everyone on his WhatsApp which leads to believe of a hacking or at least a breach of privacy to my mother, Stef and whoever else Dave has spoken with.

Stef’s parents have called the police and not to my surprise, they’re saying they can’t do anything for reasons unknown to me.

I’m able to go to college because I’m in my university’s honors and I have my tuition paid for, and both are dependent on GPA.

This semester I’ve fucked up bad. About halfway through, I had some mental health problems (mainly with anxiety and depression) where I struggled going to class and had to see a new therapist. 

My grades are shit. 

In one class I have a 100 in every assignment, but have missed 6 classes; the limit you could miss is 4. I can now absolutely not finish with an A.

In another, we have a participation grade that I’m certainly going to fail, I’ve missed two quizzes, and I have a C average on the exams. I’m certainly not getting an A or B in this. 

In another, I have a 96% test average and 92% quiz average, but attendance is 45% of our grade and I’m again likely to have a B as my final grade. 

Three of my five classes are going to be C or B, and that takes my GPA both out of honors and my tuition. 

I am not saying that these things are anyone’s fault but my own. I know I should have gone to class, and that these issues are the result of **my** failings. 

I’m not asking for a way to fix my grades, because I know I can’t. 

I’m asking how I can calm down, how I can not feel like the world has ended, and how I can not hate myself.

482,"**Me**

I'm a 33 year old guy, not married, no kids, no mortgage. I sold my home to break free of having a mortgage because it didn't make sense to me to have one. I make a little over 70k/yr in a job I hate, and I have 6 figures in the bank. 

I'm really into landscape photography and I've always wanted to buy a van and travel across Canada and the USA to explore and take photos for awhile. Such a big thing isn't realistic for a lot of people due to circumstances (married, kids, locked into a job, mortgage ect.) but for me it seems like I could actually do this. I don't give a shit about my job and it's a total dead end. I'm only here because i'm making decent money and it's the most i've ever made at any job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never known what I wanted to do for a living, it's always been something that's gotten me down and depressed in my life. I have a degree in business and considered going back for my MBA. I feel like i'm gambling if I go back to school only to land another job I might hate. I do love photography and it's very easy to say 'do that full time if you love it' but I also need to make enough to live and the landscape photography world isn't exactly raining cash on people. As technology progresses the advancements made in smartphone cameras are getting better every day and the industry of photography is shrinking since everyone is a 'photographer' now as soon as they pull out their phone.

My parents are both very successful and hardworking people. I love them both and I always want to make them happy. They aren't the type who would support my desire to quit my job, buy a van and travel around the country for a year or so. Part of me feels like they might think differently of me or view my decision as completely careless and stupid. For whatever reason their approval has always meant a lot to me. It almost feels like seeking their approval is the thing that's lead me down the wrong path in life. That job I mentioned above? it's in the industry my parents work in, that's how I gained the experience and got where I am. Otherwise i'd never be doing what i'm doing.

1. We’ve been renting a place for almost 2 years. Landlord is my bf’s dad. When we first moved in he brought up the option to rent to own the place and we said we wanted to settle in before we decided. No problems. We pay on time, he lets us have animals and a garden. Generally lets us do anything with the place as long as it’s not damaging to the property (obv). I have chickens, a horse, a cow, cats, an outdoor fish “pond” with some koi and misc little fish. I love what my boyfriend and I have started, however my bf has been reluctant to go with rent to own because the house has some issues. So far about every six months my boyfriends dad has thrown down some money and helped us fix up the place. We haven’t paid for any of that, but we have helped repair as necessary. New pump and pump house. Insulating the attic, etc. Point is I feel like we’ve had s very good tenant/landlord relationship while also maintaining good family ties. We see this dad and step mom often and they love us and we love them. 
So now comes the problem. The other day his dad was up at our place and we were hanging out chatting like usual. He let slip that they were thinking about selling THEIR house to my bf’s step brother and his fiancé and moving back into the house we are living in.  Everything got kind of quiet and he kind of back peddled and was like “but it might be 5-10 years down the line. A lot can happen in ten years” and he kind of tried to laugh it off. I wanted the just start riddling him with questions but I was waiting for my boyfriend to say something first and he just kind of like “wow. I’m surprised (step brother) would want to move back here” and then his dad changed the subject and the moment was gone. I hVent seen his dad since. My bf did message is dad asking if he’d sell us another property that he owns, and he sent back “I sold most of that chunk to your aunt so all that’s there is .25 acres” then he said something about how we shouldn’t worry because a lot can change in 10 years. 

2. I went to a team meeting with my entire department and our manager. Our manager told us our department was receiving cuts and that one of three things was going to happen. A) worst case one or two of us could lose our job. B) one or two of us could retire early. Or C) we could defund our summer program for youth for a couple years and wait to see if we can get more money for it in the future. The summer program costs over 100,000 so if we cut it there’d be money to pay our winter salaries. The kicker is it isn’t our choice. The head council gets to decide what happens. Our manager will be there to help decide and will advocate for us, but she’s only one vote in a room full of people. This effects me in multiple ways. My job is only through the school year. In March I had been in my position for one full year. In March they also asked me if I wanted to take a summer position as assistant director of the summer youth program. I was so excited about this so of course I accepted immediately. So, no matter what the consensus is after the meeting, I will be effected. Best case scenario I will have to go on unemployment in the summer or look for other work. Worst case scenario is I might get cut if someone doesn’t take an early retirement. I feel I’m at risk because I am the second newest member of the team. I know they all value me, I know that they think I do good work, but I’m afraid those with more seniority will be prioritized if we do have to cut our staff. After the meeting I asked my manager how soon we will know and she said it will probably be a few weeks before council meets again. They cancelled the last two discussions and haven’t yet rescheduled. I asked her what she felt might happen and she said that if they cut the summer program she was willing to put a good word in for me in another department that operates in the summer, which I thought was reassuring. She said she couldn’t say much else about it because it all depends on how the council meeting goes. 

So I’m pretty damn stressed right now to say the least. I know I will be okay no matter what but the unknown is frightening. I feel like In the course of two days my entire future is at stake. Even if it’s not immediate it’s still scary. The job thing is however much more frightening than the house thing. I could use some advice for ways I can accept the changes that are coming and for ways I can stop feeling trampled in life. I keep thinking if the worst. Like having to find a new place to rent where I can keep all my critters. Or looking into my first huge loan to buy property. I keep thinking in two weeks the worst will happen and the cuts at my job will leave me finishing out the year with no career afterwards. Having to change my life plan. I love my job so much. I love what I do. I’m lucky to do what I do and I don’t want to lose it.",11Apr2019,1

 I, for some reason, feel weirdly uncomfortable with homosexuality. Of  course, I don't say anything about this to anyone, because it makes me  sound like a complete dick. Both of my parents are perfectly fine with  people being gay, and they are not homophobic or anything, so I don't  know why I'm like this. My problem is that I think I might be gay.  I'm  not even a teenager yet, so I have no clue about my sexuality. If I do  turn out to be gay, I don't want to have to come out to my family. I  know they wouldn't have a problem with it, but I would feel out of place  and they would likely take special measures to ensure my happiness or  something. It sounds nice, but I would hate to be an 'icon' or whatever,  or be called 'brave' for doing literally nothing (not saying that gay  people are, but I feel like my parents would probably try and treat me  better than they normally would so they could try and prove something to  themselves). If I wouldn't feel comfortable with myself, how would  anyone else?",11Apr2019,1
491,"**Me**

I'm a 33 year old guy, not married, no kids, no mortgage. I sold my home to break free of having a mortgage because it didn't make sense to me to have one. I make a little over 70k/yr in a job I hate, and I have 6 figures in the bank. 

I'm really into landscape photography and I've always wanted to buy a van and travel across Canada and the USA to explore and take photos for awhile. Such a big thing isn't realistic for a lot of people due to circumstances (married, kids, locked into a job, mortgage ect.) but for me it seems like I could actually do this. I don't give a shit about my job and it's a total dead end. I'm only here because i'm making decent money and it's the most i've ever made at any job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never known what I wanted to do for a living, it's always been something that's gotten me down and depressed in my life. I have a degree in business and considered going back for my MBA. I feel like i'm gambling if I go back to school only to land another job I might hate. I do love photography and it's very easy to say 'do that full time if you love it' but I also need to make enough to live and the landscape photography world isn't exactly raining cash on people. As technology progresses the advancements made in smartphone cameras are getting better every day and the industry of photography is shrinking since everyone is a 'photographer' now as soon as they pull out their phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So whats holding me back?**  
My parents are both very successful and hardworking people. I love them both and I always want to make them happy. They aren't the type who would support my desire to quit my job, buy a van and travel around the country for a year or so. Part of me feels like they might think differently of me or view my decision as completely careless and stupid. For whatever reason their approval has always meant a lot to me. It almost feels like seeking their approval is the thing that's lead me down the wrong path in life. That job I mentioned above? it's in the industry my parents work in, that's how I gained the experience and got where I am. Otherwise i'd never be doing what i'm doing.

492,"So me and the person I like are really good friends and we do a lot of projects together. (I’m in middle school btw) And so the other people we were sitting with were saying things like, “You guys should date.” And, “You two would make a cute couple.” I thought she liked someone else but I also felt like she was dropping small hints that she liked me too. And she said that we weren’t dating a lot during them saying those things but I just kept saying no over and over to the people we were sitting with. And at one point they asked, “If she asked you out what would you say?”(they weren’t being annoying on purpose) And I said that I would say no. After all I was acting impulsively. After that she and I were kind of silent the rest of class. So what should I have done and what can I do to fix it?

493,"Not all of the time by any means, but a few times a week she'll bring her phone out when we're in the middle of watching a show that was paused briefly for another reason, or sometimes when we're in a conversation, and she'll set it down and not say anything about the show or the conversation. So I'll ask half the time and the other half I'll let it go as if the conversation didn't exist or as if the show was planned to be paused for a few minutes randomly. When I ask, I've gotten to the point where I'm upset every time because she has explained to me that she understands why it's a problem and that she believes it's inconsiderate too and promised that she won't do it again multiple times by now. She's the type of person to get upset when this stuff happens to her too. But the half of the time that I ask and try to solve the issue by going deep enough to point out that promising to not bring the phone out last time, she either shuts down completely and says she needs to go lay down (which I give her slack on because she has ptsd nightmares at random and I don't ask which days she does or doesn't so she can move on from them faster) or comes back at me with a confident response that she understands why it was a problem and that she won't do it again because of it being inconsiderate. I just don't understand what's at the heart of causing this issue because we've had the deep conversation 2 or 3 times now and there's literally nothing more I can do than try to have it again or to not let it bother me. And if this is something I'm just being sensitive about and is a non-issue for most people, please let me know because if the problem is just that I need to lighten up then I can try that.",11Apr2019,1
494,"NOTE :  delete if this is considered 'medical advice' 

So I saw this therapist for 3 months and in that short time he help me so much I no longer needed to see him semi weekly. While I was seeing him I quit using marijuana for financial purposes and when I said this he said ""good. Marijuana doesnt help. . "" (that's paraphrased) and it seemed liked every time I had an appointment he brought that back up on how i should stay clean. 

Now I understand it's probably easier to do his job with a sober person rather than someone high but I never go to the meetings high so it shouldnt matter that much. Now I'm having thoughts that i need to go back for a bit but dont want to because I started smoking now I'm financially able to. This alone is keeping me from going. He should be professional and respect my wishes of not talking about it right? I'd rather not change therapists but will if needed.

501,"Hello Reddit,

I have this male roommate who can be a bit creepy and I am not sure if it just his anxiety and depression that makes him this way. I myself am a female and just want to be sure I haven't gotten myself in a bad situation. 

A bit of what is going on:

I know this roommate from work. I haven't worked with him more than a year, but enough people at work enjoy him so I thought it would be a good thing to have him as a roommate since I was struggling to find someone else. Anyway, before we moved into our apartment I told him I wasn't able to move in right away since there was a polar vortex and currently living an hour from this apartment. He offered me to sleep in his bed and him stay on the couch for two weeks before I could get moved in. I told him I didn't want to do that since it was awkward and weird to do for two week. He started getting angry with me and yelling about how I was being too stubborn and he didn't understand why I was being stubborn. I kept having to say no over and over. The next day I told my mom since this fight happened at work, and she was upset that he sounded clingy and possessive. I ended up messaging him telling him that I thought he was being just that and that we are becoming roommates to help each other out with a living situation, we are not dating, nor will we ever. He blamed his constant anger about it being his depression. He said he wouldn't do it again. 

A little after this, before I moved in, I noticed he followed me or added me on all of my social media sites. The first one I noticed was his twitter, I checked the page and he hasn't tweeted for 6 years, nor had he liked anything currently. I blocked him on there since it was weird that he hasn't used the app in 6 years, yet felt the need to follow me? I am slowly trying to remove him from all of my social media except facebook. More on that later. 

Next thing: He always tries to cook for me and get into all of my interests. He doesn't cook and leave things for me, he tries to see when both of us are home so he can cook for ""us"". It's always food like chicken or steak, which is odd since that stuff is expensive. With my interests, I am a movie lover. I have a slight obsession with silent films and have a decent collection. Well this roommate wants to watch every single one in my collection-with me. Not borrowing them to watch on his own, but he wants nights where he cooks for me and we watch one of my movies. 

So the final example I will leave on this post to keep it from being a novel. We had a fight the other day which led him to wake me up the next morning and slam the apartment door waking me up a 5th time that morning. He avoided me for three days after that until he came to me when I was getting ready the other morning. He started the conversation with this,"" I went for a walk the other day, saw a goose and wanted to send you a pic of it on snapchat, but you weren't listed as one of my friends. Then I tried to post the picture on your facebook, then went back to look at who liked it and it was gone, why was that?"" I told him that I took him off snapchat along with other people because I didn't want the app any longer, ad the facebook thing, I didn't tell him this, but I hid the post o my timeline because he tries posting on it all the time. I basically had to justify my actions to him, when I feel I shouldn't have to because I am trying to have an acquaintance relationship with him as my roommate. He also tries inviting me to do everything with him, and said he does that since he doesn't have friends, but I see him everyday at work socializing and has friends there. 

Does this seem weird to anyone? I would love advice or comments on this.

503,"I currently live and work in Grande Prairie, AB as a nurse. I’ve been finding myself increasingly disheartened living in Grande Prairie for quite a few reasons. 

First and foremost, it is rather isolated, with a 4.5 hour drive to Edmonton and an 8 hour drive to Calgary. 

Population here is very transient - people move here primarily to find work, especially in the oilfield. This creates an environment where people prioritize money and work above all else. Success here, to many, is defined as buying big houses, cars, trailers, boats, making a lot of money, ect. This has never been a priority to me. 

The political climate here is overwhelmingly Conservative, seemingly disagreeing with everything that doesn’t support a cis, rich white male’s agenda. There even was an anti-immigration protest not far from where I live not long ago. This saddened and disappointed me greatly, as I am in a very loving relationship with someone who just happens to be an immigrant.

I will say, I have the luxury of living comfortably on a little less than a full-time wage while supporting myself in university. There are a plethora of jobs in the healthcare field here - something I realize may be more limited in Surrey or even Vancouver due to increased demand and competition. 

I have heard that the crime rate, gang activity and drug use in Surrey is on the higher side, something that does concern me. I am also very concerned about the extremely high cost of living compared to my projected income if I do decide to move to Surrey. Not to mention, it would be difficult to live away from my family. 

I don’t know. I’ve lived in northern Alberta all my life. Yet the older I get, the more disenchanted I feel, especially as I explore more of this world. I’ve come to find out that the world is SO much bigger than the small bubble I’ve known all my life. I’ve always dreamed of living somewhere near the ocean, a more temperate and humid climate, greener scenery. I dream of living somewhere with more likeminded people, richer in culture, history and arts. Lately, I’ve been feeling a strong push towards Vancouver area. I have family in Surrey, and there is a decent sprinkling of healthcare jobs there at the moment. I also like the small-town feel of Surrey while staying close to metro Vancouver. Every time I visit, I feel at home, I feel as though I’m right where I belong. 

Inside, I know what I really want to do is move to Surrey. Yet I don’t want to make a rash decision. It is important for me to weigh my options carefully and make the most informed decision possible. I welcome any and all input. 

TL;DR - should I move from northwestern Alberta to Surrey, BC?",11Apr2019,1
504,"I have been working as a contractor doing software support for the last few months. After finding out there is not a guaranteed of being hired on full time, I started looking into other potential positions. I cam across a part time position that seemed interesting, and considered doing it while still working here. After the interview they gave me a great offer, but I'm hesitant to accept it because it would be way less hours and I may not be able to work both.

My current job is Monday-Friday 40 hours of week, no benifits. The rate is 16 an hour.

The job offer I received is rotating shifts, 25-35 hours a week, at 24 an hour plus benifits/bonuses. This is also completely work from home. This sounds amazing, however is it a bad idea to take a part time position as my one and only job?

505,"This is a slew of questions, wrapped in one bundle, so I'm sorry if the flair isn't accurate. 

So, I have been working full-time at a hotel for 2 years now, 5 days a week, 8 (sometimes 6) hour shifts.      

My paychecks were nice, upwards of $700. I was paying my rent, bills, spending like a rich person (in moderation), it felt like a joy ride.      
Queue some drama between me, and my manager's favorite employee. I didn't really do anything, just jokingly said I could do her (coworker's) job if it meant getting me off the night shift (I had been covering for a couple months because they couldn't find anyone).        
Coworker gets pissed, and starts throwing my name under the bus at every corn she could.       
I didn't really say anything to her, I just said I'd be willing to work her shift if it meant getting off night audit (had been covering overnight shifts for a couple months, because no one wanted the job).      
When they finally hired an night auditor, I come back to my preferred shift, 3-11. Its the hours I wanted, the time frame I wanted, it's what I asked/applied for.      
I like it, its what I am most comfortable with.     
However, I was cut. I work 3 days a week, at 6 hour shifts with very few 8 hour shifts mixed in.      
I find from another coworker it was because of the coworker I listed above, who was making my manager think I was a bad employee.     
When I approached my manager, she basically told me she couldn't give me my hours unless I work 2 days of maintenance a week, because she needs a second maintenance person.      

I'm not a maintenance savvy guy, let alone she doesn't think I need the training, and just wants to throw me on the shift unprepared.        
That aside, its also a morning shift, a shift I explicitly asked to never work when I was hired.     
I'm not a morning person, I have a really bad sleep problem (probably insomnia). If I have to wake up at 7am, but am awake until 1am, and have to work 8 hours, my work would be poor, and I don't like to do poor work.        

Anyway, vent over, I can either trudge along and make ends meet. Working pay-check to pay-check, I can quit this job and find another (there isn't many options around my area), or I can work a second job.      

My apartment is tied to this job, so I'd also need tp find an apartment. But I don't want to sign a year lease, as in august I was hoping to move states.         

I'm so confused, and new to this. This is literally my second job, and my job before this was so much better, but the location got shut down after 6 months of me working there.       

Any advice would be helpful.",11Apr2019,1

511,"I was groomed from the age of 18 by my boss who was 50. I only got the job as I had been a customer from the age of 15 and he knew me as a regular. I was isolated, sickly and had low confidence. This man would buy me gifts, take me to see movies and compliment me constantly. He became obsessive over me and told me my family hated me. He became my world in a way. All this happend whilst he was married, which I didn't know about. After a couple of years I snapped out of it when he began threatening suicide after I found out he had been doing the same thing to other girls, all of us with mental health issues and isolated in some way. I managed to escape from this by leaving my job and blocking all contact, as well as telling my family what had been going on and explaining my behaviour towards them. My jobs head office banned me from the company after I told them what had happend, they said I consented to it all and he was a valuable member of staff whereas I wasn't. 

Long story short i have gone through therapy and know that his behaviour is wrong but no one believes me, he is a 'nice guy'. I recently found a blog run by him which is full of erotic fiction. Most of the stories are about him taking young girls shopping or for picnics which end up in sex. The latest two which were posted this week are about him stalking a woman and raping her in a lift... the other is about him sneaking into a girls room whilst she is asleep and again raping her. I am really concerned and don't know what to do. If I send it to anyone they will think I am causing trouble. Should I send it anonymously to someone or post it somewhere?

I went to a party on Monday night, and probably got more drunk than I should have (which is not an excuse for my actions, I know). As I was waiting for my Uber to leave, a guy I had chatted with during the party kissed me. It was so fast and I don’t even quite remember how it happened, but I think he grabbed my arm and pulled me into him. I immediately felt so guilty. As soon as I got in the Uber I started crying. 

I knew I needed to tell her, and I knew it was going to be a long and emotional FaceTime call. I also had a 5 page paper due on Wednesday. I knew I had to finish the paper before I called her, so that’s what I did.

I called her and I and told her everything exactly how it happened. I explained how immediately guilty I felt and how sorry I was. She was quiet for a while, then said she needed time to think. She hung up and then called me a few hours later.

This FaceTime call was more emotional, I think we both cried for almost the whole thing. She’s hurt and angry but most of all, she doesn’t have any trust in me anymore. I know this makes sense, but I had hoped my willingness to tell her to work past it would’ve been worth something. Almost all of my friends told me to not tell her what happened. But I knew I needed to. Our communication has always been strong and even through our tougher times with the distance, we’re always able to work to fix it together. We concluded that we both still love each other, and we’re willing to work past this (even after all of her friends told her to break up with me). 

I woke up this morning however to a text that read “hey, i hope you have a good week. i still need some time to think and heal. it was so easy to fall back into your arms last night. but im not sure if thats whats best for me OP.” But now we’ve still been texting somewhat normally, mostly still airing out our concerns.

She keeps flipping between wanting space, and texting me because she misses me. It sucks. I know that if we try to work on things it will take a long time, but I’m willing to do that. She keeps telling me that she doesn’t imagine how I could possibly gain her trust again. I’m not sure either. 

I know I need to give her space, but that’s hard for the both of us; we love each other too much. I come home in a week and hopefully then we’re able to talk things out more effectively in person. I love her so much, and I don’t want to lose her.

I didn’t meant to hurt her, but I know i did. I’m not sure where to go from here, how I can prove to her that I won’t hurt her again? How can I gain her trust back? Will it ever be the same? Did I fuck up my whole life?


TL;DR- I was drunk at a party and some guy kissed me. I told my girlfriend to be transparent, and we don’t know how to proceed. We’ve agreed it’s a mistake, but her lack in trust of me makes me nervous for the future. What can I do to fix it?",11Apr2019,0

518,"So, 'bout a month ago this guy from my school randomly texted me in the evening. Turns out he was really drunk, and in the mood for confessing his love for me. I've never ONCE talked to him, so he kinda caught my interest haha. I ended up giving him my snap once he was sober, out of curiosity. He tried to make a bit of small talk, but pretty soon broke the conversation off by asking ""streaks?"" :)) I thought he must've lost interest once he turned sober.

Flash forward 3 weeks to our school-trip to the Czech Republic. He texts me randomly \*again\* and we start talking casually for a bit. Whenever we passed each other at the hotel he would greet me and initiate small-talk. I started to kinda like him! ..But I also noticed that he's quite shy.. He'd promised me to show me his Norwegian language skills, but seemed too shy to initiate the conversation to keep that promise. Instead I initiated the conversation, and he was obviously still too shy to do it. He then promised (by text) he'd do it Monday instead (we would be back in our country by then). It never happened... I saw him multiple times that day, but he never showed signs of wanting to open a conversation. As gen-Z of course we keep our streak :)) and I attempted to make a bit of conversation over snapchat, but it didn't really work. Now he hardly sends back streaks? At least he's inconsistent with replies, which he definitely wasn't before.

So did he lose interest? Or maybe he's still shy? Any clue what goes on in a 17-year old guy's head? The first time I thought he'd lost interest, he was (evidently) just embarrassed about his drunken texting. Could this be the same sort of situation?

TL;DR He drunk-texted me and showed clear signs of interest, but now after a slightly embarrassing incident, he seems indifferent... Is he shy or did he lose interest?",11Apr2019,1
519,"There’s this girl that I’ve known her for 5 years. Throughout all of those five years we’ve always been on the line between dating and being friends. Let’s call her Jane. She’s so perfect. She’s got blonde hair, she’s beautiful, and she’s got a nice body. She never gets offended when I joke around with her and she laughs at everything I say, no matter how stupid the joke is. Last year, I started talking to another girl (who we’ll call Janet), and blah blah blah me and Janet dated for about six months and had sex during. Even when I was dating dating Janet. I knew I loved Jane more, and I told Jane constantly. This really confused her. I know I sound like a shitty person for saying that I loved somebody while in a relationship with somebody else. But I was stuck in a relationship with the wrong person. And then Jane found out Janet and I had sex. This broke her. She had to convince herself to get over me, she avoided me, blew me off, she ghosted me and I knew exactly what she was doing and why. I broke up with Janet and went away to another city for a week or so, just to breathe and figure myself out. And that was when me and Jane started talking again, when I got back, we hung out and eventually it lead to us kissing. I hadn’t felt that way for anybody, and she told me she felt the same way afterwards. We were in love but neither of us would say it, neither of us would ask each other out. One day when we were hanging out we ended up making out again and she said, “there’s no feelings in this right?” And that crushed me. I thought there was feelings. And so I was forced to say no or it would be weird I thought. It was only months after that she would tell me that she had feelings for me when she asked that question. I still love her, and I don’t know if she’s just pushing me away again. She told me she won’t date me because she doesn’t want to have to get over me again. She dated another guy after our summer fling. They dated and broke up about four times. And she says she still feels for him, but she still says that I was different. She doesn’t want to touch, cuddle or kiss because she knows she’ll instantly feel that way she did so long ago for me. She doesn’t wanna feel that way again. Or so she says. I don’t know if it’s time for me to move on or not. I just want to make her feel that way again. I want her to be mine, I just want to adore her and hold her. But the more I try the more I disappoint myself. And I don’t know if she’s doing this to me on purpose, but I talked to her about it and she said she didn’t want me getting attached to the idea of her being mine. I finally manned up and asked her if she didn’t want ME getting attached to the idea, or if SHE didn’t want HERSELF getting attached to the idea. And she left me on read. I know that that spark is still there somewhere, but recently it feels like it’s only being fueled by one side. Is it time I just let it die? Do I just do what she did to me and see what she does?

524,"So, to make a long story very short: I chose the wrong study abroad program. I'm pretty regretful of my choice, and I would much rather favor the alternative. The problem is that it's past the application deadline, making it impossible to switch without coordinator approval.  


I've already asked my coordinator twice, and she's said no. I am confused because I know that study abroad programs are usually flexible at the home university level since abroad universities have later deadlines. In this case, my university abroad's deadline to apply is June 1st. So, I believe there's time but my coordinator isn't budging. The first time I asked, I asked generally. The second time I asked, I said I'd like to switch for financial reasons (which is true). She still said no. I don't know if I actually say a very serious reason, she would finally let me switch.  


Of course, I would probably have to lie a little, which I know isn't a great idea but I'm getting desperate. I want to say that I have medical concerns and that I have family living near my desired program, able to provide me with support. Or I can just say I have family there and I need their support while abroad. I could also play up the financial reason and say my family is going through a really tough financial time with only one working parent (which is true). I could say that the coursework wouldn't meet all my requirements (which is true). I don't know, I feel like I need a really good reason and my real reason, which is scheduling conflicts, isn't that great. I want to switch because my desired program has a really intense, inflexible schedule. I'm not sure if I should just tell her the truth. Please do not judge me, I know it's not right to lie, but I'm just not sure what to do.  


Also, I am not sure how to even ask her again. Should I just swallow my pride and try one final time? I'm pretty embarrassed that I'm bothering her like this but I don't want to always wonder what would've happened if I just asked. I am planning on meeting with her in person, so, should I just straight up ask her or should I just present my issues to her. I was planning on giving her all the reasons I wanted to initially make the switch but not directly asking her again. Should I just ask her again or go with my plan?

Not to sound like a raging feminist, but I was elated when Kate What's-her-face created the algorithm for capturing the picture of the black hole. I thought, ""Wow!

That was just kind of a blow to me. I see a woman who could be a staple name in astronomy aaaaaaand actually, no, she didn't do nearly as much as everyone claims.

I'm also disgusted by how far women are taking feminism. I feel like the feminazis paint all women as entitled, weak, overly emotional bitches and I'm starting to believe it. MGTOW certainly doesn't help, either since they label women as subhuman.

I feel disgusting due to being a woman. I have to keep myself from crying when buying bras because I feel like I'm showing off my boobs by purchasing undergarments in public.

The other nail in the coffin is that they drug test and I know I will test positive for marijuana. Do I just pass on the offer? If I were to accept a job there is also the possibility I won't be able to take the final class in the fall and thus won't graduate for a while, maybe up to 2 years even, depending on how long I am at this entry level position with this respective company.

If I do accept the job and manage to pass the drug test will they verify if I have a degree? Do places really do that? My last concern is if I were to fail the test would they no longer let me use them as an internship experience reference for jobs later down the road. The test is a urine test.

We snuck out as planned but after like 30 minutes we saw the lights turn on in her house. My girlfriend ran home. Her older brother and aunt were sitting at the kitchen table waiting for her.

I would appreciate opinions on this. I am originally from South America but getting married in Ireland and I don't know how people dress in wedding here, but in South America unless the wedding invite specifically says wear white then you should not. Not sure if I am over reacting myself.

Yes, I know. The title is clickbaity, but that's how you get the clicks amirite.

Jokes aside, I do really struggle to find motivation to do anything, like work towards my future, work towards my goals/wishes, work towards anything, really. I just can't see myself doing any of that. Sometimes I get bursts of motivation to work on something, and then I do it for a little white until that motivation runs out again (for example learning programming, C#). Basically my life revolves around motivation. Without it, I can't get anything done.

I have no real life friends, nor family besides my mom, dad, and brother. And I have 2 online friends from which one of them is slowly fading away from my life (again). The other one is... just a friend? I don't really know what a real friend is.

Anyway, here in the Netherlands you're only allowed to quit school if you're at the age of 18 or have a 'start qualification' (startkwalificatie). I'm currently 17 and a half, and you probably guessed it right, I'm going to drop out. I'm planning on doing a home course, Game Developer to be exact. Reason for the home course instead of going to a school is because I hate social environments. Everyone is so different from me, I just don't feel comfortable at all. Also, no schools here at the moment provide the Game Developer course, but it's also not available online so idk, I might do programming then. Either way, I'm afraid my lack of motivation will hurt me in being able to finish the course, heck, even get started with it.

All I do in my everyday life, ever since I got first PC which was like 6 years ago, is sit at my desk all day, play games, watch YouTube and Twitch, and that's it. Pathetic, I know. Personally, I'm perfectly fine with how I'm currently living, although I know it's terrible for my health, I'm fine with it. I'll probably die earlier than expected because of it, but whatever. And knowing that you need money to pay rent and the bills, means I need a job, and because I'm anti-social person, I'd like an online job, meaning I'll need some certification to show I'm capable to do a certain online job, which I don't have. And getting a regular job will be a big no thank you from me.

I think life is just not for me, I'm definitely being super negative here, but that's just the way I see it. Personally I wouldn't mind not waking up tomorrow morning, but for the sake of my mom and dad I force myself to keep on going, even if there's no end goal in sight, just walking through a thick fog not knowing where I'll end up...

Sorry for the messy post. I though I should just let out what's on my mind and what's bothering me. Also apologies for the messy English, I'm not a native English speaker, but I try my best!

551,"Soo, long story short, i met a girl last week and we really hit it off so i asked for her number and we exchanged. 
However, this past week has been a shitshow for me and i am yet to have texted her. I know, it literally takes less than a minute to send a message, and i already feel like shit for that considering how well we got along, but, well, i don’t know why i didn’t.

552,"hi guys,

i am really very panicky at the moment.

where I live you interview to get into uni. me and an acquaintance interviewed for the same school and his was before mine. 

Him: do u want to know what's on it?

I don't know why I said yes, but for some reason I did, I honestly don't know why as others offered the same information and I said no.

he then told me a couple of the questions that were on the interview. however, I suspected he may have been lying to throw me off and so didnt prepare any of those questions and didn't write them down or anything.

but when I got to the interview I realised he had been telling the truth and the questions were the same.

I got an offer from the uni and i can't shake off the thought that i've cheated? I honestly don't know what to do as I'd like to accept the offer but can't stand the idea that i didn't get in on my own merit. i also can't help imagining a scenario in which he tells everyone he told me the questions and i end up kicked out. please help!",11Apr2019,0
553,"Hi,

I am really sad and alone. I do not feel like eating anything. I cant sleep, even If I manage to get sleep after 1 pm and I wake up in morning at 4-5 and cry thinking about all the problems I am surrounded by. It is affecting my help.

My problem is my 5 years old failed relationship. I left my parents in my home country to start my life with parents. My parents were very happy supportive. But when I cam to foreign land , everything changed.  

He loves me, but I always feel he is so casual and really dont care. 

1) He went to meet some friends and relatives and did not call/text me for complete 2 days. As he cant text in front of relatives and family and he met his friends after 1 year. This has happened many times in past .He knows this upsets me but still he keep doing such thing.

2) He had a plan to meet to some common couple friends for dinner which he knew since morning and I got know this when he was actually doing dinner. We talked whole day but he did feel it is important to even tell.

3) We are having these fights and about to end relationship but instead of coming and meet me after his long 1 month family trip ,he opted to go to some casual common friend birthday party knowing that I'm not coming as I am depresses ed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am literally alone in this place and these things he keep doing which upsets me. I am clueless that how I will adjust with this casual behavior of him. As per him , he is right and social circle is equally important. I never asked him to leave social circle but do not neglect me. Even a text to me makes me happy if you are busy.",11Apr2019,1
554,"I know graduation is soon. Regardless of that, it doesn't feel nice to have shit thrown at you in the Seniors WhatsApp group for a whole hour. I have never felt more disrespected or hated or even humiliated. I cried all night yesterday while hugging my boyfriend (the only classmate that does not hate me) and almost skipped school today.

Whenever I had previously commented my class hated me to other teachers before, they did not take it seriously. Now I have visual concrete evidence of all of it. But what do I do with it?

Cyberbullying is a crime in my country, but the police probably cares less about this than the sexual assault I reported (committed by a classmate of mine, too) that they never bothered to investigate. I know reporting it will likely lead nowhere, but I hate showing up and staring at their faces and feeling... Just despised. Excluded. Hated.

560,"Okay so I have a lot of questions and I don’t know if I have the time or energy to make multiple posts for them so fuck it I’m putting them all here.
I am (16f) going through a really rough fucking time in my life and really need help
#1 I was molested when I was 3 and raped by a family over an amount of time and I can’t really remember my past because I have a really fucked memory and constantly confuse myself. These two events I know happened and have scarred me very deeply and I’d like to move on.
#2 my dad (step dad but he raised me so he’s my dad) died in 2009 when I was 6. It was very fucking traumatizing and I’d like to move on but it’s been 10 years and I still have panic attacks about it. 
#3 I have suicidal thoughts everyday and I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know what I like or what I dislike. I can’t remember how I look. My perception of time is so fucked up the weekend had gone by and I thought it was still Friday. I’d like to know how I can get over this or through it idk. I’m just scared and confused.
#4 I’m experiencing burn out and it’s annoying because I don’t really care that I don’t want to do school work as passionately as I used to. I just don’t WANT to do ANYTHING anymore and its just ruining everything.
#5 I self harm and have been since I was 12. I have low self esteem and fucking hate myself. I want to stop but it’s been years and I’ve given hope that I can stop.
#6 I have compulsive ??? Or intrusive thoughts that are super violent and abnormal and it’s fucked me up. I have a lot of violent thoughts regarding my family members. Like killing them or abusing them and it’s starting to tear me up. I’ve had these thoughts for years but not this intensely. I love them so much and I don’t want to hurt them but I just keep seeing me hurt them and it’s hurting me. How do I get rid of these thoughts ? How do I cope with them ???
#7 I keep having these emotions ??? Or symptoms that really confuse me. I can’t really remember things like even if they just happened. I can’t look in a mirror because like I said previously I don’t know what the fuck I look like like I can’t remember it’s so fucking odd. and if I do I can’t tell WHAT I am. it’s weird I tried looking it up and it’s like body dysmorphia or something??

Also some background on me:
I was diagnosed with BPD Type 2, depression and severe anxiety. I have agoraphobia and trypophobia. I get triggered fairly easily and I don’t even know my triggers to be honest. I just know that talk of sexual stuff or physical contact makes me lose my shit. My own family members can’t touch me. It’s just really painful. I’ve tried multiple medications like mood stabilizers and anti depressants but I wasn’t consistent with them. I was hospitalized 4 times and it didn’t really do anything for me. I’m in therapy but it only does so much ya know. So yeah id really appreciate it if y’all could give me advice that’d be really nice because I’ve tried talking about this with my family but that didn’t really work out ...hence, I’m asking Reddit.",11Apr2019,1

563,"A little bit of back story. I work in the fashion industry. My stock in trade is identifying up scale street wear and mid teir fashion forward suits for young professionals. We are not talking haute couture here, but looking at ways to adapt new styles into accessible everyday wear. I used to sell suits for a major retailer and have done personal shopping work. I got an email requesting a conference call with the head of our in house design team as well as several of our EVP's one of which has been pushing me to move up the food chain of the corporation for a while now. Long story short they offered me a job as actual buyer, which isn't much diffrent from what I do now. But now instead of research and presenting my ideas I would be the one making the final decisions. The perks are amazing, a ton of travel to beautiful locations. For example I would be required to attend all the various fashion weeks and be spending a large chunk of my time in Italy. 

Here are the problems though, what they need from me runs counter to how I have been laying out my life plan. I am married have a home that is paid off in a place that I love. If I take this job they want me based in New York which would currently triple my living expenses. But they are only offering me 40% more pay. If I stay the course I should be able to retire in about 12 years, that would put me in my early 40s. I gave up a lot of things for years so that I dont have to spend my life as a corporate drone. The job seems fun and exciting but I dont know if it would be worth giving up the freedom of getting out of the rat race young.

564,"I'll keep it brief,

I'm currently a 17 year old, enrolled in a public school system and also employed. For the first semester I was obtaining straight A's and also working 30+ hours a week. It was fine and I thought  I was doing good. I bought myself a computer and clothes with my own money. Until eventually I grew tired of working+ school, it was very stressful to keep up with both. It was mentally exhausting to be constantly working at a burger joint when in reality I don't need that much money so I decided to take a break.  I was focusing only on school and everything was going okay until I was guilt pressured into having to get my job back. (from mom) So now i'm working back at my boring job and struggling to even show up to school. It's been to the point where I only show up once a week to school, because I have no time to do 30h at work+ school and gym. (and not any time for hobbys) I miss coming home from school and not having to worry about anything, just going to bed or doing chore/focusing on my hobbies. During the summer its fine to have a summer job and all, but I can't do both Work and school. I feel as if I keep riding the rails down this wrong path, i'm going to end up with a very bad future. I think i'm going to have to make a choice. I believe the right choice is to side with my education and fix my future before it shatters, and resign from my job.

568,"I've been with this girl for a few months now. She's amazing and honestly it's the best sex of my life. Currently we use condoms, but she told me that she has HSV-1, which is oral herpes. She's on birth control just in case, but she doesn't like condoms and neither do I (or anybody). She's sent me resources on HSV and how contagious it is, and from what I gather the risk is pretty low if there isn't an outbreak. Even though hers is oral herpes, apparently it can be transmitted during sex too and turn into HSV-2, though that might not be accurate. It's a pretty mild STI regardless, thanks to modern medicine. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, she recently told me that she doesn't take any medication for it. This kind of irked me, because I was under the impression that meds can suppress the virus and reduce the risk of passing it. She said that the pills would only reduce how often she has an outbreak, and we wouldn't have sex when she has an outbreak anyway. Bottom line is she wants to raw dog and I don't know if that's wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone comment on how likely she'd be to transmit it to me, and also whether or not she should be taking medication for this on a regular basis? According to her taking meds daily would ""suppress her immune system,"" but I just don't know what to do.",11Apr2019,2

571,"So my grandma lives back in Germany, very far from Canada (where I am). I text her everyday and we regularly keep in contact. Of course texting 2-3 times a day (time zones make it hard) won’t keep her from feeling lonely, so she made friends with pretty questionable people.

She has arthritis in her knee, and recently stopped taking medicine for it. She said one of her friends said that they are unnatural and will do more harm than good. 

Now she’s taking a spoon of honey and a spoon of cinnamon and rubbing it on the parts that hurt. She says it’s working but I know for a fact that it isn’t (my cousins say that she’s always in pain when she walks every time they go to Germany to visit her). 

I’ve been trying to convince her that medicine is fine and that it will help her knee to feel better, she’s just gotten worse, saying her friend gave her an oil to put into her bellybutton. I tried to explain that it won’t do anything, but she says that her friend is a smart woman and doesn’t have any reason to lie about this, I told her that I don’t have any reason to lie either and that I live her very much and do not want her to be hurt.

I find myself thinking of every excuse to break my own boundary that I've put in place. ""They might need my help. Maybe it wont be so bad this time. I've changed so maybe they have""

I feel guilty that I've cut off contact for selfish reasons, when I know deep down there is nothing selfish about it. I still feel guilty. 

I can see so clearly how I've found myself in abusive relationship after abusive relationship, because I basically walk into them subconsciously willingly. Which is shocking to take in to be honest.

578,"I got kicked out of /r/amitheasshole for writing too long of a post. 

TL;DR - There is a disconnect between who I am and who my family thinks I am. I have been contemplating this for over three years and am reaching my limit for it all. I intend to leave home with little notice soon after receiving my Associate's degree, with the intent of letting things cool off for a while and eventually building a much stronger relationship with everyone.

Alright, I want an honest answer so I'm gonna provide some relevant honest information.

My ASL is 18 (soon 19)/M/TX. I live two counties away from Houston. I currently live with my dad and my mom; I don't have siblings. Other than that, there is my grandpa and that's it (my dad's two siblings both died [2010 and 2019] and were unmarried with no kids).

I'm a mixed bag as far as my personality goes. The soundbite description would be that I'm a cross between redneck, stoner, hippie, tech nerd, republican, democrat, mechanic, cowboy, you get the point. I love working with my hands. I'm working on an old Ford Bronco with my dad and will be buying it off of him when we finish it later this year and I sell my car. I love being outside, love the country lifestyle, love weed, love working on computers, love dressing like George Strait, love all kinds of music, love all the right wing stuff, all the left wing stuff, you get the point. I'm a character.

I realize that I go ""against the grain"" of our society because of my blue-collar work ethic, liking of the simple things in life, and not wanting to go to college. Sue me.

This is where things go South.

Overall, I love every single person in my family. Both of my parents are ""good"" people. My dad enjoys his job, nobody fights physically, we're not poor, and we do some cool things as a family. While I never fit the stereotype of the entitled only child, I have been provided with many nice things such as sometimes getting paid for major shit like rewiring the house or working on my dad's car, having my tuition paid for (grandpa struck it rich decades ago, college funds for all three children as well as me), and occasional gifts under $200.

I am attending community college at the cost of $150 a credit hour, taking 12 hours a semester and 6 in the summer. In a little more than a year, I will receive my AA in general studies and have the courses and GPA to transfer to the University of Houston.

This is where it goes south even more so.

You see, I don’t belong in college. Ever since I was 11, I’ve known for multiple reasons that it isn’t for me. I’m glad that my generation is foregoing the idea that everyone needs to go there. Even though the cost isn’t a concern, I have a problem with how much it costs. I would hate spending another 4 years delaying my real adulthood. The jobs I want do not require it. And above all, I’m stupid! I have never got higher than a B- in a math class in K-12, and I coasted through this first year of college. I can’t handle an academic environment, but I have proven that I can hack it in the workforce, especially in “blue-collar” places.

That’s suicide in my family. Grandpa was a professor and a dean. All 3 kids got Master’s or higher. My dad has a JD (law degree). I’m next on the chopping block. Supposed to get a business degree. It was never “do you plan to attend college?,” it’s “where do you plan to attend college?”. When I was 16, after putting off discussion for many months, I snapped and told of my plan to forego it. Darkness enveloped the household and I felt as if I had killed someone. They weren’t having it. I bitched out and played along, saying I would go to community college for 2 years and then transfer. The logic is that even though I was selling out, I could use the two years to get my shit together and GTFO.

This is even truer today. I shouldn’t be at that school, or any college for that matter. It’s not for me, and I know this because I am in it. I don’t want to waste four years of my time and tens of thousands of my family’s money for something I don’t want or need.

The problem is, more problems have been created in the last three years. One, I never “grew up” like American teens are supposed to. I never rebelled when it was actually necessary. I never went out and did stupid shit with my friends until just recently, just smoking pot in the attic at night. That’s my rap sheet. I followed my dad’s advice to buy a “practical” car instead of a Bronco when I was 16.5, and I just finished paying that debt off. I would have been much happier with a Bronco which was more affordable, in addition to being “cool” and being able to pull bitches/have wild parties on the beach.

I also feel stunted in my social development because of the way I was raised. Risk aversion, introversion, and what could effectively be called greed (told I was better than all my peers) were drilled into me as a child. I was always the weirdest a weird kid could be without having a disability. I still haven’t bounced back from that one. In fact, it’s why I had a problem with alcohol last summer. My folks never taught me how to drink responsibly or condoned it in a safe environment, but I also had the “allure of the forbidden fruit” and went off the rails as soon as I bought my first handle. I quit soon after, and found that I really don’t like the stuff.

Weed is one thing I do like, though. I’m not going to get into why and how I use it, but know that I go through about $30 of it in a month. I’m a moderate user. However, that plant has further damaged the relationship I have with my folks. I have to tell lies out of necessity to get away with it, and I feel guilty as hell for doing so. Problem is, over 2 years, those necessary lies have built up layer by layer.

At this point about 20% of things I say are complete bullshit. I’m not lying about just smoking pot. I’m lying about my educational prospects, my political views, and just about anything else that could be met with confrontation or retribution. I even lie about “innocent things” like when I help people with flat tires or bad car batteries (got in trouble one time upon telling my dad about the first time I did it). For fuck’s sake, lying to stay out of trouble is no way to live! Did I mention I’m lying about being a Christian?

The general theme here is that I’m living a double life. I did some work for a man whose son was Bart Whitaker. Bart had his mom and brother killed, and they tried to get his dad as well but failed. It was an insurance job and he is a sociopath. From death row, Bart said something along the lines of “the man I am was not the man they thought I was.” This quote holds true to me. It’s almost like my family sees an idealized version of who I am. Everyone on my mom’s side does it as well.

I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to continue school when I shouldn’t be there. I don’t want to continue telling lies to protect myself. I want better relationships with all of my family, starting with both parents.

So I’m putting an end to it. I’m working nearly full-time and bringing in enough money to get the fuck out when I’m ready. I’ve been paying my own way sans food and “communal” items like house wares for the last year. I will graduate with my Associate’s next year. No point in quitting half-way, and I might find a use for it. I figured I can use the next year to continue getting my ducks in a row (doing well with full time job and money, it’s a start). I’m gonna get accepted to UofH, do everything short of sending the check for my classes. That would be an asshole thing to do. When no one is looking, I’m pulling up in my Bronco with a 7x15’ trailer hooked up and grabbing all my stuff that I legitimately own (all personal items, sans furniture). I’ll have said my goodbyes to my awesome neighbors and other locals. I will stay in the local area for a few months with a trusted friend while I get things ready to head up to Northwest Texas where I belong.

I should mention that there will be a 15+ page letter explaining ALL this stuff and much more (good stuff too) when they return from their outing to a house with an empty room. Basically stating my reasons for going, what I’ve been up to in the recent years, and when we will see each other again.

I intend to never return home, but I fully intend to rebuild these relationships. Build them up from the ground into something much better. I love my family, but I have a life to live.

I truly feel that my life won’t get better until I leave the next. WIBTA for doing so in this manner?

Note - If anyone has questions about the context of all this, ask me and I'll try to answer before you give a ruling for my case.

Thanks, have a good day, and YEE-FUCKIN-HAW!",11Apr2019,2
579,"Everything in my life seems so bleak right now. 
I was homeless in high school and graduated with my own job and apartment. 
I’m the oldest of four to a single mother who has worked under the table wages her whole life. 

I joined the military to get out of poverty and I was discharged (honorably) because it was too expensive to retrain me after I couldn’t make the cut for being an air traffic controller any longer. 

I have a fraction of my military benefits so I go to school in a town with an amazing university and I want so badly to transfer but my grades aren’t looking amazing because I was never really taught how to be good at school, and in addition I have minimal support from my poor family. 

I live with my girlfriend now and have gotten a good construction job but I fear that my lack of money right now (I am only part time until he end of this semester) is creating a divide between us. She is a PhD student and gets a fat paycheck for her research funding. 

My truck broke 7 months ago and I recently was able to fix it but it keeps having small issues and it feels like nothing I do can get me ahead as long as I keep pursuing my dream of attending a university for a bachelors in chemistry , my passion. But even so, I feel so behind the curve compared to peers my age. 

The only escape I have is that I am a Latin and rhythm dance instructor. That was how my girlfriend and I met but now it seems to create more division between us. 

To clarify, we love each other very much but it’s just been hard recently. 

I found out yesterday that my mother now has cancer in her lady parts and is going in for surgery Tuesday but she has no insurance and nobody can cover her medical expenses. 

Everything just looks so bleak and I don’t know how to keep moving forward.",11Apr2019,2
580,"So I am 3 years older than my boyfriend. I'm 22, he's 19. We've been together a while and honestly people usually think he's older than me. As far as my own age, people guess it wrong a lot. I get both ends of the spectrum pretty evenly, most saying I look either 19 or 20 but some saying things like 17 or 26. Anyway today at the store I went into the fitting room, he waited outside with my purse. A woman who had to be in her 30s or 40s says to my boyfriend, ""it sucks shopping with your mom doesnt it."" My boyfriend responds with ""uh..."" Because he's confused. Then i come out of the fitting room and he walks over to me, starts to tell me what happened, but before he can really start the same woman rushes over and touches my shoulder saying, ""oh honey I didn't realize hes with you I didnt even see you, I thought he was with her"" and points to an older woman probably in her 50s nearby. So my question is this, do you think she really thought I was his mom, then realized her mistake and tried to cover it up, or do you think she genuinely thought he was with the older woman who happened to be shopping near us. It makes me feel pretty insecure, but I wanted honest objective feedback from the story I just told.",11Apr2019,1

She has arthritis in her knee, and recently stopped taking medicine for it. She said one of her friends said that they are unnatural and will do more harm than good. 

Now she’s taking a spoon of honey and a spoon of cinnamon and rubbing it on the parts that hurt. She says it’s working but I know for a fact that it isn’t (my cousins say that she’s always in pain when she walks every time they go to Germany to visit her). 

I’ve been trying to convince her that medicine is fine and that it will help her knee to feel better, she’s just gotten worse, saying her friend gave her an oil to put into her bellybutton. I tried to explain that it won’t do anything, but she says that her friend is a smart woman and doesn’t have any reason to lie about this, I told her that I don’t have any reason to lie either and that I live her very much and do not want her to be hurt.

He got a girlfriend for about a year so we obviously weren’t sleeping together. Last summer after they broke up, we had sex and he couldn’t finish.

I keep blaming myself and feel like I’m doing something wrong but he’s finished during sex with me before so i don’t really know what the issue is. Is there anything i should be doing differently?

592,"A little background: I was in a band that I formed with 2 close friends and my brother. We played for a few months and it was great. We were all writing songs that we loved and we had a great tune playing shows. However, my two friends both left the band, one guy wanted to sort his life out and the other moves across the country for missionary stuff. 

Around this time, the boyfriend of a friend of mine hit me up and asked if I would be down to play bass live for his band, which is pretty well established in the local area. Eager for any musical opportunities, I of course said yes. I had one practice with them and it went pretty well.

However shit has been taking a downward turn lately. I’m afraid I’m losing my passion. (I’m hoping that’s not the case). Maybe it’s just because I don’t like their music that much. It’s alright but it’s not my thing. I don’t know the reasoning behind it, but what I do know is that I don’t feel comfortable here. 

I’m supposed to practice with them again tomorrow. I was given a list of 5 songs to have down, and I know 2 of them from the first practice.  I have no idea what the other 3 even sound like. I’ve barely even touched my bass in the past couple of weeks. I really don’t need to be in a band right now as I need to focus on the end of the semester.

I desperately need advice. I'm stressing out to death right now and I'm also confused. 

I have a school project currently going on and the presentations are tomorrow. The presentations are supposed to be about whatever you witnessed during your internship that lasted for 2 days. You had to be an intern at whatever company so you could get a view of how stuff works in a company. 

I have my presentation ready, and I asked my mom to test it. She didn't get it at all. So I'm really worried that people won't get it either.

598,"ok i know that title may alarm you... but let me explain

a bit of background:

im in first year of uni, and he’s in his last. and i met him 3 months ago and i swear to GOD i would marry this guy, and he would marry me TOO. so so sweet, extremely woke, SO good to his mom, caring, not suspicious, beautiful in every way. i would trust him w anything. 

and i just want to make it clear that i DO NOT have love goggles on, im trying very hard to look at this situation very objectively. 

but he broke up w his girlfriend of 4 years very recently (a toxic relationship) and im the first girl he’s slept with other than her. 

we would date, but he’s leaving for the summer, and he may or may not come back to do more school at my university (he’s waiting to hear back from schools).  but if he comes back, we really would want to be together. our feelings are SO strong and pure and i’ve been w a decent amount of people and this is the first guy i’ve felt this way about—that i truly see a life with

the issue is, he’s never experienced hooking up or hook up culture and we’ve talked about this and i know he wants to. we’re exclusive right now, basically until he leaves school, and i really don’t wanna hold him back from having the experience he needs you know?? like if i didn’t hook up with as many guys as i have and i committed to something serious—someone i would marry—it would be on the back of my mind all the time. like what it would be like with other people you know? 

so i know he needs this experience. he’s going on vacation with his friends and i know he needs to sleep and experience things w other people. it’s just so confusing with not knowing if he’ll be back or not....

and i’m in support of this because i know i would want the same if i was in his position. but it makes me SO FUCKING SAD. 

like i look at him and just cry sometimes when i think about him being w other people. he’s so delicate and sweet like a flower and i want him to be all mine. and i know that’s not possible. at least for now....

but alas

we both agree that if you love something, let it go. 

but how do i DEAL with this??????? like i want it to stop making me so damn sad, like right now. it’s so taxing. i know it will probably come with time, and as i sleep with other people, that will also make things easier. 

but right now it’s so hard, for the both of us, because he knows that i’m going to be with other people too. 

SO WERE BOTH LIKE SO SAD IT SUCKS. 

but does anyone have tips?? i’m very emotional, i wear my heart on my sleeve, and he’s the same so it makes me sad too. so i would LOVE some advice:(

604,"Loooooooooooong story short, three of my roommates were friends—or at least, I thought they were. (I kept my distance specifically to avoid the drama to come.) We all lived together for a year. Last week, the leaseholder announces that she wants to move out after a bevy of problems, and one of the other roommates curses her out.

The two of them get into an argument that lasts for days. The third one, who's friends(?) with both of them, kinda-sorta gets involved but decides to move out, what, 48 hours after the argument began because she ""just wants to avoid drama.""

Lucky for her, she was never on the lease—something that has, frankly, come to a surprise to me considering she moved in *last year*. Turns out, the girl that she replaced was still trying to get her name off the lease—yes, for over a year—but the roommates weren't doing what they needed to do to get that process done. And it just so happens that we were *right* about to complete that process when this third roommate moved out to avoid it.

She has not found a replacement. She has not indicated that she intends to pay May rent. The other roommate (the one who cursed out the leaseholder) is her ""best friend,"" and until we find another replacement, she cannot move out, despite being the only one in their dynamic that was actually a part of the argument. She has been making excuses for this third roommate the entire time. If we do not find a replacement by May 1st, we each have to pay *more* in rent, meaning the ""best friend"" literally has to stay longer than she wants to *and* has to pay more in rent for an apartment she does not want to pay for *her* mess.

\[deep breath\]

I managed to find one roommate. I had another, potentially, but she backed out as of today. I have also been trying to keep calm during all this because that's better than turning a two-person argument into a four-person catastrophe—that which could potentially cost us thousands of dollars.

But rest assured, I'm livid! I am viscerally angry as I type this. I literally want to beat this person's ass. And I don't think I can properly articulate how fucked up what this third roommate did to her ""best friend"" because she has already enabled her bullshit up to this point.

Oh, and the leaseholder and second roommate are still not talking. So far, me and the second roommate have been the only ones looking at replacements because I *don't* want to pay more in rent—especially not *right now*, when my finances are gonna look spotty over the next few months—and she wanted to get the fuck out of here already because she feels physically uncomfortable living in our apartment.

I've actually been doing a shocking amount of heavy-lifting here considering I wanted to move out before all this shit happened, and now I can't, not to mention I have my own shit going on.

And I have no idea who to confront here regarding how fucked up this all is or how because emotions are still high and really none of them seem that rational in the first place.

\-I have been very successful in my career I have found more than one company, despite not having any educational background in business. 

\-My academic records are a mess and I didnt score too well for my MBA test (the GRE)

I have applied to a number of MBA programs of various ranks, I am waiting to hear back, however it is possible I might only get into a low ranking program. I am 28 this year.

This friend treated her poorly though with constant mental harassment such as calling her dumb, slutty, or bringing up things she has told us all not to go on about. 

Now I do make fun of her myself, but its over small and silly stuff (we know eachothers limits). Today before we returned to class she and I had... A little ""fun"" and evidence was still on her shirt because we didn't see it.

Our 'friend' then started to email her after class saying stuff such as ""I hope you are happy with your desicion"" and ""I can't get over you"". Note he has already spent a week moping in the corner when he found out we were together.

I know this is getting a bit long but I'd also like to mention how he found out we were dating.

Its been about a week since we started dating and our 'friend' wanted to go off campus with her. I was hesitant because I knew he liked her. They went off and he tried to 'make his move' which my girlfriend rejected quickly. He tells her he won't try anything again because he ""respects me as a person"".

618,"Do not even know how to start with this. I feel that I can no longer cope with the life that I am living and I need it to get advice with how to proceed. This is going to be a long one, but I do not know of a way to make this  shorter. I preemptively want to state that I am not looking for pity and I do not want it to look like I am spoiled kid, who does not want to work. I am really looking for any ideas from objective bystanders on how to deal with life and stress in general.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Student, have a job that I do from home. It has been affecting my mental state to the point that I am getting severe anxiety and my health is getting affected. Want to know if I should do something about it or if I should just suck it up and live with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some general info about myself: 20(m), live in Europe, I am doing my second year in a university at a law faculty. I am also working at a part time job at a claim agency, which is the main reason for my problems right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, this is the job that I thought would be something I'd be doing for a couple of months, but at this point I've been working there for almost 8 months. On the outside it seems great, I work from home, but at the same time I get to chat with my bosses whenever  I need, I get low, but stable pay and most importantly I get practical knowledge in my field. In essence I do everything a qualified lawyer would be doing: communicate with customers, submit claims, write court actions etc. The only thing that I don't deal with is actually going to court. This means that I hold responsibility over decisions that potentially cost tens of thousands of euros in total and hundreds or thousands when it comes to individual clients.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of it being a relatively easy job for a student, it for me has become a constant source of stress and anxiety. That being because I am *de facto* working not 20h a week as it is in my contract, but more like 24/7. Whenever I open my laptop, whenever I hold the phone in my hands i can not get rid of the thoughts that I have an x number of emails to answer TODAY, I have an x number of due dates this week, someone wrote on our facebook page, I have to answer that, if nobody else can, I have to  think of something to post this week on our page, maybe make a new ad in photoshop and so on... And while it is not a job like that at a MC Donald's, or at a call centre with 12 hour shifts (because I've had these), it is not the body getting tired, it's the brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my anxiety levels have been steadily going up and my ability to concentrate on a single task has been going down. At this point most of the time I wake up tired, i pant all the time for no apparent reason, despite being relatively fit and going to the gym regularly. Even the simple task of walking just makes me mentally tired. This whole situation has been going on like this since January, but in March-April it became really bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example yesterday-today: I had a group assignment to submit, the document got approved by all the people in our group at around 11pm and I thought that sure, I'll submit it as soon as I get this email answered. I never ended up submitting it.... My brain just went into complete dementia mode. It was due to pure chance that I remembered about the thing in the morning and thankfully the professor was cool with it. Aside from all that I was literally shaking, feeling anxious and irritated most of the day. Partly because of a client, who needed to get an answer regarding his case, but I had no god damn clue as to what was I supposed to do with him and I feel like I partially messed up with him as well in the end. By the evening all this stress kind of paralysed me, I know I have 5 emails that need to get addressed, but just thinking about it makes me shake. I missed a social event for students at a law firm (you know, networking is important, bla-bla), but just could not bring myself to work or study almost at all today.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why am I not leaving the job today? First of all, it is my only source of income, sure, I still live with my parents, but I do not get anything from them when it comes to money, I have not asked them for monetary help with anything since I was 15 and I do not believe they could give me enough to cover my monthly expenses (which are only around 300-400/ month). Related to that is the fact that I want to go to a summer law school in Germany. It alone will cost me 500-600 eur. Without a job I will not be able to go there. And most importantly I can not leave unless I give notice 45 days prior to resigning. If I served the notice today, I'd be free by the end of may... right as my exams would be ending and as I'd be slowly getting more free time. Now I am not sure if in the summer I'd cope with the constant stress better, or I'd still feel awful, but I know right now that I would be getting 3x more money by the summer, since all the court cases that I am dealing with now would begin to actually give me the bonuses to salary.

&amp;#x200B;

So that brings me to my question: what would you, kind Redditors, do in my stead? Leave the job now? Try to work it out with my bosses? Maybe someone knows of a way to cope with stress? Literally any ideas would help, as I am out of them.",11Apr2019,2
619,"FRAT warning...

I've been aware of it for awhile now but after a taxing day today my wife pointed out in no uncertain terms that it's bringing her down. This is the last thing I want.

For context - I've been living in my wife's country for 11 years. I don't love it here, but I appreciate what I have. I have a good employer and after 4 years of temporary work, I've just been made permanent, which is awesome. We have a nice house and a decent amount of free time.

I also teach tai chi on the side two nights a week.

I'm pretty easy going, and I enjoy a relaxed type of class, but I have a few students who seem to show up just to talk. I'm happy they feel comfortable enough to do that, but it's been happening for awhile now until tonight when I asked why they were coming at all. They don't practice in between classes, they don't practice during class and I've been feeling like I'm wasting my time. And tai chi is the best gift I've ever received, and I enjoy sharing it.

Anyway, I was a bit moody after class and when I told my wife why, she said I'm taking things too personally, that I couldn't know how my students are benefitting from my classes and that she's tired of hearing me complain all the time.

And today she did hear me complain a lot because it was just one of 'those' days where nothing went right.

When I recounted my day for her, all I thought was that the shitty things would make an interesting story but I can see she thinks I was complaining.

So I'm wondering whether I've become trapped a bit and can't see past my own nose. I don't want to be like this, but I suspect it's become a bit of a default mode lately. I don't know if it's the country I'm in. I've been here long enough to understand how people tick, but I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my wife (and moving isn't an option right now). 

Anyone else out there ever find themselves stuck in a pattern like this? How did you get out of it?",11Apr2019,1
620,"I’m confused because I can’t decide if one of my closest friends of like 7/8 years is worth keeping around. There have been many times where she has been so selfish and screwed me over because of it. 

For example my dog was dying of parvo (literally like my son and only family member) and he was hospitalized and I ran out of savings to keep him in hospital. My friend owed me $1000 that she hadn’t started paying back in the 6 months since she owed me. She knew the whole thing was happening and that I was having money problems but didn’t give me a penny back (mind you she has a job no rent and was buying herself stuff all the time) nor did she even check up on me and my dog. I finally really needed it and asked her and she told me she had no money but then a few weeks later booked a vacation to an island. I was so shoooook. 

Years prior to that I had introduced her to one of my other good friends and she used to mock me and make fun of my ideas and tease me to make everyone laugh. It was cruel and evil. 

I addressed both these issues with her but honestly just don’t feel like I got a genuine apology. She acknowledged her wrongdoings and said sorry but similar types of patterns keep repeating. Definitely not on that scale, but her narcissism and selfishness ALWAYS seem to take over even though I am always there for her day and night. I can’t even talk to her about my problems most of the time. Yet if I don’t answer her texts and calls everyday she gets all mad. Usually she just ignores what I’m saying to talk about herself. I love and care for her and she does have good qualities, but it just feels so toxic and I can’t get over those major two events.",11Apr2019,2

622,"So, two weeks ago, my daughter (14, freshman) was in one of her classes with a kid that's known her all year. The kid was eating raw pineapple, and my daughter told her, hey, keep that away from me, I'm allergic. So the girl starts eating it with her hands. And touches every single thing my daughter had on the table. The girl threw pineapple at my daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within a minute or two, my daughter broke out in massive hives all over her arms, even though she went to wash her hands and arms right away. She then spent 45 minutes in the nurses office trying to get the hives and itching under control, white making sure she didn't go into anaphylaxis. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took my daughter grocery shopping once when she was little (more than once obviously but hang on) during summer and she saw a fresh pineapple. I have oral allergies to pineapples so I didn't think much of it when she picked it up.  BIG mistake. It's a good thing I always carry at least benadryl in my purse because she broke out in hives within the first aisle we hit after she put it down. My ex husband still refused to believe she's allergic. Tells her all the time she can eat the strawberries out of the mixed fruit at walmart, that contains pineapples. Luckily, he now FINALLY understands.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is, do I pursue this? My daughter said this other girl has threatened with her raw pineapple since then. I seriously dont even know what the norm is here. This girl has spent the entire year screwing with my daughter to the point that she's failing that class. Throwing stuff at her, kicking her chair, pulling her hair, threatening to cut her hair, etc, etc, etc, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just FED UP! I dont like this kid. My daughter doesn't like this kid. I mean, being told specifically, keep that away from me, I'm allergic, and then the kid throws it at her?! What the fuck kind of shit is that? In what family is that crap okay?!

623,"My last relationship just ended about a week ago and my ex has been dating someone new for almost that entire week. She seems happier with her new girlfriend then she ever was with me, they seen to connect better, and overall it just seems like both of them are a lot better with each other than when she was with me.

My only problem is that by the end of our relationship she probably wasn't thinking about me but she was thinking about this other girl. And I just don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this, like I assumed that should've made me disappointed in myself for not being good enough or like I should be sad because she probably hadn't actually liked me for awhile but i don't really feel either of those things. I'm happy for them but also this weird emotion that I don't really know how to describe.

I mean there is a new person I'm starting to think about but thats because I'm almost over the break up while she got with this girl almost the day after. But at the same time I'm not even sure if I'm completely over her but I do know that I blew my chance.

624,"The job is pretty much performing farm maintenance while an older lady leaves for out of town from time to time. I would be mowing the lawn, cleaning and feeding her horses, and looking after her house pets while keeping stuff clean. It's also a housing for work type of deal so I'd be living near the area as well since the lady stays a pretty good while away from the actual city.

Before going to the interview, I dress how I normally would besides in a business uniform since it's not that fancy of a position. I go to the interview and this time, after multiple fails at getting a job or having any hope at an actual position at one, the lady likes me and considers me. A follow up is in order but I don't think I'll make it. 

I tell my mother all of this and she automatically freaks out. But not in a positive way.

She starts questioning why even wanted the job (working with animals and keeping things in order for someone who can't do it for themselves as much) and how it'll benefit me.

She thinks I'm purely money driven when I'm not. The pay would've been 10 an hour and even though there's a follow up still, I was already excited to start.

But my mom... she has the power to shoot down any dream I have so easily. I love her, but I just wish she'd listen to me. Fully. I felt like crying when she start criticizing me for having so much interest in the position. She forced me to look up other, much shittier job positions in the city. But I can't help feeling like I should stand my ground and continue with my original plan of working for the older lady.

I know that if I did that though, there would be an argument. I never really do well with arguments because of my temper. Things would be thrown or most likely broken. I guess I just wish I could handle things like this much easier.

My mom is extremely hard to open up to and have a simple conversation with. She's quick to strong judgement fueled by ignorance with almost everything I tell her about so...

627,"I’m married. I live in a state with high cost-of-living. We are nearing the end of our lease and have been planning a thousand-mile move, but the only way we can afford it is by using our entire tax return to get down there, and as our security deposit and first month’s rent. This sounds like a nightmare to me. 

Living with parents is not an option, so it’s time for us to figure it out. 

My wife works full time. She is very hirable by any measure and will have no problem finding work no matter where we are. She has years of management experience, as well as a very positive work history (strong tenure at each place of employment, former bosses will give great references). She’s also a licensed esthetician. 

I left my full-time job to start a business (with my wife’s support) last year. We knew we’d struggle, we knew it’d be hard, but I can’t even afford to repair the equipment I need to work. Basically, for me, I feel burnt out on both ends for the effort I’ve put in and little return I’ve gotten and continue to get. I don’t struggle with doing jobs, my quality of work is fantastic, I just struggle getting jobs and putting myself out there and getting little-to-no return has just completely crushed my soul. I tried. 

Now what? I mean, our lease is up in 3 weeks. We’re broke, behind on bills. I’m considering joining the military, but that doesn’t seem like an immediate resolution. Even if I went and talked to a recruiter and said “ship me out ASAP”, that doesn’t resolve our housing situation in 3 weeks. 

I could pick up a job and continue taking business appointments on the side, although this would limit my business hours and be very bad for my business, not that it makes a difference at this point. It also does not resolve our issue in that 3 weeks, we’ll have to be somewhere else. 

I could go balls-to-the-wall with my business, calling every client I’ve ever had as well as getting my face out there, meeting people, networking, and trying to book like crazy, but.. I have been doing that, and it hasn’t been working, which is a major contributing factor as to why I now feel desperate. 

Things aren’t looking good. We’re lucky enough to be able to eat decently most nights. We budget. We don’t spend excessively. We really don’t have anything to spend after our rent and bills, and have been running at a deficit for the last several months. 

We do have one last idea of selling everything we own (couch, TVs, entertainment centers, PC, etc) for another thousand dollars and change, but what the hell does that change? Now we’re just broke, homeless, and have no belongings. 

Am I blind to some options here? What the hell do we do?",11Apr2019,2
628,"Hi all. 
I need advice about something that happened at work today. I work at a gas station and before I start, let me explain this: we have a customer card points system - you get 10 points for every $1 you spend at any gas station that is XYZ, and you need 1000 points to get $1 of savings on your purchase. 

Today, a guy came in and purchased a $200 visa gift card with his points card. I didn’t think much of it, people have bought cards before and it’s totally okay(you can exchange your points for everything but tobacco) , so I put it through. I noticed he had 356 000 points. My dumb ass just thought “wow, that’s a lot of points. How do you even get that many?” 
He asked to see how many points were left, and proceeded to buy $300 worth of more gift cards, all with the points. 

Now, a few hours later... I made the calculations. He would have needed to buy a total of 5 million dollars worth of shit to get that many points organically. 
Which is impossible, so I now know that these points were put onto his card fraudulently, for the purpose of trading it in for the closest thing to money. 

I feel REALLY stupid. I should have stopped after the first card and told him there’s no way these are “real” points. 

I’ve only been working here for a month, a month and a half, and i really don’t want to lose my job over this. 

I know that I probably should bring this up ASAP because not only is someone going around using fake points, there is another cashier in a gas station XYZ putting 5 000 000$ worth of points towards illegal (?) activity. 

How do I bring this up? I’m afraid I just made my store lose $500 and i’m either gonna be charged for it, or fired :(",11Apr2019,1

So loud it scared the shit out of me and my cat, who immediately ran upstairs. It was so loud I thought something or somebody had crashed into our door. 

When I went to look I saw the package on the ground askew. It was clearly not placed in the ground and tossed instead. 

I ran out the door to see the fedex guy jogging away towards his truck. I immediately called my husband and told him about what had just happened. He called FedEx and made the complaint. 

The dispatcher informed my husband that they would be sending the original delivery guy to investigate if anything bad had happened. 

Big surprise here. The guy comes and says that’s he’s there to investigate if he did anything wrong. I told him that yea he threw the package and put a dent in our door. He then told me in a very intimidating tone that he “doesn’t want to create a confrontation” with me. It was at that point I said “everything is fine” and he finally left. 

I immediately told my husband and he tried calling back. When he got threw and realized what he was calling about they dropped the call. He tried calling back several times but the line just said it was unavailable. So I tried calling back and the same thing happened to me. They dropped the call as soon as they realized what I was calling about then the line was only unavailable after that. 

So I decided to tweet at them and I got a response saying they contacted the management and that I should be hearing from them tomorrow. 

I’m afraid nothing will come of this and I feel like I’m out of options. Any advice on what I can do would be appreciated.

will probably be of the Dofoil or Gamarue malware (or one of the other Anti-Virus
vendor aliases, such as: Andromeda, Smoke Loader, Win3/Dofoil,
W32/Zurgop.BK!tr.dldr, Gamarue and many others
This is one of the most dangerous bot networks ever to be discovered, every

erasure, camera capture, or encrypting files and holding them for ransom (for
example the recent Wannacry debacle).
Gamarue is a downloader (also known as smoke loader/dofoil) largely used in
the Andromeda and Avalanche botnets.
Andromeda is a very large scale malware delivery platform, using Gamarue (and
other downloaders) to download malicious software to infected machines. At it's
peak (Nov/Dec 2017) had more than 5 million infected machines.
Avalanche is a large-scale content and management platform also designed for
the delivery of bullet-proof botnets, and used Andromeda to bootstrap.
Avalanche's scale and scope spanned victims from 180 countries, over 800,000
domains in 60+ top-level domains (TLD), more than one million phishing and
spam e-mails, 500,000 infected machines worldwide, and 130TB of captured and

656,"This is going to sound like /r/venting but I've been holding off on reporting this GM because of the sheer confidence she has she won't get in trouble. Skip to the last paragraph if you don't want all the details.

So for starters, she keeps cutting down the number of employees available at any given time so we get swamped when the busy periods start. To make matters worse she insists she be the frying/prep position then goes into her office for hours at a time and refuses to let us prep ingredients without her direct say-so even if a shift manager should be calling those shots during their work hours. She then gets mad at us when we don't have ingredients to make the food. She's begun using a few phrases repeatedly like ""these people think they know more than ***me! HA!***"" and ""good luck getting rid of me, I've been here 30 years!"" During our last ""Team Rally"" where we're supposed to be congratulated on our work since the last one and celebrated with little achievements and stuff handed out she gave a pack of oreos to 1 staff member and said fuck all the rest instead opting to say ""I shouldn't be saying this, *but*..."" and just complained about anything and everything. A lot of it was nonsensical too, she'll gladly contradict herself to get pity points. During the rally, for example, she says all of us not working opening shift don't  know how bad she and 1 other shift manager have it because it's just the two of them starting things in the morning until 9pm and it's only 3 until 11am. I worked mornings, it's not like that. There's 3 of them, usually a manager who wasn't her working as the only manager in the building plus two non-managers. A 4th comes in before 9pm and there were 6 people by 11am when which is when we usually start getting more than 1 order every 8 minutes. Mornings are DEAD. She was actually mad at the rally because we get more people around 6-9pm when it's the busiest.

She also seems to make a habit of telling people things that just aren't true, this is stuff that hasn't changed since I started working a year and a half ago. Like ""hang this up here when you're done using it"" will become ""WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP HANGING THIS UP!??? ASDFHjsafh;adjfs;djnf"" The other day she got fussy I supposedly took too long walking to the food line to make an order after coming from another task. She snached the item out of my hand and said she'd make it faster. She then puts the wrong meat on there and adds sour cream when the customer asked for now. She then yells at me for putting the wrong meat on there. I told her she was the one who made the item. She then says ""well you put sour cream on it when the customer said they didn't want any!!!"" and I had to tell her ***AGAIN*** no, it was she who made the item. I took no part in it. She then grumbles to herself and stomps away to her office. It's ridiculous stuff like this every day she works. I know it's not just me, other staff complain the moment she clocks out without me having to say a word. One manager transfered out and another found another job and told me before they left the GM was the reason. One of our best people left too, again pointing the finger at her. At one point we were severely overstaffed and she refused to let people temporarily transfer in from other branches even though that's what you're supposed to do and other GMs do it all the time. You'd think with her constantly angry that we'd be in last place among our fellow branches of the place in the area but we're SECOND! SECOND!!!


I need advice, what can I do about all this? 30 years is a looooooong time for her to get buddy buddy with the people above her. Is there anything I can do to save my current workplace that doubles as my favorite place to eat from a deranged bitter GM?

However, we dont do it physically, more emotionally, such as getting everything nice they have done and then making the child feel guilty. I also hate my parents alot, they claim to love me but you can feel the lie in their voice. I feel as if they take credit for my accomplishments, as if I'm just a trophy for them to show to everyone to get a higher status. 

One problem in my household is that homosexuality is not tolerated. And as a homosexual i am in deep trouble. I could be disowned, killed, sent away etc. You must be straight. You cant move out until you are married. So if I get into a heterosexual relationship then get married and move out, I'm going to be very unhappy.

660,"I am undertaking an MA in the UK (1 year course, over three semesters).

From December of last year to now I have been dealing with a constant stream of health problems. These have meant that I am massively behind on work and assignments, which has meant that I have also had serious anxiety over catching up. Long story short - I have not been able to catch up. This has, in turn, triggered a snowballing effect for my mental health, and I effectively had a complete breakdown and was further out of action for a few months. 

To be clear, academia is my greatest passion, as well as my chosen future career path. I fully intend to go on and do a PhD. This interruption to my studies firstly damages my ability to do as well in the thing that I love and value, but also potentially damages my future prospects. Beyond that, I actually would like to enjoy my MA: I would love to enjoy it and, quite simply, be present for it. 

I'm stuck with the choice now of sticking it out and extending all of my deadlines until the last possible date available, and trying to get everything done in time, or dropping out now and resuming these two semesters I have missed in January of next year, which would, of course, have financial implications.

Both of these options make me feel greatly anxious. I am also saddened by the thought of not being able to graduate with all my friends (although I know that is not the most important factor to consider). More than anything, however, I just don't want to sit on this all alone, and I really don't know what to do.",11Apr2019,1
661,"My friend and I are both female and in grade 8. We are in different classes, but have the same lunch time together. We aren’t allowed to sit with anyone other than our class, and they take attendance at our tables to make sure everyone is here. The teachers have been pretty flexible, and for the past month or so my friend has been able to sit at my table with me. We would chat, and this was before she got an iPad.

&amp;amp;#x200B; 

There is a secret hallway out of the way in my school, and you technically aren’t allowed in there but my friend and a bunch of people from her class all stay in there for lunch, just playing on their iPads and computers. Breaking rules makes me really anxious, so I always opt to go to the cafeteria. But she would rather play games on her stupid iPad in the hallway then hang out with me. Not to mention, since it’s mostly 8th grade boys who hang out there, it reeks of B.O. Even on the off chance she comes to the lunchroom with me, her and her other friend who has an iPad will just play on them together, while I sit there being completely ignored, except for when she tells me about the game she’s playing.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I was venting to a different friend about her, and he said that my iPad friend had been complaining to him multiple times about me not wanting to break rules and not wanting to stay inside the B.O. hallway and just go on our devices. He told me that the last time she had complained to him was a week ago. I felt really betrayed by this, because we’ve never had a fight, and I’ve done my best to preserve my relationship with her no matter how dissatisfied I am. I’ve never complained about her until today and to learn that she’s been bitching about me for weeks? I don’t know, man.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

She is very opinionated and aggressive and is very rude sometimes, so it’s hard to criticize her or disagree with her at all, so I’m forced to agree with her. She forced us both to break away from a “toxic” person, and she made me say stuff to the person to get me to break away. Me and this person were on ok terms, but she forced me to go away anyways. She also constantly bullies this one short kid for being short and “annoying,” and she always makes sure I say something to insult him. I always feel bad, but I apologized and he said he was ok.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to say anything too direct, because if she knows that the kid she bullies told me that she had been complaining about me, she would beat him up. I want to tell her something, but I dont know how or what, without ruining my relationship with her. Then again, if she wants to just go on her iPad and spend her lunches in the B.O. hallway rather then spend time with her friend, I don’t think I should be around someone who puts stupid arcade games over real people.

664,"Some context: im a 16 yo guy, homeschooled living in the absolute middle of nowhere. Most of my life has been spent online with my small friend group.


    About a month or two ago things with my friends started getting kinda rocky, it seemed like we were agruing every other week, when we would argue, it wasnt a debate that friends would have it was like everyone has to assure you that, no matter what you think about anything, your opinion is somehow incorrect and wrong. This caused me to just realize more flaws with the people i was around, like how i would always try to comfort them with their problems (in the past) but when i brought up my issues, no one wanted to hear it and would rather just play video games. Or how all decisions that i made in my own life were dumb (like me quitting my job due to a toxic environment).

     
      Anyway we had an argument another time, but i was so over the arguing that i just put the guy on mute, later i unmute him to hear him making fun of me about my weight, my appearance, my familys financial position. Even going as far as to tell my other friend things that i told him in confidence, asking him to keep them to himself. This all crushed me, but also showed me how terrible the people i placed myself around were, and i had to break it off with these people.

667,"I have two children, both of which are adopted. One is a toddler whom I adopted shortly after he was born and the other is much older who I just adopted recently. Right after introducing them to each-other, I noticed some awkward tension between them, but I thought that this must be normal; they need time to get to know each other.

However, I have since caught my older daughter physically abusing my toddler multiple times now. She has said that she is going to “eat him one day” and other strange and disturbing comments, but gives no explanation. She seems to be angry most of the time. The adoption center gave me no description of any mental illnesses, and she was perfectly fine at first, but she has quickly turned into a monster around my son.

I try to talk to my daughter and explain that this behavior is never acceptable, but its hard to tell if she’s actually listening. Her behavior has not improved after the constant lectures. My toddler is shy and soft spoken, and won’t speak too much about how his sister is treating him, which is disappointing.

For now, I have them separated on the worse days. Today I have made them not separated from each other because I don’t want them to hate each other.

I just want them to get along.

I got into videogames as my favorite thing in the whole world through podcasts, like The GameStation. eventually it was renamed into the Co-optional podcast.

I have a pretty life debilitating mental illness and that podcast was an escape for me at all times of day. May of last year, the main cast member, TotalBiscuit, died of cancer. 
I cried about this until I couldn't breathe for months. It's nearly been a year and I cry over it daily still. I have clear memories of being younger and my only life goal was to meet him and the others on the podcast. 
I know it seems very silly, but I was suicidal as early as 9 years old and the Co-optional podcast eliminated most of those really dark terrible feelings. 
Anyways, without my security blanket of laughing at his jokes everyday (the podcast was long enough where i can stretch it to last all week, by listening in 20 minute increments), I've been feeling horribly worse. I've read every wikiHow on mourning, and what im going through and all the examples provided are someone you've physically known. 
I have never been so effected by death before, not even my family or my high school bestfriend's death has brought me this much pain. I don't know how I'm supposed to move on. 
It feels like I'm burdening everyone around me because i cannot find it in myself to work my job, go to my college, be in my loving relationship, even clean my room.

So when she called 5 minutes later, I answered, she apologized again for getting the wrong number, and was about to hang up when I said, ""Wait, who is this? I got a call yesterday too..""

Let me go get him."" and put her on hold, then pretended to answer, and said, ""Sorry, that was my brother, this is -insert my name here-"" She was VERY confused by this and even said it was very strange. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT, I just was so under pressure in the moment, and didn't even know what company they were calling for. She told me to go to another room alone, and it turns out it's literally my DREAM to work at this company. It's high profile, and I know from previous research the phone interview is pretty much based on BEHAVIOR. She said it was worrying to her that not only did somebody else answer my phone, but that they sounded just like me and it was very strange. I feel so bad. Nonetheless, she scheduled a phone interview with me tomorrow...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apologize for the confusing tone of the conversation tomorrow during the phone call? Do you think this ruined my chances at getting this job? Should I tell her the truth? I don't even have a brother!!! Why am I so dumb???",11Apr2019,1

It is long and skinny so I was thinking of telling her it’s a laser pointer that I needed for my presentation.

686,"To start, I’m a new to Reddit. I apologize for any mistakes or misunderstandings in advance. This is also a throw away account. Heads up, I kid you not, I am very socially inept when it comes to being more than friends(?)

It started at the beginning of the school semester, and I was pretty happy with my class. (My school doesn’t sort students into classes by grades.) I had a few close friends and soon-to-be good friends in the class. There was this dude, I’ll call him S. I’ve seen him around, but he was never in my home room class. We were assigned at the same table along with two other classmates. It was a good time, and I personally think that S is a cool guy. That is, until he stopped talking to me.

It was sudden and abrupt, and there was no fights or misunderstandings beforehand. All communications were just cut off. It’s quite hard to avoid somebody you’re with most of the day, but he just doesn’t talk to me at all. If he has to talk to me, he’d either ask somebody else to do it or deem it as unnecessary and won’t tell me at all. This went on for about a month or so, and I was starting to get a bit agitated. At first I thought I had intimidated him, but later on I was kind of getting offended. I thought, if he had a problem with me, he should tell me, so maybe we could talk things out.

Suddenly, a few weeks later, my friend started whispering something in my other friend’s ear. Nothing alarming, until they both looked at me. I asked them what it was about, and they said it’s about S and I. I considered all the possibilities. Is he spreading rumors about me? Is he planning a prank? 
I asked, and believe me when I said begged, for the secret. And they said the words I’d least expect. 

“He likes you.” 

Now, I frankly care for all my friends, female or male. And I genuinely value friendship over romance, if that’s what you can call this. I just couldn’t give up friendship over a relationship like this, I felt it just wasn’t right. In the end, all pleasantries aside, I would most likely decline. Something similar to this happened before, but I left the guy hanging.(Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the girl every guy wants to get with.) I didn’t want to sugarcoat the truth or beat around the bush. I just want to serve the truth as fresh as it gets and hope honesty is truly the best policy.

It’s not like I’m unwilling to give S the time he deserves if he needs it, but feedback from him would be great. It was confusing, a guy who avoided you for some time suddenly likes you. Am I overthinking things or am I simply being oblivious?

Any advice, Reddit?",11Apr2019,1
687,"So I just got a job today. Once I told my mom though she was really felt weird about it. I’m 18 for reference and I know she’ll respect my decision, if I decide to go through with it. She also freaks out about a lot of things, so I wanted a third opinion. Its at a privately-owned hair salon that’s bigger than your average beauty salon. They do nails, hair, and just random spa stuff. The general manager did an interview with me today and he was okay-he was in his 40’s-50’s maybe ? And a little weird, but pretty nice. They have other people working there and a lot of them are in their twenties or older and wear a full mask of makeup. So she thought that was weird. So basically, he liked that I can take phone calls (because of prior work experience) and wanted me to work in an office, where I would put in appointments and stuff. Is it normal for private hair salons to hire teens? And if so, would it be “unsafe”?",11Apr2019,2

I asked the guy who sits next to him to ask him what's he's listening to and he taps him on the shoulder and he tells me he is listening to death grips. So I made a note on my phone to go listen to it when I got home so I could get his attention.

689,"Basically, my best friend has been on dating apps for a long time now looking for someone to date. She has been telling me about her various dates for years, and also about the guys who message her that she doesn't like. She apparently has a lot of guys say they would like to go on a date, and then ghost her. There were many times she wanted me to comfort her about her dating life but then would complain when I didn't respond the way she wanted (for example: if I said, ""you'll find someone eventually and it might be better for you if you stay off dating apps for a bit of time"" she would respond, ""that's what everyone says and it's really not helpful""). At this point I don't even know what to say in response to her complaints.

Also, she has a VERY specific type that she is looking for, and is very picky. Sometimes when she does get a date she'll comment that she liked him but there was one little thing wrong with his appearance so she's not sure she wants to pursue the relationship. She puts in her dating profiles exactly what she's looking for, and I guess it's a good thing she knows what she wants, but when guys who don't exactly match that description message her she gets upset about it and acts like they're wasting their time. I get that trying to date and not finding anyone you really like can be a very frustrating thing, but she doesn't compromise and she complains quite often.

tl;dr: My friend is very picky and has trouble in her dating life, and when she complains she doesn't seem to like how I respond. I'm wondering if I should confront her about possibly changing the way she approaches the whole dating situation, and how to say it without being bitchy. Or should I just keep comforting her (I realize that sometimes when people vent they just want someone to listen, and not necessarily a solution)? If any of you have had similar experiences to hers, how would you have wanted someone to comfort you?",11Apr2019,1
690,"Made an account just for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am F in my mid 20s (if it's important for context).

I have always been very playful, mischievous, adventurous, daring and very ""light"" (light feels like a good word for what I want to say here; light as in easy going, relaxed, not being burdened by anything etc). This were my favorite things about me. I was kinda self sufficient in some aspects, I didn't need anyone or ideal conditions to have fun and enjoy life. I just enjoyed life and life was giving me more reasons to enjoy it every day.

I was very liked, people viewed me as a magnetic and interesting person.

&amp;#x200B;

But then a few years ago I had a terrible break up which fucked me up big time, I have been feeling very lonely for a few years now, was very close to an emotional vampire and that made me feel even worse about myself, couple of very close people have ghosted me without reason (one was my best friend of 20 years, the other is a guy that I was friends with for 4 years and then we dated for almost a year), I developed health anxiety and I have lost this...fire, this zest, love for life, this silliness that I so desperately miss. And I haven't really recovered from it yet.  
I have felt quite sad for a while now, I feel so empty and hopeless.

Most of all, I feel very unloved and very lonely. And I guess it became a habit.. and I didn't even notice it until it was in a full blast.

I feel so overwhelmed by everything. I feel like I am missing out on a lot of things simply because I don't have people to go to places with, to do stuff with, I feel close to 0 people in my life right now. 

I swear even my face started looking sad.

I've always had an attraction to women younger than myself, and I know it can be very wrong. I have dreams when I sleep about being in a situation with younger women. I do also get aroused sometimes when I see younger women around. I know this is very wrong and I've always been able to not let it get to me, and I've always been able to ignore this feeling. I haven't thought about it for almost a year now but for some reason now its came back to my mind harder than ever. I have a beautiful girlfriend and she always keeps me satisfied.

694,"I’m doing a cosplay as 2-D from Gorillaz. I ordered a pair of black sclera lenses (the large ones that completely cover the eye) for about $90. I saved up my own money for them. They arrived a few days ago. My mom is telling me that I shouldn’t practice putting them in until the *day before* the convention. Now these lenses are fuckin big. I am going to need *much* longer than one day to practice putting them in and train my eyes to get used to them. 

My mom’s reasoning is that she’s worried one of the contacts will stick together and tear, because it happens to her sometimes when she puts hers in. My mom wears normal, daily disposable soft contacts. Of course they’re more prone to tear. And her contacts are much smaller and thinner than sclera lenses, so of course it would be harder to pull them apart if they got stuck together. I’m not saying it would be impossible to tear the contacts I bought, but my sclera contacts are certainly less likely to tear than her daily disposable soft contacts. The ones I bought are designed to last for 6 months. My mom seems to think that once I touch my contacts, they’ll just rip to shreds immediately. If I only practice with my contacts a day before the convention, there’s no way I’ll be ready to wear them at the convention and I’ll have wasted $90. I’ve never worn sclera lenses before, so I need a good amount of time to practice. I have about a month and a half before the convention.

My mom also won’t let me apply eye drops before I put in the contacts for some reason. I mentioned to her that it’s best to use eye drops before you put in sclera lenses, especially if you’ve never used them before. She then went on about how it’s “dangerous” to put in eye drops before putting in contacts. I’ve never come across a single source that says it’s dangerous to apply eye drops before putting in contacts. Ik you have to use contact safe eyedrops though, and I will be using them. I told her that every single source I have come across, including official optometry websites, has strongly encouraged putting in eye drops before putting in sclera lenses. She laughed and said she knows more because she’s worn contacts for years. I told her that sclera lenses are much different than her daily disposable soft contacts, and she said, “Well if they’re so different than you shouldn’t be putting them in your eyes”. 

I understand the risks of wearing sclera lenses, and I had made an agreement a long time ago with my mom that if the lenses hurt, I would take them out and keep them out. I would rather waste $90 than permanently damage my eyes. But now she’s making rules such as “you can’t try the contacts until a day before the con” and “you can’t put in eyedrops before you put in the contacts”.

How do I approach her about this? If I can’t try on the contacts until a day before the convention, I’ll have wasted $90 because I won’t be ready to wear them. If she doesn’t let me use eyedrops before applying the lenses, I won’t even be able to get them in my eyes and I’ll have wasted $90. I saved up my own money to buy these, and it’s all about to go to waste. Whenever I try to change her mind she gets personally offended and says I just don’t want to take her advice because I “hate her”.",11Apr2019,1
695,"27 YO Male seeking help with a failed relationship with my childhood friend who i've known for almost 15+ years. Please help, it's causing so much stress. This is a long and convoluted post (I know) but I need help.

He knows everything about me. **Everything**. I just went through a period in my life where I decided to make amends with family and a few old friends. Told them all the bad things I had done, how I'd wronged them, all the times I'd lied, how I was hiding an addiction. It was tough, but I did it. And fuck, what a stupid thing to do. Because now I'm vulnerable to people who don't give a shit about me. It's not like any of them reciprocated. And it's killing me.

Recently, my parent died of an illness, and I left my job to be with them before they passed (none of my other family was there unfortunately). I had to beg the evil side of my family for a loan so I could not work for a year and be with my parent who was dying alone (I eventually paid it back thank god). So being back in my hometown that I hated and dealing with some heavy things, I naturally reached out to this friend just to have someone else to lean on (I got picked on a lot growing up so wasn't really close with anyone to begin with). He offered a lot of help during that time, like hanging out, listening to me talk about personal things, helping me move stuff when my parent died, listening to all the fucked up shit that was going on with me at the time (siblings stealing from my dying parent, other parent shit-talking my other dying other parent, me getting hooked on drugs to cope with the stress). He actually offered me a job  a few times, and when I finally sucked up my pride and took him on his offer (I needed the money at the time) he told me I wouldn't like it and reneged. I was really hurt, but I let it slide bc I thought it was benign. Anyway, I eventually got a job on my own and moved to NYC for my dream job. It was perfect. I was away from all the toxicity, but I started to use alcohol to cope with grief and stress. And to make things worse, this friend ended up moving to NY too. So we started to hang out more. But things changed between us. He seemed more aggressive with me at times. When he's drunk he talks about kicking me in the face and gets kinda rowdy and physical. He started asking about my savings etc. He knows there was money inherited (not even that much unfortunately) and I lied and told him I didn't get anything. Bc honestly it's a stupid thing to ask someone. I don't like people who think they are entitled to that information. Money is not a high priority on my mind, but it is for him. He's been like that for a while now, and it's rubbing me the wrong way. I get the feeling that he expects something from me. And so I gave him some very valuable instruments that I used to help me during that tough time (a taylor acoustic guitar, a marshall amp) because he is a musician. but his response to me giving those to him was ""yo let me know when you want them back and ill give them to you""...its so weird that he would react that way.  I keep trying to distance myself from him. Every time I get the courage to get into a new life pattern, he always reaches back out to me. his timing is actually starting to creep me out. He like gets me back into the same pattern as soon as I make a change. And I always respond bc I feel bad for him and think he needs someone (he told me he cuts himself but told me not to tell anyone, also told me about  his alcoholism). I told he can always come to me if he needs to talk. But he says hes fine. I've been open w/ him about my problems and addictions and how I'm in treatment for them. Actually, once, I came clean to him about all this stuff. How some of the things he did upset me, how I've done things that upset him, my addictions, etc. And the way he responded that was by telling me ""you aren't being yourself. your eyes are cock-eyed. what's wrong with you?"" It really hurts me to know that this person would respond to a situation like that. Why??? Oh, also, after I told him my parent died (in front of me), a week later he made a ""parent joke"" to me, which I brushed off at the time. But looking back, him saying that joke says something about where his mind was at. I've been in his place before, and I managed to get help to get on the better side of things. It doesn't seem like he wants to. And it just seems toxic. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get out of this toxic relationship? He keeps offering me things and I'm not gonna fall for his bait anymore (asking me to live with him, asking me if I want another job, asking me if I want his guitar). How do I ignore the texts and phone calls? Do you think I am being an asshole to him at all? Should I get even with this guy or just ignore him?",11Apr2019,1

So she was already grounded for not doing her chores and she was gonna be gone for two weeks because of spring break. So I wasn’t gonna be able to see her for like 3 weeks. We came up with the idea to sneak out at like 11 pm because her family sleeps early. 

We snuck out as planned but after like 30 minutes we saw the lights turn on in her house. My girlfriend ran home. Her older brother and aunt were sitting at the kitchen table waiting for her. They told her that she was going to have to tell her dad this morning (remember this all happened last night). 

So this morning she told her VERY strict dad. Keep in mind that she was already grounded and had been messing up a lot recently with her family. Her dad was already mad. He said that she broke his trust. He also said that he thinks that he’s not gonna let my girlfriend and I see each other anymore. She lost her phone and she’s grounded for longer. We can text on her ipad. But he hasn’t fully decided on any consequences. 

My girlfriend and I don’t go to the same school so I can’t see her there. I’m one of her brothers best friends. And I play on her very strict dads basketball team. 

We both regret our decision and it was the first time anything like this has ever happened. It won’t happen again. We feel like that one decision that we regret shouldn’t stop us from being together. But we understand her dads viewpoint. 

My girlfriend just told her dad that we had sex. He is furious. He thinks she gave her body away. But it was consensual. He said that he never wants us to communicate ever again. He is very christian by the way.

I responded a bit confusedly, and said “okay, so you want the money because you are traveling today and you want to make sure you have cash? And then you’ll pay me back?” He answered yes.

He and I were both in the office today (small workplace, open office environment), and I waited all day for him to pay me back. Nothing. So at the end of the day as I’m saying bye, I bring up to everyone how I’ve lost my wallet (true story) and hopefully I find it when I see everyone next. I mention specifically how I don’t have a debit card so I have no way to pay for things.

He engaged in the entire conversation and we talked at length about my lost wallet and lack of cash, and never once opened his wallet to pay me back. I was trying a passive approach because it’s freaking awkward to have to ask my boss/CEO for cash when he pays my paycheck.

We're clearly much closer friends after, but I honestly started developing feelings for her. We've been talking on a daily basis, she's been acting more open with me, and she's had me meet some of her friends.

703,"Hello!  
I want to share a story which probably isn´t that unique.   


I work in a retail store (3 evenings a week). For me this is just a temporary job while i´m figuring out what to do with my life. I´ve been working here for almost 6 years now.  


The first 4 years I had this one boss which was great. He was doing great overall in the retail business. He wanted results, he cared for his employees. I never pictured myself working in a retail store for such a long time, but I could follow this man everywhere.   


Anyways... He got a better job offer which he took. So last year we got this new boss. And he is terrible. Our store has slowly but steady started sinking. Less customers, less people working here and so on. After 6 months my boss started feeling comfortable in this work environment and that´s kinda when it got worse for me. I´m doing my best every working day I have. I´m completing every task I get and I even work overtime some days(For free).   
But this guy does not show any respect at all. He will yell at me in the store for literally nothing. When i´m visiting the store to shop he will throw some comment at me. For example me saying something like ""I went to the gym earlier today, felt pretty good"" and he will respond with ""does not look like it"". I have not seen him be like this against other employees, even if they make huger mistakes than I do. So it also feels a bit unfair(but thats life I suppose?).   


I think you get my point... I will have to keep up with this till at least July this year(Might move away and study). But every day is just getting much harder to get through.   
How would you approach this problem?",11Apr2019,1

I’m helpless after finding nothing despite my endless searching,
A little over a month ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumor and not even 2 days after finding out I was checked into the hospital and underwent a 7 hour open brain surgery (craniotomy) and had no time to really process any of this or what was about to happen.
Turns out the tumor was in my brain stem. This is apparently rare and when I woke up I couldn’t walk, talk, write, hardly see, and half my face was paralyzed.
Now over a month later I can HARDLY walk (with a walker) I have poor coordination and balance. I TALK like A ROBOT/machine, still can’t write, see better but developed a CROSS EYE, and my face is STILL PARALYZED.
I know the brain stem is a sensitive spot -

707,"On Sunday me and this girl (both 19) went to go see a movie. We picked a late showtime at 8. I got to her dorm around 4 as she wanted me to. Now we aren't in a relationship, we're friends. We went to middle school together and this was us catching up. I like this girl I actually want to be her boyfriend. I get to her dorm and we get to talking and telling stories of stupid stuff we did in our past and most of the time when I spoke, I would stammer or stutter and trip over my words it was embarrassing as hell as you can imagine. We get to the movies and we're not being fully decisive on what we were going to eat (it was a dine-theater), and that was kinda agitating her.

Ive started accepting that it's normal to have it, but my stepdad says otherwise. He has ridiculed me in the past for having acne. But recently it has gotten worse. 

He has decided to try to give me some sort of life advice. He claims that acne is not natural and infact a symptom of some kind of oegan in your body not working properly. 

He said that I would have beautiful skin if I just changed my diet and that apparently the cause for my acne is milk. He told me that the acne on my face, back, shoulders will completely go away if I change my diet. The thing is, I dnt have a different diet than my parents. I eat whatever they make. 

He went on this long tangent about how milk is horrible for you and causes horrible sicknesses. I have tried to tell him that most teenagers have acne. He told me that his kids did not have acne and had a really good diet and said that most teenagers actually don't have acne. I feel like I'm going crazy.

712,"TLDR at the bottom. 

Note that I’m not sure where to post this. This seems to be the only sub I can find that may fit my issue that’s active. 

I’m a teenage girl (that’s all the personal info I feel like disclosing on reddit) and I’m using an alt account because I really don’t want my friends seeing this, specifically the one I’m gonna talk about in this post. 

Basically, here’s my situation. I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible. 
So, I’ve had this group of friends for several years now. None of them have really been a problem for me, except for one, the sort of unspoken “leader” of the group. We have a small lunch table that fits maybe about a quarter of our group. This “leader” thinks that he rules us all, possibly the whole school. He insists on everyone following his rules. If they don’t, they get “kicked out.” This means that when they try to sit at the table, he will yell at them and insult in front of the entire cafeteria, or possibly beat them pretty brutally, again, in front of everyone. People can get kicked out for minor offenses, such as sitting at another table for the day, or for “disrespecting” the leader. This leader often insults and badly treats the people that sit with them. If you have an ethnicity other than Caucasian, any religion whatsoever, or something similar, you are sure to be insulted and threatened at least daily by the entire group, egged on by the leader. The leader is often demanding other people’s food, belongings, time, or money. He forces some (specific) people to wait on him, using degrading insults on them even though he is being treated like a king. He demands that people spend time with him outside of school, continuing to torment them even in their own homes by yelling through their windows and threatening them through text. This leader is constantly getting in trouble at school, but lots of what he does goes unnoticed by teachers. When he does get in trouble, it’s rarely successful in changing his behavior. It’s nearly impossible to leave the group without ending up lonely and with no friends, due to the amount of power this leader has over the social hierarchy at school. 
I could go on, I just need help to try and be friends with this kid without living like this. 


TLDR; I have this friend who leads an entire group of people. He mistreats us and I’m not sure how to deal with him. I want to be his friend, but he treats people like his servants. I really need help.

713,"Calling it a job seems generous, it’s €6 an hour (only legal because it’s an apprenticeship), minimum wage is €9.80.

I work 45 hours a week.

Today I got into an argument with a qualified guy, he’s always putting in little remarks “give me that knife I can’t trust ya with it” “give me that you’re just a waste of space”.
“Don’t touch that, it’ll kill ya, some mightn’t mind but I’d hate to have to go tell management.”

He asked me to get a wheel barrow, I went and looked around, then I asked a couple of guys (ground workers etc) they said check their stores, still nothing.
Went back saying I couldn’t find any and he said ‘fuck me your useless, I asked you to do a simple task, come on I’ll find one’ 
We looked for 10 minutes and he found the ground workers foreman he knew where the only one on site was, but it was being used in the back of the building.. he got it sorted anyway and I went and brought it outside to empty all the cement in it.

I brought it around the site, in through the welders area and up a flight of stairs.
As I let it down he shouted at me ‘don’t just fucking look at it fill the fucking thing’ I walked over to grab the shovel and said “I’ve literally just let down the fucking thing you can’t expect me to do 2 jobs at once” and I started throwing bricks into it.

He went off “you can fuck off you cheeky cunt, I’m not dealing with your shite, fuck off to (the foreman), I’ll let him know who’s sent ya, fuck off”.

Foreman just said go give (other guy) a hand.
A while later I was in his office helping with plant and equipment checks/health and safety certs.

I’m still on a trial period, I’m 2 months into 4.

I’m going to apply for the police and look into going back to college.

I want to give in my notice next Monday.

My parents want me to have a job lined up (I’m 21), they know I’m looking into going back to college and applying for the police force but they still want me to start into a job regardless.

I’m just tired of it, I was told (by the guy who heard it) that the foreman said “if we had more (mes) we might get more work done.
Other lads joke that when I’m there work might actually get done.

I don’t think highly of myself but I’m still not putting up with that shit from him.

714,"\[Male, High School student writing this\]

&amp;#x200B;

I have another male in my neighborhood that's about 7 months younger than me. So we're the same age. Our mom's are close friends, and text and go out to lunch/shopping/mom stuff every week or so. Now, I moved into this neighborhood about 6 years ago, and they had been there for about 8 years. Our moms immediately became friends. We didn't exactly hit it off, mainly because he was in 6th Grade, and I in 7th. Now I'm in 10th Grade, in the local high school, and he's in 9th grade, which is the Middle School in my state. We attend the same church, but are in different youth classes because of age. 

Just last year, our mom's want us to become friends, because it'd make our two family-friend get together 'less awkward'. My mom really started insisting I invite him to stuff. For about a year now, I've been making an effort to talk to him, and invite him to movies, lunch, to hangout with me and a few mutual friends from our church. He'll say OK probably 1/4 of the time. I do understand he is busy, as his parents push him to maintain a 4.0, be on the soccer team, and hold down a job. However, when we do hangout, he usually doesn't talk a lot. He's sort of socially awkward around new people, and my mom has told me in private that that's part of the reason his mom wants us to become friends, so he can branch out. Apparently he keeps a very small, tight group of friends. 

However, over the past three months, he's become more open, and our conversations more in-depth. Our families took a vacation together and we really enjoyed it. But he still never really reaches out to me to hang out. It's always me to him. \[Not trying to throw a martyr/pity party, but just giving context.\] I'm getting sort of tired putting the majority of the work, especially when it seems his mom is the one pushing for it, rather than my mom. Do I keep trying at it, or should I just pick up on the hints that maybe he'd rather just have a nice conversation once and awhile in church or when we see each other, and stop inviting him?",11Apr2019,1

My blood pressure goes up. My entire body violently shakes from head to toe. I can feel my heart racing in my ears. If it continues I begin to cry hysterically. And afterwards my body and mind is so drained. 

I've always been a very passive person. The voice of reason some might say. People come to me for honest, blunt, and to the point type of advice. I'm normally a very quiet, soft spoken, and level headed person. 

I've never been in a physical fight, although I learned pressure points and simple defense moves.

Okay, Here is everything. I'm a 21 male college student. I drive from home to school and from school to home everyday for 2 years, and everything is okay until that day. When I drive, I saw the car suddenly before me. I tried to slam the brake as hard as possible, but it's too late. I hit that car. I still remembered that at that time, I didn't saw the red lights of the car before me turned on.  I looked at the car before me, the back bumper of it was still the same, although the head of my car is seriously broke. I prepared my mental.

However, that car went to a small road next to that and then stop. I followed them. I saw one young boy jumped down and checked that car. After that, he went up to the car. I jumped down, went to driver seat, and asked the lady who drove that car. I asked, ""Are you okay?"". She said, ""Everything is okay. It just shook a little bit"". Then I asked again, ""Are you sure?"". She said, ""Yeah, okay"". After that, I went back to my car, and drive back to the garage to think whether I should fix or sell the car.

I'm a junior in High School. I need advice as to what I should do this summer between two options: get a job tutoring math (I have been doing voluntary tutoring at the science museum for 2 years already, this one is a real paid job. Will still continue volunteering). 

&amp;#x200B;

The second one is to go to India with my family and volunteer in the Himalayas. I have been trekking in the Himalayas 4 times already, so it isn't random to volunteer there. But it is like a paid thing that is just there to make your resume better, and I think the colleges know that.

This is obviously directed in making my college app better. Should I do the first one, that shows my consistency over the last 3 years in tutoring math, or should I do the second which just sounds cool? I come from a upper middle class family so it's not like I can't afford the Himalaya thing. I also want to have some more freedom and money to use to build a PC (my parent don't like video games, cultural stigma so they won't give me money for it).

For all I know, she tells him stuff like that all the time.
He brushed it off, but I thought it was weird and tried to tell him that it’s not something you say to someone that is in a relationship. He defended it, saying she was being respectful of the relationship by not sending her nudes. 

More backstory: There was also a party of hers, I said I was uncomfortable so wasn’t sure I should go. He said I would be more uncomfortable knowing they were together without me there. He also said it could plague our relationship forever if I cancel plans just because someone he’s had sex with is there. I found out though that he purposefully didn’t tell me they were fwb until after the plans were made, and even then I only found out because I directly asked him. 

Also, he always tells me about previous sex stories of his, some stories I’ve heard countless times (with multiple people). Even laying in bed last night he randomly told me one, out of the blue. I’ve told him In the past That I don’t know why he would want to tell me these things, I don’t really want to hear them (especially multiple times). Last night I asked him how he would feel if I started talking about my ex and sex life. He kindve mocked it, implying I had no interesting stories to share about it- I haven’t shared anything like that with him, I wouldn’t think it’s appropriate. Then he told me I overreact to everything, he was just trying to tell a story. 

These are the only things that I’ve really found issues with. When I try to talk it out instead of bottle it up, I feel like he just pushes it aside, and even if he knows I’m still upset he ignores it. But saying that I’m overreacting, when I try to discuss it as rational as possible, it’s made me feel like I don’t know how to communicate with him. Even with his ex-fwb, it seems like he’s more concerned with backing her rather than just trying to look at it from my perspective, even if he doesn’t agree. 

He’s a great guy, I don’t think he would cheat. I don’t even know if he realises my perspective on this at all. Now I’m concerned if I try to ever resolve anything, he will just think I’m overreacting and not care what I say.

They hung out every day for three years straight. He said he will probably never experience a love like that again. He told her that I am the only source of angst in his life and that he and I will have a serious talk soon?

He said that he doesn’t wanna date her right now and wants them to mature but in the meantime he’s giving me a shot. 

Unfortunately I snooped because I had previously told him I am not comfortable with him talking to his ex as she used to stalk me and harass me. Well I kept seeing missed calls from her recently after a year of being free of her and literally I saw so many messages between them. Apparently they met up a few months ago in the middle of the night and talked for like five hours in her car. Then he called her and they talked for a long time again. And then he said maybe we can talk In May whenever work starts to wrap up (he’s a teacher). I’m shocked as I knew nothing of this really. I had a feeling a while ago about it and just asked him to not talk to her because she is crazy and ruined our lives but he still does. Apparently in February they met up and talked till like five am in her car. He told her he wants to be friends and always has. That she will always be the closest person in his life no matter what and that he’ll never find a love like they had. She just has to mature for them to truly have a special love. 

He told her he blocked her so she couldn’t randomly call him and cause a fight between us but that he’d reach out when he’s ready.... and talk her he’d wanna talk in May. 

Is he just appeasing her now cause she is crazy? He’s never said a mean thing to me ever and is so sweet and supportive. He tells me to stop being controlling and crazy when I confront him with this issue 

I mean he got all defensive when she texted him asking if I knew they were talking again and he said that’s none of your business. We’re done talking for today.
I mean someone here said people still frequently talks to their exes and maybe he just wanted to be friends with her. She seems nice. She asks him if he’s having any issues in his life as he has been more receptive to talking to her and maybe it’s because he feels he can’t talk to people about his issues. He’s a super private person and she apparently was one of the people he could open up to. She asked him if he felt comfortable talking to me about his issues and he said no he’s still thinking about the issues he’s concerned about in his life. She said she felt bad. She wanted to help but didn’t know her place but she was an open book for him.

She said she knows that toxic masculinity is real and if he had trouble processing stuff to reach out but no pressure

Why wouldn’t he just date her cause she’s so willing instead of risk our relationship and my sanity to chat with her?

DOES IT MAKE THINGS BETTER KNOWING HE NEVER REACHES OUT TO HER?! Also, she would love to date him and he knows it and says no. He doesn’t think it’s a good idea right now

723,"Writing isn't something I do *really* often, but sometimes I'll have a great idea and let an idea out, then expand on it when I feel like it. I don't think I want to be an author when I'm older, but I keep a journal around just in case I ever decide to publish something.

 I was working on a story that was about one-hundred pages over the course of a few months. My mom knew how long I'd been working on it. It was a book with fantasy elements in it and my mom doesn't agree with content like that. (She's very religious.) It was especially bad because I based it on Greek mythology with gods and creatures like that.

She read a few pages, deemed it ""demonic crap"", and threw it in the trash. I come home from school one day and find my belongings have been rummaged through, my whole room seems off, and my journal has half its pages ripped out.

Guess where I find the journal? Crumpled up, in the trash, food smeared all over with dark coffee stains bleeding through the words. The papers were all soggy and the words smeared. It was completely unreadable and disgusting.

I cried after finding that. My mom told me to shut up and get over it, and stop throwing a tantrum. She's yelling at me and trying to make it seem like I did something wrong. I try explaining how much work I put into it, but she doesn't listen and she insists that something so ""trivial"" as a childhood journal won't matter in a few years, and if by then I still care I can leave and ""get the hell out her house"".

Luckily I typed a few pages and saved them on a google drive, and I also remember the central plot points, so not *all* hope is lost for the story. My mom tries to convince me I'm overreacting but it's the *principal* of the matter. Why do I have to deal with this? Why does she get to get away with treating me like this? It's not technically abuse so I can't do a damn thing about it. I'm mad and sad all at the same time and all I want to do is cry and yell at her, let her know how much I hate her.

728,"I'm currently in high school in a theater class. I believe my theater teacher dislikes me and my friends for no reason at all, and giving us bad grades out of nowhere. Since after winter break of last school year the teacher has been odd toward the other students and definitely less forgiving than before said break. She's got me on her attendance as an advanced drama student, which means if you've had thay class for more than one semester you're in advanced (this is my 3rd semester with that class,  one last year and both semesters this year.)  Some of the students that are in their first semester of theater class, or other advanced members ask me for advice on stage placement or blocking, or just what some words mean or what a metaphor in their lines mean. My close friend is in advanced as well so we both help. However when we do help, the teacher calls us out in the middle of our explainations and tells us to get back on task or whatever we were doing. We explain that we were helping another student and the teacher gets defensive and snappy with us, which seems very different from what a normal teacher would do. This happens often and it puts just about anyone off to whoever the teacher snaps at. 

The teacher also is very sensitive to odd things, for example I had to write a monologue from the perspective of a child anticipating their christmas present. I decided to have my character be a nerdy 9 year old boy and to use my retainer to my advantage as it gives me a lisp when I talk with it. I finished writing and brought up a printed copy of the monologue to my teacher, and when presented with it told me that the monologue was great, but somehow the use of my retainer would be insensitive to people with speech impediments and I should edit out the lines that involved the retainer (which would make the monologue under the given word limit.) Now with my retainer I myself have a lisp and I thought it was dumb that I couldn't use it. I don't see it as insensitive as I was going for stereotypical nerdy kid traits (glasses, lisp, etc.) I talked to other friends who have lisps or a retainer and they said it was a good idea and agreed with it, one saying, ""That would be hilarious, just go for it regardless."" At that point I was pretty ticked so I went to the counselor for my grade and asked about what I should do. The counselor agreed that it seemed weird that I couldn't use it and left it at that. I didn't end up doing my monologue despite having it fully memorized at the time. 

So I bring you to today's event, my choir is going on a tour to a different part of the state. We would be going to different colleges and high schools to perform our songs which I'm very proud of. I went around to my teachers today to get my permission slip signed. We have to confirm our grades and get teacher approval. My other classes are fine when it comes to grades, and a new semester just started so there are no grades in our gradebook. The day before today I checked and there wasn't a grade for the class. Now today when I checked there was an F waiting for me. Disgusted I looked down at my permission slip with the grade and the teacher didn't approve of me going. So, now I can't go on tour and I've seemingly let my choir down as they need me. There's nothing I can do at this point to salvage my grade to a D, as that's considered passing. Apparently the F was added up to one assignment and participation points. My explaination is thus: 

The first grade put in was for a monologue of 24 lines. I had the monologue fully memorized, but the day we performed all the pollen in the air decided to start going around and of course my allergies hit hard. Before class started my eyes began burning and getting watery and swollen and it got progressively worse. When it was my turn I stood up and asked to go to the nurse after I performed. The theater teacher agreed and I got up on stage. At that point it felt like I'd put out matches in my eyes and it was pretty unbearable. I got through two stanzas of my monologue before I flat out couldn't take it. I had to stop. I did that and waited for the applause to cease. I promptly wiped all the water from my eyes and ran to the nurse. I managed to get some relief from flushing them and I returned to class. I got my grade slip the next day with a disgusting 6 out of 15. 

Secondly is the participation points, which didn't make any sense to me. A typical school week is five days, thus five points for that week's participation. I do as I'm supposed to in class, such as group work or script writing, arranging props, etc. I have no idea why that had a low mark either, nor do I no what the grade for that was either. I was told it was likely low. 

There's no point in reasoning with this teacher because the teacher will find ways to belittle me and other students. I'm definitely not the only one  the teacher does this to as generally all the past students I know of that aren't the typical goody-two shoes favored theater kids, have a general disliking for this teacher as well. Myself, my best friend and others have been targeted by the teacher for minute things and its gone on for far too long. Since I first started getting targeted I've been told to suck it up, but I'm sick and tired of being told to. Everyone that says it isn't in that class and never has been, so they don't understand my situation from my view. As of now I'm desperately wanting out of the class and so do others. Many, many students fought to get out of the class last semester and they succeeded. I tried to as well but there were no classes available I could switch into that I knew I would succeed in. There's no winning at this point and I'm stuck in a rut.",11Apr2019,1

730,"Okay, so I'm going to try to keep this as short and to the point as possible, while still providing all the details. So, I'm an 18 year old male, and I'm in my senior year of high school, and I have a close female friend that is the same age as me and in the same grade as well. I've known her since freshman year, but only kinda started to get to know her last year. This year is when I got closer with her and really started to get to know her though since we had a class together the entire first semester. We would talk and joke around and I went to her birthday party and a couple of other parties that she asked me to come to. Now, I have to state before I continue, I care deeply about this girl and I truly love her with all of my heart. Now continuing, nearing the end of the semester in January, the same girl asked me to go to a basketball game with her and I obviously said ""YES! Of course."". Well, after that we began to go to all of the games together and we hung out almost every day and even on the weekends, and she always said that she had a great time and loved hanging out with me, and I told her the same thing as well. Well then on exam week, after we finished exams and left school, she asked me to hangout with her and I was more than happy to. We went and did a lot of things together the first day and then separated at the end of that day. The next day is when things happened though. We hung out all day that and then we were sitting in my car later at night and we made out and did the ""deed"". This happened two more nights in a row and she told me that she really cared about me and that she loved me. It's important for me to note that I'm not actually dating this girl at this time, we are just hanging out all the time and we both agree that we are really good friends. Anyway, on Friday of that week, we hang out again and she tells me before anything happens that she has a boyfriend, which I knew literally NOTHING about, especially consider the fact that she had told me a month prior that she had broken up with her boyfriend. However, she proceeds to tell me that she doesn't feel right continuing to do this and that she is incredibly sorry for leading me on and even having sex with me, which she ""felt greatly teased"" me since she wouldn't be able to be in a relationship with me now since she is taken. She even told me that if she ever broke up with her boyfriend that I'd be the quickest next person that she'd want to be with. I told her that it was alright and I remained cool and calm about it and she asked if we could still be good friends and hangout, and I told her yes that it was fine and I'd be more than happy to do it. Keep in mind still that I understand most people would have just completely dropped her off right there and moved on, but like I said, I truly care more about this girl than anyone or anything else in the world. I've been in relationships before and honestly never felt this attracted and loving towards a girl. But anyways, back to it, so we continued all the way up until early March hanging out and messaging all the time and still being great friends with one another. I felt upset about the situation still but I was letting it go and being satisfied that I could still spend time with her and be with her. But, towards mid March, she started to become distant and drift away. What I mean by that is she stopped instigating conversations, when I would start conversations and try to talk to her she would reply with simple one word answers that seemed like she just wanted to end the conversation,  she never wanted to hangout anymore, and she just overall acted like she didn't want to be friends anymore. When I asked her about it she just said ""Oh, I haven't meant to be mean, but I guess I have just been in a mood"". Fast-forward just a little bit more and I began to stop starting conversations and talking to her all that much. I've just felt that it isn't really worth me trying if she doesn't want to try back. We haven't hung out in over a month and she only occasionally messages me a couple times a week. Again, I truly care about her and love her more than anything and I still just find it extremely hard to just let go and move on from it. But, at the same time, I feel like it is holding me back and I'm just hurting myself even more by trying.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to where I am now and my final question to all of you:

Is it worth continuing to try to be friends with her and hoping that I may some day have something more with her or would you suggest that I just forget her and try my best to move on?

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is an incredibly long post, but I really hope you guys would read it to get the whole story and understand. I really hope you provide some sort or advice that would help, because at this point I'm just super bummed about it all the time and I think that just some simple bit of advice would really help. Thank you!",11Apr2019,1
731,"This is probably going to be long, but there is a lot of context and I have no idea what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to grad school this past December, for a TA program that would provide a stipend and halve my tuition. After applying, I decided I probably was not going to get in and I would be better off doing something more practical. My original plan was to teach on a postsecondary level... but academia is very difficult to get in to (especially for my chosen discipline: literature), among other downsides. I instead decided to teach myself web development, which I have been doing fairly well with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well... I was accepted, including the TA program. I was honestly stunned. I decided I would likely regret not taking the opportunity, and so I emailed them back accepting the offer. Here's where shit starts getting messy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago. I have started treatment (meds + therapy), but have not found something that quite works for me yet and therapy is not a quick fix. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot afford grad school on my own, and cannot work because of committing my time to being a TA and because I do not do well with splitting my time/attention between work and school. The only way I got through my BA was by only working like 10 hours a week. Thus, I asked my grandfather for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandfather basically thinks I am a degenerate because I dropped out of college when I was 18 (which he was paying for). The whys aren't really important, but that was a betrayal to him and he has not forgiven me for it since. In asking for his help, I had to listen to a monologue about my terrible deception and otherwise shitty choices before reminding him that all of that happened almost 20 years ago. I am not the same person, and I made a mistake. He agreed that we could let bygones be bygones, move on from here. He told me he was proud of me for continuing my education, and agreed to help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well... that was Tuesday. Yesterday, I suddenly had this ""OH FUCK WHAT HAVE I DONE"" feeling... this isn't practical. I will likely not end up with a career in academia, and the only other jobs around here for English majors are marketing. I would honestly rather swallow molten lead than work in marketing. So, in effect, I will probably finish my MA, then go back to learning code anyway so I can get a job in web development. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to move to a new city to go to this school, leaving my girlfriend behind. I have no money in savings. I would be entirely dependent upon my grandfather's generosity. I would have to upend my life in every other way besides. I feel like I have made a terrible mistake. I feel like I can't back out now, because I already told the school I accepted and I';ll look like a fucking flake if I back out now. And if I do decide I want to go to this school at a later date when things are more settled, they will tell me to go f myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I back out now, the fence mending with my grandfather will be ruined. This is slightly less of a concern, because I could ask him to pay for a code bootcamp instead and explain that this is a more practical, career-oriented decision,and he would ....*probably*... understand/agree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also afraid I really will regret it if I don't go. What if I end up with some awesome career opportunity thrown my way, or meet someone who changes my life, or ...???? Maybe I just have cold feet and that is why I feel like I am making a mistake?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been crying for nearly two days. Pls help.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I unexpectedly got into grad school, accepted, but now am doubting my decision. It is honestly not very practical from a career perspective, but it is a subject I love. IDK what to do.",11Apr2019,3
732,"I just moved to a new high school this past summer and immediately joined their marching band. I had a blast and met so many people during the band camp. I thought it was a wonderful experience, I love to work hard and benefit from that.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, way after marching season, I had one of my friends tell me that during band camp she hated me. She went on to tell me that she hated my voice and rolled her eyes whenever I went to talk or anything of the sort. I guess that means when I was being enthusiastic and trying to be optimistic (calling good job b/t resets ig?). I didn't really know how to feel. She told me she loves me now, but she just didn't like me back then. I'm kind of hurt, I had always thought we were friends. Right after she said that, I asked one of my friends what he thought and he said I was just... very passionate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I take marching band seriously because I want us to do the best we can. I don't take it too seriously though (to my knowledge? I'm not that crazy about my instrument itself), I'm always running around and laughing. I've still had to do my fair share of push-ups from not doing things correctly. However, my patience does run low if no one's focused, of course. I also love being encouraging and am always working quickly during resets and stuff on the field. Am I being too bossy to other people? I had to lead the trumpet sectional a few times because there wasn't a specific trumpet leader (which the friend was in) and I had previous marching experience from other schools. I think that's why she had a bad impression. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, overall, my question is this: how can I evaluate myself so that I'm not too controlling? I know fair well I can be a little bossy, but I think I've done better over the years. I want to be friends with everyone (which I know can never truly be the case) and I wish that I could have been a nicer person during band camp. Also, how do I cope with not being in a good light in everyone's eyes? I want everyone to get along, yet I know fair well I have faults too.

733,"It is almost 4pm as I am posting this and although I ate a little while ago, didn’t do any physical activity today, and woke up past 8am, I am a little cranky from my day. Need some rest (not nap) time. I am usually tired, and have been lethargic these last couple of weeks because probably the almost 6 months of not having an actual job is starting to get to my brain of not using it to process a lot of information... I’ve tried getting into things before for the sake of having a learning hobby, however, I’ve come to learn that I actually do not really enjoy learning :( 
I am the kind who picks up something and it is hard for me to follow through or set aside committed time for a discipline (ie meditation, journaling, etc). I usually give up easily once something becomes “difficult” or lose interest perhaps for that last reason (ie piano, origami).
I am starting a full-time office job in a few days in which I will be trained to learn some specific web skills. I am so grateful for this opportunity because skills and working for a company (marketing) like this is something that will help me advance in life and will look great in my resume.
However, as I mentioned previously, I’m starting to get worried. You might have guessed already that I do suffer from some depression and anxiety issues at times (I’ve been in fact in therapy before), and it is hard for me to sometimes find motivation...
I do have goals, but simple ones which at the same time are difficult: becoming a home owner one day and retire early (needless to say, I am not too fond of working)
I need help with tips etc from fellow Redditors who are or who have been procrastinators or lethargic... This can be foods, mind exercises, etc. I really do need this because I lost my previous job due to, in a few words, poor performance. 
I drink coffee sometimes every day, and sometimes it triggers my nerves/anxiety... Matcha gives me this over-elation that makes it hard for me to concentrate...

tl;dr: I am a woman in her late 20’s who needs some tips/advice/etc to absorb and retain information better and to stay awake and motivated. I’ve tried meditation but it’s seriously hard for me to commit to any form of discipline and learning.",11Apr2019,1

There was no cheating, no hate, not a bad reason to finish our relationship,  she just did feel depressed and wanted time for herself meaning she needed to break up.

Apart from this, a few unhappy events happenned that made the situation even worse and my life passed to a phase of ""just living"". I've got a nice job, nice friends, nice family, but since she disappeared I feel like I don't mind to die. I want to repeat this sentence because that's my problem.

738,"So a little bit of back story. I went to community college for 3 years and received 3 certs in AutoCAD and Revit along with my A.S. In my 3rd year I was fortunate enough to begin working as a electrical drafter for a maturing MEP(mechanical, electrical, plumbing for those who don't know) firm. Fast forward 4 years and I'm now a electrical designer and on track to become a electrical project designer, just a step below a project manager. 

I started going back to college last fall for computer engineering since I couldn't see myself staying in the EE field for my life but now I've realized that I'm having to pay for my tuition since I make decent money. Its costing me roughly 1,700 a quarter to take 2 classes (working full-time and doing school part time). I'm trying to take 2 classes each quarter for fall, winter, spring, and summer to graduate by spring 2021. 

Now my question is do I continue going to school and pay about 15k over the next 2 years to finish getting my Bachelor's in computer engineering or do I just stay at my job and finally start the FE (fundamentals of engineering) course to get my EIT(engineer in training). In my area it's estimated that computer engineers are making 60k to 70k annually. At my current spot I'm make 48k but once I get my FE and EIT done I should be making 60k or 65k. I'd basically be trading jobs for the same income, but does a computer engineering have more potential that an EE? 

And just a little extra info, I plan on buying a house this year and also starting my own 3d printing shop on Etsy or eBay so I don't have to work 40 hours a week (I hope to bring in about 500 bucks a month from 3d printing items).

Backstory: 19M, only recently found out I'm ""attractive"" I'd probably rate myself a 6-7. Before it was probably a 4-5. Because of this I'm not really the best at women because I haven't had much experience because I had confidence issues. Ya get it? 

So I'm at a community college. There's a hot chick in one of my classes. I swear she could be a model. I got her snapchat a while back and she really was into me for a while but I think I fucked up somewhere along the line. I wont go into detail unless questioned cause I wanna make this short. 

To be clear the reason i knew she was into me was because she would text first, never broke eye contact and was always super interested in everything I said. I also caught her staring at me all the time, so yknow. 

So.. I asked her out a few weeks back and she claimed she worked doubles all weekend. I kinda took that as a sign to up and fuck off so thats what I did.

Here's what I'm confused on: We're really not that close. We've never hung out before, we have no mutual friends. I'm an awful texter so most conversations outside of real life are short-lived. Regardless, we were talking and out of nowhere she brought up how she just got Tinder and she's been talking to this guy but he hasn't been responding. Asks me what his deal is since I'm a guy.

I cant be the only dude she knows right? So why'd she pick me to ask? Lmao. I asked to show me a pic and I'm gonna be honest the dude looks like a fuckboy so thats what I said. Told her that she could at least do better than THAT guy, which isnt entirely false.
